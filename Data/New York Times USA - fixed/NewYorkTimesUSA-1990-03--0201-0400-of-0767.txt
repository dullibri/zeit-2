HEADLINE: Basic Shift In Japan Over Rates

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 7

 BODY:
While the Government has intervened heavily in the last two weeks to stabilize the tumbling stock market and bolster the yen, economists and business leaders here say these short-term tactics cannot alter the fundamental economic shift behind the turmoil: the era of extraordinarily low Japanese interest rates is ending.
After an economic boom fueled by low rates, most countries would find the long-term adjustment to higher rates to be difficult, bringing such repercussions as a rise in corporate bankruptcies, a drop in consumer spending and a general economic slowdown.
But as economists, bankers and other experts here see it, the sharp rise in interest rates will merely give the Japanese economy another chance to demonstrate its resilience. Assuming that rates do not go much higher, the effect is expected to be modest, providing an instructive study in what makes the Japanese economy so strong.
 
Huge Cash Reserves
Many potentially negative consequences will be mitigated by the remarkable health and huge cash reserves of corporate Japan, these experts said. In effect, Japanese companies used the period when interest rates held below 5 percent, along with a powerful stock market, to protect themselves against the day when those favorable conditions would end. 
There will be some jolts from the higher interest rates, these experts said, including an increase in inflation and a rise in the cost of imported goods. The worst potential consequence could be an added strain on the already tense relationship between Japan and the United States. Continued weakness of the yen and any reduction of demand in Japan could result in a push for more exports to the United States to make up for slower sales at home.
 
Worries About Trade Imbalances
That is something that both countries have tried to avoid, in the face of concerns about the United States' trade deficit with Japan, which amounted to $49 billion last year.
There are many reasons for the shift in Japanese interest rates: concerns that inflation might rise in Japan because of a severe labor shortage and rapid growth in the supply of money; even higher interest rates in West Germany and the United States, which tend to pull Japanese money to those countries, and a yen that continues to tumble in value against other currencies.
One important Japanese rate, the long-term prime rate charged by banks to leading corporations, has jumped to 7.5 percent, from 6 percent last year. The prime had stayed below 5 percent for about two and a half years.
Certain short-term rates have moved to 7 percent from 4 percent in mid-1989. Those levels are particularly high relative to Japan's annual inflation rate, which remains slightly more than 2 percent.
''We have entered a period where there will be a new interest rate regime,'' said Keikichi Honda, general manager of economic research at the Bank of Tokyo. ''It's a fundamental change that will not just go away.''
And Susumu Kato, chief economist for Goldman, Sachs & Company in Tokyo, commented: ''After almost a decade of lower interest rates, we're adjusting to a new period. It's not a temporary move.''
In sharp contrast to the United States, where many corporations borrowed heavily against assets to pay for mergers and takeovers, most of Japan's big corporations are swimming in money.
The Toyota Motor Corporation is often referred to as Toyota Bank, because it has amassed more than $20 billion in cash, a result of record profits and a huge program of raising capital in the markets during the era of low interest rates. That mountain of money means that higher rates and lower stock prices will not hamper the ability of Toyota to invest in research and new plants, or to improve its old factories.
Toyota is an extreme example, but other companies tend to be similarly rich in capital.
This is largely because Japanese companies used low interest rates to pay for improvements that have raised their productivity. They also sought markets and products that would increase profits - investments that are just starting to produce returns. They are thus much better able to pay for further improvements without having to borrow.
Still, the end of the era of low rates could produce some harmful fallout. If the uncertainty in the markets persists, some Japanese executives say, they will trim their investment plans.
The tumble in stock prices has also forced several major corporations to cancel efforts to raise capital from the market. The Yasuda Trust and Banking Company said today that it was canceling a proposed bond and stock offering that would have raised slightly more than $900 million. On Tuesday, Mitsukoshi Ltd., the large department store company, abruptly withdrew a $278 million offering. Earlier, the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company pulled out of a $1 billion deal.
The cancellations provide a clear sign that the shaken markets will not provide as rich a source of cheap capital as they had for the last several years. Over time, this will take a toll on companies' profitability.
The stock market seems to have awakened to the permanent nature of the changes in interest rates about two weeks ago, when prices started to slide. The Nikkei index of 225 stocks closed today at 33,362.34, compared with 38,712 at the beginning of the year.
''The stock market was just adjusting to this reality,'' said Yoshihisa Kitai, manager of the economics division at the Long Term Credit Bank. ''It is a hard reality that collided with the euphoria in the markets before.''
 
Shift Has Come Quickly
The change in interest rates and the shift in Government monetary policy that it signals have been amazingly steep. Japan's long-term interest rates peaked in April 1980, when the yield hit 10.3 percent on the Government's 10-year bond, a benchmark figure determined by the market and the basis for many other lending rates. After that, the rate fell and did not stop until May 1987, when it bottomed out at 3.4 percent.
Although rates edged higher afterward, the yield on the 10-year bond still hovered below 5 percent until last fall. That was less than two-thirds the level of long-term rates in the United States. But since December the 10-year bond rate has soared and is now at 7.2 percent, its highest since 1984. The yield on 10-year bonds in the United States is now about 8.6 percent.
In the United States, interest rates edged higher earlier this year, reflecting the moves toward the reunification of the Germanys, which is expected to have an inflationary effect, as well as the Federal Reserve Board's concerns about inflation. American rates have since appeared to stabilize.
As the yen grew weaker, it forced the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates to try to give investors a better return and to encourage currency traders to buy the yen. The Bank of Japan announced a rise in its official discount rate, its third in six months, on Dec. 25.
But it now seems that the central bank responded too gingerly. The yen continued to weaken and market-level interest rates continued to rise, in part on anticipation that the central bank would move again.
The prospects are for a further decline in the yen and an increase in the dollar's value. The Bank of Japan is estimated to have spent $5 billion to $8 billion last week alone, and several hundred million dollars more this week in a futile effort to strengthen the yen. The exchange rate has risen to more than 150 yen to the dollar, the highest in more than a year.
''The Bank of Japan has been in the market every day,'' said Yoshi Hashimoto, head of foreign exchange here for the Chase Manhattan Bank. ''They have smothered the market a little bit, but demand for the dollar is still strong.''
A further drop in the yen could send ripples through the country, and higher rates could impede corporate investment. Such investment now equals nearly 25 percent of the gross national product, compared with about 10 percent in the United States, said Mr. Kato of Goldman, Sachs.
But, given the present outlook, all those factors are considered relatively minor. ''There will be some slowdown in growth,'' said Mr. Honda of the Bank of Tokyo. ''It's unfortunate. But corporations are earning record profits. We don't expect that cash flow to really slow soon.''

HEADLINE: Hilton Hotels Rejects Bids; Sale Ended

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 7

 BODY:
Seven months after soliciting bids for all or part of the company, the Hilton Hotels Corporation rejected two acquisition proposals today and said it now intended to remain independent.
Hilton did not provide any details of the offers it rejected, and Hilton executives did not return phone calls requesting comment. But investors apparently expected the news, as Hilton's stock price fell $5.375 a share before the announcement to close at $61 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
A number of potential acquirers are reported to have considered or made offers at various times since the company put itself up for sale last summer, including the JMB Realty Corporation of Chicago, the Miller-Klutznick-Davis-Gray Company, the real estate development company headed by the investor Marvin Davis, a group led by Alfred Checci, who led the buyout of NWA Inc., and a number of Japanese and other foreign concerns.
In a statement, Barron Hilton, the company's chairman, attributed the disappointing bids to the difficulty faced by potential acquirers in raising financing and to the clouded outlook for real estate.
''We have been considering a sale of the company, among other alternatives, since last summer,'' Mr. Hilton said. ''At the time we began the exploration process, the world economy, the market for acquisition financing and the investment climate for real estate and hotels were each far stronger than they are today. The significant adverse developments in each of these areas were reflected in the acquisition proposals we received.''
In a separate statement, the company pointed to a number of ''adverse developments'' affecting potential Japanese acquirers, including increased financing costs in Japan, negative reaction in the United States to Japanese acquisition of highly visible properties and a growing reluctance to pay the premium prices seen in previous hotel deals.
 
Speculative Frenzy
When Hilton put itself on the block, it set off a speculative frenzy in the stock market. Investors, betting that the company would bring a premium price, bid the stock up as high as $115 a share last fall, and some analysts predicted that Hilton could be worth as much as $130 a share.
The stock price, however, declined steadily as it became apparent that there was less interest in Hilton than investors had assumed.
Hilton, which is based in Beverly Hills, Calif., owns and operates hotels and owns casino-hotels in Nevada. The company's earnings last year slumped by 15 percent, to $110.1 million, or $2.27 a share, from $130.9 million, or $2.72 a share.
Mr. Hilton said the company would now focus on expansion plans, including the opening of hotels in London, Hong Kong, Monte Carlo and Cancun, Mexico, and the opening of a new casino-hotel in Laughlin, Nev.

HEADLINE: Fed Currency Activity Low

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The United States sold a modest $750 million for Japanese yen in the foreign currency market and did nothing against the West German mark in the three months ending Jan. 31, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said yesterday.
The period had the least amount of intervention of any period since late 1986. 
The intervention occurred on five days during the period when the Fed acted to resist the dollar's rise against the yen, the bank said in its quarterly report to Congress.
A rising dollar makes imports cheaper and exports more expensive, aggravating the United States trade deficit.
The dollar rose 1 percent against the yen in the period but fell 8.5 percent against the West German mark. The mark's gain was fueled by positive sentiment about the opening of the borders between East and West Germany, the report said.
Against the yen, the dollar benefited early in January because of uncertainties about parliamentary elections in Japan. The dollar rose to its high for the period, 146.80 yen, on Jan. 3, the report said. Since then it has risen 2.4 percent to close in New York yesterday at 150.35 yen, despite Fed intervention.
Intervention in the latest period was much lower than in the previous period, when $5.87 billion was sold against the yen and the mark.
The intervention was the least since the period from November 1986 to January 1987, when the Fed bought $50 million. The central bank buys dollars when the currency is weak and poses a danger of inflation.
The latest period had the lowest dollar sales since the August-to-October period of 1987, when the Fed sold $631 million for marks.

HEADLINE: Consumer Debt Rose 5.9% In January on Auto Sales

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
Americans took out $3.54 billion more in consumer credit than they retired in January as they flocked to auto dealerships to lock in the latest round of sales incentives, the Federal Reserve reported today.
The Fed said overall consumer credit advanced at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.9 percent following a 7.3 percent gain in December, when holiday shopping was at its peak. Consumer credit includes all consumer loans except mortgages. 
Credit card debt slowed to a 1.4 percent gain at an annual rate, after rising 23.7 percent in the December holiday shopping period.
Revolving credit rose just $243 million in January, compared with a $3.94 billion advance in December. The January gain was the lowest since a $904 million advance last September.
 
Buying Sluggish
Except for auto sales, sluggish consumer buying as the new year began was also reflected in last week's Commerce Department report on personal consumption spending. The report showed that spending slowed from a 1 percent gain in December to a rise of six-tenths of 1 percent in January.
Automobile credit, on the other hand, jumped by a seasonally adjusted $1.86 billion, or 7.7 percent at an annual rate, after falling four-tenths of 1 percent in December before rebates and lower interest rates were reintroduced.
Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate were up a sharp $1.45 billion, or 8.6 percent, after a 3 percent gain in December.
But outstanding mobile home debt fell $18 million, or nine-tenths of 1 percent. It was the fourth consecutive monthly decline. Mobile home debt for December was revised from a rise of 1.9 percent to a decline of nine-tenths of 1 percent. Mobile home debt fell in 11 of the last 12 months reported, with September's 2.8 percent gain the exception.
The various changes left total consumer debt at the end of January at $720.1 billion.

HEADLINE: Productivity Gain Stands

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
The Government left unchanged today its earlier estimates of gains in productivity of two-tenths of 1 percent for the fourth quarter of last year and of nine-tenths of 1 percent for the year.
The Labor Department, in its regular recalculation of figures based on additional data, said output in the fourth quarter was unchanged after reporting earlier that it had declined two-tenths of 1 percent. The figure for hours worked in the quarter was also changed, from a decline of four-tenths of 1 percent to a drop of two-tenths of 1 percent.
The 1989 increase in productivity of nine-tenths of 1 percent compared with a climb of 2 percent in 1988.
Economists have said that the relatively poor showing in productivity is a signal that the economy is weak and might face increased inflationary pressures.
But the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, has said the economy has passed its weakest point and sees economic activity increasing at a modest pace this year.
The Labor Department also revised hourly labor costs, a major inflation measure for businesses, to a rise of 5.4 percent in 1989, instead of 5.5 percent. That is up from 4.7 percent in 1988 and represents the biggest rise in such costs since the 1981-82 recession.

HEADLINE: Dow Slides 7.21 Points on Light Volume

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks moved narrowly yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 7.21, to 2,669.59, in light volume, as traders marked time until tomorrow's key employment figures for February. The numbers are expected to show continued weakness in the economy.
Volume rose to 163.6 million shares, up from 143.6 million shares on Tuesday. Advances numbered 740 issues and declines 762. 
''The real key to today was yesterday,'' Laszlo Birinyi, president of the Manhattan research firm Birinyi Associates. ''We just stopped and caught our breath. The market overreacted on Tuesday and today was a digestion of Tuesday's 27.25-point gain.''
He noted that there were six periods of computerized ''sell'' programs - most of them of just two or three minutes' duration - when the market lost 17 points. The most significant selling program, he said, was between 3:13 and 3:24 P.M., when the Dow fell 6.98 points, or almost the same as the drop in the Dow at the close of the day.
The industrials moved ahead about 12 points almost from the start but quickly zigzagged a few points up or down until noon and within half an hour headed down 10 points, to 2,674. The Dow rose 5 points within the next hour, fell 4 and then recovered the lost ground by 3 P.M. From that point on, the market headed as low as 2,665 before recovering a few points at the close.
 
Special Market Situations
Special situations continued to dominate the market, with the New York Stock Exchange briefly delaying the start of trading in MGM/UA, Great Northern Nekoosa, Businessland, AAR Corporation, Xtra and Bandag until news developments crossed the stock ticker.
The Big Board halted trading in Nynex between 11:16 A.M. and 1:53 P.M., initially reporting an imbalance of sell orders but quickly changing the reason to pending news. Nynex, the owner of the New York Telephone Company, fell 1 from the price at the halt when trading resumed and ended the day down 2 3/4, to 80 1/2. The New York Public Service Commission said it had rejected a $445 million rate increase for New York Telephone next year.
MGM/UA, the 10th-most-active issue on the Big Board, jumped 3 3/4, or 20 percent, to 17 3/4. The film company said it had agreed to be acquired by Pathe Communications for $20 a share, or $47.2 million. Nekoosa fell 5/8, to 65. Georgia-Pacific, which completed its $65.75-a-share offer for Nekoosa on Tuesday, said it had accepted about 53.8 million shares from stockholders and now held 97.3 percent of Nekoosa.
Businessland, the computer store chain, rose 2, or 22.9 percent, to 10 3/4 on 1.2 million shares. After breaking with Businessland last April, Compaq Computer said it had authorized the chain to sell and service its products nationwide.
 
Airline Supplier Down
AAR slid 4 1/8, or 15 percent, to 27 1/2, with 909,300 shares traded. The airline supplier said its profits in the third fiscal quarter would be lower than expected because a foreign contract did not develop. Xtra fell 1 5/8, to 30 1/4. The leasing and transportation company said it would not consider bids it had invited for the company before its annual meeting next Thursday, when a proxy fight by dissident stockholders would determine the makeup of the board.
Bandag, the world's biggest producer of rubber and supplies for retreaded tires, rose 3 1/4, to 83 3/4. Scott Merlis, an analyst with Morgan Stanley & Company, said Bandag would benefit from laws in 20 states that encourage retreading instead of creating environmental problems by throwing tires away.
Polaroid, which rose 2 3/8, to 45 1/4, last week and 2 5/8, to 46 1/4, in the first two days of this week, fell 5/8, to 47 1/4. Kodak rose 1 1/2, to 39 7/8, with 1.28 million shares changing hands.
Alex Henderson of Prudential-Bache Securities cut his rating on the stock to a ''hold'' from a ''buy,'' contending that the stock had already risen in response to a big court award it was expected to get from Kodak in a patent-infringement suit. Reuters, the news agency, said Mr. Henderson estimated Polaroid's award at $1.5 billion but that Peter Enderlin of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company reiterated Polaroid as a ''buy,'' forecasting a $2 billion award soon.
USX, the oil and steel producer, fell 1 3/8, to 35 5/8 in heavy trading. Armstrong World fell 1, to 35 3/8. The Wall Street Journal mentioned both yesterday among companies threatened by battles to unseat management. Hilton fell 5 3/8, to 61, in brisk trading amid growing sentiment that the hotel company might not be sold.
Among other market averages, the Dow transportations fell 13.16, to 1,135.31, with USAir off 1 5/8, to 28 3/8; Conrail 1, to 46 1/8, and Union Pacific 1 3/8, to 74 3/8. The S. & P. 500 fell 0.98, to 336.95, and the Big Board composite 0.40, to 185.77. The Amex market value index rose 0.22, to 359.03, and the Nasdaq composite 0.14, to 432.47.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Trading in Dollar Is Mixed Despite Central Banks' Sales

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed in foreign exchange trading yesterday as it struggled against a concerted effort by central banks to lower it.
Gold prices fell, closing below $400 an ounce in London and at $400.20, down $3.40, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. The Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $400.60 an ounce, down $2.85 from late Tuesday. 
Traders said the Federal Reserve and other central banks had entered the currency markets to sell dollars, and a published report in Tokyo said the members of the Group of Seven industrial nations had agreed to intervene to try to stop the dollar's climb.
A Treasury official in Washington, however, said that there was no G-7 meeting and that confusion apparently had arisen because of a quarterly meeting that is taking place in Tokyo of the so-called Working Party 3 of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The Working Party 3 group is made up of officials from the leading industrial nations and they discuss balance of payments outlook of the member countries.
The way was set, however, for closer coordination between the United States and Japan last weekend when President Bush and Prime Minister Kaifu discusssed cooperation in the currency markets at their Palm Springs meeting.
 
Up Against Yen
The intervention in the markets yesterday was only partly successful. The dollar rose sharply in Europe and was mixed in New York, where it still managed to advance against the yen, the currency that the Group of Seven is trying the hardest to bolster.
In New York, the dollar rose to 150.35 yen, from 149.85 late Tuesday. In Tokyo, the dollar climbed to 150.75 yen, from 149.50 yen on Tuesday. It was quoted in London at 151.15 yen.
Richard Levine, the vice president for foreign exchange at Elders Futures Inc., said the dollar appeared to be rising on commercial and investment demand, and not just on speculation.
''We haven't seen this kind of demand for dollars since the end of 1989, and probably going back to the summer of 1989,'' Mr. Levin said.
Overseas traders said the continuing lack of confidence in the yen and the West German mark, as well as a brighter view of the United States economy, was also supporting the dollar.
Against the West German currency, the dollar fell in New York to 1.69815 marks, compared with late Tuesday's 1.7035.
The dollar gained against the pound. In New York, sterling slipped to $1.6465, from 1.6475 late Tuesday. In earlier London trading, the pound fell to $1.6388, from $1.6495.

HEADLINE: William Appleman Williams Dies; Gadfly of Foreign Policy Was 68

BYLINE: By PETER B. FLINT

 BODY:
William Appleman Williams, a historian known for his sharp critiques of American foreign policy, died of cancer Monday at Newport (Ore.) Community Hospital. He was 68 years old and lived on the Oregon coast at Waldport. 
Dr. Williams was a prolific and influential writer of a dozen revisionist books that challenged prevailing views of American history, deploring the United States as an imperialist power pressing its economic and ideological will around the globe. He was a professor at the University of Wisconsin from 1960 to 1968 and at Oregon State University from 1968 to 1986, when he retired with the title emeritus.
The genially combative professor, who termed himself a radical and was often called the founder of the New Left school of American history, was particulary critical of America's role in the cold war and in Vietnam.
With passionate argument and complex analysis, he championed self-determination for all people and argued that a refusal by Americans to acknowledge a national desire for expansion and global hegemony has led to major errors and confusion over the nation's future.
 
Focus on Self-Determination
''The act of imposing one people's morality upon another people is an imperial denial of self-determination,'' he wrote in his 1976 book ''America Confronts a Revolutionary World: 1776-1976.'' ''Once begun, there is no end of empire except war and more war.''
Detractors accused him and other revisionists of employing a double-standard: of justifying or explaining Soviet actions by citing national security while measuring western actions against a utopian ideal. Reviewers termed his works provocative, honestly stated and admirable, but they challenged some arguments as flawed, simplistic and naive in relying on good intentions and communal feeling.
His other books include ''American-Russian Relations, 1781-1947'' (1952), ''The Shaping of American Diplomacy, 1750-1955'' (1956, 1962, 1970), ''The Tragedy of American Diplomacy'' (1959, 1962, 1972), ''The Contours of American History'' (1962, 1966) and ''The Roots of the Modern American Empire'' (1969).
The historian was a native of Atlantic, Iowa, and a graduate of the United States Naval Academy, where he earned a bachelor's degree in engineering. In World War II, he was a Navy line officer in the Pacific and was later treated for battle wounds for more than a year.
He earned master's and doctoral degrees at the University of Wisconsin and taught history at six colleges. He also taught at the University of Melbourne as a Fulbright scholar in 1977, was president of the Organization of American Historians in 1980 and taught a course in maritime history at the Oregon Coast Community College last fall.
Survivors include his wife, Wendy; a son, Ward, of San Francisco; two daughters, Kyenne, of Madison, Wis., and Savoy Jade, of Hull, Mass.; two stepchildren, Justin, of Eugene, Ore., and Kathy, of Beavercreek, Ore., and three stepgrandchildren.

HEADLINE: Study Calls $2,200 Heart Drug No Better Than Cheaper One

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN

 BODY:
An expensive drug that is widely used to treat heart attacks in the United States is no more effective than a cheaper alternative commonly used in Europe, researchers in Italy reported yesterday.
In the first large-scale direct comparison of the two drugs, the researchers found no statistically significant difference in the death rates, heart function or complications among 12,381 heart attack patients. The drug commonly used in this country, tissue plasminogen activator, or T.P.A., and streptokinase, dissolve the blood clots that form within fat-damaged coronary arteries to cause heart attacks.
The results of the Italian study could have a major impact on the treatment of heart attacks in the United States because of the vast difference in cost of the two drugs. 
 
A Dose Costs $2,200
T.P.A. was developed in the 1980's through advanced genetic techniques. It costs $2,200 for each dose, and more than one dose might be necessary during hospitalization. It is sold as Activase by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco. Streptokinase, which is a protein derived from streptococcal bacteria, costs $186 each dose, although some hospitals pay as little as $76. It is made by Hoechst-Roussel Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Somerville, N. J. ''Streptokinase would now appear to be the drug of choice based on factors of cost,'' said Dr. Claude J. Lenfant, the director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Md. But he added that the price of T.P.A. might fall as technological improvements reduced production costs.
G. Kirk Raab, president and chief executive of Genentech, said the results were disappointing for his company but argued that they were ''inconclusive'' because the researchers did not immediately report results on the use of T.P.A. in combination with another drug, heparin. He said many American doctors believe the combination is highly effective.
The value of clot-dissolving drugs has been proved in earlier studies, and much smaller comparative studies of these two drugs have shown results similar to those reported yesterday. The drugs are credited with helping to improve survival and shorten the length of hospital stays among the 1.5 million Americans who suffer a heart attack each year. About half a million of them die, making heart attacks the leading cause of death in the United States.
The new study, reported at a meeting of Italian cardiologists in Florence, also showed that the standard therapies, including one of the clot-dissolving drugs, aspirin and other heart drugs, are continuing to improve prospects of survival.
 
Debate Over Drug Choice
Despite the benefit of clot-dissolving drugs, doctors throughout the world heatedly debate the choice of which one to use. T.P.A. is the overwhelming choice among American physicians, while streptokinase is heavily favored in Europe.
American doctors have turned heavily to T.P.A. because a number of studies of that drug alone have shown its ability to dissolve a clot quickly and effectively in a large percentage of cases. It is also considered less likely to cause an allergic reaction. The drug has also been heavily promoted by Genentech.
One other clot-dissolving drug, Eminase, is marketed in the United States by SmithKline Beecham. It was not included in the Italian study but is being directly compared with T.P.A. and streptokinase in an international study now under way. A fourth clot-dissolving drug, urokinase, is not licensed for use in this country.
 
Findings of Other Studies
The results released yesterday dealt only with the period of a heart attack patient's stay in one of the 223 Italian coronary care units in the study. Dr. Lenfant cautioned that further analysis would be needed to determine whether differences in the benefits of the two drugs would arise over a longer period.
Other studies have shown that T.P.A. can dissolve a clot quicker and more effectively than streptokinase, which is one reason American doctors prefer it over streptokinase. Thus, Dr. Lenfant said, long-term data from the Italian and other studies now under way might show a weakening of the heart muscle when the results are further analyzed six months after the patients suffered heart attacks.
Nevertheless, Dr. Lenfant said, the Italian study will have an impact because everyone was waiting for the results. ''It is provocative, but not necessarily in the way many people expected,'' Dr. Lenfant said.
In the Italian study, all 12,381 patients received standard cardiac care, including aspirin, and other heart drugs like those belonging to a class known as beta blockers. The patients also agreed to receive by random choice either streptokinase or T.P.A. if they were admitted to the hospital within six hours of the onset of the symptoms of a heart attack.
Heart attack symptoms can include steady pain in the chest or arm and nausea and vomiting.
Of the 6,182 patients who received injections of T.P.A., 556 died; 478 suffered clinical heart failure; 117 suffered a second heart attack during the hospital stay, and 576 developed angina, which can produce chest and arm pain from an inadequate supply of blood to the heart as a result of blockage of the coronary arteries.
 
Comparison of 2 Groups
By comparison, of the 6,199 patients who received streptokinase, 536 died; 502 developed clinical heart failure; 146 suffered a second heart attack during the hospital stay, and 619 developed angina.
The 70 strokes suffered among recipients of T.P.A. compared with 54 among the streptokinase group. But the numerical differences of the complications or results among the streptokinase and T.P.A. groups were not found to be statistically meaningful.
''Clearly, you cannot say on clinical grounds that T.P.A. is better than streptokinase, or vice versa, because they are just the same,'' said Dr. Silvio Garattini , the director of the Mario Negro Pharmacological Institute in Milan. His institute sponsored the study with Italian cardiologists.
But Dr. Garattini added that other medical considerations like allergies to streptokinase might lead a physician to choose T.P.A..
The Italian researchers said that the choice of drug ''must take full account of public health economy considerations.'' In the United States, health insurance plans generally cover the costs of clot-dissolving drugs.
Each of the two groups was divided into two additional groups. By another random selection these patients received either no additional drug or heparin, a drug that reduces the ability of the blood to form clots.
 
Excess of Bleeding
The researchers said they found ''a clear excess of bleeding complications in the heparin-treated group'' without any benefit to their survival or heart function.
American researchers have criticized the Italian study because the heparin was started 12 hours after admission to a hospital. But Dr. Garattini, the chairman of the meeting where the findings were reported, said the choice of timing ''was logical when we began the study two years ago and no one has any data to say it is better to give it any earlier.''
The study reported yesterday was the second by the same Italian group. The first involved only streptokinase and in 1986 the researchers proved the value of the drug in reducing the death rate from heart attacks. Aspirin was not widely used in the first study, but beta blockers and other cardiac drugs were often prescribed.
 
Typical Heart Patient
Dr. Garattini said in a telephone interview from Florence that the study represented the typical patient treated for a heart attack in Italian hospitals.
He said the newest combination of therapies led to a continued improvement in survival from heart attacks. The Italian researchers said the 8.8 percent probability of dying during hospital treatment for a heart attack had dropped dramatically from a baseline of 13 percent in 1986 before the first study.
The 8.8 percent figure was also a drop from a baseline of 10.2 percent recorded in the group that was treated with streptokinase in the first study.

HEADLINE: Sharm el Sheik Journal;
Hotels. Divers. Next for a Fragile Reef: A Bridge?

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SHARM EL SHEIK, Egypt

 BODY:
This is a place where the fish, the foreigners and the flights of entrepreneurial fancy blend in symbiosis: the fish bejewel the coral reef, the foreigners dive to see them and the entrepreneurs build the hostelries where the foreigners rest when the fish viewing is done.
Yet, as environmentalists and ecologists contemplate the future of one of the region's last unspoiled marine sanctuaries, they see perils on the horizon.
One is the hunger of distant collectors for rare species of the fish that congregate in spangled multitude along the reef. Another is the unbridled rush into hotel building that has turned the beachfront into a construction site. But the largest, laden with issues of Arab pride, is a suggestion by Saudi Arabia and Egypt that they link their lands by a 15-mile system of causeways and a bridge soaring over the waters of the Strait of Tiran just north of here. 
''This is a very sensitive issue,'' said a foreign expert, who cited the sensitivity as his reason for asking not to be quoted by name. ''Each time outsiders start talking about it, the resolve to go ahead with the plan deepens.''
 
Backpackers and Scuba Divers
If the project proceeds, the expert said, great chunks of coral reef will be destroyed, causing unforeseeable ecological harm elsewhere along the reef, which hugs the coastline for miles.
Egypt regained the Sinai under its 1979 peace treaty with Israel, which seized it during the 1967 Middle East War. Israeli entrepreneurs had already, planted the seeds of mass tourism with a hotel and holiday apartments here. Until last year, it was still possible to find road signs in Hebrew pointing the way north through the dry, serrated mountains, where an array of fortifications displays the area's potential as a focus of conflict. Indeed, the 1967 war began after Egypt closed the Strait of Tiran.
In more recent years, the warriors have largely given way to backpackers and scuba divers from Europe arriving in increasing numbers at the small airport. With the people have come more hotels, and boutiques and antique shops. And, as modernity has spread where once the Bedouins and their camels roamed undisturbed, the Egyptian authorities and foreign conservationists have sought to preserve the pristine waters, to protect the angelfish and parrotfish as well as the tourism they lure.
A project sponsored by the United States Agency for International Development seeks to persuade about 300 Bedouin fishermen to abandon the traditional way of catching fish by standing on the coral reef with gill nets. The idea, an American official said, is to persuade the Bedouins to use larger nets and fish beyond the reef from boats.
 
Project's Affect on the Region
Environmentalists, moreover, try to keep watch for the shadowy agents of companies supplying aquariums, who offer the local fishermen good money for rare fish.
A wedge of land around the Sinai's tip has been declared a national park and other places have been named protected areas where developers may not build hotels. At the entrance to the Ras Mohammed National Park, a warden checks car trunks for booty - coral or rare fish.
But the Saudi-Egyptian bridge project could change the region's character.
''The bridge is still an idea that is going through a lot of studies at the moment,'' said Abdel Maqsud Ahmed, an official of the Ministry of Transport and Communications who is said to be the leader in pressing for the construction of the bridge. ''We are studying all aspects of the project, including the environmental aspect and the environmentalists' objections. Environment and nature are now very important to Egypt as a means of living.''
 
Threat to Coral Reef
Despite those assurances, some remain unconvinced. ''Those who think the project will be a plus do not think in terms of environmental considerations, but maybe in other terms,'' said Mohammed Ibrahim of the Government's Environment al Affairs Department. He declined to go into detail, saying the authorities had given no ''green light'' for open debate of the idea.
Others, who asked not to be identified, seemed less constrained. ''You open that bridge and there'll be traffic jams for miles either side of it,'' said a foreign specialist. ''You'll be getting bridge tolls. But you'll lose tourism.''
The idea apparently is to build a series of causeways from the Saudi side to Tiran Island, and then to build a single span across the remaining two miles of strait.
''It would mean destroying coral reef to sink foundations, and no one knows how that would effect the ecological chain,'' the foreign expert said.
 
Issues of Arab Brotherhood
The idea became public when Saudi Arabia renewed ties with Egypt last year and King Fahd visited Cairo and talked with President Hosni Mubarak. The project would provide a road link for the Muslims of Egypt and North Africa to the Islamic shrines of Saudi Arabia during the annual pilgrimage to Mecca.
The idea thus evokes not only issues of Arab brotherhood and pride in the face of perceived interference by outsiders opposing the idea but also the profound passions of Islam.
It is unclear what benefits the bridge would bring to travelers in other seasons, because of the distance between the major cities the bridge would connect. The trip to Sharm el Sheik is now six hours by car from Cairo, and Jidda and Mecca are another 600 miles to the southeast.
But for those who would build it, at least, the bridge project conjures images of great profit.
Newspaper reports in Cairo initially suggested that the bridge would cost $600 million. But some informal estimates by American engineers put the final cost in billions of dollars. That helps explain why, shortly after the idea was made public last year, six Japanese businessmen arrived here, residents said, inquiring about contracts.

HEADLINE: Nixon Treated as Hero In Halls of His Disgrace

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
Congressional aides with only distant childhood memories of Watergate applauded, cheered and jostled one another to shake his hand. Newt Gingrich, the House Republican whip, positively glowed. Even the worldly Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader, seemed a bit nonplussed.
Richard M. Nixon returned today to Capitol Hill, the scene of his downfall, for his most public appearance here since the Watergate scandal drove him from the Presidency in 1974. 
Grayer, more hesitant in his walk than when he last strode the corridors of Congress, but holding himself regally and exuding good humor, Mr. Nixon lectured Republicans in Congress on the dramatic turnings in world events.
The former President, who knows something about how to make a comeback, gave advice to senators seeking re-election this year, held his first Washington news conference since he resigned and basked a bit in the restored political glow that he has been carefully acquiring.
 
Living History Speaks
Mr. Dole said as he emerged from a 30-minute meeting with Mr. Nixon that the former President was ''rehabilitated'' and jested that as for making a new bid for office, ''I think he's going to announce.''
Mr. Gingrich, after a 90-minute meeting of the House Republican Conference - Mr. Nixon's official reason for being here - said several times that it had been an ''extraordinary'' experience to hear Mr. Nixon speak about China, Eastern Europe and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union. ''It's almost eerie to hear a man who is a living example of history,'' he said.
Mr. Nixon applauded President Bush's overtures to China, said Poland's efforts at free-market reform ''must not fail'' and said it was up to the United States to assure ''the victory of freedom'' as Communist power crumbled. But he opposed economic aid to the Soviet Union and said that while the cold war was ''probably'' over in Europe, it was continuing in the developing nations.
In recent years, Mr. Nixon has systematically shed the seclusion of those days after his resignation. He has lectured widely, granted television and print interviews and written treatises on foreign affairs.
 
Heavy Turnout by the Young
He visited the Reagan White House with other former Presidents. Mr. Bush had him to an intimate dinner last year to talk about China, which Mr. Nixon was responsible for ''reopening'' in 1972.
He visited Congress last December for a quiet dinner at which Mr. Dole was the host. Today's trip was far more public, with a news conference, photo opportunities with members of Congress and staffs and halls lined with well-wishers. It seemed to symbolize emergence from the chrysalis of a political disgrace into a new role as an elder statesman, at least within the Republican Party.
Congressional aides in their early 20's turned out by the dozens for him today. Ripples of applause and cheers followed Mr. Nixon as he walked, limping slightly, down the corridors of the Longworth House Office Building, just next door to the Raeburn Building, where the House Judiciary Committee once deliberated his fate.
Mr. Nixon came late to the crowded news conference in the building's lobby after his session with the House Republican Conference: he had to pose for pictures with scores of lawmakers, lobbyists, staff members and others.
 
On Reagan: No Cover-Up
Mr. Dole said several Congressional security officers wanted to be photographed with Mr. Nixon ''and we didn't ask for their party affiliations.''
At the news conference Mr. Nixon, who never seemed comfortable in hot television lights, wiped his face several times with a handkerchief. When a reporter called him ''Mr. Gorbachev'' by mistake, he laughed and said, ''I've been called worse.''
He was asked about the Iran-contra affair and the videotaped testimony in which Mr. Reagan said he could not recall much of those events. Mr. Reagan, Mr. Nixon said, was not a crook. ''How this man, who is 79 years of age, could not have made more mistakes and forgotten more I don't know,'' said the 77-year-old Mr. Nixon. ''I think that President Reagan was not trying to dissemble. He was not trying to cover up.''
He was asked if he felt ''at peace'' now with himself. ''I'll save that for the next conference,'' he said. ''I know that I'm getting older and the press seems to be getting younger.''
 
U.S. Policy, China, Communism
Asked about his return to Capitol Hill, he again avoided answering in the context of his resignation. ''It's good to be back here where my political career started 43 years ago,'' said Mr. Nixon, who was a California Congressman in the late 1940's.
Generally, he tried to keep the focus on foreign policy, He said he supported Mr. Bush's secret missions to China: ''If the United States does not play a role in China, who does that leave among the major powers? It leaves the Soviet Union and Japan. Does anyone think the Soviet Union is going to export human rights to China? And anyone that thinks Japan is going to export democracy to China must be smoking pot.''
He spoke of the changes in Eastern Europe with admiration and said Mr. Bush and Congress must ''see that after the defeat of Communism that freedom works.''
Senator Dole overflowed with praise for Mr. Nixon's foreign policy acumen, even if he was a bit more reserved about his political role. ''I think he's an excellent fund-raiser,'' he said. ''Rehabilitated? That means a lot of things to a lot of people. I think he is.''
A Republican senator's aide scurried out of Mr. Dole's office to grab colleagues for picture-taking with Mr. Nixon. ''He's doing great,'' the aide shouted over his shoulder. ''He's back.''

HEADLINE: Bush Transportation Policy Assailed

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
The Bush Administration's new transportation policy was sharply criticized today by many members of Congress and by state and local officials, most of whom disagreed with its shift from Federal spending toward local spending on mass transit and highways.
''It does nothing to show me a recognition that the nation is facing a growing transportation crisis,'' said Representative Glenn M. Anderson, a California Democrat who is chairman of the House Public Works and Transportation Committee. ''When it comes to the crunch of making a national commitment to invest in our future, the report is lacking.''
The policy, announced today at the White House, calls for the Federal Government to focus its efforts on projects of national significance, like major interstate highways. It also calls for state and local governments to increase their own taxes and expenditures for other projects, at a time when major cost increases are forecast for roads, airports, rail lines and other transportation needs. 
 
Opposition Grows More Vocal
Many details of the Administration's policy had been disclosed in recent days and weeks. Today, opposition to its central premises grew more vocal.
''This plan perpetuates the existing Federal fiscal policies that continually seek to force state and local governments to pick up the slack for proposed Federal cutbacks in domestic programs,'' said Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York.
He released a state study showing a steady decline in the Federal Government's share of national spending on highways and mass transit over the past decade.
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a New York Republican who is on the Senate Appropriations Committee's transportation subcommittee, said: ''I don't see how we make any progress with this approach. The policy limps because there is not sufficient revenue allocated to it.''
Bipartisan groups, like the National Governors' Association, that had been involved in consultations with the Administration on its policy praised the Administration for issuing a report focusing attention on transportation needs. But the praise was faint.
''I feel like the fellow with one foot in a bucket of ice and the other in a bucket of hot coals,'' said Gov. Wallace G. Wilkinson of Kentucky. ''On average, I feel okay.'' A Democrat who is vice chairman of the governors' transportation committee, he spoke to reporters outside the White House after hearing President Bush and Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner present the policy report.
''Will more of the burden be shifted to the states, and if so, how much?'' he asked. ''More and more and more of the burden is being shifted to the states, and our ability to handle those things is getting less and less and less.''
 
Skinner Confirms a Shift
Mr. Skinner, at a White House news conference, said, ''We feel that state and local governments have not provided a sufficient amount of infrastructure funding.'' The Administration feels strongly that operating subsidies for mass transit should stop, and it also has proposed eliminating Federal subsidies for Amtrak, the passenger railroad. Both of these policies have been adamantly resisted by Congress for years.
Although the policy statement released today contains no specific budget or cost figures, Mr. Skinner said that the Federal Government would continue to increase total transportation spending even as it shifts many responsibilities to state and local governments. The amounts, he said, would depend on legislation to extend and renew aviation, highway, mass transit and other programs, which Congress is expected to enact in the coming two years. Currently, the Federal Government spends $27 billion a year on transportation, about one-fifth of all public spending on transportation.
''Over all, I am hopeful that it will be growing,'' he said. ''We call for a greater local share and a greater Federal share.''
But Francis Francois, executive director of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, said: ''We have been doing more for some time. In point of fact, the Federal Government has been a junior partner.''
Mr. Francois said his group wants Federal highway aid to increase initially to $18 billion annually from $14.7 billion and grow over a four-year period to as much as $26 billion a year. He said states and local governments should make proportionate increases.
The National Conference of State Legislatures, however, strongly supported the Administration plan to increase state financing of transportation. ''We applaud Secretary Skinner for his effort to realign roles and responsibilities,'' said William Pound, the group's executive director. ''State officials are best able to determine the needs in their individual states.''
Some transportation experts focused on the management of several multibillion-dollar trust funds that collect fees from users of the transportation system and allocate the money to Federal aid programs.
A coalition of 16 aviation industry groups, for example, denounced the Administration's plans to increase airline ticket taxes to 10 percent from 8 percent and to use the aviation trust fund to pay a higher percentage of the operating costs of the air traffic control system. Instead, the industry argued, the Administration should leave ticket taxes where they are and use the fund for a faster modernization of air traffic control equipment.

HEADLINE: SENATOR TO SEEK BIG MILITARY CUTS

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee said today that he would seek to cut $12 billion from the Bush Administration's proposed military budget of $303.3 billion for the next fiscal year.
The chairman, Senator James Sasser, Democrat of Tennessee, offered only a limited picture of the effect such a cut would have on weapons, personnel levels and research spending.
But as justification for seeking a cut of about 4 percent from the Administration's proposal, he cited testimony last week from the Director of Central Intelligence, William H. Webster, that the Soviet threat is fast receding.
''I believe Director Webster has pushed the defense debate beyond its early stages of uncertainty,'' Mr. Sasser said at a hearing where the Congressional Budget Office outlined options for cuts in military spending. 
 
Warning on 'Internal' Inertia
''The impediments to achieving a real peacetime defense budget are managerial, bureacratic, sometimes political,'' he said. ''They have little to do with the threats we face from without and a lot to do with the inertia we must overcome from within.''
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has publicly disagreed with Mr. Webster's assessment, and over the weekend said the intelligence chief's comments were ''not helpful'' to his effort to gain Congressional support for the Administration's defense plans.
Mr. Sasser said there was a good chance other Democrats on the budget panel would support his recommendation. He described Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, who heads the Senate Appropriations Committee, as neutral.
 
First Step of Many
Although Mr. Sasser's recommendation represents the first of many steps in Congressional consideration of the military budget, and precedes a more detailed review of strategy and spending by the House and Senate panels that directly oversee military policy, it is likely to serve as a benchmark figure for the Senate in the months ahead.
The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan research arm of Congress, has prepared five different alternatives for spending. They range from saving $9 billion over five years, by making minimal changes in policy to meet the requirements of expected agreements on arms and conventional forces, to saving up to $80 billion over five years, through large reductions in active American forces and scrapping strategic weapons systems.
If current policies were to continue unchanged, military spending adjusted to keep pace for inflation would be $306.4 in the 1991 fiscal year.
The Senate Armed Services Committee, which is still months away from drafting guidelines for the military program, is looking at a spending level that would translate to cuts of between $3 billion and $4 billion from the Bush proposal, said Senator Jim Exon, a Nebraska Democrat a member of both committees and generally a conservative on military matters.
''I can't tell you exactly where it will come out, but I'll be recommending something below $300 billion,'' he told reporters today.
 
Voice for Smaller Cuts
Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, said cuts in that range sounded far more plausible than the reduction Mr. Sasser was discussing. ''I just don't believe that much is possible in the first year,'' he said, adding that for now he is prepared to stick with the Bush figures.
While the Armed Services Committees in both the House and Senate are responsible for drawing up a comprehensive plan for what the Pentagon spends and for how military resources are deployed, the Congressional budget process requires the House and Senate budget panels to act first and produce a blueprintfor the overall Federal budget. Mr. Sasser's committee is hoping to begin is budget drafting in late April.
In the House, Democrats remain deeply divided over how much to cut the military spending and are looking at cuts that range between $10 billion and $16 billion. Liberals in the House say they are convinced that the Senate will ulitmately approve a military spending level much higher than most Democrats would favor, and part of the jockeying that has started reflects a desire to give the House bargaining room on the final number.
''Those of us who want to cut the defense budget realize that this is a five-year struggle, not a one year struggle,'' said Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat who is a member of the House Budget Committee. ''We want to really get the number lower, not just have an opportunity to vote for a lower number and lose.''

HEADLINE: $150 Billion a Year

SERIES: Second of two articles.

 BODY:

How to Spend It
Yes, there is a peace dividend, a fabulous fortune to be amassed as defense spending is gradually scaled down. By 1999, the amount could readily reach $150 billion a year. But already the line of people with worthy claims on the windfall stretches around the block.
Spend the money, some say, to strengthen the new democracies of Eastern Europe. Use it, others say, to make up for starved social spending in this country. No, say still others, including President Bush, use it to reduce the immense Federal deficit. Indeed, last week the Senate passed a non-binding resolution to do just that. 
How should the country spend the peace dividend? One principle can usefully guide debate because it guarantees political consensus:
Invest in the future. Make Americans more productive by focusing on two urgent needs - the health and education of youth, and the crumbling national infrastructure.
Cutting back the mountainous deficit, per the Senate resolution, is responsible. But it is misguided and unnecessary. It's misguided because public investment in the economic future is every bit as important as reducing the deficit. It's unnecessary because deficit cuts already scheduled under the Gramm-Rudman law should suffice.
The larger task before Congress is to promote economic growth. Using the dividend to reduce the deficit would help do that. Smaller deficits would mean less Government borrowing, leaving more money in private capital markets to fuel corporate innovation and investment.
But it would promote growth at least as much to earmark the dividend for the needs of children and infrastructure. The economy needs a better-educated work force and an efficient transportation system at least as much as more investment by General Motors and Sears. Public investments need to be debated on their individual merits, not rejected in slavish devotion to deficit reduction.
 
What's the Right Size Deficit?
Experts disagree about the desirable level of deficit, leaving the public uncertain. Benjamin Friedman, a Harvard economist, cites the savings rate, low and falling, as a cause of low investment, sluggish productivity and increased reliance on foreign capital. No one of these trends is cataclysmic; the combination is frightening. His remedy is to increase savings by insisting that the $100 billion deficit - counting Social Security - be converted by tax hikes and spending cuts into a $60 billion surplus.
But Robert Eisner, an economist at Northwestern University, vehemently disagrees. He argues that the savings rate, excluding public investment, is not too low. Keeping deficits in the vicinity of $150 billion is just fine, because that would keep Federal debt from growing faster than the economy does.
Even without the peace dividend, the deficit is already scheduled to fall. Unless Congress wholly abandons its Gramm-Rudman targets, the deficit -counting Social Security - will be eliminated by the mid-90's. That target is stricter than Dr. Eisner's, looser than Dr. Friedman's. If it is the wrong target, it would not seem to err by much. For the next few years, the Gramm-Rudman targets will produce deficits that are modest by both historical and international standards.
The case for driving the deficit much lower is unproven. That being so, Congress would be wise to use the unexpected peace dividend for public investment. The proper test is how well the investment works - will it enlarge the economic pie? - not how much it affects the deficit. America's human resources and physical capital are too important to sacrifice at the arbitrary altar of deficit reduction.
 
Put Americans in the Fast Lane
For a decade, needed public investments have been squeezed out by tax cuts, rising military spending and middle class entitlements. Americans pay the cost in the form of airport congestion, decrepit bridges and freeway tie-ups. They also pay for the lost investment in people.
Investments in Human Resources. The most compelling challenge is to give a fair chance for productive lives to the next generation of Americans, one in four of whom is now born into poverty. Programs that do that pay off immediately, commonly saving three and four times their cost in remedial programs.
Funds from the peace dividend would magnify the gains - and the savings. A billion dollars would give comprehensive prenatal health care to an additional 1.5 million poor pregnant women. An additional billion would add 400,000 children to Head Start, which, though widely successful, still reaches only one eligible child in five. Every dollar spent on Head Start, experts say, saves almost $5 in welfare, remedial education and other costs.
Investments in Infrastructure. The nation's transportation network has also been allowed to deteriorate. According to the Federal Transportation Department, urban areas now experience two billion hours a year of highway delays. Flight delays at 21 primary airports amount to 20,000 hours a year. Peace dividend money can bring relief and promote economic growth.
There are other worthy, perhaps even compelling purposes for which the peace dividend might be earmarked - including, notably, the environment. If there's to be public debate about the agenda, however, it better start soon. Otherwise, this rare windfall will dribble back into Washington's workaday stew of needs, claims and special interests. The point resounds, for Congress and even more for the present occupant of the Bully Pulpit: This is a precious moment, but only if they seize it.

HEADLINE: Nicaragua Votes for End to Washington's Siege;
Cuba's Turn?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
William Safire gleefully predicts in ''Castro's Last Stand'' (column, Feb. 19) the ''coming downfall'' of President Fidel Castro of Cuba. He links this event to ''the economic crisis facing his Soviet sponsors'' and other political changes sweeping the Communist world in Eastern Europe.
I am neither a seer nor a booster of the Castro regime, and Mr. Safire's prediction may well come true. His views, however, appear to be based on wishful thinking and an astonishing ignorance of Cuba. 
President Castro, in power since 1959, has outlasted seven United States Presidents, and I am willing to make a modest even-money wager with Mr. Safire that he may still be around when President Bush completes his term in 1993.
One key reason President Castro stands a chance of survival is that his Government must be viewed in its regional context. The crumbling Communist regimes of Eastern Europe were economic basket cases compared with their Western European neighbors. But Cuba, while far poorer than the neighboring United States, provides a standard of living that is comparable, and in several cases superior, to that in most other Caribbean and Central American countries.
Cubans, despite limits on personal freedom and the clear (to me) shortcomings of a centralized Communist economic system, are better fed, housed and educated, and enjoy better health care than do the citizens of several nearby countries with a capitalist system. Infant mortality in Cuba, for example, is now about 11 per 1,000 births, about the same as New Zealand and Israel, far lower than that of such free enterprise neighbors as the Dominican Republic (66), Haiti (118), Honduras (70), Guatemala (60), El Salvador (60), Trinidad (20), Jamaica (18) and Costa Rica (18).
And while Cuba is in the midst of a serious economic crisis, the same can be said of many of its non-Communist regional neighbors, overwhelmed by debt and inflation. Their exports command successively lower prices on the world market, and their citizens continue to migrate to the United States in search of opportunity. Third world underdevelopment is a tenacious problem that crosses ideological barriers and defies simple formulas.
These facts Mr. Safire forgets or chooses to ignore. As for human rights, he is curiously selective when he rails against the ''tyranny'' in Cuba, while making no mention of murder and mayhem committed by governments in Haiti, Guatemala and El Salvador.

HEADLINE: Nicaragua Votes for End to Washington's Siege

 BODY:
To the Editor:
To understand what happened in the Feb. 25 Nicaraguan elections, Penn Kemble needs to take off his ideological glasses. ''Sandinistas Out: No Surprise'' (Op-Ed, Feb. 27) is at best half-right, containing profound misperceptions of both Nicaragua and United States policy.
Contra supporters trumpet the results as a vindication of the Reagan Administration's unremitting hostility toward the Sandinistas, or as Mr. Kemble, senior associate of Freedom House, describes it, ''the support of the U.S. in securing . . . democratic rights.'' 
Is that what the elections prove? Or is it that a superpower that lays siege militarily and economically to a small, impoverished country can bring it to its knees? Nobody ever argued that the United States could not cripple and paralyze the Nicaraguan economy.
The Sandinistas mortgaged their economy to fight Washington's war. For years, more than half the budget was directed toward the military. The gross national product dropped by half. Purchasing power plummeted by 80 percent. A radical structural adjustment introduced in 1988 sent prices spiraling. These were indeed harsh truths of life in Nicaragua, and they cannot be understood apart from Washington's harsh policy.
It is also true that Sandinista zealotry alienated many people. Most of Nicaragua's peasant population are historically conservative and have resisted any government (Sandinistas included) that told them what to do. So the Sandinistas lost the election - and so did incumbent governments recently in Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras. This trend is visible all over the hemisphere. It is a bad season to be an incumbent.
The Central American peace process initiated by President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica in August 1987 -and fought every step of the way by the Reagan Administration - created the conditions for the Nicaraguan elections. Had the contra war continued, there would have been no elections and no triumph of the opposition led by Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.
In opting for Mrs. Chamorro, Nicaraguans were not voting for Washington's policy, which they knew. They were voting for Washington's economic aid, which they hope for. They were not celebrating Washington's intervention in their internal affairs. They were voting for relief from Washington's unmitigated hostility.
Mrs. Chamorro and the UNO coalition have declared their intention to respect and honor the accomplishments of the revolution. They have given the beneficiaries of land reform assurances that their land will not be returned to the old owners. And they have publicly acknowledged that to govern they must respect and work with the Sandinistas, who remain even after their defeat far the largest and best organized party in Nicaragua.
There is wisdom in this recognition, for Mrs. Chamorro's government and for United States policy. The Sandinistas, who organized the elections and give every sign of abiding by their results, are crucial if Nicaragua is to bind up the wounds for which Washington bears so much responsibility.

HEADLINE: Youth Held in Burning of Boy Called Thuggish but Lonely

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
On the block where he lives, the accused youth is known as a bully with a vicious streak - a boy who taunted and beat smaller children, stole their lunch money and other property and sometimes whipped stray dogs into snarling fury and set them on one another for the fun of it.
But behind the mask of anger, acquaintances say, the 13-year-old Brooklyn youth charged with kidnapping, beating and critically burning a younger boy is also a troubled and lonely foster child with learning disabilities, himself an outcast tormented by older youths, a school dropout who spent aimless days in the streets and playing video games.
As the police, neighbors and anguished families tried to fathom the attack, an outpouring of concern from across the city and the country - from the White House, former President Ronald Reagan, Mayor David N. Dinkins and scores of ordinary people - was expressed for the victim, David Aupont, who marked his 12th birthday yesterday in the burn unit of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan.
David, who suffered third-degree burns over more than half his body in the attack in a basement in the Flatbush section on Wednesday morning, was listed in critical condition a day after his ordeal and was being given a 50-50 chance of survival. 
 
Motive Called Robbery
''He's a fighter - he's tough,'' Dr. Cleon Goodwin, director of the burn unit, said of the patient. Teddy bears, balloons, presents and many telephone calls from well-wishers arrived at the hospital yesterday, but no one but his doctors and parents were allowed to see him.
The police, who had said on Wednesday that David was attacked on his way to school by a youth who tried to force him to smoke crack, gave a different version of events yesterday, saying the assailant's motive had apparently been robbery and that there was no evidence that crack had played a role in the case.
But it was the horror of the crime and not the motive that stunned the city and the neighborhood where David and the accused assailant - a youth whose name was withheld because of his age - were known among children, teen-agers and adults as virtual opposites.
David was described as a quiet, clean-cut boy who had emigrated from Haiti a year ago and, though unable to speak English fluently, studied hard at the Walt Whitman Intermediate School at 72 Veronica Place and got along well with his family and neighbors at 754 East 23d Street in the Midwood section.
The accused youth, however, was described as a surly and thuggish boy who intimidated, beat up on and extorted money from other children, who dropped out of the sixth grade at Jackie Robinson Intermediate School, 46 McKeever Place in Flatbush, a few months ago, and who spent hours a day playing video games at home and in arcades on Flatbush Avenue.
School officials declined to discuss the youth or his status, but a teacher at Jackie Robinson said the youth had been enrolled in special education classes for the learning disabled. But several students said the youth had not attended any classes for months and had apparently dropped out of school.
 
An Isolated Boy
There was no one home yesterday in the third-floor apartment at 2537 Bedford Avenue, near Clarenden Road, where he lives with his foster family -Martha Stokes, an unemployed mother, her son, Anthony, 12, and two younger daughters, Keesha and Precious.
Lisa Paulycarpe, 14, who lives downt the blocks at 2553 Bedford Avenue, said that neighborhood residents knew the youth as an islolated boy - a bully who intimidated and sometimes beat up smaller children, but who also was mistreated and scorned by older youths whose company he sought.
''They think he's strange,'' she said. ''He's an outcast. He wants to be in, but people say, 'We don't want to hang with you.' ''
Another neighborhood youth, who gave his name only as Randy, said the 13-year-old loved playing nasty tricks. ''One time, he picked up a dead cat and chased me with it,'' he said. On another occasion, at a restaurant, he said he saw the youth empty salt and garlic shakers on a chair and mix up the contents with ketchup, then push the chair in so that an unsuspecting person would sit on the mess.
Randy said that, in an effort to ingratiate himself with older toughs a couple of months ago, the youth once stripped naked and ran across the rooftops. He also collected stray dogs and, after beating them into a snarling fury, set them on one another, Randy said.
''He's crazy,'' the boy said. ''He's really weird.''
 
No Evidence of Crack Involved
Others said the youth occasionally used crack and other drugs, but the police said there was no evidence of this. In particular, the police said, there was no evidence that crack was involved in the attack on David Wednesday.
Deputy Inspector Joseph DeMartino, commanding officer of Brooklyn North detectives, said at a news conference at the 67th Precinct station house in Brooklyn that the 13-year-old had intercepted David and three other boys about 8:35 A.M. at Beverly Road and Lott Street.
The boys recognized the older boy. ''He's known in the neighborhood as a bully,'' Inspector DeMartino said.
While the other three boys fled, David was seized by the 13-year-old and was forced to walk several blocks and taken into a basement at 2534 Bedford Avenue, across the street from the the suspect's apartment house. First reports had said David was taken to a nearby garage, but this was based on a bloodhound's false tracking, the police said.
In the basement, the Inspector said, the older boy beat David with his fists, stole a small amount of money from him and tied him to a radiator with strips of cloth. Then, he said, the youth doused him with an as-yet unidentified flammable liquid and set him on fire.
With his clothes blazing, David broke free, ran out a rear entrance, climbed over a fence and ran to a nearby auto body shop, where mechanics snuffed out the flames. The initial reports about crack apparently had come from the mechanics, who said the boy had made the allegation.

FRIDAY
 
ARABIAN DAYS
Despite a handful of exotic, often contradictory images culled from ''Lawrence of Arabia'' and television news, to most Americans Saudi Arabia might as well be the moon. For those who wish to learn more about this huge, rich, all-too-stereotyped country, the next best thing to being there is a free weeklong exhibition called ''Saudi Arabia Yesterday and Today,'' which opens today at the New York City Passenger Ship Terminal on Pier 88, at 48th Street and 12th Avenue. This large-scale presentation, sponsored by the Saudi Arabian Government, includes 65,000 square feet of exhibits on the country's geography, culture, architecture, religion, politics, and arts and crafts. Highlights include nearly life-size re-creations of a desert oasis, complete with palm groves and a Bedouin tent, and the outdoor marketplace known as a souk. Gold and silver doors that were once part of the Kaabah, Islam's original house of worship, are displayed in a courtyard with exhibits and a slide show about the Islamic religion and culture. In addition, the show includes a video-and-laser show on recent Saudi history and economic development, demonstrations of crafts like rug-weaving and calligraphy, and folk dance performances daily at 10:30 A.M. and 12:30, 4 and 6 P.M. The exhibition is open daily from 9 A.M to 7:30 P.M. through March 17. Information: 765-9244. 
 
LOVE IN THE TEENS
Adolescent amour, or love at first write, might best describe tonight's literary program in the Writer's Voice series of readings at the West Side Y.M.C.A., 5 West 63d Street. This 8 P.M. reading, called ''First Love,'' will feature romantic and other teen-age writings by Fran Lebowitz, author of ''Social Studies'' and ''Metropolitan Life''; Ntozake Shange, author of ''For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf,'' and Meg Wolitzer, whose novels include ''This Is Your Life'' and ''Sleepwalking.'' Admission is $8, or free for high-school students and teachers with identification. Reservations and information on the series: 787-6557.
 
SATURDAY
 
LIFE UNDERGROUND
Every straphanger has stories to tell about life aboard the New York City subway system, but what about the people who drive the trains, sell tokens and work on the tracks and signals? Some of the vast folklore of subway workers may be discovered on Saturday at the New York Transit Museum in downtown Brooklyn, where four past and present employees of the New York City Transit Authority will talk about subjects like drilling subway tunnels, delivering a baby on the subway, saving a woman who had jumped in front of a train, and filming movies like ''The French Connection'' and ''The Taking of Pelham One Two Three.'' The 90-minute program, beginning at 2 P.M., will be led by Sally Charnow, a folklorist and historian. This museum of local mass-transit history is at Boerum Place and Schermerhorn Street, in a former subway station near the present Borough Hall station. The program is free with museum admission, which is $1.15 - the price of a token - or 55 cents for children. Information: (718) 330-3063.
 
FAMILY SHAKESPEARE
Egland in the days of William Shakespeare will be brought to life this weekend in a new musical for families presented at the Promenade Theater, Broadway and 76th Street. ''The Play's the Thing,'' by Thomas Edward West with music by Robert Waldman, is a lively tale of a Puritan girl whose father opposes the theater. Disguising herself as a boy, she joins Shakespeare's troupe shortly before the premiere of ''Romeo and Juliet.'' The production is by Theaterworks/ USA, the children's-theater company, and is directed by R. J. Cutler. Performances are on Saturday at 12:30 P.M. and Sunday at 10:30 A.M. and 12:30 P.M. Tickets are $12 and $15. Reservations: 677-5959 or 947-5850.
 
SYMPHONY PREMIERE
A new symphony by Richard Danielpour called ''Journey Without Distance'' will be given its East Coast premiere by the Stamford Symphony Orchestra on Saturday at 8:30 P.M. and Sunday at 3 P.M. in the orchestra's home at the Palace Theater/ Stamford Center of the Arts, 61 Atlantic Street (near Exit 8 of Interstate 95), in Stamford, Conn. Mr. Danielpour, a 34-year-old New York composer, has said that the symphony was inspired by ''A Course in Miracles,'' a work of spiritual psychotherapy by Helen Schucman. The orchestra, conducted by the music director Roger Nierenberg, will also perform Ottorino Respighi's ''Ancient Airs and Dances Set II,'' Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Capriccio Espagnol'' and two pieces by Maurice Ravel: ''Tzigane'' and ''Pavane for a Dead Princess.'' Tickets are $6 to $32; discounts for students and the elderly are available. Reservations: (203) 325-1407.
 
SUNDAY
 
WAR AND ART
Germany's turbulent history from the eve of World War I to the end of World War II, and artists' reactions to the horrors and tumult of those years, are the subject of an exhibition that opens at the Jewish Museum on Sunday and continues through May 23. The show, ''War, Resistance and Politics: Dusseldorf Artists, 1910-1945,'' includes 125 paintings, drawings and illustrations by 39 artists, Many of the artists served on the front lines in World War I; others were active in liberal and left-wing politics during the Weimar Republic, and some survived the Nazi era. In addition to works by Kathe Kollwitz, Otto Dix and Max Ernst, lesser-known artists from the Dusseldorf avant-garde like Conrad Felixmuller and Otto Pankok are also included in the show. Most works are on loan from the Stadtmuseum Dusseldorf. The Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92d Street, is open Sundays from 11 A.M. to 6 P.M.; and Mondays through Thursdays from noon to 5 P.M. (Tuesdays till 8 P.M.). Admission is $4.50; $2.50 for students and the elderly. Information: 860-1888.
 
CENTENNIAL CONCERT
Choral and vocal chamber works by the Swiss composer Frank Martin will be performed by the New Amsterdam Singers, with the mezzo-soprano D'Anna Fortunato, at 4 P.M. at St. Ignatius Episcopal Church, West End Avenue at 87th Street. The concert, which marks the centennial of Martin's birth, will include pieces written between 1921 and 1971 to texts by writers including Shakespeare, Pierre de Ronsard and Francois Villon. This program of rarely performed works also will feature Martin's a cappella Mass for double chorus. Martin, whose choral works and better-known orchestral pieces tend to be melodic yet technically complex, was influenced by Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg, but he never abandoned tonality. The New Amsterdam Singers, a 22-year-old New York ensemble of about 70 members, are directed by Clara Longstreth. Tickets are $10; $8 for students and the elderly. Information: 662-6523.
 
DANCING TOWARD SPRING
The spring dance series at the 92d Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, will continue on Sunday at 7 P.M. with a performance of new works by the choreographer Francis Patrelle. The program will include ''State of Mind,'' excerpts from ''Fuoco e Fiamma,'' a revival of Mr. Patrelle's homage to George Gershwin's ''Rhapsody in Blue'' and a contemporary musical collage called ''Jazz/ Fools.'' The Dances Patrelle company will feature Donald Williams, a principal with Dance Theater of Harlem, and members of the New York City Ballet. Tickets are $5. Information: 996-1100.

HEADLINE: Patent Suit Becomes Trade Battle

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
A Swiss machine-tool company won a victory today over a Japanese rival in a battle that has been marked by bare-knuckles practices rarely seen in multinational business.
Also facing off in the dispute were officials in Washington and Zurich and at the Defense and Commerce Departments.
The case originally involved patents for advanced machine tools, which the AGIE Group of Zurich accused the Sodick Company of Yokohama of infringing. But it escalated into the area of international trade practice and matters of national security. 
 
Federal Agency Involved
Because the issue involved access to American markets, the battleground was the Federal agency that adjudicates trade disputes, the International Trade Commission. The commission found in favor of AGIE and barred Sodick's machine tools from the United States. The ruling now goes to the President, who is unlikely to overturn it; if he takes no action for 60 days, it becomes final.
''We're disappointed and intend to seek reversal either in the Presidential review or the Federal circuit,'' said P. Jay Wilker, a lawyer for Sodick.
The two opponents are aggressive postwar companies, both with annual sales in the $200 million to $300 million range. Sodick was formed in the mid-1970's and AGIE in the mid-1950's.
The dispute involved AGIE's assertion that it had a 1975 United States patent covering parts of a special type of electrical-discharge machine tool that cuts the hardest metals and also flushes away debris. The market for such tools has been growing at about 20 percent a year and is now valued at $100 million annually. Sodick asserted that the technology covered in the patent had earlier origins and therefore it was free to make and import similar equipment without paying royalites to AGIE.
In one of the more unusual aspects of the case, and as the exchange between the companies grew more volatile, Sodick accused the Swiss company of selling the Soviet Union militarily valuable machine tools and transferring technology to make the equipment in a joint venture with the Dzerzhinsky Machine Tool Association of Kaunas, Lithuania.
This drew the Pentagon into the argument. ''We're still looking at it,'' said Lieut. Comdr. Edward H. Lundquist, spokesman for the Defense Department's Defense Technology Security Administration.
The case has also led to inter-agency strife between the Defense and Commerce Departments, other officials said, over the ability to control export of such machine tools. The Pentagon says they could be used for Soviet missile guidance, radar, jet engines, helicopters, naval drive systems and other military purposes. But the Commerce Department has given a green light to their export.
 
Strong Rejection From Zurich
The Zurich company strongly rejected the allegation that it was selling contraband to the Soviet Union. David M. Yarborough, president of AGIE USA, which imports the tools from Switzerland for sale in the United States, called the accusation ''a total red herring.''
Jean-Daniel Gerber, the Swiss Embassy's economics minister, said, ''We have absolutely no evidence that AGIE exported anything that it is not allowed to under Swiss export regulations.''
The Pentagon investigation has stirred concerns about Switzerland's informal commitments to enforce export controls as rigorously as the United States and other Western allies do. Neutral Switzerland is not a member of the trade alliance, but because of the informal commitments, it now gets unimpeded access to American technology as if it were a member.
 
The Toshiba Provision
Sodick's line of attack was based on the so-called Toshiba Provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act, under which any foreign supplier may be barred from the United States for two to five years if found selling restricted products to the Soviet Union.
The Toshiba Machine Company, a 51 percent owned subsidiary of the giant Toshiba Corporation, the Japanese electronics company, was punished by the 1988 legislation for selling embargoed machine-tools for propeller-silencing equipment to the Soviet Union in the mid-1980's.
While AGIE had originally threatened to have Sodick excluded from the market for patent violation, Sodick, matching punch for punch, threatened to have AGIE excluded for export violations.
In its petition, AGIE sought a ruling that its 1975 American patent related to the flushing system of the electrical-discharge machine tool - United States patent number 3,928,163 - was enforceable under Section 337 of the Trade Act of 1930.
 
Patent Ruled Enforceable
The six commissioners, under the chairmanship of Anne E. Brunsdale, unanimously affirmed the judgment last December by its chief administrative law judge, Janet Saxon, that the 1975 patent was indeed enforceable and that Sodick was an infringer.
But Sodick argued that the technology had earlier origins. It traced development to a Soviet inventor in Moscow who took out a patent there in 1949. The developer's name was V.V. Kupchenko; little is known about him. The Sodick brief also reprinted a 1965 article on the machine-tool flushing process in a Soviet technical journal written by E. Y. Grodzinsky and V.D. Proklova; little is known about them.
AGIE lawyers argued that the Swiss company had taken novel and inventive steps to advance the earlier knowledge, which under American law establishes a patent's enforceability.
While three other Japanese companies - Fanuc, Mitsubishi and Hitachi - recognize the AGIE patent claims and pay the Swiss company royalties, Sodick has refused.
''We believe those companies made a mistake because they were misled on the enforceability of the patent by AGIE,'' said Mr. Wilker, a lawyer for the Park Avenue law firm of Marks Murase & White, representing Sodick.
Today's decision could mean more work in Davidson, N.C., where AGIE operates a production subsidiary, the Elox Corporation. AGIE says it has pumped $20 million into Elox over the last two years.

HEADLINE: Hotel Chains' Woes: Just Too Many Rooms

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
Overbuilding, operating cost increases and stiffer competition among major hotel chains have turned the fast growth-and-earnings pace of the early 1980's into a crawl of consolidation and strains on profits, corporate executives and industry analysts say. Many experts believe that it will take the industry years to overcome most of the problems and that shakeouts could affect some familiar hotel names.
Fresh evidence of the widespread troubles of the once-booming American hotel industry came Wednesday when the Hilton Hotels Corporation announced it had rejected two lower-than-expected takeover proposals.
The Marriott Corporation, Ramada Inc., Holiday Inns and other large, well-established chains that dominate the broad middle market are struggling to improve their bottom lines by expanding into the one remaining bright area: the rapidly growing budget-priced sector. This has made operations like Marriott's Fairfield Inns and Ramada's Rodeway Inns hot properties. These no- and low-frills operations offer rooms that are increasingly attractive to business travelers whose employers are looking to cut costs. 
 
Financing Short for Some
But some smaller companies, like Prime Motor Inns (which also owns Howard Johnson's), lacking big financial bases, have been hurt by the savings and loan crisis and ''junk bond'' turmoil. Those problems have cut off much of the financing for those companies, leaving many of them unable to compete in an environment where expansion and refurbishment of older rooms are important for success.
''It will take several years to absorb the current oversupply'' in the overall hotel industry, said Thomas Lattin, a partner in Laventhol & Horwath, a Philadelphia accounting and consulting firm that specializes in the hospitality industry. ''The large chains that overbuilt in the middle market are now suffering.''
Just last September, for example, analysts were predicting that Hilton, one of the premier names in the industry, would fetch a record-setting price, as did other big chains sold in the last few years. Estimates then even said that a price of more than $6 billion, or about $130 a share, would be reasonable for a company whose stock had languished below $50 for months, but which appeared to be solidly profitable.
So when Barron Hilton, the chain's 62-year-old chairman and chief executive, put his venerable lodging company on the auction block in August, its shares soon skyrocketed to a high of $115.50. But after seven months passed with no one dangling offers that approached those prices, Mr. Hilton lamented yesterday that ''the investment climate for real estate and hotels'' was just not what it used to be. Hilton's stock closed at $50.625 yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, down almost $16 since the no-sale announcement.
It is not hard to see why even a Hilton is finding high bidders hard to come by. The average occupancy rate for the major full-service hotel chains has fallen to about 63 percent, below the 65 to 68 percent range that persisted for most of the 1980's. More important, the rate is well below the 70 percent level that analysts say the hotels need to break even and the rate is expected to fall further, to about 61 percent next year.
As occupancy rates have fallen, the discounts and special packages offered in slack periods have climbed, although in many cases the net price to the consumer has continued to rise. And a few cities, most notably New York and Los Angeles, seem to have defied the industry trend. But analysts say the problems will catch up with hotel operators in those cities in a couple of years.
 
Sharp Discounting
A survey by Laventhol last year of more than 9,000 hotels in nearly 60 cities found a median discount rate of 25.5 percent from posted room rates, called rack rates in the industry. Such discounting has made it hard for hotels to maintain profit margins and many have started to cut operating costs and to buy or otherwise expand into segments of the market with the lowest operating expenses and higher profit margins.
One result is that hotels lost an average of $429 on each room before taxes in 1988, but managed to cut the loss to $369 last year, another Laventhol study reported. Most of that reduction in losses, according to Mark Lomano, director of research at Laventhol, came from a slowdown in building and sharp cuts in operating expenses. For example, hotels are laying off room-service workers and replacing them with self-service food and beverage bars in the rooms.
The overbuilding of the 1980's, when the number of rooms grew by about 37.5 percent, with 774,00 rooms added in the decade, was a result of an early shortage of rooms, the prospect of continued appreciation of real estate values and easily obtainable financing. Analysts say the boom also anticipated continued tax write-offs, many of which were eliminated with the 1986 Tax Reform Act.
''Sixty-five percent of the hotel rooms built between 1981 and 1986 were built with the full intention that they would lose money,'' Mr. Lomano said. ''They were built as tax losses, but the tax laws changed.''
 
Artificial Boom
Although investors, syndicators and builders profited handsomely from this artificial boom in the early 1980's, the people now left holding the bag are the hotel owners who have no income and big losses that they cannot use to offset other income.
To increase business, most of the big chains are battling to broaden their lines to include lower-priced hotels and increase their name recognition among different segments of consumers. In the last three years, the big chains, from Ramada, with its acquisition of Rodeway Inns, to Marriott, with its development of Fairfield Inns, have entered the budget end of the market as their full-service operations become less profitable. In the last three years, 175,000 rooms have been added to the economy sector, representing nearly half of the hotel rooms added over that time.
This has turned economy hotels, where no-frills rooms cost about $30 a night, into one of the most hotly contested parts of the market, said Michael G. Mueller, an analyst with Montgomery Securities. Budget hotels are not new, but the recent success of companies like Motel 6 and Days Inns, the biggest of the budget hotel group, underscores that money is to be made at the low end.
A. Bradford Bryan, the president of Marriott's Courtyard, Fairfield Inns and Residence Inns, said his limited-service market, as opposed to the full-service Hyatts and Sheratons, could not grow fast enough to meet demand. He expects most of the growth in both demand and room supply to come in the limited-service sector.
''All the statistics I have seen indicate that industrywide demand is growing at 5 percent and rooms at 3 percent,'' Mr. Bryan said, ''but in the limited-service market demand is outstripping supply by at least 3 to 1.''
 
'The Weakest Segment'
Hit particularly hard are the older and well-established chains, like Ramada and Holiday Inn, that steadily raised room rates in the last 10 years and now find they have old hotels that need heavy capital investments to compete with new middle-market hotels.
''At this point the midmarket is the weakest segment and the only new product coming out in this market is the Marriott Courtyard,'' Mr. Lattin said.
But even Marriott, long regarded as one of the best-managed companies in the industry, has had recent troubles. It announced costly changes late last year that have already resulted in a $200 million write-off against earnings.
If the weakness in the broad middle market of the business was not bad enough, hotel companies, especially those that focused on growth through developing new properties, are finding that the industry is caught in a financing squeeze. The traditional sources of money for building, refurbishing or otherwise improving hotels are no longer interested in lending to the troubled industry. Except for the large, well-established companies, financing is increasingly hard to find.
 
Stocks Decline
The stock market has also been sharply re-evaluating hotel stocks over the last six months. Avner Arbel, a professor of finance in Cornell's School of Hotel Administration, said hotel stocks, which led the market a year ago, have lost one-third of their value over the last six months.
''The six-month loss went across the board for virtually all hotel companies,'' Professor Arbel said. ''The weak performance of the hotel industry as a whole represents an extreme turnaround.''
Most experts in the hospitality industry believe that the financing squeeze will continue the consolidation already under way by forcing small chains to sell out to larger chains or combine with each other. As for those chains that expanded by assuming large debt at the high rates of the early 1980's, they too will be forced out as debt service costs, falling revenues and the inability to get new loans squeeze their bottom lines.
''The changes and upheavals in terms of the marginal players being put out of business is in the long term healthier for the industry and certainly for the bigger players,'' said Richard Saltzman, a Merrill Lynch managing director and a highly regarded investment banker in the hotel industry.
''What you'll have is a sort of oligopoly,'' he added. ''The big players will go through a rough period but ultimately they will benefit significantly because they'll have the market to themselves.''

HEADLINE: Brady Going To Group of 7 Talks in April

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said today that he will go to Paris next month to meet with financial leaders of the Group of Seven industrial nations to discuss recent economic developments around the world.
Before appearing at a House Appropriations Committee hearing on the Treasury Department budget, Mr. Brady was asked about a report that he and Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, were planning to travel to Paris on April 7. ''Definitely,'' he replied. Asked further if the trip involved meetings with the leaders of the Group of Seven, he said, ''Yes.'' 
 
First Meeting Since Changes
The meeting of finance ministers and central bank presidents from the world's most powerful industrial democracies - the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy - would be the first such session since the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe.
An official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the United States had proposed the meeting to discuss how changes in Eastern Europe are affecting currency markets and the economic coordination efforts among the major powers.
A spokeswoman for the Federal Reserve declined to comment on any aspect of the meeting.
In recent weeks, the value of the dollar on world markets has climbed sharply while the Japanese yen and West German mark have declined.
A stronger dollar threatens to worsen America's already huge trade deficit since it would make United States products more expensive on overseas markets and imports less expensive for American consumers.
 
Moves to Stem Dollar's Rise
The Group of Seven countries have been coordinating efforts this week to sell dollars and buy Japanese yen and West German marks in an effort to dampen the dollar's climb. But so far the Government currency sales have had limited impact.
At their last meeting, on Sept. 23 in Washington, the Group of Seven's economic ministers also expressed concern about the dollar, which had been rising over the summer. They said a further strengthening could undercut efforts to promote a healthy global economy and they vowed fresh efforts to try to keep a lid on the dollar. On the next trading day after their meeting, they followed up that commitment by intervening strongly in the currency market, and the dollar fell almost four Japanese yen and more than five pfennigs against the West German mark.
Since then, the dollar has risen more than 6 percent against the yen Against the mark, the dollar is 10.5 percent lower than at the end of September, but it has been strengthening recently.
The mark shot up at the end of last year and early this year amid positive sentiment about the opening of the borders between East and West Germany. The yen's decline, meanwhile, has been laid to concerns about political and economic uncertainties in Japan.
In addition to the recent volatility in exchange markets, the Group of Seven officials are expected to address the question of the unification of West Germany and East Germany. Some economists fear this development could worsen inflationary problems in West Germany, especially if a proposal to exchange the West German currency for the East Germany currency on a one-to-one basis is carried out.
The April 7 meeting will be held just one month before a previously scheduled May 7 meeting of the Group of Seven's finance ministers in Washington.

HEADLINE: Freer Rein On A.T.&T. Is Proposed

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
In another step toward deregulating the long-distance telephone market, the Federal Communications Commission proposed yesterday giving the American Telephone and Telegraph Company a freer hand in cutting or raising rates and offering additional services for large business customers.
The proposal is expected to be approved by the agency after a period of public comment, review and revision. It was made after the agency tentatively concluded that there was now significant competition in the $55 billion market for interstate telephone services.
Under the proposal, A.T.&T. would have to give only one day's notice to change some prices and services for large businesses and would no longer have to supply cost information to the F.C.C. Current regulations require 14 or more days' notice and A.T.&T. must also produce varying amounts of cost data. 
 
Company Complains of Delays
A.T.&T. has protested in the past that its competitors have used the longer notice periods to file complaints blocking or delaying many price cuts and service improvements it wants to offer in the market for WATS lines and for dedicated long-distance lines used by the biggest customers. That market ranges in size from $5 billion to $7 billon a year. Current regulations on A.T.&T.'s residential and small-business services would be retained at least until 1992 under the proposal.
The F.C.C. also proposed giving A.T.&T. greater freedom to negotiate contracts with specific - usually very large - companies, while reducing the amount of information it must provide. Such information can be used by its competitors to price their own services just a little below that of A.T.&T.
 
Plan on Toll-Free Lines
The agency also proposed an eventual relaxation of regulation of A.T.&T.'s international and toll-free 800 services. But the agency linked deregulation of the 800 market to companies' being able to change long-distance companies without having to change their existing 800 numbers. Companies have often spent heavily on advertising to make their 800 numbers swell known and are reluctant to change numbers, but it is not technologically feasible for them to retain the number if they switch long-distance companies.
The F.C.C. does not expect local telephone companies to have the technology to allow such changes until 1992, said Alfred C. Sikes, the F.C.C.'s chairman.
The U S Sprint Communications Company had lobbied for just such an agency stance on 800 numbers. J. Richard Devlin, the general counsel and an executive vice president of the United Telecommunications subsidiary, said yesterday that while the company was concerned about loosened regulation on other A.T.&T. services for large businesses, it was pleased over all with the agency proposal because of the stance on 800 services. ''It's a statesman-like decision,'' he said.
A.T.&T.'s rivals, notably the MCI Communications Corporation and U S Sprint, have said that A.T.&T. remains too big and has retained too many advantages from its days as a monopoly to be allowed to compete on an equal regulatory footing.
Businesses with about $200 a month or more in long-distance services generally use WATS lines and may be affected if yesterday's proposals are adopted, said Joseph Nacchio, A.T.&T.'s vice president for business communication services.
 
'Competitive Battles'
Gary L. Phillips, a lawyer with the Common Carrier Bureau of the F.C.C. who presented the agency staff's recommendations at a public hearing today, said, ''What we have in effect today is competitive battles being waged at the F.C.C. instead of in the marketplace.''
Reducing the notice period to one day would mean that A.T.&T.'s price and service changes would be argued after they have gone into effect and A.T.&T.'s competitors would be prevented from using the Federal agency to create delays, Mr. Phillips said. The F.C.C. does not plan to allow competitors to try frequently to delay A.T.&T.'s moves by filing complaints the same day that A.T.&T. submits its price or service change, he said.
Among the A.T.&T. business services delayed by regulatory action have been so-called software-defined networks, which use computers combined with regular long-distance A.T.&T. facilities to mimic a private phone system custom-built for a company.
Consumer groups have expressed concerns that increasing A.T.&T.'s ability to reach different contracts with different companies will allow the company to discriminate in its pricing.
A.T.&T. has about 66 percent of the long-distance market, while MCI has about 12 percent and U S Sprint 9 percent.
The F.C.C. also asked today for public comment on whether it should declare an end to A.T.&T.'s designation a decade ago as the ''dominant'' long-distance carrier. This designation has been accompanied by regulations that restrict to certain ranges any changes in A.T.&T.'s prices for specific services. Its elimination would revolutionize regulation of the telephone industry.
The F.C.C. staff did not make any recommendation concerning the designation, and few industry or agency officials expect it to be adopted in the near future.
 
A Period for Comment
The F.C.C. declared that it would allow 60 days for public comment after the proposals are published in final form in a few weeks. A 30-day period would follow for companies and individuals to file replies to the comments, after which the F.C.C. is scheduled to vote on the proposals.
Mr. Sikes said in an interview after the hearing that he expected the commission to reach a final decision by the end of this year. He said he did not know when the proposals might take effect.
Mr. Nacchio of A.T.&T. said that if carried out, the F.C.C.'s proposals would enable the company to offer new services more quickly. He said the new rules would let A.T.&T. cut prices because reduced regulation means lower compliance costs and less forgone revenues from services whose introduction is delayed.
Any price reductions, which MCI and U S Sprint would be under pressure to match, might encourage some customers to remain on the nation's main telephone network instead of building their own systems. But the main significance of today's F.C.C. actions lay in the agency's taking the stance that significant competition has arrived in the long-distance market and that regulation should accordingly be reduced, he said.
Today's proposals represent the most important milestone in the deregulation of the long-distance telephone market since last July, when the F.C.C. abandoned limiting A.T.&T.'s profits to a fixed percentage of its investment in plant and equipment in favor of limiting price changes to narrow ranges pegged to the rate of inflation. The new method is intended to give A.T.&T. an incentive to improve productivity by allowing it to keep the gains from cost reductions.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The Denial Of the Obvious

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
STEPHEN POTTER, the author of ''Gamesmanship'' and ''One-Upmanship,'' said an economist has two basic ploys. The first, labeled Economic Approach A, is to cloak the obvious in ''a little wild incomprehensibility.'' Thus, Mr. Potter's model economist, named Regil, would tell listeners that if they wanted to influence ''the general liquidity situation of banks and public,'' they had better not forget that the central bank's ''discretionary action on the cash basis took the shape of dealings in Treasury bills, the market rate of discount on which could and did fluctuate.''
In the opposite direction is Economic Approach B, the more classical ploy, which requires the economist to practice ''the stupefaction of the exhaustingly clear.'' For instance, in a crisis, the model economist might say: ''Unless something happens to change the state of demand, more will be bought at any given price than at any higher price.'' 
In recent years, however, we have witnessed the emergence of what might be called Economic Approach C, which may be designated ''the denial of the obvious.'' Thus, the economist, employing Ploy C, may deny that the United States budget deficit is too big and deny that it has anything to do with the trade deficit. Indeed, he may also deny that the heavy inflow of foreign capital is creating any future problems for the United States.
The denial-school members reject evidence that American productivity and living standards have lagged as a result of inadequate capital formation, and will lag further if foreign capital inflow slackens and rising interest rates, aimed at preventing the outflow of capital, cut further into domestic spending on new plant and equipment, and on research and development.
They may deny the national debt problem, private as well as public, pushing back into their unconscious the multibillion-dollar failures of savings and loan institutions and the growing problems of many commercial banks and heavily leveraged corporations as evidence of excessive debt.
Tying these problems together - in particular the foreign deficit and slow productivity growth -is the inadequacy of saving relative to what individuals, businesses and politicians want to spend. Here is the heart of the nation's foreign trade and overall payments problem: If any country invests more than it saves and consumes more than it produces, the excess must be covered by an inflow of foreign savings.
Can monetary policy extricate the nation from its foreign economic troubles? Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, recently testified that the central bank could address either the stabilization of domestic prices or exchange rates but could not achieve both objectives simultaneously. ''Monetary policy alone,'' he said, ''is not readily capable of addressing today's large current account deficit, which is symptomatic of underlying imbalances among saving, spending and production within the U.S. economy.'' Cutting the Federal deficit, he added, was a better way of raising domestic saving and freeing additional resources for productive investment. But some economists, including strange bedfellows from the Keynesian left and the supply-side right, now insist that the budget deficit does not matter and that there is no saving problem, once savings are correctly defined. The most prominent economist taking that line is Prof. Robert Eisner of Northwestern University, who represents the Keynesian left. He would adjust the budget deficit for the effect of inflation on the public debt, set up a capital budget and increase domestic saving by including in the category outlays on public goods, like roads and education.
All of this, however, is irrelevant to the issues of the relationship of national savings to the foreign deficit or domestic growth. As Charles L. Schultze of the Brookings Institution observes: ''Making the inflation adjustment does not change the estimate of national saving one iota. If the inflation adjustment is subtracted from the deficit because it is not truly income to bondholders, then current statistics overstate not only the budget deficit but also the income and the saving of those same bondholders. The Eisner adjustment simply reallocates national saving among its components: less private saving, less government dissaving, with no net effect on national saving itself.''
And if a Federal capital budget were used to raise the level of national saving, it would raise the level of national investment by the same amount, and hence not change the existing gap between domestic saving and national investment.
Such definitional arguments can be used, however, to advance their proponents' policy objectives: in the case of the Keynesian left, to justify stronger aggregate demand to push the economy faster and cut unemployment, or, in the case of the supply-side right, to justify continued opposition to any tax increases to close the Federal budget gap.
But such ploys may encourage public disdain for what the 19th-century critic, Thomas Carlyle, called ''the dismal science'' and his contemporary, Matthew Arnold, called ''the plonking science'' -the science of the utterly obvious, or, sometimes, the science that denies the utterly obvious.

HEADLINE: 6 Environmental Issues In Exxon Proxy Report

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
The proxy statement issued by the Exxon Corporation yesterday includes six shareholder proposals addressing environmental concerns, which indicates that the Securities and Exchange Commission approved their inclusion.
That means that the management of the company, already beleaguered by bad publicity surrounding some large oil leaks in recent months, will face a debate over its corporate environmental policy at its annual meeting April 25 in Houston.
At the meeting a year ago, some stockholders angrily asked questions about the company's Valdez oil spill off the coast of Alaska. But this year formal votes will be held on the resolutions, including those inspired by the Valdez Principles, a 10-point agenda that urges corporations in general to take steps like reporting annually on their environmental activities. 
 
Terms of Other Proposals
The other proposals call on Exxon to take many steps, ranging from limiting emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases to establishing an environmental committee on its board.
The company said it opposes all six shareholder proposals. Its proxy statement gives several reasons, one of which is that the board thinks some of the resolutions do not recognize the need to ''balance the environment with important adequate energy resources and stable, healthy economies.''
The company also said it was preparing a report on its ''past and continuing efforts on environmental protection, health and safety.''
Even supporters say they doubt the proposals will pass.
 
A Trend Seen Forming
Several experts called environmental proposals the trend of the future and the start of a campaign that will equal in fervor the one that compelled many institutions, as a protest against apartheid, to sell shares in companies that operated in South Africa.
Lewis Gilbert, long a stockholder advocate, said he would attend the meeting and vote for the proposals. ''I think a great thing has happened,'' he continued. ''A lot of institutional holders have indicated they will vote for the proposals.'' He added that the proposals might persuade many more large pension funds and other institutional holders to ask questions.
''I say it is their fiduciary duty,'' he said, ''and not many of their representatives have been coming to annual meetings. We support Tim Smith.''
 
Institutional Support Seen
Timothy Smith, executive director of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, confirmed that a large number of institutions heavily invested in Exxon stock, like the New York City pension funds and the California state retirement system, would vote in favor of at least some of the environmental proposals on the proxy statement now in the mail to shareholders.
Mr. Smith said that 75 percent of the 25 companies he had asked to approve the Valdez Principles had agreed to do so. He said those companies included Chevron, Texaco, Mobil and Amoco, all oil companies; Union Pacific, a holding company; Waste Management; Aetna, the insurance company, and McDonald's, the fast-food chain.
Dr. James Post, professor at the Boston University School of Management and an expert on environmental problems, called the proposals ''very reasonable and modest requests.''
He added: ''I think Exxon's initial positions opposing the proxy proposals are without merit. The attitude casts doubt about the integrity of Exxon's management system.''
 
Outside Audit Group Suggested
Professor Post yesterday suggested the need for an external audit commission. He is a member of such a commission organized in 1981 by former Senator Edmund S. Muskie to monitor Nestle S.A.'s infant formula, about which there were health difficulties in developing countries some years ago.
''It is called the Nestle Infant Formula Audit Commission,'' Professor Post said. ''It meets quarterly or more often to provide continuing oversight by an outside group. This includes investigating complaints and doing field investigations.''

HEADLINE: A.T.&T. Card Offer Seen

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company is expected to offer Mastercard and Visa credit cards in an effort to increase revenues, industry analysts said this week.
The company has been studying such a move for some time. Analysts said A.T.&T. would probably offer the cards this month to many if not all of the 40 million holders of its A.T.&T. phone credit cards.
A company spokesman, Walter Murphy, declined to comment on A.T.&T.'s plans for charge cards. But last year the company confirmed that it was studying such a move. ''We've looked at ways to advance the A.T.&T. card,'' Mr. Murphy said on Wednesday.
The new cards would be used for purchases at stores, restaurants, hotels and other retail locations, unlike A.T.&T.'s phone cards, which can be used only for long-distance calls.
Several industry sources said A.T.&T. might consider establishing its own retail card eventually but would use its initial offering of Visa and Mastercard as a test.
Analysts said A.T.&T. had contracted with Total Systems Services, a subsidiary of the Synovus Financial Corporation, a Columbus, Ga., bank, to serve as the initial data processor for the cards.
A.T.&T. plans to attract customers by waiving fees for the card in the first year and charging interest rates of 14 percent to 15 percent, well below prevailing rates on other cards, industry sources said.

HEADLINE: More Defaults Are Predicted

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
A panel of credit experts told Congress today to expect an increase in the number of defaults by debt-burdened corporations in the early 1990's. But they said there was little that the Federal Government should do to reverse the trend. 
''Further policy action may make the situation worse, rather than better,'' said David A. Wyss, senior vice president of DRI/McGraw Hill, an economic forecasting company based in Lexington, Mass.
 
The hearing was called by
Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of a House finance subcommittee, to examine the ''junk bond'' market of high-yield securities.
Thomas J. McGuire, an executive vice president of Moody's Investors Service, a credit-rating company, said the default rate of speculative-grade issues had risen to 5.4 percent.
He said 51 companies defaulted on a total debt of nearly $12 billion last year.
''The outlook - given the increase in lower-rated issuers and the potentially unfavorable economic environment - is for still higher levels of defaults in the early 1990's,'' he said.
Mr. Wyss said his company expected defaults to peak this year at 8.9 percent and to drop back to an average of 3.7 percent over the next five years.

HEADLINE: Sales Up For Many Retailers

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Several big specialty retailers and department store chains yesterday reported strong February sales growth as demand heated up for spring apparel.
The results from some of the nation's largest retailers indicated consumer interest in shopping had not cooled despite a lukewarm economy.
K Mart, the mass merchandiser, said its February sales rose 14.7 percent, while the Limited Inc., the nation's largest specialty apparel retailer, reported a 21 percent gain in sales for the month, and Gap Inc., another nationwide apparel chain, said its sales surged 29 percent.
 
'Retailing Is Not Dead'
''Certainly retailing is not dead,'' said Karen Sack, an analyst at the Standard & Poor's Corporation in New York. 
Linda R. Morris of the PNC Financial Corporation in Philadelphia said the February figures ''signal that the consumer is continuing to spend.'' She added, ''Although it's not a robust retail environment, it certainly bodes well for a decent year.''
Among the retailers reporting yesterday were department store groups, specialty clothing chains, discounters and mass merchandisers.
Other national chains reported their February results a week ago, including the nation's largest general merchandiser, Sears, Roebuck & Company; Wal-Mart Stores Inc.; the J. C. Penney Company, and others. Variations in fiscal-year calendars have caused retailers to have differing sales-reporting schedules.
Last week's reports - with the exception of the ones from Sears and Montgomery Ward & Company -showed solid sales increases. Sears had virtually flat sales in February and Ward's were up 1.7 percent. In contrast, Wal-Mart sales surged 33 percent from a year earlier, and J. C. Penney posted an 8.1 percent gain.
 
Sales Better Than Expected
Thomas Tashjian, an analyst at Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles, said sales generally were better than expected across the board in February.
Some retailers, he said, benefited this year from a seasonal pickup in shopping because there was an additional week in the winter period.
Retailers that specialize in apparel continued to outrun general merchants in February as they did last year. In a time of sluggish economic growth, purchases of expensive items, like furniture and home appliances, are typically the first things to be sacrificed.
Sales at the Limited rose to $318.2 million in the four weeks ended March 3 from $263.8 million last year. Sales at stores open a year or longer were up 16 percent.
Results at stores open at least a year, called same-store sales, are considered the best reflection of a retailer's performance.
Based in Columbus, Ohio, the Limited operates its flagship stores plus Victoria's Secret, Abercrombie & Fitch, Lane Bryant and others.
At the Gap, sales surged to $103 million, from $80 million a year earlier. Same-store sales rose 20 percent.
K Mart said its overall results benefited from good gains in women's, men's and children's clothing lines. Sales for the four weeks ended Feb. 28 grew to $1.9 billion, from $1.66 billion a year earlier. Same-store sales were up 4.4 percent. The retailer, second in 1989 sales volume behind Sears, also owns the Waldenbooks bookstore chain, Pay Less Drug Stores and other chains.
K mart recently said it was speeding up plans to open additional stores and refurbish others as it tries to capitalize on the weakness at Sears and to stay ahead of its fast-growing rival, Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart is widely considered a powerful contender for the No. 1 ranking in terms of annual merchandise sales revenue in the United States. Currently, it is No. 3.
Several top retailers do not report their sales monthly, including the Campeau Corporation units, Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores; R.H. Macy & Co., and Batus Inc., owner of Marshall Field & Company and Saks Fifth Avenue.
Here are the retailers that reported their domestic sales yesterday for February, the first month of their fiscal years:
 
K Mart Corp.: Four weeks ended Feb. 28: $1.9 billion, up 14.7 percent from $1.66 billion.
Dayton Hudson Corp.: Four weeks ended March 3: $821 million, up 13.1 percent from $725 million. May Department Stores Co.:
Four weeks ended March 3: $596.1 million, up 10.6 percent from $538.8 million.
Limited Inc.: Four weeks ended March 3: $318.2 million, up 21 percent from $263.8 million.
Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc.: Four weeks ended March 3: $176.8 million, up 3.1 percent from $170.8 million. First 7 months: $1.82 billion, up 5.7 percent from $1.72 billion.

HEADLINE: Stocks Up in Light Trading As Dow Gains 26.58 Points

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks advanced in light trading yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 26.58 points, to 2,696.17.
Except for Monday and Wednesday, when the Dow fell slightly, the bellwether index has climbed every day for two weeks, tacking on 131.98 points.
Michael Metz, chief market analyst for Oppenheimer & Company, remarked: ''This really is symptomatic of a sold-out market where lots of major participants keep looking for bargains. And where the market refuses to cooperate by giving ground, these participants get anxious about missing the market and become more aggressive in their buying.'' 
''The message,'' he said, ''is that just about all the known negatives on interest rates, inflation and the uncertain economic outlook have already been discounted.''
''You haven't had any decent good news to spark this rally,'' he said. ''What you have is basically a situation where nobody owns any stock.''
Other than the Dow industrials, most other key indicators rose only a few points, with the Dow transportation index ahead 1.96, to 1,137.27, the Dow utilities rising 1.58, to 221.51, and the S.&P. 500 up 3.32, to 340.27.
 
Volume at 170.9 Million Shares
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange rose to 170.9 million shares, from 163.6 million the day before, with 983 issues rising and 507 declining.
Coca-Cola, one Dow stock, rose 1, to 72 3/8, in heavy trading. In a move to take on Pepsi more aggressively with a sweeter drink than Coke Classic, the company said on Wednesday that it would soon begin test-marketing Coke II, the old ''New Coke'' renamed.
Other Dow stocks moving higher included 3M, up 1 3/8, to 82 5/8; Procter & Gamble, up 1 5/8, to 65; USX, up 1, to 36 5/8, and Woolworth, up 1 1/2, to 62 5/8. After Carl C. Icahn, the Manhattan investor, said he would seek support to distribute to investors most of USX's steel operations, Standard & Poor's affirmed the debt ratings of USX's oil and steel business.
Genentech, the West Coast health-care company, fell 1 1/8, to 26 1/8, on volume of 1.1 million shares, before the Big Board halted trading late in the day, pending an announcement. Genentech announced that an Italian study of its blood-clot-dissolving drug and of another made by Hoechst A.G. had been ''inconclusive'' in deciding which was better, although it said both were ''equally effective in saving lives'' of heart-attack patients.
Among aircraft, electronics, computer and technology stocks, Boeing rose 1, to 67 1/2; McDonnell Douglas 1 3/8, to 56 5/8; Martin-Marietta 2, to 42 3/4; Motorola 2 1/8, to 64 3/8; I.B.M. 1 1/2, to 107; Digital Equipment 2 3/8, to 76 7/8; Apple Computer 1 3/8, to 36 3/4; Compaq 3 5/8, to 95 7/8, Hewlett-Packard 1 1/8, to 44 3/4; Computer Associates 1 1/8, to 14 1/8, and Microsoft 3 1/2, to 106 1/4.
Doug van Dorsten, a computer analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton, issued a ''buy'' recommendation on Compaq. Wendy Abramowitz, an analyst with Argus Research, told Reuters a week ago that analysts expected Microsoft to introduce several new software products this year.
Motorola advanced in the wake of reports on the Financial News Network that Hitachi, the Japanese electronics company, might buy a piece of Motorola. Traders seemed skeptical.
Buttressed by strong February sales reports from several retailing companies, J.C. Penney rose 1 1/8, to 68 7/8; May 1 1/2, to 48 7/8; Dayton Hudson 1 3/8, to 66 5/8; Gap 1 3/4, to 59 1/4; Limited 1 3/4, to 39 3/4; Melville 1 3/4, to 48 5/8; Toys ''R'' Us 1 5/8, to 41 5/8.
Bard slid 3 1/8, or 23 percent, to 13 5/8, with 3.35 million shares traded. Hilton, the most active issue on the Big Board, plunged 10 3/8, to 50 5/8, on 7.79 million shares after Hilton decided not to sell the company.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Higher As Gold Prices Slip in U.S.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished mostly higher yesterday in lackluster trading worldwide.
Gold prices slipped in New York after finishing mixed overseas. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold settled at $400 an ounce, off 20 cents from Wednesday. The Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $399.80 an ounce, down 80 cents. 
''The day never really got started,'' said Bob Morrissey, a senior trader with the Bank of Boston in New York. ''It was almost like a holiday market.''
Traders said trading was dampened by the threat of central bank intervention. Dealers were surprised on Wednesday when a group of central banks aggressively and repeatedly sold dollars to keep the currency from rising.
The Federal Reserve was believed to have entered the market more than once yesterday to sell dollars against the yen, but the action was modest compared with the previous session, traders said.
Still, sentiment toward the dollar remains very bullish.
''More and more people are seeing that the economy is not doing as badly as original expectations, so there should be no real easing of interest rates,'' Mr. Morrissey said.
Higher interest rates generally support the dollar by enhancing the value of fixed-income securities. Foreign investors, typically major purchasers of instruments like United States Government bonds, need dollars to make their investments.
Further evidence about the economy will come this morning, when the Labor Department issues its unemployment report for February. The consensus is for non-farm payrolls to show an increase of about 240,000 jobs.
Separately, officials confirmed that finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrialized countries will meet in early April in Paris, where they are expected to discuss global currency exchange rates.
In New York, the dollar finished at 151.09 yen, up from 150.35 yen on Wednesday. It also gained against the pound, which ended at $1.6385, cheaper than $1.6465 on Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's late rates, included: 1.7008 West German marks, up from 1.6982; 1.5080 Swiss francs, up from 1.4995; 5.7495 French francs, up from 5.7400; 1,255.25 Italian lire, up from 1,252.75, and 1.1807 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1831.
Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery finished at $5.112 an ounce, down from $5.122 on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: For Younger and Older, Workplace Day Care

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
The Stride Rite Corporation is bridging the generations in the heart of its workplace with a day care center where working parents can bring not just their preschoolers but also their aging relatives.
While many companies offer child care, Stride Rite is the first to bring together in one location those under 6 and those over 60 whose biggest problem is not personal health but filling lonely days with a sense of purpose.
It is easy to forget that there are bigger social policy questions here while watching 79-year-old Eva DaRosa sharing peanut butter crackers with preschoolers or hearing 85-year-old Geraldine Keane spinning a story about dinosaurs that rivets the attention of 4-year-olds.
But the center is indeed dealing with broader questions: How can businesses attract and keep a qualified work force? How should the nation care for its oldest and youngest citizens?
''By the year 2000, almost half the employees in the work force will be providing child care, elder care or both,'' said Dr. Michael Creedon, a former professor of gerontology at the University of Bridgeport who is now director of corporate programs at the National Council on the Aging in Washington. ''We can expect more companies already providing child care to convert to intergenerational day care in order to help their employees.'' 
The companies also gain, in increased productivity and decreased turnover in workers. Dr. Creedon said a number of studies showed that employees tended to lose five days a year on average because of problems providing care for a family member. Such problems are also likely to cause workers to quit their jobs, come to work late or use the telephone excessively for personal reasons.
The recently opened Intergenerational Day Care Center here in Stride Rite's headquarters fulfills a vision of Arnold Hiatt, the company's 62-year-old board chairman, who had read about working parents spending frantic hours each day coordinating care for family members both old and young.
''I'm in business trying to orchestrate workers, materials, consumers and markets and to bring it all together,'' Mr. Hiatt said. ''Why not a similar business approach to a societal problem? There are risks involved in engaging two vulnerable populations and no certainty of success. But they are nice risks.''
 
Track Record as Innovator
Stride Rite, a leading footwear manufacturer, already had a track record as an innovator. In 1971 it became the first corporation to open an on-site child care center. It still operates that center, at its plant in nearby Roxbury, one of the city's most economically depressed neighborhoods.
To develop the new center, Mr. Hiatt enlisted the help of Wheelock College, a Boston-based school specializing in child care and family studies, and Somerville/Cambridge Elder Services, a local nonprofit agency providing help to the elderly.
The partners were determined that the center not have the look and especially not the antiseptic smell of an institution, and it does not. The aroma of chicken soup wafts from the kitchen at noon. And sometimes at snack time, there is the tempting smell of pretzels baked by Mrs. DaRosa and Mrs. Keane. (The children prefer sticks they can wave to the twisted variety.) When the center is in full operation, it will accommodate 55 children, who can range in age from 18 months old to 6 years, and 24 older adults. It will be open not only to relatives of employees but also to people in the community.
''It is more than likely that one of Stride Rite's 500 employees one day will enroll both a child and a parent at the center,'' said Karen Leibold, director of work and family programs for Stride Rite.
 
Benefits Are Assessed
''If we look ahead, we see a chance for the two generations to get to know each other,'' Ms. Leibold said. ''The elders will find and experience again what it is like to be a contributing member to the community.''
Since February the children have been coming to the center, which has a gym and rooms filled with a dream world of stuffed animals and toys.
The children, in groups labeled ''peanuts,'' ''Muppets,'' ''rainbows'' and ''eagles,'' depending on age, have already made an impact on the neighborhood. On a typical afternoon walk, they stop at the Hotel Marriott next door and induce the bell captain to let them try on his plumed hat. They then visit the florist shop and Legal's Seafoods to see the lobster tank, returning home with day-old flowers and bags of oyster crackers.
The section for older adults opened two weeks ago with no formal ceremony except for the display of a finger-painted banner saying, ''Welcome Eva and Gerry.''
Mrs. DaRosa is dropped off at the center by her 48-year-old daughter, Maria, who works across the street at the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority.
 
Mother's Idle Hours Filled
The center, open from 8 A.M. to 5:30 P.M., now fills her mother's idle hours, Maria said, and she rides home animatedly talking about the day's events. The adults have their own retreat at the center, a cozy area of couches, chairs and piles of flowered chintz pillows that Mrs. DaRosa calls ''the porch.'' Last Monday, the program was built around the history of Cape Verde, the former Portuguese colony off the West African coast from which the DaRosa family came generations ago. Happily, Mrs. DaRosa danced a Mazuaka she learned in her younger years.
Mrs. Keane learned about the care center from her daughter, Nancy Kruger, vice president of training and development at the Greater Boston Y.M.C.A. Ms. Kruger, in turn, heard about it at a conference on child care.
Mrs. Keane, a former teacher, usually arrives with a book in hand. She gets herself to the center and home by taxi. She has volunteered to use the word-processor that will be installed so that the participants can help prepare a newsletter about the center.
Next week, the two widows expect to be joined by 74-year-old Josephine Campanelli, whose granddaughter, Ronna, is a real estate leasing assistant at Stride Rite.
Ms. Leibold said the company had expected enrollment of elders to be slow. ''No one wanted to be the first through the door, and many wanted to see how the center looked and what food was served,'' she said.
For the moment, the adults and the children meet only at meals and occasionally take outdoor walks together, but a few of the youngsters now come looking for Mrs. Keane to read.
 
Patient View of Relationships
''We realize you cannot push children and elders together,'' Ms. Leibold said. ''You have to provide the opportunity for the relationships to develop. It cannot be forced.''
An early childhood teacher, Ms. Leibold came to Stride Rite seven years ago to direct its children's center. Her staff of 25 full- and part-time members includes teachers with advanced degrees as well as a professional dancer, a musician, social workers and recreational therapists. Ultimately there will be a nurse, but the center is not designed to care for older adults with debilitating illness.
Stride Rite hopes other companies will emulate the care center. ''My only reservation,'' Dr. Creedon said, ''is we not forget that an intergenerational center only meets the needs of some elders. It does not serve those now in nursing homes, confined to bed at home or severely incapacitated.
''For them, we still need a broad array of other responses such as flexible work schedules and more generous leave-of-absence policies for employees who are care-givers.''
Stride Rite spent $700,000 to convert 8,500 square feet of its fourth-floor headquarters for the center.
The company will subsidize the center's operating expenses, estimated to be $600,000 a year. The center estimates that it costs $150 a week to take care of a preschooler, $170 for a toddler and $140 for an elder.
 
Meeting the Center's Expenses
Stride Rite employees pay fees of $20 to $130 a week for the children, depending on family income, and $85 a week for the older adults. The balance comes from a foundation set up by the company. Outsiders pay full costs, with some low-income families aided by state subsidies. The company is prepared to make up the difference between what the fees bring and the center's expenses with money from the company's foundation.
Although Mr. Hiatt is proud of his company's program, he expressed serious misgivings about whether it will be cited as evidence that the business sector has the resources to take responsibility for the nation's preschoolers, insisting that this remains a government responsibility. ''Companies can be innovative and experiment but I don't believe corporate day care answers the need of intervening in the lives of 20 million children under 5,'' he said.
And he noted that such fringe benefits for employees have historically been one of the first things to go when companies retrench in difficult economic times.
''If business turned down for a few years, I'd probably get a lot of flak about my mishigas,'' he said, using the Yiddish word for foolishness.
But such practical considerations have not dimmed his dream of what the center can be:
''Here we do not share the same names,'' he said, ''but we have a chance to interact that is as old as the family of man.''

On the Front Line in Guerrilla War: Power Pylons

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, March 4

 BODY:
Just off the Pan-American Highway, a desert lot here serves as a drive-in showroom for Peru's latest fashion in power pylons - pillboxes, electric fences and ''concrete pants.''
''The concrete pants can withstand a 15-pound dynamite charge,'' Tomas Espinola Carranza, director of transmission for the state electric company, said as he braked his station wagon in the dust by a tower. Each of four supports was encased in a steel-reinforced concrete legging.
Fortifying pylons has become a new industrial art in Peru, where Marxist guerrillas blew up 1,196 of the nation's 5,000 high-voltage transmission towers in the 1980's. Plagued with similar terrorism, power company engineers from El Salvador and Colombia have recently visited the desert lot here to exchange ideas and inventions with their Peruvian counterparts. 
For Peru's far-left Shining Path guerrillas, cutting electric power is an important propaganda tactic in this capital of eight million. Power outages have become so predictable that some factory managers tell their workers to stay home on dates commemorated by Shining Path. $15 Billion in Losses Blackouts accounted for a large share of the $15 billion in economic losses attributed to political violence in Peru from 1980 to 1988, according to a recent study by Peru's Congress. In the 1980's, the Electroperu utility lost $110 million in energy sales, repair costs and fuel purchases to run thermal generating plants.
''Shining Path uses the blackouts selectively to show that the Government is powerless,'' said a Western diplomat who has studied the terror tactic. Over one year ending last July, the blackouts were regularly spaced every 40 to 50 days, he said.
A series of attacks around the time of Peru's city elections in November led to 45 days of power rationing here that ended Jan. 15. With the first round of Peru's presidential election scheduled for April 8, the Shining Path guerrillas, who are calling for a boycott of the election, are expected to topple more towers along the thinly defended Andean tranmission lines.
''Forget about the blackouts - immediate delivery,'' promised a recent newspaper advertisement for Lima's new status symbol, an auxiliary diesel generator.
 
Adapting to Blackouts
In Lima, people have seemingly adapted to the blackouts that hit neighborhoods without warning. Many people avoid elevators for fear of getting trapped for hours. Service station attendants have learned how to pump gasoline manually, and drivers have learned to thread through intersections jammed by extinguished traffic lights.
And at the power company, engineers are learning how to fortify 30-ton, 165-foot transmission towers.
''The problem gets worse every day,'' said Col. Angel Valdivia, a retired army colonel who is Electroperu's chief of security. Indeed, company statistics show that attacks on power pylons doubled last year, from 163 in 1988 to 335 in 1989.
The challenge is to modify Peru's graceful Italian-made pylons, which were designed 30 years ago when their worst imaginable enemies were winter storms in the Italian Alps.
In addition to encasing pylon legs in 15-foot-high concrete casts, Peruvian engineers have experimented with enclosing the four legs in a square, 15-foot-high pillbox with broken glass embedded in the concrete walls.
 
Electrified Wires Used
In another tactic, engineers drop from a tower a cable carrying 23,000 volts to electrify three wires strung around the base. To keep cows, llamas and people away, the pylon is then surrounded with a perimeter of concertina wire.
To convert local peasants into energy guards, engineers are also running lines from towers to remote mountain villages.
''Peasants would always say, 'The towers go through here, but I don't have any electricity,' '' said Anibal Tomecich Cordova, the utility's general manager.
In another tactic, Peru's Energy Police, a division of the National Police, have surrounded 600 Andean towers with anti-personnel mines. To protect a mountain line that runs far from roads, the army is drawing up plans to build a series of helicopter landing pads.
Worried about Shining Path's alliance with Andean coca leaf growers, the United States this year is to give Peru $36 million, the first substantial American military aid seen here in 20 years.
Citing aid that the United States gives El Salvador to keep electricity flowing there, Peruvian officials hope that the United States will consider helping Electroperu.
''We don't even have a single helicopter,'' said Mr. Tomecich, noting that his lines cross mountain passes as high as 16,500 feet. ''We need helicopters, all-terrain vehicles and a satellite communications system. The terrorists would just blow up microwave dishes.''

HEADLINE: Haitians Take to the Streets Again To Call for Military Ruler's Ouster

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, March 9

 BODY:
Demonstrations aimed at bringing down this country's military ruler continued for the fifth day today as protesters marched and built flaming barricades to block main roads.
The police used gunfire, truncheons and tear gas to break up some of the protests, and at least three young people were reported wounded in the capital. Most stores and offices in the capital were shuttered, and schools across Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, were closed. 
Lieut. Gen. Prosper Avril, who came to power in a coup 18 months ago, was believed to be meeting with aides in the presidential palace. He issued no statements as the crisis deepened. Haitians who follow politics and several foreign diplomats said reports on Thursday that General Avril's wife had fled Haiti were incorrect.
 
Widespread Disapproval
Most of the country's leading political and business groups have called on the 52-year-old general to resign, saying they no longer believe his promises to lead the country to democracy. General Avril has also been accused of mismanaging the economy, allowing soldiers to skim profits from Government agencies and failing to end months of robberies and killings.
Ordinary Haitians are usually cautious in criticizing their presidents, but their restraint seemed to have vanished today. ''We need another president,'' a gasoline station attendant said. ''Avril has to go.''
''It looks bad,'' a civil servant said. ''It is not a minority against him. It is people in many towns.''
In an interview on Wednesday, General Avril told an independent Haitian television reporter that he was prepared to step down if that was ''the will of the people.'' But he added, ''If I step down hurriedly it will create a lot of turmoil.''
 
Opposition Alerts Army
On Thursday, the most violent day of demonstrations so far, 3 people, including a police officer, were killed and at least 12 were wounded.
An informal coalition of 11 political groups urged the armed forces today to prepare for General Avril's departure and to ''take all necessary measures for a smooth transition.''
Political and business leaders are urging that General Avril be replaced as President by Gabriel Volcy, the Vice President of the Supreme Court. They have suggested that the judge govern in consultation with a council of about a dozen members chosen from all sectors of Haiti, including the military.
In January, after the unexplained killing of an army colonel, General Avril abruptly declared a state of siege in which dozens of civilian political leaders were arrested and beaten. Seven were forced into exile. Under pressure from the United States and other aid donors, General Avril lifted the state of siege after nine days. But public confidence, never firmly established, was destroyed. One by one, the political leaders announced their refusal to take part in elections promised this year by General Avril.

HEADLINE: Europe Giving Thatcher Bad Press on Germany

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, March 9

 BODY:
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is being described by influential British and West German newspapers these days as the skunk at the garden party of German unity.
But her public position on the issue is quite close to that of the United States and France, and mirrors some of the Soviet Union's concerns.
This is important because East and West Germany plan to negotiate the terms of unification, after elections in East Germany on March 18, with the four countries, the Allied powers of World War II.
Yet Timothy Garton Ash, the foreign editor of The Spectator magazine, wrote not long ago that in recent travels through both Germanys, he could find only one person who had a good word for the British Prime Minister - Egon Krenz, the deposed and now unemployed Communist Party leader who briefly succeeded Erich Honecker last October. 
 
Criticized by Schmidt
The former West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt described Mrs. Thatcher last week as the only outstanding personality among European leaders, but said that she no longer had enough respect from her colleagues to lead them or the Germans into the European future. ''She has gone too far,'' he said.
The weekly newspaper he now publishes, Die Zeit, reported last week that Mrs. Thatcher was against German unification because she was a ''little Englander,'' a British nationalist who could not stand the thought of a Europe dominated by a united German nation.
Mrs. Thatcher's image as a European leader, in most European newspapers, including British ones, has faded in the course of the last year. She has repeatedly thrown cold water on hopes for rapid European political and monetary union, and her domestic troubles have piled up. It is also well-known that she and Chancellor Helmut Kohl have never struck up a warm relationship.
In both Britain and West Germany, these things have colored the reporting of what Mrs. Thatcher does best, which is to keep turning over bedrock ideals like European unity and German reunification and pointing out all the scorpions and centipedes below.
 
Uncertainty Over Currency Union
Her aides keep finding more. The prospect of a currency union between East and West Germany, one of them said, created ''a whole area of new uncertainty'' for European monetary union. The prospect of German unity, he said, would also require renegotiating the European Community's policies on fisheries and agriculture.
German unification, Mrs. Thatcher says, should take place deliberately, not all of a sudden, something her critics in Germany hold against her. But a close examination of what Mrs. Thatcher may have been saying about German unification in recent weeks shows her remarks to be no more obstructionist than those of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union, who has been hailed in West Germany for giving it the green light.
That was after he told Mr. Kohl in Moscow last month that how and when the two Germanys came together was for them alone to decide - but that the security framework within which they did it was a concern of their neighbors.
Mrs. Thatcher used almost identical words a week later in a widely quoted speech to the Board of Deputies of British Jews on Feb. 18. ''German unification must take into account not only the feelings of the two German states, but the sensitivities and interests of others in Europe as well,'' she said.
 
Inflexibility 'Confirmed'
Several leading British newspapers characterized the Prime Minister's remarks as an attempt to slow down the pace of unification. The Guardian's report said the comments ''further confirmed the Prime Minister's inflexibility and apparent reluctance to play a constructive role in building the new European architecture.''
Mrs. Thatcher's aides concede that she has in fact been trying to slow the pace. But they noted today that in the Feb. 18 speech, she also said she supported Poland's wish to see its Western border guaranteed by treaty.
But Mr. Kohl's long refusal to address that concern brought him trouble. President Bush subtly underlined the difference between the American and the West German position on the border at Camp David, Md., on Feb. 25.
By last Thursday, the French Foreign Minister, Roland Dumas, was saying openly in West Berlin: ''There are moments when silence is heavy with ambiguities. That border is untouchable. That must be said without delay. It has to be stated clearly to the people concerned, first of all the Poles.''
 
Statement by Kohl
Finally, on Tuesday, Chancellor Kohl, conceding mistakes, proposed a joint declaration by the East and West German parliaments after the elections to guarantee the border.
''In all this we want to insure that Germany's unification upholds peace and prosperity in Europe and does not become a new source of instability,'' Mrs. Thatcher said in her speech last month. ''Chancellor Kohl and his colleagues share this aim, and I am sure they will remain staunch supporters of NATO,'' she said.
Mr. Gorbachev, whose own domestic political preoccupations in the Soviet Union have led officials in Washington to assume that he can no longer prevent German unification on NATO's terms, repeated on Tuesday that NATO membership was unacceptable for a united Germany. Mrs. Thatcher believes it is indispensable.

HEADLINE: Thaw Is Hinted In School Strike In West Virginia

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, W.Va., March 9

 BODY:
What has become one of the most serious teacher strikes in the nation in recent years shut down more than half of West Virginia's schools today, the third day of the strike.
There was no sign when the dispute would be resolved. But late tonight, in what his aides called a ''positive gesture,'' Gov. Gaston Caperton recommended that any teachers returning to the classrooms Monday not be punished or have to forfeit pay. Teachers' organizations said they would respond Saturday to the Governor's remarks. 
The State Board of Education said the walkout, mainly over pay, had closed all schools in 24 of the state's 55 counties and had left schools badly understaffed in other counties.
At least 100,000 pupils, about a third of the state enrollment, were unable to attend classes because of the walkout.
Before the Governor's suggestion late tonight, state officials and leaders of teachers' organizations said they were willing to negotiate. But they could not agree on conditions or timing for talks.
 
Ahead of Mississippi
According to the West Virginia Education Association, whose membership includes about three-fourths of the state's 22,000 teachers, West Virginia ranks 49th in teacher pay, with an average annual salary of $21,904. Only Mississippi teachers earn less.
''I'm not proud of what I'm doing, but what we earn is a disgrace,'' Susan Coffman, a second-grade teacher, said this morning as she picketed on a spring-like, overcast day in front of the Piedmont Elementary School in downtown Charleston. On the school's bright green doors were tacked copies of court injunctions prohibiting the pickets from blocking entrances and exits.
The West Virginia strike is the third statewide teacher strike in the country this year, following one-day walkouts over pay in Utah and Washington State. Citywide or countywide teacher strikes are fairly common around the nation, but statewide actions are rare. That three have been called already this year has caused some educators to wonder whether the nation might be headed for a new spell of school unrest over money.
''This many statewide strikes is very unusual,'' said Howard Carroll, a spokesman for the National Education Association, the Washington-based organization that represents about three-fourths of the nation's teachers. Who Inflicted the Wounds? Henry Marockie, the West Virginia education superintendent, said this afternoon he saw no sign of a quick end to the walkout.
''It looks like about half our schools are in and about half are out,'' he said, ''and they're going to stay that way for a while. This is going to create a lot of wounds that will take a long time to heal.''
Kayetta Meadows, the president of the West Virginia Education Association, said state officials had inflicted the wounds.
''Eight years ago, we ranked 33d in the nation in pay,'' she said. ''We're falling farther and farther behind, not even keeping up with inflation. Our paychecks today have $250 less in spending power than they did 10 years ago. We'll stay on strike forever, if necessary, to turn the situation around.''
State officials, including Governor Caperton, readily concede that the pay is too low, making it difficult for the state to recruit and hold teachers. But the officials say the state, one of the most economically troubled in the country, does not have the means to meet the teachers' demands.
 
A Turnip Without Blood
''We put together a package that would have given them a 5 percent pay increase and many other improvements in benefits, but they rejected it and walked out,'' said Governor Caperton, who has frequently called himself ''the education Governor.''
''There's no more blood in the turnip,'' he added. ''We all know that this state's young people are its future. But this is a very poor state, and we can only do so much.'' While both sides insisted today that they were willing to negotiate, both set conditions. State officials said the teachers would have to return to work before there could be any talks.
Indeed, only hours before his conciliatory gesture, Governor Caperton said: ''We won't talk while there's an illegal walkout under way. State law doesn't permit teachers to have any collective contract with the state, so this is not a strike. It's just an attempt at intimidation.''
But officials of teacher organizations said they reserved the right for their members to stay off the job. ''Nothing says you can't talk while you're on strike,'' Ms. Meadows said.
 
Warning From Legal Official
Earlier this week, the West Virginia Attorney General, Roger Tompkins, warned teachers that they could be suspended, dismissed or charged with a misdemeanor for walking off the job. ''A strike or work stoppage by teachers constitutes an attack upon the most important duty and function of this state,'' he said.
Some state officials contend the strike was precipitated in part by competition among teachers groups for members. Besides the West Virginia Education Association, which is affiliated with the National Education Association, the American Federation of Teachers is active in the state.
 
No Strike Benefits
But teachers insist the sole reason for the strike is money, and not just salaries.
''It's really more than just pay for teachers,'' said Ghee Gossard, a third-grade teacher who was picketing today at Piedmont Elementary. ''There are a lot of school systems around the state that don't get the money from the state that they deserve.''
How long the teachers can hold out is anybody's guess. They have no strike funds and, they say, not much money in their personal bank accounts.
While concerns about money had been building among teachers for some time, they did not crest until a month ago, after Governor Caperton said in his annual budget address that there would be no raise this year. Within days, thousands of teachers descended on the state Capitol, marching noisily through legislative halls and threatening to strike.
Mr. Caperton threw together a plan that included a 5 percent pay increase, as well as some money for benefits and school improvement programs. He proposed to pay for the package with a new tax on coal and, aides said, had rounded up the votes for it.
But when he offered the package to the teachers, on condition that they drop all strike threats, they balked. He withdrew the offer, and the strike followed, on Wednesday. The Legislature is scheduled to end its session on Saturday.

HEADLINE: Senator Makes Scathing Attack on Gephardt Over Criticism of Bush

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9

 BODY:
In an unusual breach of senatorial custom, Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, the deputy Republican leader, delivered a scathing personal attack today on Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the Democratic leader of the House.
Speaking from the floor of the Senate, Mr. Simpson described Mr. Gephardt as a ''frustrated fount of trivia'' and ridiculed his recent criticism of President Bush as the frustrated railings of a man who lusts to have the President's job.
In a speech on Tuesday, Mr. Gephardt criticized the President, asserting that he lacked vision and leadership in shaping the country's response to the emerging democracies in Eastern Europe and changes in the Soviet Union. Mr. Gephardt was widely rebuked by Republicans, who have pounced particularly on the Missouri Democrat's call for economic aid to the Soviet Union. 
While Mr. Simpson has been taking aim at Mr. Gephardt all week, his speech today went well beyond the earlier partisan jabs, focusing less on the substance of the speech than on the majority leader himself. It came on the heels of similar comments issued earlier in the day by Ed Rollins, the director of the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee, who called Mr. Gephardt a hypocrite for his criticism of President Bush's use of public opinion polls.
 
'All You Need Is a Shrill Voice'
''It doesn't take any brains to be a critic,'' Mr. Simpson said of Mr. Gephardt. ''All you need is a shrill voice and a human target, and when the target happens to hold a job that the critic desperately lusts for and has been repeatedly denied by his own party, then the frustration levels must be enormous.''
Representative Gephardt ran unsuccessfully for his party's Presidential nomination in 1988.
Mr. Simpson accused the Democratic leader of using the foreign policy speech to further his own political ambitions. ''Richard Gephardt ought to try to resist the desire to have the camera lights bleach his suits out while he rails on in classical personal aggrandizement trying again for the big brass ring,'' Mr. Simpson said.
Mr. Gephardt, who was in California at the time. did not hear Mr. Simpson's comments in the Senate. David Dreyer, a spokesman for Mr. Gephardt, said, ''It shows a low opinion of the American people when the Republicans launch a personal attack on Congressman Gephardt, who is urging greater American leadership to advance democracy in the Eastern bloc.''
''This was a setup,'' said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York. ''It is very clear to me that someone in the White House was very upset by what the majority leader said, or we would not have had this kind of response in the Senate.''
Mr. Moynihan added that during his 13 years in the Senate he had never witnessed such a statement about someone not present to respond.
Touching briefly on the policy issues raised in Mr. Gephardt's speech, Mr. Simpson said that it was Mr. Gephardt who was out of touch with the American people, not President Bush. ''Two-thirds of the American people oppose substantial aid to the Soviet Union at this time,'' he said. ''No wonder Mr. Gephardt doesn't like the polls. They don't tell him what he wants to hear.''
Mr. Simpson called the Democratic majority leader ''a very bright and thoughtful man'' who had unwisely chosen to become ''the self-appointed trasher of the Administration.'' The American people were waiting for original ideas and thoughtful leadership from Mr. Gephardt, he said. ''All they got was reprocessed cud.''

HEADLINE: Unemployment Remains Steady at 5.3%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9

 BODY:
The economy generated many more jobs in February than analysts had expected, but the growth was not sufficient to affect the civilian unemployment rate. It stood at 5.3 percent for the ninth straight month, the Labor Department reported today.
The report, the first comprehensive indicator of economic activity last month, suggested a rebound from recent stagnation and was hailed by the Bush Administration as tending to confirm its projections of a fresh expansion this year.
''We believe the economy, after a period of slower growth, is likely to show progress,'' said Michael J. Boskin, the President's chief economic adviser. 
But the report was greeted nervously by the securities markets. Prices fell on both bonds and stocks. The bond market was especially hard hit. Investors there saw the report as a sign of economic strength, raising their fears of inflation and higher interest rates. Either inflation or higher interest would reduce the value of existing Government notes and bonds. [Page 34.] Bigger Gain Than Expected The report showed that jobs as determined by the department's survey of business payrolls jumped 372,000 for the month, a gain of about 100,000 more than had been expected. The report also revised the increase for January to 332,000, or 20 percent more than first reported. The February increase in jobs was the biggest since mid-1988 and included the first rise in manufacturing jobs since last March.
In all, according to the department's survey of households, which is separate from the payroll survey, the civilian labor force totaled 124,630,000 last month, with 118,035,000 people holding at least one job. The unemployed numbered 6,595,000 people, for a civilian jobless rate of 5.3 percent.
The overall jobless rate, which includes military personnel stationed in the United States, was 5.2 percent last month, also unchanged from its January level.
 
Impact of Auto Employment
Special factors contributed heavily to the improvement portrayed in the number of jobs, and analysts said the economy was not nearly so buoyant as the numbers might at first suggest.
The Commissioner of Labor Statistics, Janet L. Norwood, noted today in her monthly appearance before Congress that 90,000 of the new jobs reported last month represented the return of laid-off workers in the automobile and related fabricated-metal industries. This reflected some improvement in demand for American-made cars, but the number of auto jobs is still 50,000 below the level of February 1989.
Another special factor was the second straight month of exceptionally warm weather. That led to a 60,000 increase in construction jobs, after a 105,000 rise in January. Dr. Norwood warned that some of this surge might prove to be borrowed from the industry's usual rebound in the spring.
Most of the figures reported by the Labor Department are adjusted for seasonal variations: the department uses recent history to take account of generally predictable things like extreme weather, holidays, the beginning and end of the school year and the changeover in automobile model years.
This is done to allow more accurate examination of underlying economic trends. Sometimes, however, the adjustments are not enough to offset extraordinary circumstances or may exaggerate them.
 
Factory Employment Still Weak
Apart from automobiles and metals, factory employment was relatively weak last month, the department said. One measure of this was an index that compares the percentage of companies adding workers with those reducing their work force. That index showed only 46.1 percent of 141 manufacturing industries increasing employment or keeping it unchanged in February. This was the 10th month in the past 11 in which this gauge measured less than 50 percent.
The department's survey of business payrolls also showed that service industries posted substantial gains while smaller increases in jobs were recorded for transportation, public utilities, finance, insurance and real estate.
In all, service jobs, which are the driving force in the economy, climbed 221,000 last month while jobs in goods-producing industries rose by 151,000.
The report also showed that the length of the workweek in private industry edged up six minutes, to 34.6 hours.
The unemployment rate is based on a separate department survey of about 60,000 households. It showed that the increase in civilian jobs of 172,000 was not quite as rapid as the 233,000 rise in the number of people seeking work. But this shortfall was not enough to raise the jobless rate, which has been flat since late last spring.
 
Decline in Jobless Rate for Blacks
There was little change in the jobless rates of most population groups except that the rate for blacks fell eight-tenths of a point, to 10.5 percent. This put it about one point below its average for the second half of last year.
The unemployment rate for auto workers, which had soared to 20 percent because of temporary plant shutdowns in January, fell back to 8 percent last month.
In the Northeast the jobless rate edged up two-tenths of a point, to 5.7 percent. In the West the rate rose by one-tenth of a point, to 5.5 percent. For the South, the rate was unchanged at 5.8, while the rate for the Midwest fell six-tenths of a point, to 6.1 percent. The regional figures are not adjusted for seasonal variations.
The ranks of the domestically based military fell to 1,678,000 in February from 1,697,000 in January, department figures indicated.

HEADLINE: Civilian Rate As Main Gauge

 BODY:
The Labor Department statistics published today by The New York Times show the civilian unemployment rate as the primary gauge of the nation's labor market rather than the overall rate, whose base includes domestically stationed military personnel.
The Times will continue to report both rates. But it is shifting its focus to the civilian rate because that is widely viewed as a slightly more accurate reflection of labor market conditions.
When military personnel are included in the work force, the overall unemployment rate that results is frequently one-tenth of a point lower.
Focusing on the civilian rate is intended to reduce confusion and provide consistency, since the details in the monthly report, including the jobless rates for various population groups, relate only to civilians.

HEADLINE: Artists, Accepting Federal Grants, Worry About Strings

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 9

 BODY:
Grants are godsends for writers like Martha Collins, but she still had to think long and hard before accepting a $20,000 fellowship this year from the National Endowment for the Arts.
The financial freedom was tempting, but it came with a few strings attached: Ms. Collins, who is a poet, and 96 other writers nationwide had to sign letters promising to comply with Federal restrictions imposed last fall after some legislators objected to Government financing of exhibitions featuring works by the photographers Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano. Under the restrictions adopted as part of the arts endowment's appropriations bill, it agreed to weed out grant recipients whose art might be construed as obscene.
''I signed because I can live with it, but I'm concerned by the tone - concerned that things could get worse instead of better,'' said Ms. Collins, who also directs the writing program at the University of Massachusetts at Boston. 
 
'Obligated to Obey'
The chairman of the endowment, John E. Frohnmayer, said Thursday that he did not endorse the legislation, though as a Federal official he was prohibited from lobbying against it.
''I'm obligated to obey the law,'' he said in a telephone interview from Washington. ''I do think that the statute is unnecessary and I hope that Congress in its wisdom will not see fit to continue it.''
Among the 1990 applicants, five writers were singled out for closer examination and all of the more than 4,000 artists who eventually were granted funds received a package containing the promissory letter, the endowment said.
''Like a lot of writers, I was in a financially desperate situation so I signed, but not without a lot of outrage,'' said Alison Demming, a poet in Provincetown, Mass. ''The N.E.A. is giving us freedom from economic stress, but they're saying we can't exercise it freely.''
 
'Create as You Wish'
That's not the perception the endowment wants its writers to have, said Virginia Falck, a spokeswoman for the agency.
''Our stand is, 'Don't let this intimidate you,' '' she said. ''Feel free to create as you wish. When you're funding creativity, you've got to allow room for people to do all kinds of things - warts and all.''
But grant recipients are now being asked to refrain from producing artworks that include, but are not limited to, ''depictions of sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the sexual exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sex acts and which, when taken as a whole, do not have serious literary, artistic, political or scientific merit.''
Some writers said they felt they were facing the possibility of increased censorship and state control of the arts.
''It's ironic that we've spent all these years reading about restrictions on artists in Eastern Europe and just when they're gaining freedom we're beginning to feel restricted,'' Miss Collins said. She also objected to ''sandwiching'' homoerotic art between images of sadomasochism and sexually exploited children. ''Everyone I've talked with feels it's alarming,'' she said.
 
To Monitor Agency
Other writers were more sanguine. Ursula Hegi, of Spokane, Wash., said she had signed without hesitation because ''it was not in any conflict with what I'm doing.''
Ms. Falck said the endowment had not so far developed a procedure for checking on the thousands of photographers, dancers, urban designers, painters and other artists who each year receive Federal funds.
Meanwhile, the Writers' Coalition, an umbrella organization for 50 groups, including PEN America, the Modern Language Association and the National Writers' Union, plans to monitor closely the agency's next steps.
The endowment ''is supposed to be an arts advocate and at the same time must comply with this law,'' said Liam Rector, director of a writers' group called Associated Writing Programs in Norfolk, Va. ''The endowment finds it difficult to defend itself, so it falls to the field and to the artists themselves to protect First Amendment rights.''

HEADLINE: Report Denied on Not Renaming Greenspan

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9

 BODY:
A published report that President Bush is unlikely to ask Alan Greenspan to stay on as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board when his term expires in 17 months drew strong denials today from the White House and the Treasury. It also prompted ringing endorsements of Mr. Greenspan from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers.
The report appeared to have little influence on financial markets. But it was taken seriously by some analysts here, who saw it as another sign of White House unease with monetary policies that have led to about a half-percentage-point increase in long-term rates so far this year as rates were rising in other big industrial countries. 
More broadly, the article, which appeared today in The Los Angeles Times, was seen as marking another chapter in a long story of uneasy relations between the White House and the Federal Reserve, stemming from the frustration of Presidents over their inability to control the central bank's power to create money. Created by Congress just before the outbreak of World War I, the Federal Reserve System was given independence in an effort to insulate the management of money and credit from politics. In the postwar era alone, duels with Fed chairmen have been fought during the Truman, Johnson, Carter and Reagan Administrations.
The Los Angeles Times article appeared as one more incident in the Bush Administration's low-key running debate over interest rates. Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, and President Bush himself have said that the Fed should lower interest rates to maintain growth.
The day before Mr. Bush's remarks, to a home builders' group in January, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, had been more direct, saying that he hoped that new statistics showing a steady inflation rate and a faltering housing industry would persuade the Fed to ease. But Mr. Fitzwater later sought to play down the disagreement. And no Administration official has suggested publicly that Mr. Greenspan's job might be on the line if he failed to respond to this pressure.
Nevertheless, some experts said that The Los Angeles Times article probably came from some top Administration official annoyed at the Fed's reluctance to make further reductions in interest rates at a time when a recession is possible.
''The Administration wants to be in a position that if someone were to announce a recession next week, it would not be viewed as the Administration's fault,'' said Joseph Minarik, staff director of the Joint Economic Committee.
William Greider, author of a recent history of the Fed, ''Secrets of the Temple,'' said: ''This is the Administration's way of turning the heat up on the Federal Reserve Board. The article should be treated as serious politics.''
Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat who sits on the House Banking Committee, said that ''if the White House is leaking this, it's both counterproductive for the White House and pretty abhorrent.'' He described it as an effort to ''sacrifice the long-range stability of the country for short-term political gain.''
 
Treasury Called Likely Source
Some experts said the Treasury Department, rather than Mr. Darman or other White House officials, might be the source of the latest pressure on the Fed to lower rates. There is a faction at the Treasury that wants lower rates to stimulate the economy and reduce the value of the dollar, said Jude Wanniski, a supply-sider who is president of Polyconomics Inc., an economic consulting firm.
Both White House and Treasury officials took the occasion today to knock the report hard.
''I don't know where this story came from, but it is out of left field,'' said Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Asked whether White House officials like Mr. Darman were angry at Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Fitzwater said, ''No one is angry.''
 
Treasury's Response
Roger Bolton, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for public affairs, characterized The Los Angeles Times story as ''totally unfounded.''
''The matter hasn't even been discussed,'' he said.
The Fed had been reducing interest rates in small steps from the middle of last year into December. Some Administration officials argue that more reductions are needed to encourage greater spending on credit and thus avoid a recession, and to stimulate exports. Lower rates usually reduce the value of the dollar, which makes American goods less expensive in foreign currencies.
Mr. Greenspan has argued before Congress that rates need to stay high to combat possibly resurgent inflation. Among other factors, his supporters say, are global economic developments, like the need to find enough capital to finance development projects in Eastern Europe.
 
Fed Officials Surprised
Whatever the source of the pressure, the article apparently came as a surprise to Fed officials. Mr. Greenspan was in San Francisco, vacationing after attending a two-day gathering of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. His two top press officials, Joseph Coyne and Robert Moore, were on vacation.
Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana and chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, also expressed surprise.
''I think there is very broad support for Fed policy in the Congress and indeed in Washington,'' he said. Mr. Hamilton is the chief author of a bill now before Congress that would force the Fed to be more accountable to the public for its interest-rate policies.
Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the House Banking Committee, said of Mr. Greenspan, ''He's done an admirably good job and is entitled to be considered for reappointment.''
 
Denials Discounted
But one prominent supply-side economist with close links to the White House said that despite the Administration denials, he thought the article - in which a longtime Bush adviser was quoted as saying the President was ''mad as hell'' about Mr. Greenspan's high-interest-rate position - was true.
''I know they are unhappy with him, and I sure know they are considering not reappointing him,'' said this economist, who insisted on anonymity. He said the view at the White House was that Mr. Greenspan ''seems to fear economic growth, but this President favors economic growth.''
Andrew F. Brimmer, a former Federal Reserve Board governor who is now a Washington financial consultant, said: ''I believe Bush is unhappy with Alan Greenspan, and I believe his associates are unhappy. I believe the unhappiness extends to the Treasury.''
But Mr. Brimmer, like many other other market specialists, said he thought it would be a mistake for the President not to reappoint Mr. Greenspan.
Because of Mr. Greenspan's ''sterling reputation,'' it would be a ''real shock'' to the markets if he was not renamed, Mr. Brimmer said.

HEADLINE: A Raw Nerve in Tokyo

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 9

 BODY:
As the largest industrial groups in Japan and West Germany explore collaborations in aerospace, automobiles and electronics, Tokyo's habitually nervous business community is facing a troubling question:
How will the United States react if Japan and Germany enter broad alliances in technologies where America still holds an edge?
Like the prospect of German reunification, the proposed alliance of the Mitsubishi companies with Daimler-Benz, announced Tuesday, is something Government officials and business leaders talk about publicly in the most positive, non-threatening terms. Japan would be foolish not to make a broad move into Europe before the creation of a single market there in 1992, they argue, and the United States has little to fear in the ties with Germany's biggest automobile, aircraft and arms maker.
''The relationship of Japan with the United States has been very close and Japan should strengthen it,'' Toyoo Tate, chairman of the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation and one architect of the possible collaboration with Daimler, said in his office this week. ''But we are now in the age of globalization, and this is a manifestation of Japan's need to get closer to Europe. Because we are taking this step does not necessarily mean relations with the U.S. will become worse.'' 
At least so far, little objection has been voiced, but lurking beneath the surface is a fear among many Japanese that the United States will soon view the alliance as vaguely threatening.
Europe already appears to have a stronger hand in dealing with Japan than does the United States, especially as 1992 nears and Eastern Europe opens. One senior official of a company affiliated with Mitsubishi noted that Western Europe could still offer something Japan desperately needs: access to a market that seems as foreign and impenetrable to some Japanese companies as Japan seems to some Americans.
Japanese officials say they are also bracing themselves for unwanted references to 50 years ago, when the corporate ancestors of Mitsubishi and Daimler built the war machinery of the Axis powers.
''The timing is not exactly ideal,'' a senior Japanese diplomat said the other day. Talk of the possible alliance fuses ''two of America's biggest worries,'' he said, the power of a recombined Germany and the prospect that Japan's seemingly unstoppable industrial advances could be given another lift.
No one is yet sure that the vaguely described alliance - actually a series of alliances between individual Mitsubishi companies and Daimler divisions - will prove workable. Some European nations, especially France, are already warning of the dangers of Japanese ''transplants,'' and are attempting to extend the limits to Japanese car sales there.
 
Guarding Technologies
Both corporate groups are likely to guard their best technologies and richest markets jealously, so analysts expect the biggest deals to come in areas where the two giants do not compete directly. There is widespread speculation, for example, that Mitsubishi Motors may build a small, inexpensive car that both it and Daimler could market in Eastern Europe, where few will be interested in a $50,000 Mercedes-Benz. Mr. Tate refused to discuss that possibility today, but said officials would first have to make clear exactly what kinds of limits would be imposed on Japanese cars made in Europe.
There are already warnings in the press here that the two companies should know their limits and avoid making the United States feel frozen out.
''As the recent Japan-U.S. summit and trade talks have revealed, political and emotional conflicts between the two countries have not abated in any way, and anti-Japanese sentiments in America are still strong among those who regard Japan as a menace to their country,'' Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan's largest newspapers, reminded its readers this morning in an editorial headlined ''A Colossus Is Born.''
 
'Must Be Most Annoying'
''To these people, it must be most annoying that the same Japanese group that bought Rockefeller Center has decided to collaborate with the most powerful conglomerate in West Germany,'' it said. In October, Mitsubishi Estate bought 51 percent of the Rockefeller Group, which owns Rockefeller Center and other mid-Manhattan office buildings, for $846 million.
In Germany, the bigger worry seems to be Europe itself. Even before the alliance was announced, many expressed fears that Daimler-Benz was growing too big and too powerful, especially after its acquisition of the Messerschmitt-Bolkow Blohm G.m.b.H., the aircraft maker.
''If the partners of such a joint venture are German and Japanese, then it is also a political matter,'' said Suddeutsche Zeitung, a leading Munich daily.
Technological alliances are hardly uncommon, especially recently. A host of American and Japanese electronics manufacturers have agreed to share technology and market products jointly; on Wednesday, A.T.&T. and NEC, the world's largest semiconductor maker, announced ties for developing advanced chips over the next five years.
 
On a New Scale
But the Mitsubishi-Daimler alliance promises to be a linkage on an entirely different scale. Not only does it involve a wide range of technologies, it also involves a host of closely linked companies - Mitsubishi Motors, Mitsubishi Electric, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and the Mitsubishi Coproration - that rarely act together, at least publicly.
''Such a large-scale corporate linkage is very uncommon,'' said Kenichi Imai, a professor of economics at Hitosubashi University, who studies the relationships of what in prewar days were known as ''zaibatsu,'' Japan's business groups. Today the company members of those groups ostensibly operate independently, despite the fact that they hold big stakes in each other and exchange members on their boards. It is not uncommon these days for a Mitsubishi-related company to buy a product or technology from Toshiba or NEC, which belong to rival groupings. A decade ago, that would have been unheard of.
Moreover, executives at Mitsubishi say that each of its companies will have to strike separate deals with Daimler's divisions. It is unlikely, experts here say, that the Mitsubishi companies would pool their resources and negotiate collectively with Daimler.
Thus, if Mitsubishi Heavy Industries needed Daimler's help building jet engines - an area where Japan has been persistently frustrated - it would have to offer something of its own in return, like the advanced composite materials for wings that it has been developing for military and commercial use.
''The companies work closely, and the leaders meet every week,'' one Mitsubishi executive said recently. ''But when they get back to the office, they still have to make money.''

Digital Offer Of Severance

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: MAYNARD, Mass., March 9

 BODY:
The Digital Equipment Corporation, trying to cope with a slumping computer industry and a weak New England economy, said today that it would soon offer a voluntary severance package to as many as 8,000 employees.
The nation's second-largest computer maker said last month that it might post its first quarterly loss in its 32-year history in the third quarter ending March 31 and that it was considering various cutbacks. 
Digital, which has 125,900 employees, said it would offer a voluntary severance plan to between 5,000 and 8,000 workers. It does not plan forced layoffs. Brad Allen, a company spokesman, said plant closings were being considered in the United States. He said the severance plan would not be completed in the third quarter, The Maynard, Mass., company initiated a similar plan last October, when it offered 700 workers at its Salem, N.H., plant the option to leave the company. Digital said 260 workers had accepted the offer.
Digital, ranked second only to the International Business Machines Corporation among the nation's computer makers, has met increasing competition to the VAX mid-sized computers that have been its main product.
Digital's stock slipped 25 cents a share today, to $76.625, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Treasury Prices Fall on Jobs Report

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities tumbled yesterday after the Government reported an unexpectedly large rise in civilian employment in February.
Traders said the jobs report unnerved investors in fixed-income securities because it was taken as a sign of economic strength that raised fears of inflation and higher interest rates, either of which would reduce the value of existing fixed-income debt issues.
In its report, the Government said 372,000 jobs were created in February. It also revised the increase in January jobs to 332,000, from 275,000. 
Credit market analysts were quick to note that the February increase included the hiring of some 30,000 census takers and the rehiring of roughly 70,000 auto workers laid off in January, as well as an increase in construction work brought on by the mild weather of much of the last two months. Nonetheless, prices of fixed-income securities plunged in the morning and remained depressed throughout the day.
 
Big Losses in Bond Futures
The biggest losses were posted in trading of bond futures at the Chicago Board of Trade. People in the futures market took the job data at face value, traders said, and sold throughout the session.
Dealers in Treasury securities said the heavy selling of bond futures undermined prices in the cash market. Only when bond futures trading in Chicago ended at 3 P.M., New York time, did the cash market begin to recover some of its losses.
In late trading in the cash market, the Treasury's benchmark long-term bonds, the 8.5 percent issue maturing in 2020, were offered at 98 22/32, down 25/32. Just before the bond futures market closed, the cash price of the long bond had been down a point, or $10 per each $1,000 of face value.
At 98 22/32, the long bond's yield was 8.62 percent, up from 8.54 percent the day before. A week ago, the yield was also 8.54 percent.
In Chicago, the March bond futures closed down a point, at 92.1, for a loss of 1.3 on the week. The more active June bond futures contract fell 1.2, to 91.26, for a loss of 1.6 on the week.
 
Growth in Money Supply
''Allowing for the possible distortions in the latest jobs data, it still shows that the economy is not fading as fast as some think,'' said Leif H. Olsen, who heads an investment management firm bearing his name in New Canaan, Conn.
Given indications that the Fed has not done anything to cause, or prevent, rising interest rates, Mr. Olsen said, ''We can only assume that the bond market, in demanding higher rates, is questioning the Fed's anti-inflation policy, because the Federal funds rate is the cheapest rate in the money market.''
Manipulation of the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for temporary loans, is one of the Fed's chief tools. The funds traded at 8.25 percent most of the day, roughly the rate of recent weeks.
Discount rates on Treasury bills continued to rise. The change was again attributed to an increase in the supply of bills.
The rate on the 90-day bills rose 7 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 7.98 percent; the six-month bills gained 7 basis points, to 7.88 percent, and the one-year bills climbed 8 basis points, to 7.84 percent.
Among some short-term coupon issues traded in the secondary market, the 8.5 percent notes of 1992 lost 8/32, to 99 20/32, for a yield of 8.71 percent, and the 8.5 percent issue of 1995 dropped 14/32, to 99 10/32, for a yield of 8.65 percent.

HEADLINE: Dow Ends Positive Week With a Decline

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks gave up more ground yesterday in slow trading in the wake of a sharp rise in bond yields and computerized sell programs that depressed the market severely.
The Dow Jones industrial average slid 12.84 points, to 2,683.33. That cut the gain for the last two weeks to 119.14 points, 22.97 of which came this week. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange slumped to 150.4 million shares, from 170.9 million on Thursday, with declines outnumbering advances, 876 to 602. 
But in what could be seen as a favorable sign, only 18 issues touched new lows, while 28 reached new highs.
 
Rate Cut Seen as Less Likely
Traders took new signs of unexpected strength in the economy as further support for their long-held feeling that the Federal Reserve has no intention of forcing interest rates down for the time being. Lower rates would put more money - and thus pep - into the economy.
The Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate remained steady at 5.3 percent in February, while non-farm payroll employment rose by 372,000.
Hugh A. Johnson, chief investment officer for the First Albany Corporation, an Albany brokerage firm, said the employment figures were ''significantly stronger than expected and pretty much removes any hope that the Federal Reserve is going to lower interest rates anytime soon.''
He said, ''The employment data suggest that the economy is showing enough resilience that the economy doesn't need lower rates.''
 
Two Negatives for Stocks
That, he said, was doubly negative for stocks because rising rates ''offer investors an attractive alternative to stocks'' and ''darken the outlook for corporate earnings.''
Among the 30 Dow industrials, Du Pont fell 1, to 39; Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing dipped 1 1/4, to 81 3/4, and Philip Morris was off 7/8, to 37 1/4. NCNB, the North Carolina banking company, fell 2 1/8, to 41 1/2, in heavy trading. The company said problem loans might rise in the first quarter.
Retailing stocks, buoyed by February sales gains, continued to show strong advances. Gap, the apparel chain, which rose 1 3/4 on Thursday, rose an additional 2 1/4 yesterday, to 61 1/2. Edison Brothers, a women's shoe chain, rose 1 3/8, to 34 7/8. Nordstrom, the department store, rose 1 5/8, to 30, with heavy buying by institutions.
Airline stocks were also strong, with Delta Air Lines up 1, to 70; UAL up 1 1/4, to 134, and USAir up 1 1/8, to 29 3/8. USAir said its load factor rose in February.
Digital Equipment, which rose 4 7/8 last week and 2 1/4 the first four days of this week, fell 1/4 yesterday, to 76 5/8. Digital said it would offer voluntary severance to between 5,000 and 8,000 workers and was considering new plant consolidations.
 
Trading of Genentech Shares
Genentech, the South San Francisco biotechnology company, was unchanged at 26 1/8, with 1.06 million shares changing hands, almost half of them going to big insitutions. Genentech said that Roche Holdings Ltd., parent of Hoffmann-La Roche, would go ahead with its previously announced plans to buy 60 percent of Genentech.
Rorer Group, the drug company, rose 7/8, to 62 7/8, in heavy trading, after rising 2 points earlier in the week. Traders pointed to rumors that Rorer might announce Monday a multibillion-dollar sale of the company to Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemical giant.

HEADLINE: Saudi Oil Minister Predicts A 'Sellers' Market' in 90's

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The Saudi oil minister, Hisham M. Nazer, said yesterday that he did not anticipate an oil crisis in the 1990's but added that ''the market will slowly but steadily turn into a sellers' market.''
He predicted a 20 percent increase in oil demand in this decade, which other experts said would be a continuation of the trend in recent years. That increase would come with world economic growth of 3.2 percent, he said. 
The Saudis' own growth rate would also be about 3.2 percent, he said, which some experts describe as a modest figure.
Mr. Nazer would not make specific predictions about oil prices. But he said, ''We do not think higher prices will sustain economic growth.'' Conversely, he said, lower prices would not ''maintain the proper stability in producer countries.'' Saudi Arabia has run a budget deficit in some years recently because of lower oil prices.
Asked whether his country would make further investments in refining and marketing operations in consumer countries, Mr. Nazer said such expansion was ''an important ingredient of stability'' in the industry. His country already owns half the Texaco marketing and refining network in 23 Eastern states, including three refineries and thousands of gasoline outlets.
Mr. Nazer spoke at a conference on the Saudi economy at the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies at New York University. He arrived in New York on Wednesday, when he helped open a 65,000-square-foot exhibit on Saudi history and culture at the Passenger Ship Terminal, Pier 88. The exhibit runs through March 17 and then moves to Los Angeles.
 
Would Lease Oil
In response to a question yesterday, Mr. Nazer said his country would be interested in leasing oil to the United States for storage in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. An Energy Department report recently endorsed the idea of filling the reserve caverns, mostly in Louisiana, with oil that was leased instead of purchased, to lower the cost. Mr. Nazer said, ''We're interested in the strategic reserve simply because we're interested in penetrating the American market.''
Some American analysts suggested that leasing could be a way for a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to earn extra oil revenue without violating the group's quotas, which cover sales and do not anticipate leasing.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up in Quiet Trading After Employment Report

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar moved mostly higher yesterday in quiet trading on world currency markets, bolstered by a better-than-expected employment report.
Gold prices slipped worldwide. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold settled at $399.80 an ounce, off 20 cents from Thursday. The Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $399.75, down 5 cents. 
The dollar got a lift from a Labor Department report showing that non-farm payrolls gained 372,000 jobs in February, the largest increase since June 1988. Most estimates had called for a gain of roughly 250,000 jobs.
''The data gave the dollar good background support,'' said Marc Chandler, an analyst at MMS International in Chicago. ''The numbers gave greater credence to the 'soft landing' scenario and reduced lingering hopes of a near-term easing'' of interest rates, he said.
The Federal Reserve keeps the economy from overheating by holding official interest rates at current levels or by raising them, as some analysts have suggested the Government might be considering. Higher interest rates enhance the value of dollar-denominated securities.
 
Intervention Seen in Europe
 Despite the bullish sentiment surrounding the dollar, Mr. Chandler said that the fear of central bank intervention had prevented the currency from rising further. Several central banks stepped in to sell dollars in European trading, but they did not follow through in domestic markets.
Because of nagging political and economic problems in Britain, analysts predicted that the pound would continue to weaken against the dollar.
The pound lost nearly 2.5 cents amid anxiety over recent demonstrations against a new tax imposed by city halls across Britain. In addition, opinion polls show that the popularity of the Conservative Government and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is at an all-time low as inflation rises and interest rates remain high.
Earlier in Tokyo the dollar rose to 151.15 yen from Thursday's 150.83. Later in London, the dollar closed at 151.32 yen. In New York the dollar closed at 151.27 yen, up from 151.09.
In London, 1 cost $1.6183 late yesterday, cheaper than Thursday's late price of $1.6427. In New York, 1 cost $1.6170, less expensive than $1.6385 on Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's late rates, included: 1.7025 West German marks, up from 1.7008; 1.5095 Swiss francs, up from 1.5080; 5.7560 French francs, up from 5.7495; 1,257.50 Italian lire, up from 1,255.25, and 1.1804 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1807.
Gold closed in London at a bid of $399.05 an ounce, down from $401.95 on Thursday. The closing bid in Zurich was $399.50, down from $400.75. Earlier in Hong Kong gold closed at $400.65 an ounce, down from $401.95.
Silver prices also fell. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery finished at $5.095 an ounce, down from $5.112 on Thursday. In London, silver traded at a late bid of $5.11 an ounce, down from $5.15.

The troubled Bank of New England Corporation today named Lawrence K. Fish chairman and chief executive.
Mr. Fish, a former Bank of Boston executive vice president, joins Bank of New England as it is trying to revamp and restore public confidence. 
Analysts generally praised the appointment, but they warned that Mr. Fish might not be able to rescue the bank. ''If the economy does not cooperate, a miracle worker is going to have a hard time,'' said Gerard Cassidy, an analyst with Tucker, Anthony Inc.
Mr. Fish, whose hiring has been expected since late last month, replaces Walter J. Connolly Jr., who oversaw the bank's striking growth in the 1980's but was ousted after the company suffered huge losses.
Much of the trouble has been traced to the bank's unbridled lending practices in a construction boom in the mid-1980's. When the economy slowed near the end of the decade, the real estate market tumbled, and the bank was saddled with a mountain of problem loans.
Last month, the bank announced that its losses for 1989 totaled $1.11 billion and disclosed it was reviewing financial data from previous quarters to see whether larger provisions against bad loans should have been made earlier.

Credit Card Trade-Ups

 BODY:
With the credit card market saturated, issuers of gold cards are pressing more affluent consumers to ''trade up'' because gold cards offer higher profits and lower risks. It makes sense for holders of standard Visa cards or Mastercards to consider switching to gold because the rates and annual fees for these cards are on their way down and are either lower than or competitive with the lowest charges for standard cards. Banks set their own credit standards and services, but both Visa and Mastercard require holders of gold cards to have a credit line of at least $5,000. Here are some of the best rates available: 

$	 	 	 	Bank	 Card	 Rate	 Annual Fee	Manufacturers Hano-	 Gold	 17.8%	 $40	ver Trust, New York	 Standard	 19.8%	 $20	 	 	 	 	First Atlanta Bank,	 Gold	 14.88%	 $35	New Castle, Del.	 Standard	 17.88%	 $15	 	 	 	 	People's Bank,	 Gold	 13.50%	 $40	Bridgeport, Conn.	 Standard	 13.50%	 $25

Shipping Furniture Overseas Is Costly

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
More and more American tourists will be heading for vacations abroad as the spring tourist season approaches. For many of them, part of the fun will be making a major furnishings purchase - perhaps an antique chest, a rug or fine crystal.
But unlike those who buy perfume or a wristwatch or something they can tuck into their suitcases, buyers of dining tables and armoires have to contend with shipping their purchases back to America. They, or the merchant they buy from, must arrange for packing, air or sea shipment, local transportation on both sides of the ocean, insurance and, if required, customs duty.
In most situations, the merchant or dealer who sold the item will offer to take care of it all. But each of these services can be expensive, and the total can cause sticker shock. 
''It's a real trap for somebody who is buying something and thinks that he is getting a great deal,'' said Dennis J. Rowles, vice president of the Wolf D. Barth Company, a Philadelphia freight forwarder and customs broker. ''You may find that in the end you're paying just as much as you would in the United States, plus you've got a great deal of aggravation.''
Once you decide that the item you want to buy is something you are not likely to find at home or do not want to search for again, there is one cardinal rule before buying it: find out the exact cost to have it sent home and decide whether you are willing to pay that price. It is costly to send big pieces, or even fairly small ones, from overseas. And when you learn the cost, you might decide not to buy. Freight forwarders act as agents for the purchaser, preparing the shipping documents and generally orchestrating the movement of goods from their point of origin. Customs brokers serve as a contact with the United States Customs Service to secure release of the goods to the purchaser. Many overseas travelers who buy personal items use freight forwarders or customs brokers to avoid problems in transporting the items they have acquired.
Paul F. Wegener, chairman of the National Customs Brokers and Forwarders Assocation of America, a trade group, said, ''Transportation and handling should not add more than 40 percent to the price of an article when you get it back.''
With purchases of smaller items, one way to save is to have them packed inside a large one for the passage home. ''Basically, you're sending the small items for almost nothing, except for the price of the additional insurance and bit of extra packing,'' said Cliff Williams, export manager of Hedleys Humpers Ltd., a London freight forwarder.
 
Beware of Price Inflation
 Even if a foreign dealer or retailer says the entire cost of shipping the product is included in the purchase price, travelers should be wary. In some cases, this purchase price may be inflated to account for transportation, and in others, the merchant may not bother to send the item.
Local transportation in the city of purchase and the destination city, also known as inland freight, coupled with packing and unpacking the items, is charged by the hour. A typical fee might be $50 an hour for each packer or driver, which could easily push the bill for this segment alone well into the hundreds of dollars.
Transoceanic shipping charges are usually based on either the volume or the weight of the item. Mr. Wegener, who is also vice president of M. G. Maher and Company, a freight forwarder and customs broker in New Orleans, said trans-Atlantic shipping by sea costs $175 to $200 for 40 cubic feet or for 2,000 pounds.
If the shipment is sent by air, that price is doubled, he said, but the packaging you choose can affect the shipping cost. For instance, objects are typically sent by air from France in one of two ways: ''container de groupage,'' where the item is shipped in a container with many others and may be delayed until the container is full, or ''messagerie,'' where it is shipped individually. Shipping things individually costs at least twice as much as container shipping.
Insuring the delivery against loss or damage from door to door is strongly advised.
There may be duty to pay when and where the goods are received. Most people leave it to customs brokers, who comply with Government regulations and clear the entry, typically for a fee of $60 to $200. The broker will have on hand the required documents - invoice, bill of lading, entry manifest and customs declaration - and showthose papers to a customs inspector at the airport or other arrival point, where the goods may be examined before being released.
 
How the Duty is Figured
 When shipping merchandise, there is no personal duty-free exemption of up to $400 or flat rate of 10 percent on the next $1,000 worth of fair retail value, as there is when travelers personally take home foreign-made items. The duty that must be paid is determined by tariff classification. For example, the rate for furniture other than chairs is 2.5 percent.
Thus the duty on a $10,000 wardrobe would be $248.75, after allowing for the $50 deductible granted on goods that are shipped. And the overall cost of sending the wardrobe by air from, say, London to New York would be in the neighborhood of $1,500.
When you add it all up - and you can have that done for you before you make a purchase abroad - you might decide you don't need that wardrobe after all, unless it is an antique that may increase in value or is something you cannot live without.
 
 
 
BUY HERE, DRIVE THERE
 Shipping new cars back to the United States from overseas is quite a different matter from shipping furniture.
 The purchase is normally made from an authorized dealer in the United States, who sells a version of the vehicle that meets American safety and emission requirements. The car must usually be ordered at least six weeks before the desired European delivery date and paid for in advance.
In Europe, the car can be picked up at the factory, an airport or other pre-arranged location, depending on the manufacturer. After driving the car during a vacation, the customer leaves it at one of the many designated drop-off sites established by the company - usually in a major city like London or Paris.
The vehicle is then transported to the United States by ship and sent to the dealer from which it was purchased. Buyers may have to wait three to eight weeks to pick it up.
The price is typically all inclusive. The cost of ocean freight, processing, local transportation, duty at the rate of 2.5 percent, customs clearance and insurance for a specified driving period in Europe is added to the price of the car. Manufacturers say this overall price is still 5 to 10 percent less than the suggested advertised delivered price in the United States.
A 300E Mercedes-Benz sedan, for example, costs $41,350 when delivered overseas. The suggested price in the United States is $45,950. The Peugeot 405 sports wagon costs $15,570 if it is delivered in Europe. The manufacturers suggested United States retail price is $16,390. Remember that most automobile sales in this country are made under the list price.

HEADLINE: BUSH DISTRESSED AS POLICY FAILS TO MOVE CHINA

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 10

 BODY:
President Bush and many officials in his Administration say they are deeply disappointed by the failure of the Chinese Government to relax its repressive rule in response to numerous conciliatory gestures by Mr. Bush.
The American officials explained that divisions within the Chinese leadership, compounded by fears about a resurgence of the democracy movement in China after the rapid democratic change in Eastern Europe, have made it difficult for Beijing to respond as the President had hoped.
Those concerned about the meager results so far include the architects of Mr. Bush's policy and some who carried it out, like Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger. He acknowledged in recent Congressional testimony that the repression continued after his visits to China, that there has been no ''rapid payoff'' from Mr. Bush's policy and that China has no plan to lift martial law in Tibet. Mr. Eagleburger secretly visited Beijing with Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, in July and December. 
 
Getting Worse, Not Better
Administration officials say the crackdown has become harsher in the last few months, with more surveillance of dissidents, more political education classes for students, more restrictions on overseas study and more persecution of the Roman Catholic Church and other religious groups.
In addition, the officials said, the Government has recently purged or punished many Chinese journalists and police officials who expressed support for the democracy movement or did not take a firm stand against it.
Administration officials said they hoped that, by openly expressing their disappointment with China, they could coax Beijing to end the abuse of human rights.
In a surprise to the Administration, trade with China was booming even as repression increased there. Commerce Department data show that Chinese exports to the United States rose 42 percent last year, to a total of $12 billion. Much of the increase occurred in the second half of 1989, despite the killings in and near Tiananmen Square early in June. The Beijing authorities have been hard pressed to obtain convertible currency to pay off foreign-debt obligations.
 
Personal Embarrassment to Bush
For Mr. Bush, these developments represent a special problem because he invested a lot of political standing in defending his China policy and risked his reputation as someone knowledgeable about the country, where he served as chief of the United States mission in 1974 and 1975.
Mr. Bush now voices such disappointment, sometimes even irritation, but has no new policy. In an interview with NBC News last week, he acknowledged that ''there hasn't been much'' give yet by the Chinese, and he said, ''I wish there would be more.''
His criticism of China is far milder than that in the State Department's annual report on human rights, which sharply assailed Chinese abuses. ''I believe I know how to go about trying to see things move forward again,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Some think isolation -bring them to heel by publicly slapping people. I think I know China well enough to know that this isn't the way to do it.''
Beijing vilified Mr. Bush for allowing the State Department to issue the report. It further strained relations with Washington this week when it expelled an American businessman, John P. Cragin, on a charge of conducting ''illegal religious instruction.'' China said he had done ''missionary work under the guise of holding English-language- training courses in Tianjin since October 1989.''
 
How State Dept. Sees It
A State Department official said: ''We hoped there would be more of a response to the President's overtures. We are still hoping. The people in power in China today fear that if they do the things we would like them to do to heal the wounds of last June, they will jeopardize their own personal positions.''
The increase in trade between China and the United States would have been impossible if Congress had imposed stiff economic sanctions, as many lawmakers advocated last summer. Mr. Bush persuaded Congress to hold off, arguing that commercial contacts were good because they ''have led, in essence, to this quest for more freedom'' in China.
''The Chinese are desperately trying to increase exports,'' said Jan M. Whisler, an economist at the United States International Trade Commission. ''China must now depend almost entirely on export revenues for the hard currency needed to service its foreign debt of nearly $40 billion.'' Major payments on the debt are due this year.
A new fight looms in June over trade benefits. China's most-favored-nation status, which generally guarantees the lowest possible tariffs on exports to the United States, is scheduled to expire July 2. Administration officials say Mr. Bush will seek a regular annual extension of that status for China. Many in Congress are already gearing up to resist. At least six bills have been introduced to suspend or terminate China's status as a most favored nation.
 
Use of 'Forced Labor'
Senate Republicans are collecting evidence to show that some of China's exports, particularly textiles, were produced in prisons and labor camps. Federal law prohibits the importing of any goods produced in a foreign country by ''forced labor'' or ''convict labor.'' Textiles accounted for $3.2 billion of the $12 billion in Chinese exports to the United States last year.
Roger W. Sullivan, president of the United States-China Business Council, a trade association of 300 American companies doing business there, said there would be ''a very strong challenge by Congress to renewal of most-favored-nation status for China.''
Although quick to acknowledge that Mr. Bush has not achieved his objectives, White House officials are sensitive to criticism of the President's China policy.
Mr. Scowcroft complains bitterly that his toast ''to U.S.-Chinese friendship,'' at a banquet in Beijing on Dec. 9, has been misread as an endorsement of the military crackdown. Likewise, Douglas H. Paal, the senior specialist on China at the National Security Council, severely criticized a report on China issued last month by Asia Watch, a human rights group. When Is Ferocity Restraint? Mr. Paal marked up a copy of the report with marginal commentary, like a professor's comments on a student's essay. Asia Watch said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army had shown ''ferocity'' in suppressing the democracy movement.
Mr. Paal wrote: ''Some of the P.L.A. actions were indeed ferocious - other units at other times did show great restraint.''
Asia Watch said that thousands of peaceful dissenters were being detained in China without trials. Mr. Paal wrote, ''The very fact that so many detainees have not been tried indicates some degree of restraint.''
People who originally backed Mr. Bush's policy say they, too, have been disappointed. A. Doak Barnett, professor emeritus of Chinese studies at Johns Hopkins University, said he supported Mr. Bush's effort to ''halt the downward spiral in our relations with China'' by sending Mr. Eagleburger and Mr. Scowcroft to Beijing in December.
''That mission had valid objectives and was worth trying,'' said Mr. Barnett, who has been studying China for more than four decades. ''But the Chinese have not responded sufficiently to indicate a reversal of repressive trends or to have a significant impact on American public opinion or Congress.''

HEADLINE: MILITARY LEADER RESIGNS IN HAITI; ELECTION PROMISED

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, March 10

 BODY:
Lieut. Gen. Prosper Avril, Haiti's military ruler for the last 18 months, stepped down today after a week of nationwide protests. An army officer said a provisional government would take power within 72 hours to organize elections.
The announcement of the resignation was read over national television shortly after 3 P.M. by Gen. Herard Abraham, who until now has been the acting Chief of Staff of the army.
General Avril made no statement. Diplomats said he was expected to leave the country in the next day or so. 
 
Fifth Change in Four Years
General Avril's resignation is the fifth time power has changed hands in four years of political turmoil since widespread unrest forced President Jean-Claude Duvalier to flee the country in February 1986, ending nearly three decades of family dictatorship. Continuing abuses under successive military regimes, including an election day massacre in 1987, have prompted Washington to withhold assistance considered vital to Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.
General Abraham said the mission of the army was ''to re-establish peace and order within 72 hours in order to hand over power to a provisional Government that conforms with the spirit of the Constitution and will have the task of organizing elections.''
 
Court Justice to Be Elevated
Haitian political leaders and foreign diplomats said that according to a plan worked out with General Avril, an as yet unidentified justice of the Supreme Court was to be named by General Abraham to lead the new government. The selection of the head of government, the leaders and diplomats said, will be made through a consensus of civilian leaders.
Haiti's Consitution calls for the chief of the Supreme Court to replace the President when a vacancy develops. But the present chief of the court, Gilbert Austin, is regarded as a close ally of General Avril.
The sole mandate of the new government is to be to organize presidential elections ''in a minimum of three months and a maximum of six months,'' said Marc Bazin, a former executive of the World Bank and one of the leading contenders for the presidency.
 
General Pledges Democracy
General Abraham pledged that the army would work with the rest of the country to establish democracy.
The army, he said, would ''assist and not oppose'' the people of Haiti in ''taking a first step toward resolving the institutional crisis that the country is experiencing.''
He said the task of restoring order and installing a new Government was ''a real challenge.''
''But,'' he said, ''the army of Haiti, showing discipline and embodying the ideal of greatness, will employ all its resources to to this end.''
In a cautious statement issued here and in Washington, the United States Government said it welcomed General Abraham's declaration that he planned to turn over power within 72 hours and said it would be prepared to help the provisional government ''conduct free and fair elections under international observation at the earliest possible date.''
Pressure had been building against General Avril as Haitians became convinced that he was unlikely to lead them to democratic elections and as economic conditions grew steadily worse. The 52-year-old general was accused of condoning human rights abuses and of permitting soldiers to terrorize Haiti with violent robberies and street killings.
In a series of radio interviews, many of Haiti's civilian political leaders reacted favorably to the statement from General Abraham. But some radical leaders and many ordinary Haitians expressed concern that General Avril was still in the country, that the transfer to civilian authority was not immediate and that General Abraham did not explicitedly state that a civilian would be taking power. Civilian political leaders said General Avril had apparently left the presidential palace, but they said they were not sure where he would spend the next hours.
 
Bonfires in Streets
Crowds of Haitians had begun milling in the streets of the capital from late morning as news of the impending resignation announcement spread. Some streets were blocked with bonfires, and three buildings, including two Government offices, were sacked. But no injuries were reported.
The political leaders and diplomats said General Avril, who took power in a coup on Sept. 17, 1988, had disclosed his decision to resign in meetings with the Vatican and American ambassadors at his family mansion in the cool hills above the capital.
The politicians and diplomats said that in negotiations over the last few days, General Avril had sought assurances that there would be no reprisals against him or the soldiers of the Presidential Guard, who have been his main source of power. In an attempt to prevent violence by the Presidential Guard, diplomats said, the force of about 1,200 soldiers was being dismantled and dispersed to military posts around the country.
Shortly after noon, before the resignation announcement, mobs sacked two Government offices in the capital and the offices of Gregoire Eugene, a lawyer and presidential candidate widely regarded as having been a supporter of General Avril. The police used tear gas to disperse another mob that was advancing on a radio station operated by an Avril supporter. There were no reports of injuries.
After the collapse of the Duvalier dictatorship four years ago, mobs rampaged through the main cities, lynching members of the civilian security forces known as the Tontons Macoute and wrecking homes of Duvalier officials. Similar attacks took place 18 months ago when Lieut. Gen. Henri Namphy was deposed and replaced by General Avril.
The political leaders, meeting as a group of 12, declared on local radio stations on Friday that no actions would be taken against members of the armed forces. But one diplomat said: ''That's the leaders talking. Let's see how the people react.''
The Haitian politicians and diplomats said they believed General Avril had decided to step down as the demonstrations, which started Monday, spread to all the major cities of Haiti and promised to continue into next week. Stores, offices and schools across the country had been shut.
 
'We Were Going Nowhere'
''The whole country was blocked up,'' Mr. Bazin, the former World Bank official, said. ''We were going nowhere.''
A diplomat added: ''The country was falling down all around him. It became apparent that nobody had any confidence in his Government.''
Though the police had been seen clubbing protesters and shooting into crowds during the week, no more than about half a dozen deaths and 40 or 50 injuries have been reported in the demonstrations. The Presidential Guard is the only effective armed unit in the country, and General Avril appeared to have at his command far more force than he chose to use.
''The impression people have had from the beginning was that Avril was not a ruthless killer, not the kind to give the order to mow down groups of civilians,'' a diplomat said. ''The reason he's leaving, I think, is that he feels that otherwise there would be a lot more unrest and bloodshed.''
President Duvalier had even more force available to him, and he, too, stepped down earlier than diplomats studying the balance of power had expected. Several dozen people are believed to have died in anti-Duvalier protests, but he was also said to have had no stomach for bloodshed.
In addition to the mounting pressure from Haitians in the streets, General Avril faced a call for his resignation from political, civic and business leaders, who for the first time in recent history united to speak with a single voice.
Some of the Haitian political leaders said the United States Ambassador, Alvin P. Adams, had played a key role in bringing General Avril's opponents together. They noted a sharp contrast from the days preceding the disastrous attempt at presidential elections in November 1987 when the American Embassy here, led by Ambassador Brunson McKinley, repeatedly expressed confidence that the regime of General Namphy would insure free and fair elections. The elections were halted after more than 34 voters had been gunned down or hacked to death; witnesses said that both civilians and soldiers had been wielding weapons.
''It was very positive,'' Mr. Bazin said of the role of Mr. Adams. ''It was quite a positive change.''
The United States suspended more than $70 million in economic aid after the election killings in 1987 but continued to provide about $35 million in aid to private social organizations for food and medical assistance.
''The United States certainly urged the political groups and the different sectors to work together to effect peaceful democratic change,'' an American official said.
General Avril had been a close adviser to both Francois Duvalier, the founder of the family dictorship, and his son, Jean-Claude, and he had grown wealthy as a result. He served as a broker with foreign weapons dealers and had an office in the national bank. Documents recovered after the collapse of the dictatorship showed that the family had drained millions of dollars from Government agencies.
General Namphy was widely regarded as brutal and incompetent. When General Avril replaced him, in a coup that was said to have been carried out by enlisted members of the Presidential Guard, he was viewed as intelligent and crafty, but perhaps not trustworthy.
He promised from the start to lead the country to elections. But like General Namphy before him, he stalled repeatedly, saying the country was not yet ready for them. He worked out a schedule of elections for this year, starting with voting for mayors and town councils and ending in the selection of a president. He said the process would give voters the experience necessary to make a wise decision for the highest office.
Most political leaders wanted to have presidential elections first, but agreed to go along the Avril plan.
The United States, France and Canada were considering restoring and increasing aid to Haiti, based on the general's promises and limited progress.
But in late January, for reasons that are still unclear, General Avril abruptly declared a state of siege, arresting, beating and exiling some political leaders. Aides said the leaders would be permitted to come back to Haiti after a national legislature had been selected. The political leaders said this would enable General Avril to engineer the selection of legislators and through the national assembly influence the presidential election and ultimately curtail presidential powers.
Street violence, believed to have been carried out by members of the armed forces, remained high under General Avril. International human rights groups accused the Avril Government of abuses. Foreign aid and loans from the World Bank and other international financial organizations strongly influenced by the United States were not forthcoming. Foreign investors stayed away.
Prices of basic foods rose and the Government's cash reserves dwindled. The Government teetered on the brink of economic collapse, often uncertain until the last minute whether it would have the money to pay for monthly petroleum and wheat shipments.
The Haitian political leaders said that in addition to the American Ambassador, the French and Vatican Ambassadors, Rafael Dufour and Msgr. Paolo Romeo, were also instrumental in discussions with General Avril.
The political leaders said General Avril had hoped to remain as commander of the army, after relinquishing the presidency, and to continue living in the country. But he was told that was not possible, they said.
The politicians and diplomats said General Avril was expected to leave Haiti a day or so after handing over power. He reportedly owns a house in Belgium, but it was not clear where he would go.
''I think he was perhaps concerned that if he got on a plane immediately, some members of the Presidential Guard might be scared into some kind of reaction,'' a diplomat said.

HEADLINE: American Voices: Doubts As the Cold War Ends - A Special Report:
In U.S, Unease as World Changes

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 10

 BODY:
For Americans everywhere, the news from abroad in recent months has been both dazzling and disorienting.
The faraway events that have played across the nation's living rooms - the collapse of the Berlin wall, the overthrow of Communist governments, reforms sweeping the Soviet Union - came with such velocity and drama that at times they seemed unreal, as if someone had punched the fast-forward button on history.
From conversations around the country - with college students in Michigan and farmers in Nebraska, military industry workers in Southern California and civil rights workers in Mississippi, business leaders in Dallas and high school students in suburban Denver - it is clear that those events have had another profound effect. They have begun to reshape how Americans view themselves and their country.
 
Visions of Opportunities
Some see this as a moment of fresh opportunity, of peaceful possibilities that will in time allow the nation to switch resources from the military to domestic programs that will improve lives. 
''Isn't this what we all have been praying for all these years?'' asked Harold Cooprider, a retired psychologist living in Newport Beach, Calif. ''Every American should be proud.''
But if there was a common mood among the scores of Americans interviewed, it was hardly a mood of triumph. While there was a strong sense that the Soviet Union had probably lost the cold war, few were willing to say the United States had won.
Most of those interviewed expressed apprehension, as if the fading of the Communist threat only illuminated other perils, especially the specter of sharpened economic competition with the Germans and the Japanese, who now loom larger than life as masters of technology and manufacturing. ''We're just not a superpower anymore,'' said Douglas Hausman, a junior at Albion College in Michigan. ''Economically, we are not as strong as Japan or West Germany right now. Maybe militarily we are stronger. But these countries can call our bluff anytime they want because they own so much of us.''
Some said the moment should serve as a wake-up call to the country to save its economy. ''On a personal level, the fact is that my generation may not have it as good as our parents did,'' said Julie French, another Albion student. ''The fact is that we are going to have to work harder.''
Throughout the conversations ran a strain of wariness about the permanence of reforms in the Soviet Union. Many people expressed admiration for Mikhail S. Gorbachev, but a few are not sure exactly what he is up to. ''He's either the greatest statesman in history or the world's greatest aluminum-siding salesman,'' said Larry Worsham, who manages a small radio station in Louisiana.
 
The Diminishing of America?
 Many of those interviewed seemed to think that America's institutions and leaders might not be quite up to the new world taking shape. And some said they believed that with its adversary diminished America would be diminished, too, as it cuts back its forces and its presence in Europe.
''The decline of the Soviet Union is also the decline of the United States in terms of its relative importance in the world,'' said Shari Cohen, a graduate student in Soviet affairs at the University of California at Berkeley.
All those interviewed - the students, the workers, the business people - say in their own way that the country is passing through a watershed and Americans will have to make some fundamental decisions about where they are going and what they intend to be.
 
Dallas
 
The Fading Of an Enemy
 At Hoffbrau Steaks, a restaurant and tavern in Dallas, there used to be a sign over the bar. It read: ''Russian vodka not served here.'' The general manager, Matt Hanifen, put the sign up in 1980, when the Soviets had just invaded Afghanistan and President Carter boycotted the Olympics. ''No one liked the Russians back then,'' he said.
Last year the bar quietly started serving Stolichnaya, a Russian vodka, and about three months ago Ray Bond, the bartender, took the sign down. No fanfare. ''The sign just wasn't right anymore,'' Mr. Bond said.
Besides, Mr. Hanifen said, America's mood has changed. ''Russia isn't our enemy anymore,'' he said.
And that leads to a question: If the Soviet Union is no longer America's enemy, does the country need another one?
 
A Choice of Necessary Enemies
Just across town Richard Condon had an answer. Mr. Condon is the author of ''The Manchurian Candidate,'' about American prisoners in Korea who are brainwashed by their Chinese Communist captors and programmed to assassinate on coded command.
''Now that the Communists have been put to sleep,'' Mr. Condon said, ''we are going to have to invent another terrible threat. And we have four choices, which isn't bad. We have Iran. We have Japan. We have Latin America. And we have the Common Market juncture in 1992.''
For politicians, enemies are necessary, even vital, Mr. Condon said. ''The basic ruse of the professional politician is, whenever possible, to set people against one another, because it keeps them from thinking about how the infrastructure is falling apart,'' he said.
He says he sadly fears that the enemy of choice will be Japan. ''It's just so much easier to create an enemy out of people who don't look like Aunt Mary,'' the writer said.
 
The Russians as Bugs Bunny
Down in Bastrup, in northern Louisiana, Larry Worsham, general manager of KMYQ, a small radio station operating out of a tumbledown house, said he did not feel any safer with the changes overseas. Nor did he believe America had won.
''Let me put it this way,'' Mr. Worsham said. ''Do you remember those cartoons where Elmer Fudd would come running at the door and just before he got there Bugs Bunny would open the door and Elmer Fudd would go running right on through and off a cliff? And he would just hang there in mid-air?''
''Well,'' Mr. Worsham said. ''I feel like the Russians just pulled open the door on us.''
 
 
 
Kimball, Neb.
 
All-Quiet Front Of the Cold War
 Farmers sow their crops right up to the edge of the fences that surround the missile sites scattered across remote Kimball County, Neb., and parts of neighboring Colorado and Wyoming. Cattle graze nearby. Except for the small metal signs on fences warning trespassers that ''deadly force'' will be used against them, the missile sites are just another break in the long horizon.
In a way, this is about as close as one comes in America to the front lines of the cold war. Armed with nuclear warheads, the Minuteman 3 missiles buried in the High Plains are aimed at targets in the Soviet Union, where, presumably, there are missiles aimed at Kimball County.
''I know things are a long way from settled,'' said Jim Robinson, a jeweler in Kimball, a town of about 3,000 people. ''But with the changes in Europe and Russia, I do feel Kimball is a little less of a target than we once were.''
 
Missiles? Few Were Worried
At the Holiday Restaurant Walt Thummel, a wheat farmer, said he was like most people around Kimball: they never paid much attention to the missiles because they never believed the missiles would be used.
''I don't know how a serious threat they ever were,'' Mr. Thummel said, adding that he could not recall when he last thought of the Soviets, the bomb or nuclear war. ''No, it's not the military threat I worry about; I worry more about the economics.''
''That's right,'' said Frank Rasmussen, another farmer. ''Ten years from now, how do kids make a living? What's going to happen to them when they can't afford houses or pay their taxes?''
Life has been tough in Kimball, as in a lot of small towns. Export markets for its wheat have dried up, and prices have been flat. The price of the oil that used to be pumped from the surrounding plains has fallen so low that most of the stripper wells have been capped. And there isn't much profit anymore in beef either. ''We're just slipping farther behind Japan, and maybe Europe too,'' Mr. Rasmussen said.
Mr. Thummel nodded. ''I don't think America is the world's savior anymore,'' he said. ''We got too many problems of our own, and people just don't respect us the way they used to. It's the same way with the Russians, except they ran out of money first.''
 
A Vote for Gorbachev
But, he said, he sure does like Mr. Gorbachev. ''If he ran for President here, he'd probably he elected,'' Mr. Thummel said. ''I think he does not speak with a forked tongue. I think you can believe him.'' Alden Anderson, also a farmer, listened and shook his head. ''Well, I hope you boys are right,'' he said. ''I hope he turns out to be what we hope. But we've got to keep our eyes open too. Those people don't know how to handle democracy yet. What happens if they get impatient?''
Mr. Rasmussen laughed. ''I can agree with that,'' he said. ''It's like me and my Social Security check. I always want it right now.''
 
 
 
Orange County, Calif.
 
Optimism At Yacht Club
 At a Kiwanis Club luncheon last month in Corona Del Mar, a wealthy and very Republican part of Orange County, Charles Hoover rose to speak, He told his colleagues that a friend in Germany had just mailed him a chip of concrete from the Berlin wall.
It was a small but emotional memento, Mr. Hoover explained. He treasures it, he said, not as a souvenir but as a symbol of the ideals that Americans and Germans now share.
''I am not so much proud about what has happened in Germany, but rather humble,'' said Mr. Hoover, who owns a small heating and air-conditioning business. ''I'm glad we have a system that works, and I hope it will work for them now, too.''
These are comfortable people, several of them retired, living in one of America's most favored places. They were eating their lunch at a yacht club overlooking Balboa Island, on the kind of bright, warm late-winter day that does credit to the local Chamber of Commerce.
For the most part, they are optimists as they discuss what is happening overseas. ''For someone who went through a war, the greatest joy for me is the realization my grandchildren will most likely grow up in a world where there is no threat of a bomb,'' said Eric Roberts, an insurance broker from Newport Beach, Calif.
They see themselves reflected in the democratic movements in Eastern Europe and feel at one with the people there, especially with Mr. Gorbachev.
''I think he is a miracle man, a person of courage and charisma,'' said Dave Gambill, a real estate man from Corona Del Mar. ''I think he would make a good Republican.''
 
 
 
Palmdale, Calif.
 
The Road Back After B-1's Fall
 As many as 7,500 workers were once employed at Rockwell International's aerospace plants in Palmdale, in the desert north of Los Angeles. They were helping to build the B-1 bomber. But now that work is done, and nearly all were laid off.
About 1,500 of them are now back, hired for a variety of projects, like building a new Air Force gunship and renovating commercial airliners. An additional 425 are building a fifth space shuttle, for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
These are not good times for manufacturing workers in America, given the decline in high-paying factory jobs as a result of foreign competition and new production technology. Now the changes overseas appear to make life even more perilous for some workers in the arms-making industry.
 
'We Didn't Win Anything'
''It's great the wall came down,'' said Gary Sanders, who works at Rockwell. ''It's great that families who have been separated for so long can come together - that people can now choose their own government.''
But that's where the sentiment ends. ''We didn't win anything when Communism collapsed,'' Joseph Dagg Jr. said, ''because we're not No. 1 anymore. And unless we change our attitude and stop letting Japan and Korea and everyone else kick us in the butt every day of the week, we're never going to be America again.''
Like the Western grain farmers who once decried the faraway Eastern banks and Eastern railroads for manipulating their lives and markets, there is a frustration among many American workers who see their lives and their livelihoods as hostage to distant financial interests, to foreign banks and foreign investors.
 
'Save Ourselves First'
''What we need are tariffs; our industries need protection,'' said Raymond Michaud, another worker. ''All these other countries have checks and balances to protect themselves. Here we just open the door. No wonder the Japanese paid Ronald Reagan $2 million to come speak. They owe him.''
Rose M. Dagg, who is Mr. Dagg's wife and a union official, said, ''Instead of talking about how to rebuild Eastern Europe, I'd like to hear more talk about rebuilding this country,'' adding, ''Maybe we ought to save ourselves first.''
''What there is left to save,'' Mr. Sanders added.
But what about nuclear war? Shouldn't people feel safer now?
''Well, it's true that I don't worry about Japan trying to bomb us,'' Mr. Dagg said, ''because I know they're not going to bomb something they already own.''
 
 
 
Fort Worth
 
Unneeded Arms, And Alternatives
 Robert H. Trice is director of business development for General Dynamics, which makes the F-16 fighter jet and heavy tanks, among other things. His is a tough job these days.
If the changes in Europe mean a need for fewer tanks and fewer aircraft, it will almost certainly mean less work for his company and other military contractors.
So, one of Mr. Trice's jobs is to look at new opportunities and new markets for General Dynamics. The company is working now on a project with the Japanese for joint production of an advanced fighter jet. What of Traditional Allies? And there is more. Counterterrorism, for example. ''We are going to need to provide increased security assistance and economic aid to our traditional allies,'' Mr. Trice said. What happens, he asks, when Turkish workers displaced in Germany stop sending money back home to Turkey? Or what if Yugoslavia falls apart and unrest threatens Greece?
''We may have to spend more to secure these allies than before,'' he said. ''But instead of doing it with heavy weapons, they will need surveillance aircraft and verification equipment.''
And then there is the war on drugs, and the possibility of what Mr. Trice called ''limited incursions'' into other countries. ''It's just going to shift,'' he said. ''You are going to need forces who are retrained and more mobile. That could mean a whole new generation of light equipment.''
 
 
 
Chicago
 
Picking Up The Pieces
 When change is rampant, opportunity abounds. And people from bankers to students are looking to Eastern Europe to see what's in it for them. Even the Communist Party in America sees some dividends coming its way.
The day the Berlin wall came down, said Scott Marshall, the Illinois state organizer for the Communist Party U.S.A., he was visited by a real estate agent who works in an office below party headquarters, on Chicago's South Side.
''He came in and said, 'Pretty tough day for you guys, huh?' '' Mr. Marshall recalled. ''But I think we kind of surprised him. Because I told him we thought it was a pretty good day. I told him Communists believe in democracy and personal freedom too.''
 
An Eye on the Mainstream
If anyone thinks the turmoil in the Soviet Union and the collapse of Communist governments are bad news for the Communist cause in America, Mr. Marshall said, they should think again.
''Back when the cold war fears were going, people were suspicious of Communists,'' he said, adding that now people would be a little more open. He pointed to the visit by the real estate agent as an example. ''I think it will help us get into the mainstream.''
For those looking for financial, rather than ideological, gains from the events in Europe, there is a new magazine, Bloc, published in New York City that addresses business opportunities in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
And in Dallas, John H. Falb, executive vice president of NCNB Texas, the state's biggest bank, said he and other international bankers around the country were being besieged by investors trying to make sense of what was going on in Eastern Europe.
''We're trying to learn how to pronounce the names of places we haven't heard of since World War I,'' Mr. Falb said.
He added that a bank customer in North Carolina had acquired the cable television rights for much of Poland, although he said the success of the venture depends on more Poles' owning television sets.
 
 
 
Greenville, Miss.
 
Awaiting A New World
 Over the last couple of months, said Larry Farmer, a community organizer in the Mississippi Delta, people have marveled over the changes in Europe and the Soviet Union.
''They say, 'Well, democracy works, doesn't it?' '' Mr. Farmer said. ''And I usually say, 'Why don't you go to Metcalfe, Miss., and tell me if you still think democracy works.' ''
''We have communities in Mississippi without running water or toilets,'' he said. ''We got crack cocaine killing our youth. We got horrible statistics on venereal disease. If we are going to talk about millions or billions for Poland or Czechoslavakia, let alone the defense industries, let's talk about money for Mississippi. We could use a little foreign aid, too.''
Mr. Farmer was speaking at the scene of a a conference in Greenville on poverty and the rural family. The changes in Europe were not on the agenda, but he said he thought there was a strong connection.
''The warming of the cold war ought to now allow us time to back off, to reflect and look inward at our problems,'' Mr. Farmer said. He helps organize community groups in the small, rundown, mostly black towns of rural western Mississippi.
 
Pioneering for Democracy
Nearby, in the sunroom of his large home, Charles Victor McTeer recalled coming to Mississippi in the late 1960's, as a young black law student from Maryland who wanted to help bring democracy to the rural South. Now he watches with awe and disbelief as the forces of democracy challenge Communist regimes and authoritarian rule from Moscow to Pretoria.
Referring to Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. McTeer said, ''He has forced all of us to rethink our existence on the planet, from the people in Lithuania and Romania and South African to blacks in rural Mississippi and poor whites in West Virginia and Mexicans in Texas looking for a job.''
In this new world, Mr. McTeer said, everything is interdependent. ''Think of the impact of all this. If the Russians are now going to be driving Hondas too, it means in 20 years from now the price of gas is going to be astronomical. And that means that even if Mandela is free, we are still going to have to figure out to how to feed South Africa.''
There is a new world coming, Mr. McTeer said. ''And in that new world, everyone eats; everyone is entitled to a piece of the action.''
''And I think it is going to happen,'' he added. ''I just think it is funny if George Bush does it instead of Jesse Jackson.''

HEADLINE: Bush Distressed As Policy Fails To Move China

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 10

 BODY:
 President Bush and many officials in his Administration say they are deeply disappointed by the failure of the Chinese Government to relax its repressive rule in response to numerous conciliatory gestures by Mr. Bush.
The American officials explained that divisions within the Chinese leadership, compounded by fears about a resurgence of the democracy movement in China after the rapid democratic change in Eastern Europe, have made it difficult for Beijing to respond as the President had hoped.
Those concerned about the meager results so far include the architects of Mr. Bush's policy and some who carried it out, like Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger. He acknowledged in recent Congressional testimony that the repression continued after his visits to China, that there has been no ''rapid payoff'' from Mr. Bush's policy and that China has no plan to lift martial law in Tibet. Mr. Eagleburger secretly visited Beijing with Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, in July and December. 
 
Getting Worse, Not Better
Administration officials say the crackdown has become harsher in the last few months, with more surveillance of dissidents, more political education classes for students, more restrictions on overseas study and more persecution of the Roman Catholic Church and other religious groups.
In addition, the officials said, the Government has recently purged or punished many Chinese journalists and police officials who expressed support for the democracy movement or did not take a firm stand against it. Administration officials said they hoped that, by openly expressing their disappointment with China, they could coax Beijing to end the abuse of human rights.
In a surprise to the Administration, trade with China was booming even as repression increased there. Commerce Department data show that Chinese exports to the United States rose 42 percent last year, to a total of $12 billion. Much of the increase occurred in the second half of 1989, despite the killings in and near Tiananmen Square early in June. The Beijing authorities have been hard pressed to obtain convertible currency to pay off foreign-debt obligations.
 
Personally Embarrassing to Bush
For Mr. Bush, these developments represent a special problem because he invested a lot of political standing in defending his China policy and risked his reputation as someone knowledgeable about the country, where he served as chief of the United States mission in 1974 and 1975.
Mr. Bush now voices such disappointment, sometimes even irritation, but has no new policy. In an interview with NBC News last week, he acknowledged that ''there hasn't been much'' give yet by the Chinese, and he said, ''I wish there would be more.''
His criticism of China is far milder than that in the State Department's annual report on human rights, which sharply assailed Chinese abuses. ''I believe I know how to go about trying to see things move forward again,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Some think isolation -bring them to heel by publicly slapping people. I think I know China well enough to know that this isn't the way to do it.''
Beijing vilified Mr. Bush for allowing the State Department to issue the report. It further strained relations with Washington this week when it expelled an American businessman, John P. Cragin, on a charge of conducting ''illegal religious instruction.'' China said he had done ''missionary work under the guise of holding English-language- training courses in Tianjin since October 1989.''
 
How State Dept. Sees It
A State Department official said: ''We hoped there would be more of a response to the President's overtures. We are still hoping. The people in power in China today fear that if they do the things we would like them to do to heal the wounds of last June, they will jeopardize their own personal positions.''
The increase in trade between China and the United States would have been impossible if Congress had imposed stiff economic sanctions, as many lawmakers advocated last summer. Mr. Bush persuaded Congress to hold off, arguing that commercial contacts were good because they ''have led, in essence, to this quest for more freedom'' in China.
''The Chinese are desperately trying to increase exports,'' said Jan M. Whisler, an economist at the United States International Trade Commission. ''China must now depend almost entirely on export revenues for the hard currency needed to service its foreign debt of nearly $40 billion.'' Major payments on the debt are due this year.
A new fight looms in June over trade benefits. China's most-favored-nation status, which generally guarantees the lowest possible tariffs on exports to the United States, is scheduled to expire July 2. Administration officials say Mr. Bush will seek a regular annual extension of that status for China. Many in Congress are already gearing up to resist. At least six bills have been introduced to suspend or terminate China's status as a most favored nation.
 
Use of 'Forced Labor'
Senate Republicans are collecting evidence to show that some of China's exports, particularly textiles, were produced in prisons and labor camps. Federal law prohibits the importing of any goods produced in a foreign country by ''forced labor'' or ''convict labor.'' Textiles accounted for $3.2 billion of the $12 billion in Chinese exports to the United States last year.
Roger W. Sullivan, president of the United States-China Business Council, a trade association of 300 American companies doing business there, said there would be ''a very strong challenge by Congress to renewal of most-favored-nation status for China.''
Although quick to acknowledge that Mr. Bush has not achieved his objectives, White House officials are sensitive to criticism of the President's China policy.
Mr. Scowcroft complains bitterly that his toast ''to U.S.-Chinese friendship,'' at a banquet in Beijing on Dec. 9, has been misread as an endorsement of the military crackdown. Likewise, Douglas H. Paal, the senior specialist on China at the National Security Council, severely criticized a report on China issued last month by Asia Watch, a human rights group. When Is Ferocity, Restraint? Mr. Paal marked up a copy of the report with marginal commentary, like a professor's comments on a student's essay. Asia Watch said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army had shown ''ferocity'' in suppressing the democracy movement.
Mr. Paal wrote: ''Some of the P.L.A. actions were indeed ferocious - other units at other times did show great restraint.''
Asia Watch said that thousands of peaceful dissenters were being detained in China without trials. Mr. Paal wrote, ''The very fact that so many detainees have not been tried indicates some degree of restraint.''
People who originally backed Mr. Bush's policy say they, too, have been disappointed. A. Doak Barnett, professor emeritus of Chinese studies at Johns Hopkins University, said he supported Mr. Bush's effort to ''halt the downward spiral in our relations with China'' by sending Mr. Eagleburger and Mr. Scowcroft to Beijing in December.
''That mission had valid objectives and was worth trying,'' said Mr. Barnett, who has been studying China for more than four decades. ''But the Chinese have not responded sufficiently to indicate a reversal of repressive trends or to have a significant impact on American public opinion or Congress.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Pressed to Pay for Boat People in Hong Kong

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, March 10

 BODY:
Britain is pressing the Bush Administration to pay most of the cost of caring for the tens of thousands of Vietnamese boat people now being housed in its colony of Hong Kong, as well as for building a new refugee camp, possibly on Guam, diplomats and United Nations officials here say.
The British request for up to $80 million in American aid for the Hong Kong boat people, who now number about 55,000, reflects London's concern that the international community is not paying its share of the cost and irritation with the United States for opposing the forcible return of boat people to Vietnam.
The new United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Thorvald Stoltenberg, a former Foreign Minister of Norway, has also written to President Bush underscoring the seriousness of the crisis Hong Kong faces and urging him to change America's position and agree to the compulsory repatriation of those boat people judged economic migrants rather than refugees from persecution, those officials say.
Last year the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, who has traditionally reimbursed Hong Kong for caring for the boat people, paid only about $8 million of the $20 million cost. This year the cost of all the boat people seeking asylum throughout Southeast Asia is supposed to be met by the 29 member governments of the Comprehensive Plan of Action on Indochinese Refugees, adopted at a United Nations-sponsored conference in Geneva last June. 
 
U.S. and Hanoi Block Accord
Although those countries promised to contribute a total of $108 million on a voluntary basis, they have only paid about $15 million so far, with the United States giving $11 million. As a result, Britain fears Hong Kong will again be left to pay most of its bill itself.
Last January the member governments of the Comprehensive Plan of Action came close to approving a British proposal to return those Vietnamese who do not qualify as refugees under international law. But the United States and Vietnam blocked the accord by insisting on at least a year's delay before mandatory repatriation could begin, while Britain refused to wait beyond June.
As a result, diplomats say, Britain feels the United States should be held responsible for the extra bills it faces for looking after the Hong Kong boat people as well as for the cost of building the new camp that would be necessary to house any new influx that arrives this year. To underscore its irritation, Britain has even suggested that the United States build such a camp on its own territory, the island of Guam, or in the Philippines.
The Bush Administration's refusal to sanction the boat people's forced repatriation is criticized by many diplomats from recipient countries as being essentially a domestic political gesture that reflects its reluctance to be seen endorsing the return of refugees to the Hanoi Government.
Of the 55,000 boat people in Hong Kong, about 44,000 are eligible for screening by the British authorities to determine whether they are political refugees and may thus face possible return to Vietnam. About 8,000 have been screened so far, with only about 12 percent of those gaining refugee status.
Although Britain wanted international endorsement for its plan to start returning boat people by force, it has said it will go ahead without that once it has completed arrangements with Vietnam, including permission for international agencies to monitor the treatment the returning boat people receive.
Refugee officials say the number of new arrivals in Hong Kong and elsewhere in Southeast Asia so far this year is well below last year's levels. They say that is one of several indications they have received that Northern Vietnamese, who make up most of the boat people, are becoming more aware of the overcrowded conditions awaiting them in refugee camps and the danger of forced repatriation.

Romanian Rebel Predicts Slow Progress

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
The clergyman whose defiance helped start the rebellion that toppled Romania's Communist dictatorship in December says he believes that centrist forces can retain enough strength in elections on May 20 to maintain momentum toward democracy.
''I think there will not be an absolute winner,'' the cleric, the Rev. Laszlo Tokes, said in an interview in Manhattan on Friday.
''But with a small majority,'' he said, ''the National Salvation Front will continue to lead the country.
''The apparatus men realize they cannot turn back the wheel of history, but they want to save themselves,'' Mr. Tokes said, referring to the bureacracy that in large part remains in place despite the overthrow of the Ceausescu regime. 
The right-wing parties that surfaced after the execution of President Nicolae Ceausescu ''are not strong enough to form a coalition government,'' the 37-year-old Protestant pastor said, and will act as ''a counterpoint against the other extremity.''
''I assume that in a slow and compromised way the changes will go on,'' he added. The minister spoke in English throughout the interview.
 
A Trip to Rally Support
Mr. Tokes, a Romanian of Hungarian descent, said he arrived in the United States last week on a visit to rally support for democracy in Romania. ''The guarantee of the success of this social change is the international democratic forces,'' he said. ''We have to strengthen these guarantees for the world and for Romania.''
Two and a half months ago, Mr. Tokes (pronounced TOE-kesh) was in hiding, spirited from village to village as remnants of the Securitate, Romania's hated security police, sought to kill him.
For eight years, as minister of the Reformed Church in Timisoara, a city in Transylvania in western Romania, Mr. Tokes wrote treatises and organized protests in defiance of Mr. Ceausescu's systematic repression of the Hungarian minority.
''Our school system was dismantled,'' he said. ''Quotas were forced so our churches couldn't admit students of theology in adequate number.
''In recent years,'' he continued, ''Ceausescu made public the plan to demolish our villages - more than 7,000 villages to be demolished - and to gather the people in official living centers.''
 
Shielded by His Parishioners
On Dec. 15, as the Securitate was attempting to take him away, about 200 people, most of them parishioners, jammed the narrow street in Timisoara where Mr. Tokes lived. Hour by hour the crowd grew, lighting candles, praying, refusing to move.
By dusk on Dec. 16, at least 5,000 people were in the street, he said. ''Not only Hungarians,'' Mr. Tokes said. ''This is the qualitative change. The solidarity demonstration for me changed into a general protest against the regime.
''The people cried, 'Down with Ceausescu,' 'We want liberty.' In front of our windows, they sang national songs and started towards the center of the town, the party house and the official buildings in Timisoara.''
Within an hour, he said, 50,000 people had gathered in the city's center. ''Then appeared the water cannon,'' the minister recounted. ''They used tear gas and batons - Securitate, army and milita together, with small tanks, shields, helmets, rifles. Out broke the revolution.''
 
Revised Estimate of Killings
Reports on the number of people killed in Timisoara that weekend have varied. ''At the beginning, the number was manipulated to be more and more, to emphasize the heroism of Romanians,'' Mr. Tokes said. ''Now, the apparatus men try to manipulate it down.'' By his estimation, 500 people were killed and several thousand injured.
Reports of the repression filtered out. ''First, the movement has spread in Transylvania,'' Mr. Tokes said. ''Then in Arad. Then from town to town. But we knew if Bucharest didn't join, the revolution would not succeed.''
Mr. Ceausescu, hurriedly returning from a visit to Iran, made a tactical error. ''He was so conceited, thank God,'' Mr. Tokes said, ''that, according to Communist recipe, he gathered that meeting on Dec. 21. He wanted to make the people condemn Timisoara as hooliganism and fascism.''
But students at the rear of the crowd in Bucharest's central square that night began to boo. Like a wave, the jeering rolled toward the speaker's platform. And, in a pivotal moment for the revolution, Mr. Ceaucescu was seen on national television to be shaken by the derision.
 
In Hiding Until Mid-January
Mr. Tokes, meanwhile, was on the run. He said that in early January, after he visited Bucharest for the first time since the revolution, bullets pierced the walls of his compartment on a train carrying him out of the city. For several weeks, Mr. Tokes remained hidden in a remote village as remnants of the Securitate tried to track him down.
Finally, in mid-January, when he emerged from hiding, Mr. Tokes was hailed as a hero of the revolution and became a member of the provisional parliament. But the revolution ''got stuck,'' he said.
''The beginning was uplifting,'' Mr. Tokes said. ''The continuation, not so good. The people of Romania weren't prepared for liberty. In that liberty, all the problems which were supressed are now broken out. The people are impatient. They waited for liberty as manna.''
The economy is now in disarray. ''Food, for example,'' Mr. Tokes said. ''Distribution is a little better now, but there is no essential change.''
 
Fascists 'in Masked Form'
The right wing, he said, is trying to turn the people's impatience against the transitional government. He said that ''organizations with fascist character'' like the Iron Guard, which existed during the war, had been reactivated ''in masked form.''
''They use the traditional national contradictions as a weapon, quite as Hitler used the Jews, as the blame for everything,'' Mr. Tokes said. And Communists, he said, remain in the system.
The fate of democracy is riding on the election, he said. ''If not, there is the terrible alternative of military rule.''

HEADLINE: Cuomo in the Lead in Counterattack on G.O.P.

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 10

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York said today that personal attacks on Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri for criticizing President Bush's policy toward Eastern Europe were part of a Republican pattern of evading major issues.
''The one thing they seem to be afraid of is intellectual discussion,'' Mr. Cuomo said of the Republican Party in a telephone interview from the Governor's mansion in Albany. Among Republicans, he added, ''there is a proclivity to avoid intelligent exchanges and to convert every disagreement into a personal attack.'' 
Mr. Cuomo made his comments after his staff told reporters that he was interested in discussing the scathing attack on Mr. Gephardt delivered by Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, the deputy Republican leader.
 
Attack on Senate Floor
In a speech on the Senate floor on Friday, Mr. Simpson mocked Mr. Gephardt's criticism of the President as the frustrated railings of a man who lusts after Mr. Bush's job. He called Mr. Gephardt a ''frustrated font of trivia.'' Telephone calls today to Mr. Simpson went unanswered.
Earlier this week, Mr. Gephardt, the House majority leader, who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1988, said Mr. Bush lacked vision in dealing with the emerging democracies in Eastern Europe and changes in the Soviet Union. He called for economic aid to the Soviet Union, and he accused the Administration of ''government of the polls, by the polls and for the polls.''
Ronald H. Brown, the chairman of the Democratic Party, joined the exchange today, saying there has not been a President as ''thin-skinned'' as Mr. Bush since Richard M. Nixon occupied the White House.
Mr. Cuomo said of the Republicans: ''They're very effective at vituperation. They get the decibel level high. It gets you into trading punches, instead of trading ideas.''
A White House spokesman said the Administration would have no comment on the Governor's remarks.

HEADLINE: Nonprofit Community Groups Rebuild Housing in the Bronx

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
With a sweep of her hand, Charlene Moats traces the cycle of devastation and renewal that has changed the face of her Bronx neighborhood.
Not long ago, all five blocks along Southern Boulevard from East Tremont Avenue north to the Bronx Zoo were lined with shells that once housed hundreds of people. ''I've been here 30 years,'' Ms. Moats said, ''and I remember when this whole block was abandoned.''
Today every apartment building is either rebuilt or under reconstruction. ''It makes me feel good,'' said Ms. Moats, who will soon become the manager of a handsome five-story walk-up nearing completion at East 181st Street and Southern Boulevard. ''People used to be running. Now they're not going anywhere. We have a new laundromat, new stores opening up. It means a lot to the community.'' #1,000 Apartments Created The building, along with one across the street and two others nearby, has been restored by a nonprofit community group called Build, one of two dozen local agencies that represent the most successful nonprofit component of New York City's effort to create tens of thousands of apartments in the city's poorest neighborhoods. 
In all, the local groups have produced more than 1,000 new apartments, and 2,000 more are either under construction or being designed. And while they represent but a small fraction of the 47,000 that the city has pledged to create from abandoned shells in its 12-year, $5.1 billion housing plan, they are significant in several ways.
The buildings will serve a poorer population than many of the others renovated under the city's plan. They are financed in part with Federal tax credits that have been sold by two national nonprofit groups. And they demonstrate the potential of the city's nonprofit housing and community development groups.
''In a town that is still obsessed with private developers, this program has been an important statement,'' said Paul S. Grogan, president of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, one of the national groups in the program. The other group is the Enterprise Foundation, created by the developer James W. Rouse to help the poor.
''It has demonstrated that you don't sacrifice anything in efficiency, cost control and timeliness if you work through local nonprofits,'' Mr. Grogan said.
 
Management a New Challenge
Although the tax credits have been used by the two groups in cities around the nation, nearly half the housing produced has been in New York City.
Having demonstrated this ability, the grass-roots groups now face the challenge of showing they can manage the housing. Many experts say the groups have unusual assets for this task: They know their neighborhoods extremely well, and they often seek to connect housing to larger community needs, like fighting drug trafficking and encouraging job training and economic development.
The local groups vary considerably in size and experience. Some, like the Banana Kelly Community Improvement Association and Build - an acronym for Bronx United in Leveraging Dollars - have been in the forefront of local housing development for a decade or more.
Others, like Asian-Americans for Equality on Manhattan's Lower East Side and the Aquinas Housing Corporation in the West Farms and East Tremont sections of the Bronx, have been active in tenant organizing or other forms of community advocacy, but have never before developed housing.
Still others, like the Ridgewood-Bushwick Senior Citizens Council, have histories beyond the world of housing and community development.
 
A Range of Rents Offered
Depending on their needs, they have been supervised and assisted in myriad ways by the two national groups, which have sold more than $100 million in Federal tax credits to major corporations that invest in low-income housing in New York.
The money raised through the credits accounts for about one-third of the cost of the building renovations. The city pays the rest, with some help from the state. The rehabilitations have cost an average of $70,000 an apartment, city officials say.
Rents for two-bedroom apartments in the program range from about $400 to $450 a month and are deemed affordable to families earning between $16,000 and $18,000 a year. Ten percent of the units in most buildings are set aside for the homeless, who pay the welfare shelter allowance, or $312 a month for a family of four.
In addition to selling the tax credits, the national organizations provided technical assistance on development, financing and management to the local groups. ''Other times, we learned things from them,'' said William R. Frey, director of the Enterprise Foundation's New York office.
 
Sweat Equity Employed
Banana Kelly, for example, began to fight housing abandonment in the Longwood section of the South Bronx in the mid-1970's. The group took its name from the sweeping banana-shaped block of Kelly Street, where it began organizing ''sweat equity'' projects, in which residents rebuild abandoned shells basically by themselves.
Today Banana Kelly is a major developer in Longwood and Hunts Point and manages buildings containing more than 700 apartments. It has supervised the reconstruction of eight large abandoned apartment buildings through sweat equity, said Getz Obstfeld, Banana Kelly's president, and has organized a similar effort at five small abandoned buildings on Fox Street.
The group has also overseen the moderate renovation of 20 occupied but rundown buildings taken over by the city after landlords defaulted on their property taxes. And it runs a program in which 30 young people are learning construction by renovating, under supervision, a five-story abandoned structure.
Build, which works in poor neighborhoods in the central and northwest Bronx, has supervised the moderate renovation of occupied buildings for more than a decade under many different city programs. The work usually involves such things as installing new plumbing, heating and electrical systems.
The group owns and manages 29 buildings containing a total of 1,100 apartments. They are scattered in a two-mile radius from Build's basement headquarters in a small building on Briggs Avenue, two blocks east of the Grand Concourse.
 
Tenants Picked by Lottery
Under the program run by the Local Initiative Support Corporation, Build has nearly completed the reconstruction of four shells. They contain a total of 165 apartments, and a lottery determines who gets them. Melva Ramos is one of 6,000 people who applied.
''I was very lucky,'' she said in her new five-room apartment on the third floor of a sparkling building at Southern Boulevard and East 180th Street. Mrs. Ramos and her four young children moved in three months ago.
''It's comfortable,'' she said. ''The heat is good. There's always hot water. The walls are not cracked. It's beautiful. I love it.''
City officials and foundation executives say the community groups are likely to provide solid, long-term management.
''The not-for-profits bring something that dollars and cents can't measure,'' said Felice Michetti, the acting Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development. ''They know neighborhoods as no private developer could know them. They look at tenants as neighborhood residents; there's a difference between a tenant and a neighborhood resident.''
 
Families Helping Themselves
Banana Kelly, among others, works hard to link housing to community purposes. In a small building that it renovated for the homeless at Fox Street and Longwood Avenue, the group is helping the families take control of the building and their lives.
On a recent afternoon, members of the first 10 families who have moved in gathered in a basement meeting room to decide by themselves how the final eight families would be selected.
One woman suggested that the new families, who will come from shelters for the homeless and welfare hotels, be required to demonstrate that they have maintained their own apartments in the past. ''Can we be sure that someone who's only lived in a hotel or a shelter or their parents' house is responsible?'' she asked.
Another woman quickly noted that those in the room were themselves homeless just two months ago. ''We can set an example,'' she said. ''Just because you come from nowhere doesn't mean you're going nowhere.''

Love Is Message As Maya Angeloub Addresses 700

DATELINE: SHREVEPORT, La.

 BODY:
Maya Angelou was no stranger to the 700 people who listened to her speech at Centenary College of Louisiana here last week.
In preparation for her appearance, this 165-year-old liberal arts college of about 850 undergraduates passed out 1,300 copies of her autobiography to students and members of the faculty and staff. Everyone from college trustees to custodians was discussing ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,'' and most of those who heard her brought their copies with them.
''I can stop pretty much anyone on campus and say, 'What did you think about the part where she did such and such?' '' said a campus spokeswoman, Janie Flournoy. 
Ms. Angelou took it all in stride. Noting that the book, published by Bantam, is in its 34th paperback edition, she said she was grateful to anyone who had read it.
While she recalled her 10 years growing up in nearby Stamps, Ark., Miss Angelou went beyond childhood experiences. Her smooth alto voice seemed to vibrate the mortar of the campus chapel as she stepped into the pulpit and took the microphone, singing a spiritual.
Her speech, she said, was about love - ''about romantic love, agape love, familiar love and self-love.''
If love, especially self-love, was the message, poetry was the medium. Not only her own poems but also the works of black poets long swallowed by history.
''This is your life, young man, young woman,'' she said. ''This is it. It is one thing to come to 'An Evening With Maya Angelou,' but if I can be of any inspiration to you, then you must look at me, and be renewed. Look at me. I come from a town in Arkansas smaller than the exposed portion of that stage down here.
 
'I Was Determined'
''Look at it,'' she said. ''I was determined. I am still determined. I'm the Reynolds Chair at Wake Forest, and a Fellow at Yale. I'm on the board at Harvard and U.C.-Berkeley, and visiting professor at Radford University. And I teach French and Spanish. And I teach in Europe, at Oxford.
''See me now: black, female, American and Southern. See me and see yourselves. What can't you do?''
''If I have anything to give you,'' Ms. Angelou told the audience, ''it is this encouragement: that you may encounter defeats but you must not be defeated. It may even be necessary to encounter defeat.''
 
Experience of Literature
Ms. Angelou, 61 years old, lamented the forgotten works of 19th-century writers who recorded early trials of the black race. ''How have we survived? I project the literature handed from one generation to the next generation to encourage the next generation to survive, and to do better than that, to thrive. And to do better than that, at all odds, to thrive with some passion, some compassion, some humor and some style.''
She warned that without the common experience of literature, people become fragmented. ''We allow our ignorance to prevail upon us and make us think we can survive alone, alone in patches, alone in groups, alone in races, even alone in genders,'' she said.
The message was delivered in a city that has been divided by a surge of racial unrest for a year and a half. Tension has not eased since September 1988, when a group of blacks attacked police officers with rocks and burned two stores after a teen-age white girl was said to have shot into a group, killing an unarmed black man.
Tuesday night, it was Miss Angelou's books that bound students of Centenary College, 94 percent of whom are white, with students from the Shreveport campus of Southern University, a predominantly black institution, who attended. The Mayor of Shreveport, John Hussey, sat in a front pew.
 
'Changes the Way I Feel'
''The way she portrays her own life and all her stuff makes everything the same,'' Clinton Gwin, a junior at Centenary majoring in economics junior and from Shreveport, said after the speech. ''It's not that she's a black woman; she's just a person.''
Laura Hemmings, a freshman English major at Centenary from Shreveport, said, ''It changes the way I feel about certain things, like being a woman.''
Miss Angelou's visit, including the $8,500 fee, was sponsored by the student government and paid by Centenary student fees. Patricia Matthew, chairwoman of the student government forum committee, said she wanted to bring Miss Angelou because ''she'd be good for the college.''
''I have people here who don't even know me very well who came up and said, 'Thank you,' '' said Miss Matthew, a junior majoring in English from Bossier City, La.
The books were bought after Centenary's president, Donald Webb, requested $1,500 from his Fund for Innovation, which is endowed by the Women's Endowment Quorum at the college. He said the size of the college allowed the fund to purchase books for everyone.
''You couldn't do it at Ohio State,'' he said, laughing.
Following the speech, Miss Angelou attended a reception in her honor, where she was pressed by people who wanted to shake her hand and say a few words.
Earlier she herself thanked the audience. ''I needed to be with you,'' she said. ''And I think maybe, you needed me to be with you.''

Coins

BYLINE: By Jed Stevenson

 BODY:
The value of paper money is just a chimera unless you can convince someone of its worth. Today our conviction in the value of United States dollars is so high so that we accept them without a second thought although the bills are only redeemable in other bills or coins made of nearly worthless alloy.
During the Civil War, however, confidence in the stability of the dollar was low, very low. The United States Treasury was nearly bankrupt, having sent most of the gold and silver to Europe for arms purchases.
A panicky population trusted only precious metals, hoarding coins until severe shortages developed. The Government was faced with the problem of finding ways to make the paper currency more palatable to a population that was increasingly reluctant to deal only in paper. 
To solve the problem, the Government issued several remarkable financial instruments, one of which will auctioned by Stack's, coin dealers in New York City. The auction will take place on Thursday at 6:30 P.M. at the Omni Park Central Hotel, Seventh Avenue at 56th Street.
The article for sale is a $20 Compound Interest Treasury Note and it combined the features of a regular $20 bill and a bond.
These notes were authorized by the Acts of Congress of March 3, 1861 and June 30, 1864 and the Treasury issued notes that bore an attractive six percent interest compunded semi-annually.
All six denominations - $10, $20, $50, $100, $500 and $1,000 notes - were issued for a period of three years only but the notes could be redeemed before that time. A table showing the interest and value of the note after each six-month period appears on the back of each bill.
The date of issue was surprinted in red ink on the front of each note so anyone accepting the note could easily compute the exact value at any given time. The notes circulated as legal tender, but it's more likely that most of them were saved for the three years and then redeemed.
All the notes have a surprinting in gold ink on the front in large letters, ''Compound Interest Treasury Note.'' The denomination is also surprinted in gold on the front although each bill already has its face-value printed extensively elsewhere.
Each of the notes has an allegorical figure on the front denoting such topics as Peace, Victory, Loyalty or Justice. The $10 note has a portrait of Samuel P. Chase, Lincoln's Secretary of the Treasury, while the $20 note shows Lincoln's portrait and curiously a seige mortar, one of the few indications that these were actually a type of war bond. The $500 note shows the ship, ''New Ironsides.''
Few of these notes have survived, and any in better than Fine condition are extremely rare. Most of the notes were redeemed three years or so after their date of issue - they did not accrue interest after the three years.
Those that were not turned in at the time were marred by the gold ink used in the surprinting. The ink is highly acidic and many notes have holes where the ink ate through the paper.
Another problem facing the collector is that the higher denominations that may have been widely circulated - the $50 and $100 notes - were counterfeited so extensively during the Civil War that the U.S. Treasury began withdrawing its own notes.
Today, there are no known examples of the $500 and $1,000 denominations, athough the U.S. Treasury lists several that were never redeemed. If one turns up, Stack's says it would probably be sold for around $60,000 to $90,000. The $20 note at auction is expected to sell for $4,000 to $6,000. But it could also be redeemed at the U.S. Treasury in Washington, D.C. They'll give you $23.88.

Treasures From a Napoleonic Trove

BYLINE: By PAULA DEITZ; Paula Deitz is co-editor of The Hudson Review.

 BODY:
In French, the word ''Vitrine'' conjures up the imaginary and unattainable world that exists behind glass in shop windows and showcases. And each year, the glass of the now-famous gallery-long vitrine in the costume exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art must be cleaned of fingerprints several times a week, as the crowds press in for a closer look at the magical array of small decorative accessories that have become the heart of the shows.
This year, for ''The Age of Napoleon: Costume From Revolution to Empire'' (until April 15), the vitrine is filled with the luxuries of the realm that Napoleon found it expedient to encourage for the political and economic reason of keeping artisans and craftsmen well employed. In surveying the rich assortment of ornamental jewelry, snuffboxes and sabers, one can understand why Mrs. James Monroe, who was in Paris in 1805 as the wife of the American Minister, made a beeline for the same quartier that Americans shop in today, near the Place Vendome. 
She selected a matched ensemble of a comb, necklace and earrings in citrine and gold. No doubt, she brought this imperial touch to the White House when she wore the jewels during her husband's Presidency, perhaps still with the fawn-colored cut-velvet dress she had also purchased in Paris, which is in the exhibition as well.
To make a point about the need for a new style of adornment, Katell le Bourhis, an associate curator at the Met and the exhibition's organizer, has lined the vitrine gallery with 25 mannequins in the sheer white muslim neo-classical high-waisted dresses that made any assembly of women at court look like an antique colonnade.
Clare Le Corbeiller, the associate curator in European sculpture and decorative arts who wrote the catalogue chapter on ''Jewels of the Empire'' said in an interview, ''With these pared-down monochromatic dresses as backgrounds, and with hairstyles both flatter and closer to the head, there was an opportunity for more color and variety in jewels.''
The adornments, and period portraits of women wearing them, trace not only the rise of wealth and power following the stringencies of the Revolution, but also personal relationships that evolved during this period, most notably the one between Napoleon and Josephine de Beauharnais, his first Empress. The simple initialed rings they exchanged, with a figure of love engraved on one of them, provide the only intimate moment in the display.
Josephine had a passion for jewelry, and she had at her disposal a generous civil allowance and what was left of the state jewels to transform into the new trend-setting forms. The most luxurious of these were the matched ensembles called ''parures,'' from the Old French word meaning ''to adorn.''
Among these elaborate suites of jewelry in the exhibition is one the Empress gave away - as she often generously did after wearing something only once - to Josephine van Hee, whose portrait miniature next to the porphyry and gold necklace and earrings shows how well they suited her. But the major parure of the exhibition in the neo-classical style is in carnelian and pearls with delicate chains of gold leaves.
The new sleeker, Grecian coiffures required statelier diadems, combs or bandeaux around the forehead, sometimes worn in tandem. When Jacques Louis David painted his tableau of Napoleon's 1804 coronation ceremony, he did justice to the graceful curve of Josephine's gold and silver diadem set with 1,040 diamonds, a gift to her from Napoleon. Now in the collection of Van Cleef & Arpels, the crown is only one item in the vitrine whose brilliance resonates the pageantry of that occasion.
Cameos and micromosaic medallions, recalling scenes of antiquity, were also in keeping with the political mood. A cameo diadem carved from a single shell, with mythological scenes framed by gold, pearls and precious and semiprecious stones, was a present to Josephine from her brother-in-law Joachim Murat. Simply marrying into the Bonaparte family was like opening a treasure chest. Even the short-lived marriage between the young, wealthy Baltimore beauty, Elizabeth Patterson, and Napoleon's brother Jerome yielded at least one garnet and seed pearl ornamental comb.
When Napoleon married Marie Louise, Archduchess of Austria, in 1810, he commissioned for her an eight-piece parure in diamonds and rubies designed by Etienne Nitot. Though the original was dispersed long ago, Nitot wisely kept a copy in white sapphires and garnets, which is on loan from the successor Parisian establishment, Chaumet: a coronet, diadem, comb, necklace, earrings and bracelets.
No design of the period was without symbolic significance, most charmingly demonstrated by a suite of three gold and gem-set acrostic bracelets sold by Sotheby's two years ago. The first letter of each stone - including emeralds, rubies and sapphires - spelled out the names of Napoleon and Marie Louise and the dates of their births, first meeting and wedding, with the numerals set in rose diamonds. So much cachet is associated with Napoleonic jewelry that the bracelets sold for $75,000 when the high estimate was for only $16,000. Currently at Ares Rare, an antique jewelry gallery at 961 Madison Avenue, one can see an 1810 French diadem, a delicate wreath in gold with acorns and oak leaves ($12,500).
For all the imperial wealth, there is still a reference in the exhibition to more humble origins, particularly in the gold earrings called poissardes, based on those worn by fishermen's wives. And set apart in another showcase are earrings of a more revolutionary nature in the form of a guillotine with a Phrygian cap and a crowned head rolling away - suitable for Madame Defarge.

The Pound Takes Another Beating

 BODY:
It is down, down, down for the British pound, which has fallen more than nine cents, to $1.6160, in the last two weeks. The Bank of England was in the foreign exchange market Friday buying the sagging sterling, which until several weeks ago had been one of the surprise strong currencies of the year. And the central bank may have to intervene again this week if the downward slide continues. The fortunes of the pound have turned sour on fears of inflation, higher interest rates and growing doubts about the performance and staying power of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. And the malaise has spread to the London stock market, which has managed to be volatile without gaining any ground.

COMPANIES
The Great American Express Cut-Rate Buyback
 
Finally, the American Express Company has found a way to come out ahead at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. But it's at the expense of Shearson shareholders. In 1987, American Express sold the public a minority interest in Shearson at $34 a share. Last week, American Express decided to buy each share back - for American Express stock worth about $11.93. American Express actually had wanted to sell more, but plans for another public offering and for a deal with Sanford I. Weill of the Primerica Corporation fell through. So with the help of more money ($1 billion), fewer employees (at least 2,000 layoffs) and a new chief executive (Howard L. Clark Jr.), American Express hopes to revive its brokerage. Some analysts say it will be years before Shearson can be peddled again. ''These companies are clearly wed for quite some time,'' said Michael L. Blumstein, a First Boston Corporation analyst. 
 
 
 
Coke: Another Generation
 
''New'' Coke is about to become even newer. The Coca-Cola Company said last week that it will test a Coke II brand as a renamed, repackaged, remarketed version of ''new'' Coke. The new, sweeter than the old, was supposed to appeal to the Pepsi generation, but its sales have slipped to 1.4 percent of the domestic soft drink market. Analysts say the Coke II name also might help the company distinguish new Coke from its original product, now called Coca-Cola Classic. Coke II cans will have dashes of blue, a color more familiar on the cans of Coke's largest competitor. And what if Coke II succeeds? As Joseph J. Doyle, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, put it, ''They have 'Karate Kid III.' I can't wait for Coke III.''
 
 
Will They Go Back to Greyhound?
 
Will Fred G. Currey become the Frank Lorenzo of the bus business? Mr. Currey's Greyhound Lines Inc., like Mr. Lorenzo's Texas Air Corporation, is perilously leveraged. And, as Mr. Lorenzo did at Eastern Airlines, Mr. Currey is trying to replace strikers with nonunion workers. The union walked out March 2, but Greyhound claimed last week to be operating 30 percent of its bus system, a figure disputed by the union. Prior to the current troubles, Mr. Currey arguably improved service, investing in his bus fleet, increasing ridership and, last year, eking out a small profit. But if a 1983 Greyhound strike under previous owners is any guide, it could take the company years to win riders back.
 
 
Demystifying Food Labels
 
How not to cash in on the nutrition boom: Dr. Louis Sullivan, Secretary of Health and Human Services, called last week for food companies to have mandatory nutritional labeling on nearly all their packages. Saturated fat, fiber, cholesterol, percentage of calories from fat - all would have to be clearly listed. No longer would food packages rival supermarket tabloids in telling stories that are mystifying, creative and incredible. Ideally, consumers would be able to see at a glance that a frozen dinner now labeled low-calorie was actually a meager, starvation-ration serving laden with fat. Said Dr. Sullivan: ''The grocery store has become a Tower of Babel, and consumers need to be linguists, scientists and mind readers to understand the many labels they see.''
 
 
The $2,000 Difference
 
The main difference between Genentech Inc.'s genetically engineered clot-dissolving drug and a more conventional product is about $2,000 a dose, European researchers reported on Thursday. They found that streptokinase, at $186 a dose, could treat heart attacks as well as Genentech's tissue plasminogen activator, or Activase, at $2,200 a dose. The study raises questions about whether sophisticated genetic engineering can produce drugs any better than those made by cheaper means.
 
 
USX and Dumping the Steel
 
Corporate raiding in the post-junk-bond era somehow seems a lot more complicated. The most that Carl C. Icahn has gotten from the management of the USX Corporation so far was a promise on Thursday to have shareholders vote on spinning off at least 80 percent of the steel business. Though he may be the largest shareholder, some analysts say he is unlikely to win the vote. But they note that Charles A. Corry, the USX chairman, has no long-term commitment to making steel. USX also has major interests in oil and gas.
 
 
In Brief
 
A 32-year-old great-grandson of the Ford Motor Company's founder moved a step closer last Wednesday to someday maybe running the company himself. William Clay Ford Jr., who already sits on the board, will direct the company's worldwide automotive strategies.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
Riskier Munis?
 
 Since the turn of the year, Treasury and corporate bond prices have tumbled but municipals have remained as solid as an old granite courthouse. Rates on long-term municipals have hovered near 7 percent since last year while 30-year Treasury bonds have gone from 7.8 percent in December to about 8.5 percent now. David Johnson, a portfolio manager at Van Kampen Merritt Inc., said municipals have held stable because of relatively low supply. But some analysts see a risk: As more cities and states face financial troubles, their credit ratings, and the value of their bonds, will fall.
 
 
Melamed to Leave the Merc
 
Leo Melamed plans to resign as head of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to spend more time with his family and, in his own fashion, explore outer space. He announced on Monday that he will retire as executive committee chairman at the end of the year. The father of financial futures, he turned a market once most concerned with pork bellies into an arena with global influence on currency exchange levels, stock prices and interest rates. His tenure has also seen a Federal investigation of trading abuses. Mr. Melamed intends to continue trading for his own account. But he might find the cosmos more peaceful than the commodity pits: He also plans to write a sequel to his 1987 science-fiction novel, ''The Tenth Planet.''
 
 
Coloring for Babyboomers
 
How to cash in on the graying of the baby boom: Open a beauty salon and concentrate on hair coloring. American Salon magazine predicts that salon customers will spend $5.5 billion on hair coloring this year, up 29 percent from last year. ''More women are going out into the work world,'' said Norma A. Lee, speaking for next week's International Beauty Show. ''They don't have time to fool around and do it themselves.''
 
 
Unemployment Holds Steady
 
The unemployment rate continues to defy predictions of an economic slowdown. The Labor Department reported on Friday that the rate stayed at 5.3 percent in February for the ninth month in a row. Meanwhile, January's 5.4 percent drop in factory orders, the steepest in 15 years, only reflected weak manufacturing, said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Company. ''What stands out,'' he added, ''is the enormous strength of the service sector.''
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
 
Brussels: The Boring Boom
 
Brussels is blossoming as the headquarters of an increasingly unified Western Europe. The European Community concentrates its offices there, with most European Parliament meetings there as well. As European companies have crowded in, commercial real estate values have doubled and tripled. Construction cranes are everywhere; seven major downtown hotels are going up or have just been completed. But the boom has brought more discount shopping stores than sophistication. The city's real attractions remain the Gran' Place, some classic restaurants and a naughty little statue. The hottest ticket in Brussels come Friday night is for the train to Paris - which is where the Group of Seven industrial nations has chosen to meet next month.
 
 
Mitsubishi Finds a Friend
 
The Mitsubishi companies of Japan have found a friend to induct them into the corporate club in Europe. On Tuesday, they announced plans for ''intensive cooperation'' in automobiles, aerospace and microelectronics with Daimler-Benz of West Germany. Japanese companies have been rushing to enter Europe before a single, borderless market takes shape in 1992. Daimler, whose products include Mercedes-Benz cars, stands to gain access to Japanese technology and markets.
 
 
Small Business, Soviet Style
 
Soviet leaders seem determined to keep passing laws making small businesses legal until everyone gets the message. In 1988, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev allowed small businesses to open their doors as worker-owned cooperatives. In some areas, they have flourished; in others, they have been squashed by local politicans. Last Tuesday, the Supreme Soviet tried to encourage the spirit of enterprise some more, voting 350-to-3 to allow citizens to own the means of production. But local officials will still apparently own the means of obstruction: Workers can possess a factory, but only the government will be entitled to own the land underneath.

Getting Women Down to the Site

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

DATELINE: PORT WENTWORTH, Ga.

 BODY:
Robert E. Coker, the project superintendent at the paper plant expansion in this tiny town just outside Savannah, thinks Sheryl T. Hamlett is a terrific carpenter's helper. She works hard, takes classes on her own time and never balks at working late or weekends. She is, he said, ''one of the best workers we've got.''
She is also a single parent with two children under the age of 4. Until now, that might have kept her out of a business where workers stay home when it rains, work weekends when it doesn't and work late on a half-hour's notice. ''If they didn't help with day care I couldn't swing it,'' Ms. Hamlett said. 
As it happens, B.E.& K. Inc., the industrial construction company based in Birmingham, Ala., which is building the plant, is more than helping out. Less than two months ago it opened BEKare, arguably the nation's most novel corporate day-care experiment. Built by hooking trailers together, it is open when the workers are working, closed when they're not - and it will pack up and drive off when the project is complete.
''If a foreman says one of his people will be two hours late, or if the site is open on Saturday, we'll keep the kids,'' said Debra Halveston, a child-care worker at BEKare.
For women in construction, that is more than a convenience; it is a necessity. ''I've got to place my three kids when school lets out,'' said Betty Branham, a project timekeeper. Shirley Johnson, a foreman who waited until her children were grown to go into construction, knows what Ms. Branham means. ''I would have started a lot earlier if there had been day care,'' Ms. Johnson said.
Earlier, she would have been an anomaly. Today 11 percent of B.E.& K.'s workers at Port Wentworth are local women. But that influx has not been problem-free.
''We started to suffer excessive absenteeism,'' said Theodore C. Kennedy, B.E.& K's chairman. ''We had to remove the concerns the women had about their children.''
But how? Few day care centers or private sitters are flexible enough to accommodate a construction worker's schedule. The waiting list for decent child-care centers in all parts of the country ''can be tremendous,'' said Stacey J. Pomerantz, a program associate at Catalyst, a group that researches women's issues. Moreover, construction projects only last a year or so, so it would be economic foolishness for a construction company to build a full day-care center.
Then Mr. Kennedy had a brainstorm: Why build a permanent center when a movable one would do just as well? Thus, BEKare, which Mr. Kennedy projects will cost B.E.& K. $750,000 a year, was born. Now it is comprised of five 14- by 40-foot trailers, but can easily be expanded to nine. Mary Jo Cline, BEKare's director, reckons it can be moved four or five times before it falls apart.
Women's rights advocates applaud the thought that went into BEKare. ''This shows that a company can creatively solve its problems and those of its women workers,'' said Ms. Pomerantz. Ellen Galinsky, co-president of the Families and Work Institute, another research group, added: ''Work/family problems do not have cookie-cutter solutions, and it is a joy to see such innovation.''
Right now, two local ex-schoolteachers take care of about half a dozen children at BEKare. But B.E.& K. expects to hire as many as 600 more workers in Port Wentworth as the construction project gathers steam, and it expects that many will be mothers who will readily pay the $51 a week that BEKare charges for each child. Ms. Cline expects that within a year BEKare will have 12 teachers handling 65 children ranging in age from 6 weeks up through pre-teen.
B.E.& K. pays wages comparable to those paid by local schools, and has thus been able to woo qualified teachers. Most will probably go back to the school system when the Port Wentworth project is complete. But Ms. Cline says she will go with BEKare, and Ms. Halveston does not rule out the possibility.
Just as important to B.E.& K., some of the construction workers may go along, too. ''I'd be tempted to go to the next project,'' said Cheryl L. McGlohon, a laborer whose 4-year-old son is at BEKare. ''I'm not sure I'd feel that way if they didn't have the day care.''
 
 
 
CONSTRUCTION'S ATTRACTIONS
Until now, construction sites were the last places one would expect to find child care centers. Male construction workers certainly were not clamoring for them, and construction companies were not exactly rushing to hire women.
But in the last few years, the shortage of skilled workers has grown critical. In the construction downturn of the 1980's, many male workers, fed up with getting laid off all the time, moved into lower paying but more stable jobs like auto repair, or even opening businesses of their own. And the recent upsurge of construction activity, particularly in the Southeast, has not lured many of them back.
Meanwhile, new technologies have made physical strength less important for many construction tasks. The upshot is that companies are recruiting more women to be carpenters, electricians, even welders and pipefitters. And, since the money is generally good, many women are lining up for training in those professions.
''We are encouraging more females to come into our profession,'' said Theodore C. Kennedy, B.E.& K.'s chairman. ''And that means we must worry about day care.''

HEADLINE: All About/Accountants;
Rivalries, Responsibilities and Some New Risks

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
Forget about accountants being a mild-mannered bunch of milquetoasts. When it comes to competing for clients, they are actually some of the most ruthless predators known to humankind. As Barry R. Wallach, a tax expert with Arthur Andersen & Company, boasted, ''I kind of view nonclients as clients being held in trust for us by the competition until we get there.''
Although the large accounting firms have long enjoyed nearly exclusive franchises for checking the books of public companies, their rivalries have only intenstified despite a flurry of mergers last year that reduced the Big Eight to just six.
The firms that remain - KPMG Peat Marwick, Ernst & Young, Deloitte & Touche, Arthur Andersen, Coopers & Lybrand and Price Waterhouse - slug it out every time a prestigious audit is up for grabs. These days, the attention is on Pepsico Inc., a $9 million account that Ernst & Young forfeited at the insistence of another client, the Coca Cola Company. Coke was upset that the merger of Ernst & Whinney and Arthur Young left the combined firm with both accounts. 
The hunt for new clients, and new services, is taking some startling new directions. Most firms cultivate former employees, who often go to work for potential clients, with lavish parties and alumni relations programs. The firms have targeted Eastern Europe as a vast, unconquered frontier for their audit skills, and they have pitched their services to the Federal Government, arguing that it should be run more like private enterprise.
But as they scramble for clients, accounting firms are becoming more likely to face responsibility for their clients' problems. Stockholders are taking accounting firms to court over audits that failed to warn of financial risks. No major firm is close to insolvency, but several face claims totalling hundreds of millions of dollars.
 
 
 
After the Mergers
 
 The Big Six Court Distinguished Alumni
 In the layoff wave that is following the merger wave, accounting firms seldom give pink slips. Instead, they give parties. And rather than allowing terminated employees mere hours to empty their desks, the firms give them six months, sometimes a year, to find new jobs. Then, they offer a stream of newsletters, alumni directories, reunions and training sessions. It's an accounting firm ritual that makes layoffs and resignations seem more like college graduation. ''We'd seen what universities do to cultivate their alumni,'' said Larry D. Horner, chairman of KPMG Peat Marwick. ''This is nothing more than a takeoff of that.''
Just as universities depend on their alumni for donations, accounting firms look to their alumni for more business. Accounting firm turnover runs as high as 25 percent a year, and most of those who leave go not to the competition, but rather to companies that could become clients.
''Very often, they will rise into positions of prominence where they'll have the opportunity to be a good friend of the firm,'' said J. Michael Cook, chairman of Deloitte & Touche. ''And that might mean the opportunity to refer busines to us.''
Many in the accounting industry had predicted that the mergers would result in sweeping staff cuts. At Ernst & Young, rumors have persisted for weeks, despite the firm's denials, that more than 300 of the combined firm's partners would be eased out.
The firms have done their best to keep any layoffs all but invisible. Those let go sometimes feel better appreciated as former employees. The New York office of KPMG spends $40,000 a year to publish an alumni directory and another $25,000 to distribute an alumni newsletter.
In October, KPMG rented the ballroom of New York's Marriott Marquis to fete 1,200 ex-employees. Roving waiters bore trays of shrimp and the banquet tables were piled high with roast beef. The cost: $75,000. Taking the reunion theme a step further, the firm put guests' classes -the years they joined the firm - on their name tags.
''It's funny,'' said Robert Serio, a Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company stockbroker who attended as a former KPMG employee. ''Even when the accounting firms were pulling back on their own employees' Christmas parties, the alumni parties were still going full swing.''
 
 
 
The Rating Game
 
Redefining What It Is To Be No. 1
 Not only are accounting firms vying for clients. They are also competing for recognition as the best salespeople in their business.
Accounting Today, a biweekly magazine, keeps box scores. For 1989, the magazine ranked Arthur Andersen first, with the best won-lost record, or the greatest margin of clients gained over clients lost. But now comes Deloitte & Touche with a claim on the salesmanship title as well. Deloitte figures that when the 1989 rank is adjusted to reflect the new clients' sales volumes (which tend to be proportional to accounting fees), the firm leaps ahead of the pack. Deloitte finished first in a ranking, adjusted for clients' sales volumes (which tend to be proportional to accounting fees), that Accounting Today compiled for the first six months of 1989. The firm's new accounts in 1989 included RJR Nabisco Inc. and the Morrison-Knudsen Corporation.
Arthur W. Bowman, the editor of Bowman's Accounting Report in Atlanta, says that Andersen and Deloitte & Touche will have the edge in the 1990's as well. Though Andersen is best-known for its huge consulting arm, Mr. Bowman admires the enormous investment it is making in its traditional audit and tax-related business. And he praises Deloitte & Touche because of the smoothness of its merger last year, between Deloitte Haskins & Sells and Touche Ross & Company.
 
 
 
The Trouble With Clients
 
Got a Problem? Sue the C.P.A.
 The more accounting firms chase new business, the more they seem to end up with some clients they wish they had never touched. The firms are increasingly vulnerable to lawsuits by investors who claim to be the victims of slipshod audits. As Harris Amhowitz, general counsel for Coopers & Lybrand, said, ''A very substantial loss could bankrupt an accounting firm.''
Many accounting executives say a major firm - although not one of the Big Six - could wind up being among the failures.
In exchange for an exclusive franchise to review the books of public companies, most state laws require accounting firms to operate as private partnerships - without the limited liability enjoyed by corporations. As the firms have expanded, partners are increasingly jittery about having their personal net worth on the line every time a client's business stumbles. With more exotic transactions and more business failures, claims have grown.
''There's this presumption that anytime there's a business failure, there's also been an audit failure,'' said J. Michael Cook of Deloitte & Touche.
Shareholder attorneys make few apologies. ''We're in very rough times financially, and the accountants are very often the ones who know or should know what's going on,'' said Arthur Abbey, a New York lawyer who specializes in suing accounting firms.
Just the week before last, Federal regulators sued Ernst & Young for $560 million for failing to spot problems at a Dallas-based savings and loan, the Western Savings Association. Arthur Young, part of the newly merged firm, had already had troubles at Lincoln Savings and Loan. There, a class-action suit filed after another well-publicized business failure seeks damages of $250 million from accounting firms.
Laventhol & Horwath, a mid-size Philadelphia-based firm that has grown rapidly through acquisitions, has also had a string of adverse settlements, serious enough to have forced its partners to take a deep pay cut last year. Edward A. Suarez, a senior Laventhol partner, blames policy-makers. Accountants, he argues, deserve better protection from lawsuits.
''If you believe accountants add value to the economic system, it's madness,'' he said. ''The courts have got to put a stop to this.'' Many accountants say their firms should be allowed to incorporate.
Most firms complain that the legal threat will drive young talent from the profession. Annual insurance premiums and deductibles can consume up to 5 percent of a firm's total fees, and perhaps as much as one-quarter of partners' pretax profits. Ernst & Whinney and Arthur Young, the only two firms where information has become public, spent $41 million and $17.5 million respectively in the 12 months before their merger on outside legal fees and insurance premiums. Their experience is believed to be fairly representative of the Big Six.
For these sums, Ernst had $140 million of insurance coverage atop a $5 million deductible on each claim, with a $30 million worldwide annual deductible. Young, which is facing serious lawsuits in the wake of the savings and loan crisis, had arranged $145 million of insurance coverage atop a $2.9 million deductible per claim and a $35.5 million worldwide deductible. Policies of this sort buy a firm some peace of mind. , though one huge case could blast through the limits of its coverage.
 
 
 
THEN THERE'S FEE FATIGUE
Turning the average accountant into a rainmaker is not easy. At Arthur Andersen's 1,725-bed, $130 million training center in St. Charles, Ill., 40 miles outside Chicago, television is banned and chairs are few. ''We want them out networking,'' said Richard Nerad, who runs the center. ''Distractions are eliminated.''
At a recent class, Barry R. Wallach, of Andersen's Chicago office, discussed the A B C's of business-getting. Why handle a problem yourself, he asked, when you can send in a team - and find other problems to solve? ''This is the profile of the old accountant,'' said Mr. Wallach, showing a videotape of a man on the phone. ''The guy's Rambo, a one-man answer team. Got a question? Boom. I don't want to say he's wrong. He's incomplete.''
The videotape continues. A new, team-spirited accountant gets a prospect to meet with a squadron of experts from across the nation. And the final, best role model is the accountant who suggests other, urgent problems to solve each time a project is formally finished.
But Richard L. Measelle, who manages Anderson's entire tax and accounting practice, warns that these techniques can become too effective. Then, he said, clients might contract a dreaded disease: ''Fee fatigue.''

HEADLINE: Only Washington Can Solve the Health Care Crisis

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Stuart Butler (''Coming to Terms on Health Care,'' Jan. 28) ignores the well-recognized and much publicized causes of the health care cost crisis and lays the full blame on corporate employees who use ''free'' health care. According to Mr. Butler, the employee is to blame for the crisis. 
Where is the alternative coverage to be found? Far from competing with each other for medical business, insurance companies have been stampeding to get out of the individual medical insurance market. When I entered the insurance business in 1973, there were about 25 companies offering individual medical policies in New York State. Now there are two.
Mr. Butler declares that ''all workers and their families would have equal access to health care coverage'' under his plan. Who is guaranteeing equal access?
He recommends requiring by law that all families be insured. Would he require insurers to insure all applicants? The current cost of insuring a family in New York exceeds $6,000 per year. Is Mr. Butler proposing that unemployed families be required to pay this bill instead of the rent?
If we guarantee universal coverage, we must require universal payment according to family means. The insurance industry cannot solve the problem. Only the Federal Government has a mechanism to require universal payment. America faces a choice between national health insurance and the toleration of an increasing population of uninsured families.
Tax gimmicks won't stop this hemorrhage. Is the Heritage Foundation in Washington or on Mars?

HEADLINE: FORUM;
Quality Control for Health Care

BYLINE: By JERRY J. JASINOWSKI; Jerry J. Jasinowski is president of the National Association of Manufacturers.

 BODY:
A painful back injury recently sent me to top medical specialists in Washington and New York. One doctor rated the injury an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10 and recommended immediate surgery. The other rated it a 2 and suggested plenty of rest and physical therapy. I opted for the latter and am in fine physical shape today.
But this mind-boggling experience - and near brush with the surgeon's knife - underscored more than statistics ever could the appalling quality deficiencies in our health care system. 
Had I elected surgery, I unwittingly would have added to the alarming number of unnecessary surgical and medical procedures in this country: up to 34 percent of those performed each year, according to the Rand Corporation and other researchers. Rand says nearly $50 billion is wasted annually on such unneeded services. I'd bet the figure is substantially more than that.
Consider that more than a third of the nation's hospitals fail to meet standards designed to guard against inappropriate surgery, unnecessary blood transfusions and poorly coordinated treatment of patients in special coronary and intensive-care units, according to the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations.
Consider that residents of New Haven are about twice as likely to undergo a bypass operation for coronary artery disease as their counterparts in Boston, who tend to be treated by other means. How does one explain such enormous treatment inconsistencies between two renowned medical centers whose residents are remarkably similar in demographic characteristics?
One reads and hears very little about these shocking quality shortfalls.
An important lesson for health care organizations can be learned from the resurgence of manufacturing in the past decade. The all-out campaign for quality that helped American manufacturers jump back into the competitive fray must now be extended to health care.
While quality is an ambiguous concept, the focus should be on how to increase the value of health care products and services without raising the costs. Operationally, that means getting the waste out of the system by striving for more appropriate and efficient care.
Quality care, for example, means setting up a system to evaluate medical technologies and services, and establishing guidelines to improve treatment and limit unnecessary procedures. It means reforming our medical liability system to curb defensive medical practices, like redundant consultations and diagnostic tests used by physicians to protect themselves from lawsuits.
Quality care also means providing consumers with the information they need to make intelligent buying decisions. The regrettable truth is we often know more about the televisions and cars we buy than about the medical care we choose. One way to foster better choices on our part is to make publicly available data on hospitals and physicians a state requirement, as is the case in Pennsylvania, Iowa and Colorado. The Hershey Foods Corporation, instrumental in getting the Pennsylvania law enacted, is convinced that it is the most powerful tool they have to boost health care quality and lower costs.
Quality care similarly means giving the medical payment system a shot of quality control. Consumers still pay a relatively small share of the cost of services, giving them little incentive to use those services judiciously. Employers can play an important educational role, emphasizing to workers the individual responsibility for one's own health and placing greater emphasis on preventive health care.
Companies can take other specific steps to improve the quality of health care for their employees. They can, like Honeywell Inc., negotiate cost-saving deals with medical facilities with proven track records - ''centers of excellence'' - for high-intensity, low-frequency procedures. They can directly contract with multi-specialty clinics that select and hire physicians based on rigid criteria and that perform ongoing quality-improvement programs.
Or, like Allied-Signal Inc., they can give employees financial incentives to use general care physicians selected by the company who have agreed to serve patients for a negotiated fee. Employees who go outside the physician network are required to pay very high deductibles.
The basic objective of quality improvements is doing the job right the first time. Companies should insist on this throughout the process - from informing the consumer, to consulting with physicians, to demanding greater hospital efficiency.

HEADLINE: BIG WHEELS;
How Dreams of Clean Air Get Stuck in Traffic

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
''LOVE AFFAIR'' isn't strong enough; the automobile is part of the American identity. And more and more it looks like the Mr. Hyde part.
The smog-causing gases that cars give off are a prime target of the new clean air bill that is making its way through Congress. Senate leaders and the White House struck a deal on March 1 on exactly what further steps would have to be taken by auto makers and fuel producers, among others, to try to reverse the degradation of the atmosphere.
In fairness, it might be said that Mr. Hyde has already made passable efforts to be a good citizen. The auto manufacturers, often under duress, have managed to produce cars that give off vastly less carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide and hydrocarbons - three ingredients of smog - than the models of the 1960's. Scared by enthusiastic talk of alternative fuels like methanol and natural gas, the auto makers are pressing oil companies to make cleaner gasoline. 
But air quality in major American cities has nevertheless continued to worsen. In the 1986-88 period, 101 metropolitan areas did not meet the standard on ground-level ozone pollution, up from 64 that were not complying in the 1985-87 period. Weather was a factor, but most of the problem is cars.
One reason is that the Hydes of the world, not to mention the Smiths and the Joneses, are victims of circumstances seemingly beyond their control or anyone else's. While manufacturers were making cleaner cars, the number of cars and the number of miles they were driven increased enormously.
Statisticians try to make the astronomical numbers more comprehensible by expressing them in terms of trips to the moon, although no interstate goes there. Thus, in 1970, vehicle miles traveled in the United States came to about two million round trips to the moon. Now cars do about three million round trips annually. That is even worse than it looks at first glance. As total mileage rises, emissions can rise even more steeply, because more of those miles are covered in stop-and-go traffic. Trends cut both ways: as the years go by, dirty cars from the pre-control days are replaced with clean new ones, but then the effectiveness of even the new models declines as the cars get older.
Americans are driving more miles than ever because of cheap gasoline, population growth and longer commutes that are often a consequence of housing costs. They also like to shop, visit and just plain drive; only about 35 percent of car miles are driven to get to work or as part of work, according to one Government survey. The result of all that driving, though, is not necessarily greater convenience but ever-denser traffic, ever-longer delays and ever-sicklier air.
Yet rather than giving up their cars, Americans have responded by transforming their rolling prisons into cocoons of comfort. The gear includes multispeaker stereos, orthopedically correct seats, car phones, air conditioners, heavy soundproofing, even laptop computers and fax machines. These days it's hard to find a car without FM stereo. All these comforts help motorists routinely endure a virtually unbearable environment, even as their idling engines make that environment worse by the minute.
Automobiles impose other costs, too, like the environmental damage that is caused by spills from all the oil tankers needed to feed American refineries, and the payments to foreigners for eight million barrels, about 40 million fill-ups, every day.
Against these facts of life, the new round of clean air proposals, said Terry F. Yosie, a pollution specialist at the American Petroleum Institute, is ''trying to find other means to stay even with the vehicle miles traveled, and get to the next increment of improvement beyond that, so we're not overtaken by events, as we were to some extent in the last decade.''
The Senate-White House compromise would delay until 1995 a new set of regulations on auto emissions and would require another phase to begin only if specicfied levels of improvement in air quality are not accomplished. The pre-deal Senate version would have required two rounds of emissions tightening, the first one in 1993.
The compromise would also delay stricter standards on utility smokestacks and other sources of pollution. Government officials are quick to point out that vehicles, or ''mobile sources,'' are not the only culprits that add to smog, deplete ozone in the stratosphere, where it helps shield the earth from damaging ultraviolet rays, or cause acid rain. The degree to which cars are culpable and the comparative ease of cleaning up tailpipes and smokestacks seem to vary according to factors like how many auto plants a Congressman has in his district.
But the car is the most democratic of these pollution sources; far more than emissions from paper manufacturing, say, or electrical generation, the pollution from cars comes down to millions of personal choices.
And those choices, environmentalists fear, will affect the whole planet, through the greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide is believed to be a major contributor to global warming, and Americans' cars emit about as much carbon dioxide as all the sources in Japan do.
 
The Limits of Growth Are Hard to Reach
Technology can ameliorate some of these problems, through better fuel economy and cleaner tailpipes, but just treading water is a challenge. For a while rising gasoline mileage helped, but recent statistics from the Environmental Protection Agency run the other way.
Moreover, in 1970, people outnumbered cars by 2.5 to 1, but the cars reproduce faster. By 1988, there were just 1.7 people per car. The only limit seems to be that once there is one car for each driver, increases in the car population cannot increase pollution or gas consumption unless the cars learn to drive themselves.
The projection is for more of the same. At the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, a coalition comprising New Jersey, New York and the New England states that last year required the oil companies to produce less-polluting gasoline, Allan C. Van Arsdale, a staff analyst, said that in the next 10 to 15 years, vehicle miles traveled will jump an additional 25 to 40 percent.
Some experts say that center-city congestion is not much worse than it used to be. But wide-open roads of suburban counties are getting as bad as city streets. And while there have been some improvements like one-way streets and staggered timing of traffic signals, these are mostly one-time refinements; future efficiency gains will be harder to find.
At some point, simple congestion would seem to put limits on auto growth, but it is not clear where that limit is. ''Twenty years ago, if someone had told me that the average speed driving across Manhattan would be allowed to get down to 1.5 miles per hour, I would say, no, it'll never happen.'' said Michael Oppenheimer, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. ''But you don't know what people will stand for.''
And car manufacturers have found new ways to help them deal with their frustration. Christopher W. Cedergren, an analyst at J. D. Power and Associates, a Los Angeles consulting firm that measures customer satisfaction with cars, said the next item on the list of standard comforts is compact disc players, which will be in a majority of cars by the end of the decade.
Another accessory that is part of the solution is also part of the problem: the air conditioner. In 1970, 40 percent of cars had them; now 90 percent do, said Mr. Cedergren. That piece of equipment is a synergistic nightmare for environmentalists. Air conditioners do not just encourage people to drive; they also eat gas and are notorious leakers of a chlorofluorocarbon that is particularly dangerous to the atmosphere, encouraging the greenhouse effect and depleting stratospheric ozone.
While the ozone above 30,000 feet is being depleted, it is being created at ground level by the interaction of sunlight and auto emissions. Unfortunately, ground-level ozone does not replenish the ozone at high altitude. It instead turns into the smog that causes lung and nasal irritation and, scientists believe, may cause long-term lung damage. It is also damaging to plants and trees.
 
More Places to Go, And Cheaper, Too
All of this for a convenience that is becoming a home away from home. The most recent study, conducted by the Census Bureau in 1983, found that 30.1 percent of the miles traveled were logged getting to or from work, 13.4 percent were for shopping and 15.5 percent were for other personal business. Going to social and recreational activities accounted for 13.3 percent, education, religious and civic activities for 4.1 percent, and visiting friends and relatives for 13.6 percent. Leisure driving came to just 1 percent and vacations to 2.1 percent.
The energy consumption is vast. Moreover, the private car is not efficient. Mr. Oppenheimer and a co-author, Robert H. Boyle, point out in a book to be published later this year, ''Dead Heat: The Race Against the Greenhouse Effect,'' that only about one-seventh of the energy in gasoline moves the car forward. The rest goes out the tailpipe or the radiator.
But if Americans are doing more driving, it is not irrational from the driver's point of view, because the price of gasoline has gone down. According to the Department of Energy, on an inflation-adjusted basis, the price of gasoline at the end of 1989 was just below what it was in 1973 and 42 percent below its peak price, which was in 1980. The roads are already built, the car is in the driveway, and the additional cost of driving to a restaurant 40 miles away is too small to stop anyone.
''We have built a society that is dependent on personal mobility, and we are envied all over the world for that,'' said Michael R. Deland, the chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality and formerly the Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator in Boston. That mobility, he said, ''is consistent with our most cherished national values of independence. I don't think we're going to change that in the near future.''
But Mr. Deland believes, with most other experts, that the United States will have to cut its dependence on cars. As Kenneth T. Jackson, a Columbia University historian, put it in ''The Crabgrass Frontier,'' published in 1985, ''The United States is not only the world's first suburban nation, but it will also be its last.'' The earth cannot sustain many more economies like this one, he said.
If the American mass transit system is 140 million cars and 200 million people to drive them, what is the alternative?
One is public transportation, which usually means the bus. But, as the director of the E.P.A. Office of Mobile Sources, Dick Wilson, acknowledged: ''It's difficult to tell people they ought to leave the car home when they see the smoking diesel bus. We have to clean buses up so we can promote them with a straighter face.''
At the coalition of Northeastern states, Mr. Van Arsdale agreed that ''to get out of this rut we're going to have to provide a good alternative to the motor vehicle.''
But an effective public transit system requires concentrations of population, while each year since World War II has seen more dispersal. People travel from dispersed homes to dispersed workplaces, shopping malls, restaurants, theaters and schools. To make matters worse, the route maps would not be like simple lines or grids, but like a bowl of spaghetti.
 
One Suggestion: Undo the Suburbs
Until World War II, said Dr. Jackson of Columbia, land near transportation lines was valuable and land far away was not. Now, he said, the South Bronx, crossed by subway and train lines, is in ruins, while virgin land reachable by car over the George Washington Bridge in New Jersey is being converted to prime housing.
''Let's reverse what's been going on for the last 60 years,'' he said. A start, he said, would be a gasoline tax and an end to private transportation's public subsidies, a category into which he puts everything from road building to snow plowing to police protection of the highways.
Los Angeles is making preliminary moves to reduce the demand for travel. The South Coast Air Quality Management District and other government units there have drafted a plan that calls for using zoning to intersperse housing with employment centers.
It is a long-term solution that even proponents say will be difficult to bring about. Cleaner-burning gasoline and possibly some alternate fuels seem likely to come sooner. What else can be done to tie the web of modern life together without the automobile?
''There's not too much on the horizon right now,'' said Mr. Van Arsdale, ''other than, 'Beam me up, Scotty!' ''
 
COMMUTING ILLUSTRATED
 
Problem:
Travel from home in Haworth, N.J., to office in Newark, N.J., a distance of 20 miles, so as to arrive by 9 A.M. Some options:
 
The bus to eternity
Take 7:17 A.M. bus across the Hudson River to Port Authority terminal in Manhattan, arriving at 8:11. Then take 8:20 A.M. bus back across the river to New Jersey, arriving in Newark at 8:55 if all goes well. Minimum transit time 1 hour, 38 minutes.
 
Railroad three-step
Drive car to station in neighboring Oradell, take NJ Transit train to Hoboken, then the PATH tube to Newark. Choppy experience, but transit time is not much over an hour on a good day, and it's possible to read the paper.
 
By car
Insert lucky coffee mug in coffee-mug caddy. Buckle up. Blast off. Time on road maybe 40 minutes, depending on traffic.

. . . BUT THE AIR IS WORSE ANYWAY
Despite the improvements in emissions from new cars, overall air quality has worsened in many places because of increased numbers of cars and pollution from other sources, including industry. In 1986-88, 101 metropolitan areas did not meet Federal air quality standards. For example, the limit for ground-level ozone, with certain adjustments, is .12 parts per million. Some cities logged far higher concentrations.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
VISIONS OF AMERICAN PLENTY

 BODY:
A Soviet satirist, Mikhail Zhvanetsky, is a keen observer of life in his country and the United States. Following are excerpts from an essay he wrote for Literaturnaya Gazeta. It was reprinted in the February issue of Literary Gazette, an English-language version of the Soviet newspaper.
 
To understand what we are missing, to understand what human hands can do, to understand what the earth gives us, our people should tape a four-hour TV program in [an American] supermarket. We should stop playing imagination games and look at just what they sell in an American store. There's nothing special there - just everything. Absolutely everything that we know, heard, read somewhere, saw in pictures. That's half of it. And half is what we don't know, haven't seen or heard. And we should see it, to get the healthy spirit of competition going, so that we understand what the earth can provide, what water can provide, what the winter can provide, and what the summer can provide. . . .
[In the United States,] you can do this, you can do that, but someone is doing it all. Someone is working. Women come home with gray faces, India ink flowing down their cheeks, their hands full of ink. Salesmen run around with gray faces, and they aren't the least bit polite. Where does everything in the stores come from? After all, someone produces it. They pay, they pay a lot. . . .
You have to work unbelievably hard; smoke comes out of every part of your body. There is no time to read, no time to learn anything: ''I don't read books; I read the newspapers.'' ''I don't go to the theater.'' They talk about it with pride. ''There's a guy over there; he reads books. You can find everything out from him.'' ''I don't know what the name of this ocean is. There's a geographer; he knows.'' ''There's a mathematician; he knows.'' . . .
If we here, through many centuries of struggle, through deprivation and disasters, earned the sacred right to do absolutely nothing for 100 rubles a month, over there, on the other hand, to stand in place, you have to run. In order not to sink down, you have to work with your hands, legs and head. He wasn't at tennis once; another time he wasn't at the pool - and so the rumors begin. Already a rich client didn't go to him, and he, trying to be cheerful and smile, has already dropped one step lower, then lower, because, just like here, you go up only once. . . .
The boredom is excruciating, like the food. Like the businesslike women, the businesslike men, a Broadway show. Huge amounts of water flow, fires burn and there is plenty of nudity, and people crawl around like cats, . . . and over there they have everything, and they don't have anything else, and everything is broken up into types. Some read books, some make money, some are discovering new drugs, some are inventing airplanes, some just know what buttons to push, what to turn off. No one knows how anything is made. A few kids in Houston know; ask them.
You can buy pears. Or, after you pay, you can pick them for yourself, the best, the freshest, in someone else's orchard. Or, after you pay, you can pick wild strawberries, raspberries or vegetables. There is no one standing between the idea and the realization. . . .
Everybody uses you a little bit, but that's business.

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
Can a Change In Rules Alter Young Lives?

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
IN a crack-plagued Bronx neighborhood, public school students wear uniforms proudly. At a Bedford-Stuyvesant high school ringed by poverty, students know to leave their gold jewelry and the removable gold jackets for their teeth at home. And in a handful of New York City high schools, students routinely submit to metal-detector searches for weapons.
Increasingly, inner-city schools are focusing on their environments and how students perceive themselves. If the home and neighborhood are dysfunctional and chaotic, the thinking goes, the school must be a model of function and discipline. 
Besides campaigns to rid schools of graffiti and weapons, more and more schools are outfitting their students in uniforms or forbidding excessive gold jewelry or obviously expensive clothes as disruptive and emblematic of the drug culture. More than 50 districts nationwide, including those in Philadelphia, Miami and Houston, ban beepers in schools, mainly because of their association with drug dealers.
There is little research directly linking such regulations to academic progress, and experts say it would be nearly impossible to quantify any gains. But especially in inner-city schools, the measures are being tried nonetheless.
''The ghetto culture is not the culture of blacks anywhere in the world,'' said Dr. James Comer, Maurice Falk Professor of Psychiatry at the Yale University Child Study Center. ''The way these children behave is a function of economics, social experiences and generations of a caste system. Academic life is not meaningful or useful to them. Unless there is some understanding of the magnitude of the problem and why it occurs, there will be no progress in changing their behavior.''
Principals see children raw from the violence and pathology in their lives, whose lack of self-esteem hinders learning. They see their first charge as providing an environment that aids learning, and having students accept that environment and the demands of attendance and behavior it makes.
 
Closing the Gap
''The children in these schools typically have a variety of multiple and complex needs that for one reason or another are not being met by the family, the community or the private sector,'' said Michael Casserly, associate director of the Council of Great City Schools, a coalition of 45 large urban districts.
In ruling that it is wrong to bring weapons into a school or that there is a proper standard of dress, principals say they are closing the gap between the way the outside world presents itself and they way their students present themselves.
''You can be a pimp, you can be a prostitute, you can be a drug dealer with gold teeth,'' a principal in Brooklyn, Frank Mickens, told his students in banning gold jackets on teeth. ''You cannot go to Wall Street with gold teeth.''
Mr. Mickens has plastered the photographs of students all over Boys and Girls High School in Bedford-Stuyvesant to lift self-esteem. Citing statistics showing that almost one out of four black men in their 20's is in jail or on probation or parole, he has asked teachers to seat male students in the front of classrooms, where he believes they are more apt to participate actively.
 
A Measure of Success
Dr. Comer of Yale has worked with inner-city elementary-school children in New Haven, where classes included basic academics, social skills and artistic expression. He said attendance soared and standardized test scores began climbing after one year of the new curriculum. A follow-up of one group of students after they left the school showed that they were still performing ahead of students from neighboring schools.
G. Ben Dachs, the principal of Wingate High School in Brooklyn, said he initially was opposed to metal detectors at his school, and yielded because they were approved by parents and students weary and wary of the outside world. But he said test scores and attendance have risen since the advent of metal detectors and rewards for accomplishments like passing all courses.
''The culture of a school dictates whether a youngster will learn or not,'' Mr. Dachs said.
But Roland S. Barth, a senior lecturer on education at Harvard University and project director of the National Network of Principals' Centers, cautioned: ''To me, it raises the question about the usefulness of schools as we know them. If you have to create all over again the environment in which schools operate, maybe we need a different conception of packaging schools.''
Few students or parents have objected to non-academic regulations, although the American Civil Liberties Union has opposed bans on beepers in some cases. Among those who see the devastation wrought by crack, absent parents and inadequate housing, there is relief that standards are being set somewhere.
Aida Rosa, the principal of Public School 30 in the devastated South Bronx, said the parents in her district are increasingly holding two jobs or are involved in drugs. Some have abdicated authority, she said, but others just need help. When students were given the option of wearing uniforms, many accepted.
''With our uniforms we have created a sense of unity, a sense of feeling good about ourselves,'' said Ms. Rosa, whose school resounds with an almost palpable sense of good will. ''No matter what I do here I will never be one of the schools with the top reading scores. But I think the uniforms have made a tremendous difference.''

HEADLINE: Remember Panama?

 BODY:
Most Americans over age 10 still remember those dramatic televised reports. It was only 12 weeks ago that U.S. troops invaded Panama, in the largest military operation since the Vietnam War. President Bush's political stock soared when the assault brought the capture and removal to Miami of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, Panama's fallen strongman.
But 12 weeks can be a long time if you're trying to hold together a country whose army and police force have been shattered, and whose economy has been devastated by two years of U.S. sanctions and then a billion dollars of war damage.
Such is the crisis that now presses on President Guillermo Endara's new Government. Not surprisingly, Mr. Endara hopes that Washington will quickly approve promised aid and that funds in formerly blocked accounts will soon become available. But Mr. Bush's $500 million Panama aid package is meandering through Congress. Emergency funds are only now dribbling through the bureaucratic pipeline. A cumbersome process involving claims and counterclaims stalls release of back taxes owed to Panama by U.S. companies.
Meanwhile, Panama's 30 percent unemployment rate makes the Endara Government reluctant to pare down its reconstituted military force. Yet the presence of thousands of re-enlisted Noriega veterans could one day imperil democratic rule. Moreover, the force's unreliability prolongs the awkward role of American troops as a backstop for police operations on Panamanian soil.
Economic problems also make it harder for the Endara Government to consolidate popular support and renew its mandate with a fresh presidential vote. Panamanians who cheered U.S. troops last December never imagined that Washington could forget their desperate plight by March. Has it?

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL ISSUE;
Going Abroad Without Going Broke

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH; STEVEN PROKESCH is a business correspondent in the London bureau of The New York Times.

 BODY:
AMERICANS can still only hope for a return of the days when the mighty dollar made foreign travel a bargain. As a result of its relative weakness, imagination and careful planning will once again be a must for cash-constrained Americans intent upon spending their vacations strolling along the banks of the Seine, enjoying theater in the West End of London or sampling sushi in Tokyo.
But judging from the number of people now arranging for vacations this spring and summer, Americans are rising to the challenge.
It is, of course, too early to tell whether 1990 will surpass last year's record of nearly 6.5 million American visitors to Europe. But travel agents certainly sound upbeat. ''We're already having a good year,'' said Brian D. Robb, director of international product at the Carlson Travel Network (formerly Ask Mr. Foster) in Minneapolis, one of America's biggest agency chains. ''Concerns about the value of the dollar and terrorism seem to be on the back burner.'' 
Thomas Cook Travel, another big chain, also reports strong spring and summer bookings for foreign vacations, especially in Europe. ''The dollar is not great, but you have a combination of pent-up demand'' for vacations in Western Europe and ''a desire to explore Eastern Europe,'' said Marianne Toldalagi, senior vice president for marketing.
The value of the dollar against a weighted average of the world's major currencies is virtually unchanged from a year ago, according to separate calculations by the Federal Reserve Board and Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. But it is still one-third below where it stood five years ago.
Such general figures, though, do not tell you very much about a given place. For instance, the dollar is somewhat stronger in Australia, Israel and Egypt and is up sharply against the currencies of Mexico, Argentina, Kenya and Turkey. On the other hand, its value has fallen by 5 percent or more in Austria, France, Italy and the Netherlands.
Although the dollar has gained 5.7 percent against the British pound in the past year, Americans will not better off in Britain because prices in general have been rising at a 7.7 per cent annual rate. And a 21 percent rise in the dollar against the yen does not mean that Japan has suddenly become a bargain: Tokyo remains one of the world's most expensive cities.
But as even those on tight budgets will discover, there are still a number of places - including Mexico, Greece, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Egypt and India - where the dollar wields a lot of buying power.
Just because a city is expensive does not mean everything is exorbitant. In many European cities, museums are free or inexpensive. A good seat at some of the most popular plays in London like ''Miss Saigon,'' ''Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell'' or ''Les Liaisons Dangereuses'' costs only $20 to $25, and tickets for many fringe plays go for $10 or less.
While watermelons may cost $60 each in Tokyo, lunch without watermelon can actually be reasonable. Noodle shops charge $3 to $5 for a bowl of noodles. At most restaurants, a ''set'' or complete lunch - pronounced teh-sho-ku in Japanese - usually costs about $8. That might be sushi, a selection of yakitori (chicken on skewers), or some freshly fried tempura.
In Paris, antique lovers will find some bargains at the thrice weekly auctions at Hotel Drouot, the city's official auction house at 9 Rue Drouot in the ninth arrondissement.
Hotels may be expensive on average in West Germany, but the high standards for comfort and cleanliness mean you do not need to stay at a luxury hotel. A two- or three-star hotel that charges as little as $60 a night is usually acceptable.
Since the more expensive countries are eager to attract American tourists, many have tourist centers both at home and in the United States that have become increasingly helpful in suggesting ways Americans can stretch their dollars. This includes guidance on the least expensive times to come (avoid Passover in Israel and the World Cup matches that this year run from June 8 to July 8 in Italy) and on finding comfortable but less-expensive accommodations like bed and breakfasts.
So even though doubles at elegant London hotels like Claridge's, the Savoy and the Berkeley go for $297 to $429 a night, it is easy to find much more affordable places.
A British Tourist Authority brochure lists budget hotels in areas of London like Russell Square or Bayswater that cost $91 and under a night for a double. A service called Bed and Breakfast (GB) lists places in London that during peak season charge $26 to $66 a night per person, with breakfast (44-491-578-803). The Bulldog Club (44-1-622-6935) specializes in luxury bed and breakfasts in central London ($120 a night for a double with bathroom). And the Global Home Exchange and Travel Service will help you swap your house with that of a British family (44-1-852-1439).
The subway and bus systems are the key to getting around inexpensively in many areas of the world. For instance, in Tokyo clean, safe and efficient subways will get you almost anywhere in the central part of the city for 90 cents.
In London, using an exchange rate of $1.65 to the pound, a one-day pass costs $4.29 and a weekly pass is $32.50, for unlimited travel on subways and buses. The color-coded maps of the London Underground are excellent. In Paris a single Metro ticket costs 86 cents (at 5.8 francs to the dollar), but if you buy a packet of 10, called a carnet, at one time, it costs $5.38. A three-day ticket for unlimited travel, second-class, on Paris's subways and buses costs about $12, and for five days, $19. Frequent buses from the airport to downtown Stockholm cost about $6 versus $50 for a taxi.
SEVERAL countries also offer tourists special train passes, although they may require you to buy them in the United States before arriving. But make sure you are going to use them enough to make the purchase worthwhile.
In many countries, travelers can save money by avoiding peak seasons or holidays. ''In Europe in May, September and October, prices are down and the place looks the same,'' said Mr. Robb of Carlson Travel.
In Jerusalem, at the King David Hotel, the rate for a double is normally $170 with a street view and $227 with a view of the Old City, rises to $246 and $285, respectively, during the Passover season.
Of course, another option, no matter the time of year is to venture off the beaten path. The countryside just one hour from London is charming - as are the lower prices. Glasgow is the designated ''European City of Culture'' in 1990 and events are scheduled there throughout the year. The cost of a double room in Glasgow ranges from around $20 a night at a bed and breakfast to $161 at the four-star Holiday Inn.
Another way to save is to buy a package through a travel agent. Because tour companies buy in bulk, they often are able to offer savings of 15 percent or more. And packages are increasingly giving travelers more Flexibility in customizing a trip to their own liking. The land costs of an eight-night package of five Swiss cities sold by Thomas Cook, for instance, costs about $230 less, or 27 percent, than what you would pay on your own.
A good gauge for how much it will cost to stay in a given city is the State Department's per diem allowances for Federal employees traveling abroad. It covers moderately priced food and lodging as well as mandatory service charges and taxes, tips and the cost of expenses like laundry and dry cleaning.
At the upper end are Moscow ($218), Tokyo ($195) and Stockholm ($194). Next come Brussels, Madrid, Dublin, Rome, London and Paris, which range from $170 to $178. Those looking for more economical cities might chose Athens ($99), Nairobi ($94), Rio de Janeiro ($100), Mexico City ($102) and New Delhi ($103). Other daily allowances include $138 for Beijing, $150 for Sydney and $160 for Hong Kong.
Following are some specific tips for stretching your budget in a sampling of major international destinations.
 
France. While Paris is certainly expensive, it costs nothing to watch the sailboats in the Luxembourg Gardens, to go window shopping along Faubourg Saint-Honore or to listen to musicians on the Pont St.-Louis connecting Ile de la Cite and Ile St.-Louis.
It is easier to get an excellent $20 dinner in Paris than in New York. Try the hearty stews and crusty peasant breads at La Lozere, a folksy restaurant in the sixth arrondissement at 4 Rue Hautefeuille (43.54.26.64). If you really want to stretch your dollars, try one of the many North African restaurants in the Latin Quarter; a filling meal may cost less than $9. A way to try one of Paris's finest restaurants at nonstratospheric prices is to order one of the special fixed-price lunches that many of them offer.
There are still some good deals for hotels in Paris. A handsome, comfortable hotel overlooking the Pantheon is the Hotel des Grands Hommes (17 Place Pantheon, fifth arrondissement; 46.34.19.60), where you can obtain a double room with bath for $122 a night. A respectable but no-frills hotel, alongside the National Theatre of the Odeon is the Hotel Michelet Odeon (6 Place de l'Odeon, sixth; 46.34.27.80), where you can obtain a double room, with bath, for $68.
 
Italy. For those who want to combine a love for soccer and Italy, the World Cup '90 is offering special package trips that are available in most American cities. One way to save money is the Check Out Italy discount coupon program for popular spots like Rome, Milan, Venice, Florence, the Amalfi Coast and Sorrento. The 142 coupons that offer discounts for things like hotels, restaurants, beauty salons and shops, and a few gifts. (Send check or money order for $40 plus $4.95 for postage and handling to Check Out Italy, Post Office Box 36, Monte Rio, Calif. 95462; 800-462-0615 or 707-865-2797.) You may want to avoid Italy during the World Cup championship matches, when prices will probably be higher. Special events like art shows and concerts will not end with the games. They will run May to September.
A double room at a moderately priced hotel in Rome like the Hotel Locarno (22 Via della Penna; 3610841) costs about $130 a night, including breakfast. A luxury hotel like the Excelsior is about $330 for a double, without breakfast.
To save money, stay in smaller towns. Or try country-style lodgings similar to bed and breakfasts that practice what the Italians call agriturism. Prices in the less-explored southern regions are often one-third of those in the north.
 
Japan. It is true that tourists can easily spend $150 to $300 a head for dinner in Tokyo. But some restaurants charge $25 a person for a nice dinner and a glass or two of wine.
For lunch, great yakitori can be found under the elevated railroad tracks around the Yarakucho Station near the Ginza for less than $10. Or try the sushi shops near Tsukiji, the world's largest fish market, within walking distance of the Ginza.
For touring, some of the best sights, like shrines, are free or close to it. The area around Shinjuku Station is filled with bargain stores. Purchases in department stores are generally expensive, but an exception is the traditional Japanese lacquerware bowls.
Ordinary hotel rooms in Japan cost $125 to $500. But tourist offices in each town can put you in touch with minshiku, or the Japanese equivalent of bed and breakfasts, which often charge $50 a night or less.
 
Israel. The bargains seem few and far between. The Hilton in Tel Aviv charges $195 and several supposedly four-star hotels charge $100 to $125.
The major American rental firms charge $75 to $100 a day for what is called a full-sized car though is midsized by American standards, although local firms charge less. When taking a taxi, make sure that the cabbie has his meter on. While a group taxi, called a sherut, is cheaper for traveling between cities, making arrangements might be difficult if you speak no Hebrew.
Dinner at major tourist hotels can cost $40 to $50. But look for smaller restaurants that Israelis frequent near most of the hotels. The prices are lower and the menus are almost always in English. While the quality of beef is poor, the lamb can be quite good.
 
India. The dollar still goes a long way in India. A double room at Delhi's moderate Claridges Hotel is $69 a night, plus a 20 percent tax if paid in local currency. At the top-of-the-line Taj Mahal, it is $115.
Train and air fares are very low. Since many train trips are overnight, they save on hotel bills. Meals on trains are usually hot and fairly tasty in first- or air-conditioned class. A one-way overnight fare between Delhi and Calcutta runs from $35.52 on an ordinary, air-conditioned sleeper to $80 in a first-class compartment.
India continues to be one of the best places in the world for shoppers. To avoid phony goods in Delhi, go to Central Cottage Industries on Jan Path or the State Emporiums on Baba Karak Singh Marg off Connaught Place. The price of a heavy brass four-cup coffee pot is about $16. A floor-length woolen Kashmiri kaftan that is hand-embroidered goes for about $45, and cheaper models cost as little as $20. Colorful hand-painted Rajasthani jewelry boxes sell for $20 to $40. And you can pay from a few dollars to $500 for sari-length silk and hand-woven cottons.
 
China. With the devaluation of the yuan in December and a Government-imposed austerity program, the dollar now goes a lot further in China. And because tourists have generally stayed away after the upheaval last spring, most places have kept their prices down - although prices may rise because of the 11th Asian Games, which are scheduled for Sept. 22 to Oct. 7.
For lodging in Beijing, the best buys are Chinese hotels like the Huadu ($40 a night for a double) and the New Exhibition Center Hotel ($45). There is also a 10 percent service charge, but tipping is not allowed. The New Exhibition Hotel's rate includes breakfast and airport pickup but inform it in advance of arrival. The Jianguo Hotel charges what is considered a moderate $99 plus a 10 percent service fee. The Palace Hotel costs $160 a night plus a 15 percent charge. Both prices do not include breakfast.
Food, like Peking duck, is cheap and delicious. Local wines and those produced jointly with Remy Martin cost less than half the price of imports. Restaurants in moderately priced hotels and local restaurants catering to tourists are good choices.
Beijing has several joint-venture restaurants with foreign partners like Windows on the World, Dongfang, Ren Ren, Pearl and China Tea House that offer excellent dim sum lunches for less than $6 a person.
The cheapest way to get around is to rent a bike at 65 cents to $1 a day, plus a refundable $42 deposit. Taxis are reasonable, too: you can hire one for about $40 a day. For a guided tour of Beijing, try the City Bus Tour. A $4.25 ticket allows you to get off at a stop and resume the trip on another bus.
 
Kenya. Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, remains relatively reasonable. At the popular Carnivore Restaurant, which specializes in dishes like antelope, zebra and crocodile but also has vegetarian entrees, a meal for two with wine recently cost $39.
A basic room with two single beds costs $133 a night at the Norfolk Hotel, the most luxurious in town (telephone, from the United States, 254-2-335422). At the moderately priced Fairview (254-2-723211) - one mile from the city's center, with five acres of gardens - a double costs $42.85.
Camping trips are relatively inexpensive and can be arranged through any travel agent around town. In general, $250 a day a person will buy an individualized safari: a tented camp where your group will be the only guests, provisions for three meals a day and game rides in Range Rovers.

On Horseback in Alaska
Q. This summer I would like to go horseback riding in Alaska. Can you suggest places that offer trail rides? - G. S., New York, N.Y.
A. Alaska is so vast you would think there would be many places renting horses, but the state's Division of Tourism was hard put to find them. Here are three possibilities:
SeaHorse Riding Adventures, Post Office Box 122, Gustavus, Alaska 99826 (907-697-2266), has a stable of six horses and arranges rides for up to five people. All rides are guided, mostly along beaches in Glacier Bay National Park and on a few back roads. Gustavus, the gateway to Glacier Bay, is about 50 miles west of Juneau, accessible by air or water. 
Rides last one to four hours, and rates range from $25 for one hour to $75 for four hours ($20 to $65 for children). Although the company does not arrange overnight rides, Nate Borson, the vice president, said visitors could extend their trips by staying at an inn or bed and breakfast establishment and could go riding every day, take a kyacking trip or go fishing.
South Fork Outfit, Mile 110 Glenn Highway, HCO3 Box 8485, Palmer, Alaska 99645 (907-745-6323), has 20 horses and takes groups (minimum of 4; maximum, preferrably, of 10, although more can be accommodated) on trail rides of a day or more at $100 a person a day. The price includes horses, bedding and food. Overnight trips stop at cabins once used by trappers. The season is from the first of June to the end of October, according to Mark Meekin, son of the founder of the company, which started in 1945. An average ride lasts three to five days, but Mr. Meekin said he would custom-fit a trip to the visitor's wishes, offering among other things stream fishing, fossil hunting and wildlife photography. Palmer is about 115 miles northeast of Anchorage. South Fork Outfit will pick visitors up in Anchorage and provide room and board overnight at a lodge for $150 a person.
Matanuska Riding Stables, Post Office Box 3498, Palmer, Alaska 99645 (907-376-2946), has 29 horses and takes up to 20 riders on the trail at once. Day rides at $15 an hour for each horse until April 15, $20 an hour after April 15, are offered from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. every day year round. Overnight rides are $100 a person a day for a minimum of two people. Rates are for guide and horses only. Visitors must bring their own tents and sleeping bags and supply their own food.
Among attractions in the region used by both South Fork Outfit and Matanuska Riding Stables are glaciers, wildlife (moose, coyotes, rabbits) and the Wrangell Mountains, the Talkeetna Mountains and the Chugach Mountains. At times it is possible to see Mount McKinley.
A free vacation guide is offered by the State of Alaska; write Division of Tourism, Box E-529, Juneau, Alaska 99811 or phone 907-465-2010.
 
Van Rental in Portugal
Q. We are two couples leaving for Portugal on May 1 for 10 days. We want to rent a minivan (Ford Aerostar size) to hold four suitcases and four carry-on bags. Our travel agent says only nine-passenger vans are available and suggests we rent a Ford Orion. Would that be big enough? - B. S., Philadelphia
A. Officials of both Hertz and Avis say that a car the size of the Ford Orion (considered full size) should handle your luggage. The trunk space is 18 or so cubic feet, sufficient for four suitcases and at least some of the carry-on bags. The interior holds four or five passengers, so there would probably be room for some of the carry-on bags in the passenger compartment.
The Orion that Hertz offers has a manual transmission and gets about 32 miles to the gallon. The full-size car offered by Avis would probably be a VW or an Audi. Hertz quoted a weekly rate of $364, which pro rated for 10 days would be $520. Avis declined to quote a rate without knowing more particulars, such as pickup and dropoff spots.
The large van you mentioned is probably a Ford Transit (offered by Hertz) or a VW Transporter (offered by Avis). The Transit has automatic transmission, three doors, seats for nine passengers and room for five suitcases. Its mileage is rated at 20 miles to the gallon. The Hertz rate: $625 a week, $893 for 10 days.
A local agency, Europcar (24 Avenue Antonio Augusto Aguiar, 1097 Lisbon, Portugal; telephone from the United States: 011-351-1-524558), offers a seven-passenger Peugeot 505 station wagon that would undoubtedly meet your needs. A spokeswoman said the rates for May 1 would not be available until the end of March.
 
Flying Around the World
Q. Are there still round-the-world plane tickets? If so, who offers them and what restrictions apply? - E. B. E., New York, N.Y.
A. Many airlines, usually in conjunction with other carriers, offer round-the-world tickets - on two major routes: North Pacific and South Pacific. United Airlines, for example, has agreements with Air France, Air New Zealand, Alitalia, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, KLM, Lufthansa, Pan American, S.A.S. and Qantas. North Pacific fares are $2,204 in economy class, $3,102 in business class and $4,304 in first class. For the South Pacific: $2,784, $4,441 and $5,782, respectively. Northwest and Air France offer a North Pacific route in economy class only ($2,099).
Round-the-world tickets are good for a year from date of first use but must be purchased at least 21 days before that. Outside the United States, there is a wide choice of stopovers, but backtracking is not permitted. After setting an itinerary, you may make one change without penalty; subsequent changes cost $25.
Airline reservations representatives or a travel agent can work out details. British Airways, for example, maintains a round-the-world desk: 800-247-9297.
 
Tennis and Italy
Q. I plan to visit Milan in the fall. Could you give me a list of tennis resorts in northern Italy? F. W. B., Boseman, Mont.
A. Had you asked about golf, said a spokesman for the Italian Government Travel Office in New York, the task would be easy. The office publishes lists of golf courses but not tennis resorts because there are so many of them. Every town has at least one court. Many hotels have courts, and there are many private and public clubs.
The place to look is the telephone book. In the white pages they are listed under ''Tennis'' or ''Tennis Club.'' In the yellow pages, they are under ''Impianti Sportivi'' (sports establishments) and grouped with gymnastic clubs, horseback riding clubs and the like. In the white pages of the Milan phone book, for example, about 25 tennis clubs are listed.

HEADLINE: OLDER CHILDREN AND DIVORCE

 BODY:
It seems to me that Barbara S. Cain's article ''Older Children and Divorce'' (Feb. 18) does not add anything new to that tired subject. We all know that everyone suffers in a divorce. However, everyone suffers growing up. The young people mentioned in your article might have had different problems in nondivorcing families, but problems they would have had.
In the United States, we have allowed Hollywood to set our standards. We think we all should have ''perfect'' families like those in ''Leave It to Beaver'' and ''Father of the Bride.'' So we set ourselves up for disappointment.
Certainly, some of the marriages described in your article were better off ending in divorce. The real problem is with the state of marriage as defined in our society. It is an economic agreement endowed with all the false sentiments of a bad Grade B movie.

HEADLINE: The Politics of Pornography

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Donald Alexander Downs's so-called research on the politics of pornography is largely made up of the favorite fantasies and fabrications of its defenders. His ignorance of the realities of these politics is maintained by apparently talking to no one who wrote, sponsored, organized or testified for the ordinance against pornography that is his topic. The review by Franklin E. Zimring - another of pornography's defenders - of ''The New Politics of Pornography'' (Jan. 28) takes Mr. Downs's misrepresentations as fact. Both book and review might best be understood in the context of the public relations initiative - which cost upwards of a million dollars - by the Media Coalition, a group whose goal is to defend ''sexually explicit'' speech. One of its disinformation strategies is to put feminists who oppose pornography in bed with the right. 
Among the many legislators with whom we have worked on the ordinance, one is a political conservative. She was selected by the Mayor of Indianapolis to get the bill passed. We were honored to work with her. The ordinance was originally sponsored in Minneapolis by a progressive white Republican woman and a black Democratic man. Wherever it is introduced, liberals and conservatives vote both for it and against it. If the right supported the ordinance, we would have a lot more resources, credibility, money and votes. We have found most conservatives far more uncomfortable with sex equality than with pornography.
We did our best to influence former Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d's Commission on Pornography to listen to women, with some success. Our ''sin'' is in building a women's politics that is as indifferent to left and right as pornography's harm to women is. That is ''the new politics of pornography,'' but Mr. Downs misses it.
Mr. Zimring wonders what we have been doing the last five years. While pornography's defenders have got fat off the virtual academic cottage industry called ''the pornography issue,'' its opponents have been trying to survive in the face of being libeled, fired, evicted, impoverished, harassed, vilified, unemployed and unpublished. The erasure by Mr. Zimring of the role of the feminist writer Andrea Dworkin, who was co-author of the ordinance with me, is a part of this. And the lie that we are in bed with the right never stops, and never stops growing.

 BODY:

Institutional Apartments
Question: Can institutions like schools and hospitals hold leases on rent-stabilized apartments and sublet them to teachers or nurses, or do leases have to be in the name of individuals to comply with the law? . . . M. S., Manhattan
Answer: According to Thomas R. Viola, a spokesman for the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, the Rent Stabilization Code has no prohibition against renting to an institution. However, the institution would have to conform to the normal rules of subletting. Those rules include obtaining the landlord's consent and limiting the sublet to two years out of four. But the code gives greater latitude to not-for-profit hospitals. Section 2525.6 (g) 1 of the code lets these institutions sublet to affiliated personnel without the landlord's consent and with no time limit. Schools, hospitals and other institutions that hold net leases on entire buildings are exempt from subletting rules as long as units are rented to affiliated personnel. 
 
From Co-op to Condo
Question: We wish to change our 11-family cooperative corporation into a condominium association. There would be no financial gain or loss for any of us. Is this possible and, if so, how do we go about it? . . . M. J., Monroe, N.Y.
Answer: According to a spokesman for the New York State Attorney General, a co-op can be converted to a condominium. The process requires filing an application for a tenant-sponsored condominium conversion plan with the Attorney General's Real Estate Financing Bureau. However, Stuart Saft, a lawyer who has guided a few co-ops through this process, suggested that you carefully consider the time and money involved.
''I can think of only one reason why this would be worth the effort,'' said Mr. Saft, ''and that would be to circumvent the 80-20 rule.'' This Internal Revenue Service regulation limits the commercial income of a residential co-op for such things as store rents to no more than 20 percent of its gross income. Mr. Saft said that before you convert, the shareholders would have to pay off the building's mortgage because condominiums do not have mortgages. Then all shareholders would have to convert shares to mortgages on their units.
Moreover, the condominium plan, Mr. Saft said, would have to meet the standards of such city agencies as the Departments of Buildings and Health. It would also have to include new architectural drawings, even if no new construction was involved. Mr. Saft said such a conversion would require a no-action letter from the Attorney General's office indicating that the co-op's plan did not involve the sale of units, as well as a private ruling letter from the Internal Revenue Service confirming that the transaction would be tax-free.
''Unless this co-op is facing a serious financial problem if they remain a co-op,'' he said, ''I would recommend against the conversion.''
 
Broken Leases
Question: I own a two-family house and rent the upstairs apartment. I have had problems with tenants who leave before leases are up or who use their security deposits as the last month's rent. Are the standard leases they sign binding? . . . R. T., Springfield, N.J.
Answer: Yes. According to David R. Smith, a lawyer who specializes in real estate matters, as long as the lease has been signed by both parties it is a legally binding contract. Security deposits are supposed to cover the cost or repair for any damage done over and above normal wear and tear on apartments.
''A landlord would have the right to sue,'' said Mr. Smith. ''But even if the chances of prevailing in court are good, the cost of litigation is often not worth it.''

HEADLINE: Development Slowdown Offers Planners a Breather

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
FOR the last five or six years local planning boards in the New York metropolitan area have been too busy wrangling with builders, worrying about the voters and wrestling with a host of new state environmental protection laws to think through a coherent new vision of the future of their communities.
But as the rush to build has slackened, some planning agencies are seizing the time they now have to assess where the boom of the 1980's has left them and to prepare for the next surge of development.
For the impression is widespread among both developers and planners that the current slowdown is just a dip in the building cycle - a pause to let demand catch up with an oversupply of houses and office space - rather than a long-term decline in the region's economy.
Indeed, some local officials say they are already seeing a new wave of applications for commercial, hotel and retail space being prepared by developers for the expected upturn. Many of the applications are prompted by the desire of developers to win approvals before environmental laws and zoning rules, already tightened during the boom, are tightened further. 
But with the slower pace of development offering a least a little slack time for planners and politicians, communities in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are looking for new solutions to old problems of congestion, high planning costs and environmental degredation.
Among these initiatives are making the builders of several neighboring projects jointly plan ways to mitigate the impact of traffic instead of making the municipality do it; seeking curbs on the growth of wasteful one-occupant commuter traffic on busy roads and moving to protect fragile wetlands from development before the market strengthens.
Lee E. Koppelman, executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board and the dean of regional planners, noted the odd juxtaposition of a slack market and an active development community.
''Interestingly enough, as far as Long Island is concerned,'' he said, ''we have a substantial irony in the fact that - despite the fact that development is in the doldrums and that in many areas there is a surplus of commercial office space - we have been getting applications for more commercial projects in a shorter time now than we've had before.''
Still, he said, the slump is clear for all to see, and with it a mandate for planners that is in some ways harder to achieve than when the market is jumping.
''When the economy is moving upwards, it is not the planners who create wealth, they only define objectives,'' he said. ''When the economy is in danger of sliding downhill, the planners have an even more important role - to make sure the slide doesn't ruin the quality of life they worked to achieve.''
Similar thoughts were expressed by planners in other parts of the region.
''IN the decade of the 80's the planning boards were subjected to a great deal of pressure from a flow of development applications that made the flaws in the system very apparent,'' said Samuel L. Hamill Jr., executive director of the Middlesex Somerset Mercer Regional Council, a nonprofit planning consulting group active in central New Jersey.
''The planning boards didn't really have time to deal with some of the more fundamental questions,'' he said, ''such as revisions in master plans and taking advantage of many of the new statutes that have come into effect in the 80's. Now that applications have dropped somewhat we have a little time to address ourselves to planning for the next boom.''
And a boom it has been. Northern and central New Jersey alone built 34 million square feet of commercial office space from the beginning of 1986 through 1989, outbuilding even Manhattan, which produced 24.2 million square feet in the same period. When commercial construction in Westchester and Fairfield Counties is included, the metropolitan area including Manhattan added 72.8 million square feet of commercial space during those four years of rapid growth.
New Jersey added nearly 180,000 new housing units, both detached houses and apartments, during the same period, with many of the new units rising in the suburbs of Atlantic City, which has been undergoing a gambling-driven development surge. Westchester County, meanwhile, saw some 12,000 new houses and apartments rise from 1986 to the end of last year, while for Fairfield County the number was 10,700.
For some planning departments, the slowdown that has followed this building frenzy has brought a welcome chance to catch up with demands neglected during the boom and to devise new strategies for coping with the next wave of development most municipalities believe is headed their way.
Some of the new departures follow:
* Lawrence Township, just outside Trenton and astride the Interstate 295-Route 1 highway network, is set to ask several major local corporations to draw up a joint traffic-impact plan on any new expansions in the area before approaching the town planning board. This means that corporate neighbors will have to talk to one another before separately seeking development approvals.
* The eight communities that make up Connecticut's South West Regional Planning Agency - an umbrella group composed of the Towns of Greenwich, Stamford, Darien, New Canaan, Wilton, Weston, Westport and Norwalk - have banded together to devise ways to reduce both interstate trucking and single-occupant commuter traffic on congested Interstate 95.
* On Long Island, environmental officials are mapping out new zones of protection for wetlands - an issue in all three states - before the next wave of office, housing and road building pushes makes the job of protecting fragile land areas more difficult.
For residents tired of growth and congestion, these initiatives may seem long overdue. But many developers believe that what the region needs now that there is a slump is not more, but fewer, planning constraints.
''The real estate sector has already been pummeled by public policy,'' said Pat O'Keefe, executive director of the New Jersey Builders Association. ''The question is no longer managing growth; the question confronting us now is getting some growth.''
Regional planners agree that many of the environmental quality-control laws that took effect in the 80's were enacted in response to the surge in development during the second half of the decade but were never fully integrated into local planning decisions because of the pace of work.
By all accounts, New Jersey has now taken the lead from Connecticut in state efforts to coordinate economic development planning and rational growth management. Starting with the 1979 act to protect the state's 1.1 million acres of pinelands from overdevelopment, the country's most densely populated state has since enacted several further measures to protect the environment.
These laws limit coastal development, set aside open space, regulate highway access, stringently protect wetlands and, under the 1985 State Planning Act, establish a ''cross-acceptance'' framework requiring municipalities, counties and state agencies to coordinate planning efforts.
Hartford's planning law, the State Plan for the Conservation and Development of Connecticut, dates from the early 70's. Although its rules largely govern actions by state agencies, it has inspired broad regional planning alliances in the state's urbanized southwest.
In New York, the State Environmental Quality Review Act, known as S.E.Q.R.A., was enacted in 1978. But it took full effect in the early 80's as a wetlands and water quality protection measure and has since been only modestly enlarged to cover historical and archeological sites.
''The thing about S.E.Q.R.A. is that its real potential is not really known yet, and this is true of all regulatory processes,'' said Hooper Brooks, who heads the environmental planning office at the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit planning advisory group that covers the metropolitan region. ''You don't really get to see how good they are until you see what the courts do with them.''
In New Jersey, George Ververides, director of the Middlesex County Planning Board, recalled the economic slump, far more serious than today's, that followed the oil embargo of 1973 and 1974, prompting widespread predictions that suburban sprawl was at an end.
At the depths of the slump, he said, developers were still active along Route 1, the county's growth corridor, acquiring and assembling building sites for the upturn they seemed to know would come.
''They were buying up the land and putting large pieces together and we would not have had all the development here if they had not been out there, getting ready for the next boom,'' Mr. Ververides said.
''I feel this is a tremendous opportunity that has come to us because right at this moment the whole state plan is coming into play, and all of us now have a little time to pull away from the routine site plan work and think about what we're going to do in the county.''
Jerry Lenaz, a Princeton planning consultant for several central New Jersey township planning boards, said the breather in development has allowed some planning boards to consider sophisticated planning approaches.
One would be to apply project staging - a common requirement for big developments to be built out in phases according to a schedule - to small housing projects. The process allows planners to measure the impact of a project as it procedes and adjust environmental rules with the developer.
Massachussetts planning law now allows municipalities to build even small housing projects in phases to lessen sudden impacts on nearby communities, and Mr. Lenaz believes New Jersey townships should trythe same approach. This might be accomplished by tying permission to begin construction on one or two houses to the completion of road improvements, or limiting new houses to one or two per year to reduce the sudden impact on roads, sanitation and schools.
''SOME towns are taking this pause in the activity to update their master plans,'' Mr. Lenaz said. ''They're thinking, 'What do we have left, what's special about the remaining properties and how do we want to guide the remaining development in our community?' ''
One lesson of the boom years that several planners said would remain with them during the next upsurge in construction, assuming it comes, is the likelihood of increased pressures on developers to pay still more in impact fees to get approval of a project. Mr. Koppelman of the Long Island Regional Planning Board advanced another argument for vigilance during moments when the pace of development slows. Planning for development has two parts, he maintained, one designed to manage the ride to prosperity, and, once prosperity is achieved, to maintain that prosperity.
''Obviously you need careful planning when the market is active, but when things are slack there is an equal need,'' Mr. Koppleman said. ''Long Island has built to a crescendo where it has been defined in national surveys as one of the top communities in quality. So once you're there, the question becomes, how do you stay there?
''New York State has a budget crisis, Washington is pulling back, there's a softening in the real estate market, Long Island taxpayers are in revolt. The whole point of planning is not only to have stable growth, but to have the community remain stable at the level of quality that you've achieved.''
It would be easier for Long Island to protect its position today, Mr. Koppelman said, if it had listened to him earlier. In 1967, he said, Long Island planners had a blueprint for a ''perfect'' transportation system - electrifying all commuter rail lines, building separate grade crossings on all major highways and at least one bridge across the western Long Island Sound at Oyster Bay and providing high-speed ferry service to Connecticut farther east. The price was $2 billion, a figure that today would pay for the cross-Sound bridge and little more, considering the price of land.
''Real estate in Nassau County today is selling for $1 million an acre,'' Mr. Koppelman said. ''If you want to build a full cloverleaf intersection, that takes 100 acres, so you can see it immediately becomes impossible, and the best we can build are these diamond slip-offs.''
Mr. Koppleman described diamond slip-offs as a poor man's cloverleaf consisting of exit and entrance ramps, often controlled by traffic lights, and lacking the outer ramps of a cloverleaf that permit motorists to enter and exit an interchange without stopping.
Beyond the wall maps and bulging binders of the planner's office, meanwhile, many developers are already looking ahead to the next project.
Trammell Crow Residential Group of Dallas, a major housing developer nationwide, broke ground in November for Steward's Crossing, a 240-unit rental development built on land leased from Rider College in Lawrenceville, between Princeton and Trenton, in central New Jersey.
Why build now, at a time when the inventory of unsold houses in the area is high?
''I don't believe anybody's crystal ball is too good these days, but I do believe in the underlying demographics of central New Jersey,'' said Kevin Tucker, a principal in the project. Getting planning approvals is becoming more and more involved and time-consuming, he said, but once they have been achieved, logic argues in favor of going ahead, to have the project completed in time for the upturn. Mr. Tucker believes that will not come until well into next year.
ROBERT S. POWELL JR., president of DKM Properties, based in Lawrenceville, said that a project that took eight months to get approved five years ago now takes two or three years.
''It doesn't take any longer to get approval for a 60,000-square-foot office building standing alone than to get approval for 600,000 or 700,000 square feet in several buildings to be built out over seven years,'' he said. ''The problem is that it takes three years to approve a single building and one year to build it, so unless you have your approvals already lined up for other buildings, you can find yourself out of work.''
DKM Properties accordingly has applications before the state, which regulates wetlands, and Lawrence Township, which plans for Lawrenceville, to build 360,000 square feet of office space. It would be developed in three new buildings at Princeton Pike Corporate Center, at the intersection of Interstate 296 and Princeton Pike.
Mr. Powell believes the office market in central New Jersey is already recovering from a hard year of high vacancies, and he wants to be ready for the recovery.
''It really makes a lot of planning sense, if you're going to be in this business, to deal in projects that are long term,'' he said. ''That way you can address your planning issues up front and get your approvals in place, so when you find the market picking up you can move forward on your own schedule.''

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: A Theater Rescued;
Wreckers Foiled Again!

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. LYONS

 BODY:
The Lincoln Theater, a 65-year-old former playhouse in New Haven, has dodged the wrecker's ball and, in the best tradition of melodrama, has been revived - as the Little Theater on Lincoln Street.
In 1982, New Haven sought to demolish the 232-seat theater in the name of urban renewal and use its site for housing. But community groups mobilized to preserve the building, arguing successfully that it deserved to be saved because it was a true civic asset.
The theater had been erected in 1925 with money raised by residents who created the Little Theater Guild of New Haven. It showed films from 1935 to 1982. The preservationists said it would make little sense to tear it down since almost 100 local performing arts groups, lacking a proper theater, were then using church basements and high school auditoriums to stage their productions.
The building and its English Free Style facade was preserved, while the interior was updated with new sound and lighting equipment in a $1.2 million renovation paid for by the state. It is to be used as a theater by the Educational Center for the Arts, a regional high school for the artistically talented supported by 27 school districts in the New Haven area. The local Area Cooperative Educational Services will own the building, which also will be used by community arts groups.
A formal dedication is being planned in April.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL PROPERTY: Columbia's Research Park;
A 'Spec' Building Planned for Audubon Theater Site

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
ITS purpose and location alone would make the Audubon Research Building noteworthy: a speculative commercial development in Washington Heights.
But because the six-story laboratory building, developed by Columbia University, would replace the abandoned Audubon Theater and Ballroom - where the black nationalist leader Malcolm X was assassinated in 1965 and where William Fox began building the entertainment empire that became 20th Century-Fox - the project has drawn not only attention but also criticism.
The critics believe that the theater is too valuable to be razed, given its significance to the civil-rights movement and its distinctive architecture. They also worry about the disposal of laboratory wastes.
Members of the City Planning Commission have also expressed some concern about the disposal question. For Columbia's project to proceed, the commission would have to rezone what is now a residential block to commercial, amend the Zoning Resolution to allow a ''scientific research and development facility'' in the commercial zone by special permit, approve a permit for the block in question - bounded by Broadway, St. Nicholas Avenue, 165th and 166th Street - and approve disposition of the city-owned property. The land-use review procedure has begun on the project and if the community board acts within 60 days, the matter will ultimately wind up at the Board of Estimate. 
The Audubon building would be the first element in what Columbia envisions as a four-block research park between 165th and 168th Streets, across Broadway from the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. The new complex, around Mitchel Park, would have three university laboratories, a doctors' office building and two garages.
It is the first phase, however, that may be the most unusual. ''What's new here is that this would be a speculative building,'' said H. Bernhard Haeckel, Columbia's director of office project development and coordination. ''I am not aware of a multitenant laboratory building in any university setting.''
More typically, a university leases land in its research park to a private company or developer, which puts up its own building.
Tenants in the Audubon building will probably be small companies doing research in cellular and molecular biophysics, genetics, immunology, cancer, biochemistry or microbiology. New York State, a partner in the project, has required that 40 percent of the space be leased to start-up companies.
City Councilman Stanley E. Michels, the Democrat who represents the area, said: ''I look at it as a chance to redevelop without displacing anybody, to fix up the general area - which has gotten into a depressed state - and to provide jobs.'' It is an opportunity for Washington Heights ''to break into the commercial end of things,'' he said.
The Audubon Research Building, 115 feet high, would have some 100,000 square feet. It would be faced in buff brick, with patterns echoing the modernist motifs of nearby architecture. At top would be a large metal-clad exhaust-fan housing, with ranks of stainless-steel stacks above. The architects are Perkins & Will, in association with Bond, Ryder and Associates, both of Manhattan.
THE new building would take up the north half of the theater site. The south half would be used as a parking lot, pending development of a 200,000-square-foot addition. The block is owned by the city and would be leased to Columbia for 99 years.
The $25 million cost would be met by Columbia University, with $4.5 million in equity and $2.5 million in borrowing; the city's Public Development Corporation, with $10 million and the state's Urban Development Corporation, with $8 million.
If the project returns less than 2 percent a year on the investment, 20 percent of any proceeds after expenses and debt service would go to Columbia, with 80 percent going to the city and state. For any return in excess of 2 percent a year, Columbia's share of the proceeds would rise to 25 percent.
''The P.D.C. and the U.D.C. see themselves as capital venturers in this enterprise,'' said Victor Marrero, of Brown & Wood of Manhattan, a lawyer for Columbia.
Among potential tenants, Mr. Haeckel said, are small, start-up companies; established companies that want a ''research lab outpost'' near the medical center and international companies that are ''eager to establish a foothold and view Columbia University as a prestigious institution with which to associate.''
Just being across Broadway would mean little if there were not some entree to the medical center. Mr. Haeckel said tenants would be able to use the library, attend some seminars and have other ''clearly defined amenities,'' some free, some for a fee.
One important service, he said, would be an environmental health and safety office to work with tenants, as they ''will have to comply with the large number of Federal, state and city regulations dealing with the use and disposal of hazardous materials.''
The disposal of biomedical waste was the focus of a preliminary discussion by the City Planning Commission last month. ''I think you're getting concern about the safety aspects,'' Denise M. Scheinberg, the acting chairwoman of the commission, told Columbia's representatives. ''This might be considered an unusual location for such a facility.'' There is another concern about the project: that it would require the demolition of the Audubon Theater, whose facade is filled with exuberant terra-cotta figures: foxes, griffins and an enormous sea-borne female figure before an ancient sailing ship.
''AT least some of it will be preserved and fit into the design of the interior of the building,'' said Lee Silberstein, vice president of the Public Development Corporation, about the terra-cotta work.
The Audubon Theater is not a landmark. The Landmarks Preservation Commission discussed it in the early 1980's but took no action, although its staff later called for salvaging of the terra cotta. Today, demolition seems all but inevitable. But Edward Kaufman, of the Municipal Art Society, said: ''We would really like to see some significant portion of the building preserved. And I don't mean fragments of terra cotta. I mean the exterior.''
Mr. Kaufman cited the building's role in the careers of William Fox and Thomas Lamb, one of the country's foremost theatrical architects. Even more important, he said, was its connection to Malcolm X, who was shot in the ballroom during a rally of his Organization of Afro-American Unity.
The Audubon's place in the ''martyrology of the civil-rights movement,'' he said, was equal to that of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968.
''It's a landmark that is uniquely representative of the African-American experience of struggle,'' said Michael Adams, a preservationist in upper Manhattan. ''There are few such landmarks one can identify as such in the city. If this building is allowed to go down, it will be a tragedy.''
Speaking for Councilwoman C. Virginia Fields, a Democrat whose district includes Harlem, Mr. Adams added, ''All too often, institutions like Columbia University and other interests offer vague promises of economic development and jobs at the expense of the community's cultural and architectural heritage.''
Mr. Haeckel, of Columbia, said ''the university is committed to provide a suitable, appropriate memorial to Malcolm X at that site,'' in addition to doubling an existing $250,000 Malcolm X scholarship.
Preservation of the theater was contemplated in Columbia's original plan. Since then, Mr. Haeckel said, it was determined that this would ''not be economically feasible within the limits of available funding.''
But Mr. Kaufman said: ''The public is putting in $18 million. If the public decides that saving the facades or even more of the building is a public purpose, for Columbia to say it's economically infeasible is just not relevant.''

HEADLINE: End Seen To Slump For Cars

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
AUTOMOBILE sales around Connecticut are still in a slump, but dealers say they are quietly optimistic that business will improve this spring.
''There's very guarded optimism that the spring and the summer will bring a renewed market,'' the executive vice president of the Connecticut Automotive Trades Association in Hartford, Stephen F. Gabriel, said last week. ''There's a lot of new models coming into the market which may attract new buyers. We still have rebate programs.'' 
Mr. Gabriel spoke one week after soft sales prompted a Norwalk auto dealer to file a voluntary bankruptcy petition in United States Bankruptcy Court in Bridgeport, the first such petition in Connecticut.
Bayer Cadillac-Oldsmobile, doing busines as Bayer Jeep Eagle, filed for protection from creditors on Feb. 28.
 
Depressed Market
''Automobile sales right now are very soft,'' the company's owner, Stephen Bayer, said in the filing. ''I have a large built-in overhead, which makes it very difficult to meet your obligations.''
Mr. Gabriel said he would not be surprised if other petitions were filed, given the market condition.
''It wouldn't be shocking if one or two more appeared,'' he said. ''The last year, year and a half, has been pretty much a continually depressed market, and depending on someone's economic condition going into such a long, depressed period, sometimes this is inevitable.''
Mr. Gabriel said sales in the state had been climbing since 1984, with a peak of 215,000 new cars and vans sold in 1986. But sales fell to 188,945 vehicles in 1988 and 164,983 last year.
 
Postponed Purchases
The establishment of 60-month financing kept people driving their cars longer, he said. ''Sometimes, even if they thought about trading it in halfway through that period, they felt they owed more money than the car was worth, so that would make them postpone their purchase a little bit longer,'' he said.
The 14-year-old Bayer company filed under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code, which allows it to reorganize while being protected from creditors. Stephen Bayer said in the petition he would use the filing ''to rid myself of some of my non-performing assets and get back into business.''
Mr. Gabriel said there are signs that the slump may have bottomed out, providing a better market. Nationwide, car and truck sales fell 4.7 percent last month, but sales usually pick up in March and April, when winter weather begins to break, and Americans hit the road.
A spokesman in the State Motor Vehicles Department, Andrew Nelson, said the showroom was packed with customers at Newman Lincoln-Mercury in East Hartford when he brought his car in for service on President's Day.
''We were pretty busy,'' said the general manager, Dick LaQuerre, whose dealership offered free service and maintenance deals that day. ''In fact, we found out in the last month we were the No. 1 Topaz volume dealer in the whole United States. We sold something like 63.''
Mr. LaQuerre said he was optimistic that business will pick up for dealers around Connecticut, ''provided everybody has some good values.''

HEADLINE: CONNECTICUT Q&A: JAMES LEAHY;
Keeping Track of the Sound's Polluters

BYLINE: By ANDI RIERDEN

 BODY:
THE effort to save Long Island Sound demands more aggressive action by state and Federal environmental agencies as well as a commitment by industries to obey clean-water laws, says a study by the Connecticut Public Interest Research Group. The study, called the Campaign to Save Long Island Sound, found that 84 percent of Connecticut companies with permits to dump waste into state waterways violated the environmental laws, said James Leahy, the organization's executive director.
A review of the 121 companies involved showed that nearly 50 percent were routine violators, he said. Conducted by a team of scientists, engineers and environmental advocates, the five-month study examined Federal and state reports along with companies' self-monitoring reports.
The nonprofit organization, which has 45,000 members in Connecticut, conducts research and lobbies for environmental and consumer-protection regulations. Mr. Leahy, 27 years old, oversees campaigns for hazardous-waste cleanup, pesticide control and consumer rights. A Hartford resident, he previously served as the regional campaign director for the Public Interest Research Group's office in Washington. 
In an interview at his office in West Hartford, Mr. Leahy discussed the report and the group's proposals to toughen clean-water laws. Here are some excerpts from the conversation:
Q. What was the purpose of the Campaign to Save Long Island Sound?
A. We started in 1988 and focused our attention on assessing the whole problem of cleaning up the Sound instead of trying to solve it one part at a time. From our initial research, we found that there are significant levels of toxins in the Sound. But at the time, most of the attention from environmental groups pinpointed sewage-treatment overflow and urban runoff from highways and cities. However, we felt that it was necessary to focus on the underlying toxics problem that hadn't been looked at for several years in Connecticut. From there, we decided to focus on industries to see if they were complying with the Clean Water Act.
Q. How did you conduct your research?
A. We got our initial figures from the State Department of Environmental Protection and the National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration, which examines water-quality trends in marine environments throughout the United States. Then we obtained discharge monitoring reports submitted by industries to the D.E.P. These record the amount of industrial pollutants that individual companies are allowed to dump in the waterways. The reports clearly indicated that an upseting number of companies had violated the permit parameters that had been set up for them.
Q. What did you find?
A. There were two studies. One dealt with the direct discharge of toxics into the waterways, and the second dealt with discharge into sewage-treatment plants. In both reports, we found between 80 and 90 percent of companies were either severe or chronic violators. We classified a severe violator as one that has exceeded its permit level by 50 percent or more, and a chronic violator as one who does it four times within six months - in other words, on a routine basis.
From the direct discharge reports, we found that 69 percent of the companies had severe violations, and close to 50 had chronic violations. Forty percent had both severe and chronic violations. We also found that 75 percent of companies that were discharging into local treatment plants had violated their permits.
Q. Who are some of the major violators?
A. One of our case studies was Circuit Wise in North Haven, which has had a series of violations over the course of several years and, as far as we're concerned, has shown no real good-faith effort to address those problems. The First Constitution Bank is now getting blasted because it is running the Save Our Sound campaign and giving loans to Circuit Wise.
Pfizer Pharmaceuticals in Groton is an example of a company that uses lots of chemicals but has made the effort to set up their plant so that its discharge processes work - though they have on occasion been careless. The worst companies in my view are the ones whose plants are running well, yet they don't make sure that they're staying within their standards. But when you get numbers that are saying 80 to 90 percent of companies are violating, it becomes too overwhelming to spotlight a few.
Q. What was the D.E.P.'s reaction to your findings?
A. They were incredibly cooperative throughout the whole process, and they helped make the study possible. They realize that they don't have the staff to enforce clean-water laws, and obviously industries realize that, too. The Water Compliance Bureau is taking significant cuts between now and 1994 because of Federal budget cuts. However, the D.E.P. did collect over $1 million in fines last year, more than they've ever collected.
Q. Does your organization have any alternative solutions to the D.E.P.'s staffing shortages?
A. The Council of Environmental Quality came out with a report that says that in order to fulfill the mandates that are required by the General Assembly, the D.E.P. would need an additional 350 positions, which amounts to a budget increase of $20 million. We have been trying to organize a lobbying effort to get the General Assembly to allow for the extra increase in staff.
We estimate that an extra $20 million in addition to the current D.E.P. budget would equal only 1 percent of the total state budget. We don't think that 1 percent is too much to ask to protect the environment. And from our canvassing efforts, we found that most of the people of Connecticut agree with us on that.
Q. Do fines serve as an effective deterrent?
A. The thing that drives industry is profit. Therefore, these violations have to affect the cost of doing business. Maybe companies are deciding that the fines are O.K. - it's cheaper to pay them than to install the proper pollution mechanisms. Companies are also pretty confident that, even if they report their violations, there's a big chance that they won't be brought to justice.
We've proposed legislation recommending that those fines be increased - that is, if you're a significant or chronic violator, then you should be issued a base fine of $25,000.
The second thing that drives industry is public relations. We'd like to see the D.E.P. put out a report of all companies that violate their permits so that people around the state will know who is protecting the environment and who isn't. If these companies are given a public relations problem, and that causes them to reduce their pollution, then I would say we're doing our job.
Q. How does this affect the Long Island Sound issue?
A. One of the problems of addressing Long Island Sound is that it's always been a coastal issue, with the people on the coast being the most concerned. But all pollution problems in Connecticut affect Long Island Sound, everything from runoff to the pollution of our rivers and streams.
We need to address all those things and realize that not only does everything in Connecticut affect Long Island Sound, but that Long Island Sound affects everything in Connecticut, including a good chunk of our economy, such as our fishing and tourism industries, which rely on the purity of our waterways.
What we're hoping to do with these findings is make Long Island Sound a statewide concern and end this division between the coastal part of the state and the interior part of the state. That way, I think the issue will be addressed more quickly.
Q. How does the environment compare to 1972, when the first Clean Water Act was passed?
A. It's much better. The problems in the 1970's were incredible in terms of the amount of pollution that was going unchecked into our rivers and streams and oceans. But even with these laws and the E.P.A. and D.E.P. in place, we've still got miles to go. These agencies were like slapping a gauze pad onto a bleeding wound to keep the patient from bleeding to death. Right now, we're in a situation where the wound is still open. It's no longer bleeding, but you have to watch it constantly and try your best to heal it.
Q. You grew up in Milford. Would you still swim in Long Island Sound?
A. I've swum in Long Island Sound all my life, and, yes, I would do so now. However, people don't always do what's best for them.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL NOTEBOOK;
Pay Cut Is Now a Seldom-Used Tool

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Rich Gedman, the Boston catcher who has forgotten how to hit, suffered the maximum 20 percent pay cut this year, his salary plummeting from $1.15 million to $920,000. Life wasn't always so cruel to Gedman. In 1988, he batted .231 and drove in 39 runs and got a raise, from $980,000 to $1.15 million.
The raise was more representative of today's salary practices than the 20 percent cut. The maximum cut is a seldom used economic weapon. Salary cuts of any dimension have had little use in recent years.
The relative absence of pay cuts is a curious development at a time when owners complain about escalating salaries, mushrooming payrolls and salary arbitration for more players. Clubs, for a variety of reasons, have eschewed the paycut as though, like the spitball, it had been banned from baseball. 
This year, for example, 162 players filed for salary arbitration, and only seven emerged with lower salaries than they had in 1989. Three of those players, including Gedman, have bonus provisions that, if they play often enough, could produce higher incomes than they had last year. Only a handful of other players have taken cuts, including Andy McGaffigan, a Montreal relief pitcher, who like Gedman, signed for 20 percent less.
They are the exceptions, however. Clubs simply don't cut salaries anymore, thus losing a chance to make some dent in their payrolls.
''We will tender a cut if it's a player who had a bad year,'' said Woody Woodward, general manager of the Seattle Mariners, speaking of the initial contracts sent to players in December. ''But we all wind up giving them, at worst, what they made the year before.''
Fred Claire, the Los Angeles Dodgers' general manager, said there were ''very few cases where a club wants to cut a player; it's just not something you want to do.'' In addition, he said, ''the escalation has been so great that going the other way becomes something that is almost out of the question. Everything is moving up so fast, if you can hold the line, you think you're accomplishing something.''
Claire cut one salary this winter. Last year John Shelby earned $550,000, but he batted .183, hit one home run and drove in 12 runs in 345 times at bat. He signed for $500,000, a 9 percent reduction.
The California Angels gave Mike Witt a contract for $90,000 less than the $1.4 million he earned last year after he compiled a 9-15 record and a 4.54 earned run average.
Some general managers are reluctant to cut a player's salary because they think it isn't worth the possible negative reaction the player might have and take on the field with him.
''I would hope you're dealing with someone more mature than that,'' Danny O'Brien, the Angels' senior vice president, said. ''When a guy is on a downswing for a couple of years, most recognize they should have a reduction. Then the problem becomes how much. Some guys say, 'Yeah, I deserve a cut, but don't hurt me.' ''
Jim Frey, the Chicago Cubs' general manager, noted that players who were released and signed with other clubs often signed for smaller salaries, but that was not the same circumstance as a player remaining with a club and accepting less money.
''That is not very likely to happen today,'' Frey said. ''I guess to some extent we're intimidated by the whole set of circumstances today.''
He referred to the options available to a player - salary arbitration after three years, free agency after six.
''If a club doesn't offer a player enough,'' Frey said, ''he goes to arbitration, and it's not likely an arbitrator would give a player less money than he made the year before.''
In the 15-year history of salary arbitration, only nine players have emerged from hearings with pay cuts. Joe Hesketh of Montreal became the ninth last month. Aurelio Lopez was the only player with a cut until 1987, and Orel Hershiser and Alejandro Pena were the only players to have gone the distance with a 20 percent cut.
But not many clubs go into arbitration seeking salary slashes. This year 133 players submitted figures for arbitration (the others settled before reaching that point). In only five instances did their clubs file salary figures lower than their 1989 salaries. Certainly there had to be more than five players in that group who had poor seasons.
General managers say the arbitration system makes it difficult for clubs to press a case for a cut. For example, they explain, if a player has a poor season, he uses his career to argue his case for a raise.
Yet if the clubs would expend as much energy on reinventing the paycut for deserving players as they have on resisting arbitration for a relatively few more players, they might stumble onto a cost-saving device they seemingly never knew existed.
 
Umpires Will Be Paid
Even though the season almost certainly will be delayed because of the owners' lockout, one group crucial to the season will not have their paychecks delayed. Richie Phillips, the umpires' lawyer, said his clients would receive their salaries for at least the first 75 days of the season even if the lockout continues.
That is what the umpires' labor contract provides, Phillips said. He added that the umpires might be entitled to pay beyond that time. Their salaries will cost the leagues a total of more than $25,000 a day, Phillips said.
Umpires do not receive their salaries for working spring exhibition games, but they receive bonuses. The leagues, Phillips said, have refused to pay the bonuses, and he plans to file a grievance seeking that money.
''We have no dispute with the owners,'' the Philadelphia lawyer said. ''They have no dispute with us. They have locked out the players and basically they have locked out the umpires. This is the absurdity of what these people do.''
Phillips did not say how much the umpires earn for working exhibition games.
 
High-Powered Public Relations
The owners' effort at a public-relations bonanza last Thursday was not a rousing success.
When some of baseball's public-relations people suggested moving the second part of the two-pronged news conference from a crammed tiny conference room in the baseball offices to the much more spacious press room at the Helmsley Palace, Howard Rubenstein vetoed the idea. When Howard Rubenstein decided that Charles O'Connor and Bud Selig had answered enough questions, he terminated the news conference.
Rubenstein is the high-powered New York public-relations man (he represents the Donald half of the Trump news media blitz) whom the Player Relations Committee hired last year to advise them on dealing with the news media. He had been working quietly behind the scenes until the owners decided to try to end their lockout with a no-strike pledge from the players.
A gaffe that even Rubenstein couldn't prevent:
The letter that Commissioner Fay Vincent wrote to Selig, the P.R.C. chairman, and Donald Fehr, the union leader, addressing it to both, asking for their mutual efforts to get baseball going, was not delivered to Fehr until the next day. Selig not only had his copy of the letter on time, but he also had his statement accepting the commissioner's request prepared before Vincent announced his offer at the first part of the news conference. Furthermore, when Mark Belanger, a union official, called O'Connor about half an hour before Vincent's news conference, O'Connor acknowledged the news conference, but said, ''It is not about lifting the lockout.''
 
'Go Home and Rest'
The most curious aspect of the stalled negotiations is the relationship between Vincent and Fehr. It almost appears that they should be on the same side of the bargaining table, not on opposite sides. In truth, they probably have more in common than Vincent has with the owners.
On the day of the Rubenstein news conference, Fehr heard that the commissioner looked exhausted and wasn't feeling good. They spoke briefly by telephone, after which Vincent said, ''Donald told me to go home and rest.''
Fehr also went out of his way that day and the next to avoid criticizing Vincent for his action in asking the union for a no-strike pledge. If Bowie Kuhn or Peter Ueberroth had done that, Fehr would have reacted angrily.
But when he was asked if the commissioner's announcement surprised him, Fehr said most mildly, ''In the world in which you work for people, there are political realities.'' In other words, he was saying, blame the owners, not the commissioner.
The next day, Fehr was referring to the letter he belatedly received, signed by Vincent, and said, ''There's nothing in this form letter, although I doubt seriously that Fay wrote it.''
So why can't they settle the dispute? Fred Off the Record Despite mediocre performances, or worse, players see their salaries rise steadily. Here are two examples (the salaries listed are what the players received the year after registering the record on the same line):

HEADLINE: Groups Unite to Fight Airplane Noise

BYLINE: By BARBARA STURKEN

 BODY:
INCENSED by what they say is an intolerable level of jet noise over their homes, New Jersey residents in dozens of communities have banded together to draw the attention of politicians and government officials to the problem.
The New Jersey Coalition Against Aircraft Noise, organized in early January, is a collection of groups that sprang up to protest extensive rerouting of New York metropolitan region flights three years ago. The revised flight patterns inflicted jet noise for the first time upon areas 30 or 40 miles away from Newark International Airport. But despite a growing number of complaints, the roar of planes overhead continues, the group says.
The situation brings out deep-rooted suspicions held by many New Jerseyans that their state is taking more than its fair share of the New York region's ills. ''New Jersey - a dumping ground once again,'' is how the coalition describes the sentiment. Increased traffic at Kennedy International and La Guardia Airports contributed to the expansion of air lanes over their area, the coalition said. Its members also complain that governmental indifference to jet noise is part of a bigger problem: New Jersey's poor record on environmental issues. 
Kathleen Bergen, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration, said that the agency has already modified the routing plan and felt it had already taken effective steps to deal with the noise problem. But she said that an increase in air traffic at Newark meant it would be impossible to go back to the old routes that avoided the areas that were now complaining. ''The system could not absorb the number of departures now scheduled at Newark,'' she said. ''It would be like having a one-lane road instead of a three-lane highway. The flight delays would be tremendous.''
Tomorrow night the coalition is scheduled to meet in the Bernards Township Municipal Building to vent its frustrations before a panel that is expected to include Representatives James A. Courter, Republican of Hackettstown; Marge S. Roukema, Republican of Ridgewood, and Dean A. Gallo, Republican of Parsippany-Troy Hills, as well as representatives from the staffs of Senators Bill Bradley and Frank R. Lautenberg.
''Different politicians are telling us to speak with one voice,'' said Craig Cantoni, president of the noise coalition, explaining the decision to form one citizens' group to fight aircraft noise. The main goal is to win passage of Congressional legislation to roll back the flight plan; the group has also proposed imposing flight curfews, requiring that airlines use quieter jets and expanding the use by commercial aircraft of airspace over the ocean now reserved for the military. Mr. Cantoni estimates that the coalition has a membership of about 3,000. Mr. Cantoni's experience is typical of many of the members of the coalition. A 43-year-old executive of a privately held industrial company, Mr. Cantoni and his wife moved into their home in Basking Ridge more than two years ago and did extensive landscaping in the backyard.
Last summer, he said, he went outside one day and was startled by a sound ''similar to never-ending thunder'' - the incessant drone of aircraft in the skies. He said that as a result, he spent the summer indoors with the air-conditioner on. ''We moved out here to hear the birds,'' not to listen to the ''ugly, obscene noise'' of jet engines, he said. The decibel level of the jets, he says, is similar to that of a vacuum cleaner 10 feet away.
Mr. Cantoni acknowledges that he is a frequent flyer but denies that his travels make him part of the problem he is trying to combat. ''We are not against economic growth of Newark Airport,'' he said. Saying that other communities in the United States have succeeded in curbing jet noise, he said, ''We can work out some kind of mutually agreeable plan'' with the relevant government authorities as well as the airline industry.
 
Layering of Noise
Protests have escalated since early 1987, when the Federal Aviation Administration implemented the Expanded East Coast Plan for the New York metropolitan region's air traffic. The plan was designed to reduce flight delays at Newark, La Guardia and Kennedy Airports by shifting routes over northern and western New Jersey. Many of the complaints that resulted focus on the low altitude of the aircraft, which apparently is caused by a ''layering'' of flights that allows jets destined for New York to fly directly above Newark-bound aircraft, the antinoise coalition said.
More than 1,000 square miles of New Jersey are covered by airline routes, the coalition said. Complaints have come from the northern communities of Boonton and Allendale and from central New Jersey towns like Colts Neck as well. Hunterdon and Somerset Counties have been especially affected, residents say. Communities closer to Newark Airport, like Newark's Ironbound district, which has experienced jet noise for years, are also joining in the antinoise effort.
Some members of the coalition have contended that planes occasionally fly so low that it is possible to read the airline's name on the fuselage. Residents also say that they are awakened in the middle of the night by air cargo flights, which usually use older, noisier aircraft.
Al Sidar, a pilot during World War II and a resident of Basking Ridge, said he had spotted planes ''not too far above the 3,000-foot level.'' And he said he has been frequently awakened at 2 or 3 A.M.
 
Port Authority Criticized
''No one here is of the mind that we shouldn't have any air traffic at all,'' he said. ''But what we are getting now is just intolerable.'' Not all residents of communities under the air lanes are bothered by the noise. Tim Deady, who lives five miles from Newark Airport, in Hillside, said that even though the planes go right over his house, it ''doesn't bother me that much.''
''I don't quite understand how people can get so upset,'' he said. ''The dogs barking in the street bother me much more than the aircraft overhead.''
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the three airports and has also come under fire from antinoise activists, defends the plan. ''The F.A.A. has been trying in good faith over the last couple of years to make adjustments in the plan to offer relief to those communities that have been affected by the noise,'' said William Cahill, a spokesman for the Port Authority. ''Changes have been made to try to arrive at a plan that would basically please the greatest number of people who have to live under the air routes. I don't know if it is possible to please everyone in this regard.''
Some of the changes made by the F.A.A. have merely shifted the noise from one community to the next, critics contend. Mary Jane Semcer of Far Hills has already moved once to escape ''unbearable'' jet noise, she said, only to find it followed her to her new home.
Her family lived in Short Hills and had built a deck onto their home when the jet noise arrived in 1987. ''The noise was so bad we couldn't even open the windows,'' she said. ''There wasn't any relief. At 2 or 3 in the morning, we'd see cargo planes right overhead. Their lights even shone in the windows.''
Mrs. Semcer and her family then moved to Far Hills. A few months later the aviation agency juggled the routes again, and the Semcers heard the sounds of the jets they thought they had left behind.
 
Highway in the Sky
''The quality of life has been destroyed by this,'' she said. ''I've got three children who have all gone to college out of the state, and when they talk about where they want to raise their children, it isn't here. They want to go to areas where there is more sensitivity to environmental concerns.''
Others are concerned that the noise in the sky is ruining their property values. ''Like a 12-lane highway through the center of town, the air routes will eventually affect everybody by making New Jersey and your community less desirable places to live,'' the coalition said in a bulletin. ''The routes can only make a bad housing market worse and reinforce New Jersey's sad stereotype as an environmental wasteland.''
Shirley Gazsi of Cranford, also active in the antinoise effort, said a chief complaint was that there was no warning of the plane rerouting. ''They did not do an environmental impact study,'' she said. ''It's not the same as someone moving into an area knowing that there's going to be noise. If you live close to the airport, you expect to hear it - but not if you live 20 or 30 miles away.''
Despite the fact that protests grew only when planes started flying over affluent communities, the coalition says theirs is not an upper-class cause. ''We represent thousands of people,'' Ms. Gazsi said, many of them living close to the airport. Curfews and use of quieter aircraft or newer models would improve life for people experiencing noise even before 1987, she said. The coalition also contends that noise is not the only form of pollution caused by aircraft and that New Jersey's air quality is also suffering.
 
Tremendous Growth
For its part, the aviation agency says that it must balance environmental concerns with the need for expanded air traffic. ''We know these people are not comfortable with the level of noise they are hearing but we are taking steps to mitigate that,'' said Ms. Bergen, the agency spokeswoman. ''Air traffic has grown tremendously since 1978'' when the industry was deregulated, she said, adding the ''aviation is a dynamic industry.'' In addition, she said, the agency determined that an environmental impact study was not necessary because the East Coast plan was for ''high altitude'' operations.
In response to complaints about night flights, the agency has in some cases reverted to the pre-1987 flight patterns for operations between 11 P.M. and 7 A.M., she said. But Ms. Bergen said that it would be ''just impossible'' to roll back the new flight system during normal business hours, because of the growth in the region's air traffic.
Several antinoise measures are pending both at the state and Federal level. A bill sponsored by Assemblywoman Maureen Ogden, Republican of Millburn, would require use of quieter aircraft; the measure lost by four votes in the Assembly last year but will be on the agenda again this session.
In the Congress, bills have been introduced by Mrs. Roukema and Mr. Courter. The coalition is pressing Gov. Jim Florio to file a suit against the aviation agency and may even proceed with its own litigation against the agency and the Port Authority.
Mr. Cantoni said the group wants nothing less than the restoration of the ''former tranquillity'' of the affected communities. Yet some coalition members concede that might be a tall order. ''Your opposition is the Federal Government,'' said Richard Coates of Far Hills, a coalition member, who said he felt as if he lived under a ''highway in the sky.''
The issue is not likely to die down. Just recently, Representive Matthew J. Rinaldo went home to Union for a visit and found that he had become yet another victim of the noise that has bothered many of his constituents for years. ''He was awakened in the wee hours by low flying aircraft,'' said John Arnold, an aide to the Republican from Union. ''It turned out that one of the most recent adjustments the F.A.A. made means that the planes are now flying over the Congressman's home.''

HEADLINE: FORUM;
East European Workers Will Need Incentives

BYLINE: By LEE SMITH and LEWIS KADEN; Lee Smith was director of the Cuomo Commission on Competitiveness. Lewis Kaden is a partner in the law firm of Davis, Polk & Wardell.

 BODY:
Many people think that laissez-faire capitalism will be a workable model for the redevelopment of the socialist economies of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Western advisers have consistently pushed for the creation of markets, free pricing and currency systems and an economy built on private enterprises. But the rush to markets, and the willingness to create economic insecurity, clearly carries with it a substantial risk of political turmoil. 
A safer path for Eastern Europe would lead to mixed economies that combine entrepreneurial qualities and efficiency with concern for economic security and equity.
There is much America can do to nurture the development of more effective enterprises. Joint ventures would bring managerial skills to underdeveloped Eastern European companies. In addition, the United States should encourage employee ownership and participation in enterprises in Eastern Europe. America is the world's leader in the legal, financial and organizational techniques needed to provide workers with equity in the enterprises in which they work. When properly structured and operated, the company with employee ownership, especially when combined with employee participation, offers the incentives needed to create higher productivity, wages and profits; just what state-owned enterprises need to combat their inertia, low morale, low productivity and lack of research and development.
In practical terms, the first step on the road to an employee-driven economy is for the governments of these countries to sell off divisions of their huge state-owned enterprises to the people who work in them. The very size of these enterprises has been an impediment to efficiency. The governments could finance the acquisitions by taking a note against the future earnings of the enterprises. The state in its role as a creditor can encourage the employees to put as much of their earnings as possible back into the enterprise.
The United States and Western Europe can encourage this process by making loans available to enterprises willing to undergo this transformation. It would be a mistake to insist that loans only be available to traditionally structured private companies or joint ventures with Western companies.
A mixed economy with a large number of employee-owned enterprises has economic and political benefits. Workers with a right to share in the wealth of an enterprise and a voice in the company have incentives to create wealth and can internalize a sense of responsibility, individual and collective.
Individual responsibility is fundamental to economic efficiency. And a sense of collective responsibility is needed to bridge the gulf between the individual's interests and society's needs. Fostering both values is important because the political and economic success of these societies will depend on how well their politics and their economics balance the rights of the individual and needs of the nation.
The irony is that if America wants to see state socialism transformed into a system that has a key feature of capitalism - the market - it will have to advocate one of the key concepts of the theory of socialism - worker ownership of the means of production.

HEADLINE: FOCUS: California;
Market for Resale Houses Is Cooling Off

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN SHARP

DATELINE: SANTA BARBARA, CALIF.

 BODY:
LAST June, when California real estate prices were sizzling, John P. Forhan moved from a modest house into a larger, more attractive one about a mile away in a fashionable section of this city.
Mr. Forhan, a lawyer, and his wife, Carol, an accountant, paid $475,000 for the three-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bathroom house and put the old one on the market for $339,000 - the going price for properties in the lower section of the San Roque neighborhood. ''We thought the house would sell in a snap,'' said Mr. Forhan.
But at the end of summer, it was still on the market. The Forhans lowered the asking price 10 percent, to $305,000. In November, they lowered it again, to $297,000, and in December, they finally sold it at that price. 
''Things got very tense while we were paying two mortgages,'' said Mr. Forhan. ''It was tough.''
Like many coastal California homeowners, the Forhans got caught on the downside of the state's real estate cycle last year. After two years of price increases - in some cases as high as 30 percent a year -resales have cooled considerably.
But this cooling in no way signals a recession, according to California economists. ''It's a decline which is not dangerous and carries with it no expectations of a collapse,'' said Joseph Wahed, senior vice president and chief economist of Wells Fargo Bank.
Analysts outside the state have marked California as the next domino in the nation's tumbling real estate recession, following those in Texas, Arizona and New England, said Mr. Wahed.
James P. Antt Jr., president of the California Association of Realtors and a realtor in Bakersfield, said East Coast publications were predicting trouble for California - he cited an article in the Dec. 18, 1989, Barron's saying that in circumstances like California's ''panics can occur as home prices begin to falter.'' But ''we're not seeing what we are reading,'' he said, noting that the state's overheated market is just correcting itself by posting more moderate growth.
The median price of an existing home in California fell 7 percent in the last six months of 1989, to $188,000.
''The softening occurred in the move-up market, those houses priced at $250,000 to $400,000,'' said Andrew F. Kane, director of the real estate services group of Arthur Anderson, Western U.S., based in Los Angeles. ''People don't move into houses every year.''
The median resale price in 1989 was $196,521, a 17 percent increase over 1988. But although volume last June tumbled 24 percent, to an annual rate of 487,000 homes, in the whole year 538,770 homes went into contract, down only 4 percent from 1988, when a decade-high of 562,570 homes were sold.
''You just can't sustain double-digit price increases for long,'' said Leslie Appleton-Young, vice president of research and economics for the California Association of Realtors.
Several factors explain last year's slowdown. For one thing, workers' income growth has not kept pace with real estate appreciation. For example, in Santa Barbara, 120 miles northwest of Los Angeles, the median home price rose 19 percent, to $295,000, in 1988. At the same time, the average income grew only 2 percent, to $23,018, according to Mark Schniepp, economist at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
For the state, median home prices shot up 18 percent, to $168,556, while the average worker's income grew 6 percent, to $24,161, in 1988, the most recent year for which figures are available.
''The number of people who can afford a house is abysmal,'' said Mr. Schniepp.
ONLY 19 percent of California's households can afford a home. Assuming a 20-percent down payment on the $196,521 median-priced home, a California household needs at least $64,600 in annual income to qualify for a mortgage loan. A couple who qualify face monthly payments, including taxes and insurance, of $1,615. This is about 76 percent of the median income.
Nationally, 48 percent of households can afford to buy a median-priced home of $93,100. Assuming a 20-percent down payment, a household last year needed a minimum annual income of $30,600, less than half the amount needed by a Californian household, said Ms. Appleton-Young. Monthly payments totaled $765, again less than half the amount shouldered by Californians.
Because of the high cost of housing along the coast, many workers are buying homes inland. The most affordable region last year was Sacramento, where 39 percent of households could afford the median house price of $112,500. The least affordable region was the San Francisco Bay area, where only 11 percent of households could afford a median-priced home of $260,600.
That accounts for another factor cooling the increases of existing home sales: Many residents are moving farther from the ocean. ''The Central Valley markets have caught fire in recent months,'' said Mr. Wahed. The 600-mile-long valley accounts for 50 percent of the state's new construction permits, added Ms. Appleton-Young.
The migration inland is especially evident in the Riverside-San Bernardino area, where the median home sales price last year was $124,095. That is about half the price of a comparable home - priced at $245,262 - in Orange County, 15 miles away. As a result, many workers in Orange County commute a few hours every day to be able to own a home in the Riverside area.
''We're seeing a rebalancing in California's market to the interior,'' said Ms. Appleton-Young. The increased sales of lower-priced inland homes helps drag down the state's median.
Another factor cooling existing house-price increases is the condominium. As home prices continued to skyrocket out of reach for three-quarters of the state's households, condominiums became a popular second choice. In 1989, the median price of a condominium climbed 14 percent, to $139,299.
Deeper economic factors separate California's real estate market from troubled regions of the country, according to economists. For every person added to New England's population during the period 1984-88, two houses were built, Mr. Wahed said. The reverse was true in California. For every two people added to California's population, one house was added.
''The overbuilding in New England was the kiss of death,'' said Mr. Wahed.
THE biggest difference between New England and California is tied to population, according to Anthony Downs, senior fellow at the Brookings Institute. From 1980 to 1988, population gains in South California outstripped population gains of 21 states in the Northeast and Middle West combined. ''That puts a tremendous demand on housing in California,'' he said.
The demand will remain as long as the state's job market continues to post strong gains, as projected. Mr. Wahed projects that California will add 377,000 jobs in 1990, spread among industries as diverse as tourism, agribusiness, entertainment and international trade. That translates to 3 percent increase over 1989.
For 1990, Mr. Wahed projects median home prices will rise 7.5 percent; Ms. Appleton-Young forecasts a 9 percent increase, but an 11 percent drop in sales to 480,000 houses.
But for most California residents, the market slowdown is a moot point. ''I don't know anyone who can afford a house,'' said Lisa A. Baker, housing assistance supervisor for the County of Ventura, north of Los Angeles County. ''Everyone I know has terminal house-buying depression.''

Some Say Slip Is an Adjustment, Not a Downturn

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST;
For Gorbachev, an Uncertain Anniversary

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VILNIUS, Lithuania, March 11

 BODY:
Outside a polling place in Moscow last week, a voter framed the issue as a bitter joke: ''What is the difference between the Soviet Union and the United States?''
Answer: ''In the United States, Gorbachev would probably be elected President.''
The jibe was double-barreled. It took aim both at President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who today marks his fifth anniversary as Soviet leader, for failing to live up to his country's expectations, and at the West for worshiping too uncritically at the Gorbachev shrine.
 
A Danger of Not Keeping Up
For all his stature beyond his own borders, at home Mr. Gorbachev seems in danger of falling behind the major developments he set in motion: the surrender of the Communist monopoly, the remaking of the Soviet state, the disintegration of the empire, the fitful birth of a market. 
Critics, even among Mr. Gorbachev's devoted admirers, say that without another great leap of political imagination - something to bolster not his institutional power, but his popular authority - he stands little chance of leading his country through the coming period of sacrifice.
One such leap would be to step down as leader of the Communist Party, freeing himself from the obligation to clear his presidential decisions with the old men's club that runs the party.
Another would be to agree to submit to nationwide, multiparty elections, soon if not immediately.
Officials close to Mr. Gorbachev hint broadly that both of these are possible. But Mr. Gorbachev has not said so.
It is no longer news that Mr. Gorbachev's subjects grumble about the failed promises of his economic program, the rising prices and shrinking supplies. What is perhaps less understood is that the public is annoyed with Mr. Gorbachev for being too cautious in the cause of liberty, for failing to satisfy an appetite he himself stimulated.
Lionized abroad for liberating a totalitarian empire, he has never subjected himself to direct elections at home. Indeed, he is now preparing to accept a more powerful new executive presidency, again without giving the public a chance to pass judgment on his performance.
 
The Missing Element: Trust
Polls suggest that if Mr. Gorbachev did face a fair election, he would win by default - the public has not coalesced around an alternative leader - but his margin of support is declining fast, and with it his ability to motivate. Mr. Gorbachev has largely dispelled the fear that gripped his country, but he has not yet replaced it with trust.
Opinion surveys, election results, and man-in-the-street conversations all indicate that he has allowed an eclectic coalition of opposition forces to steal the slogans of reform.
''During the first stage of perestroika, it was rather reasonable for him to be in the middle of the road,'' said Sergei B. Stankevich, a street-smart young member of the loyal opposition in the Soviet Parliament.
''But now the potential of this middle-of-the-road policy is exhausted. Natural processes in politics, in the economy, are moving ahead much more quickly than Gorbachev, pursuing a middle-of-the-road policy, can react to them, and the society is developing much more quickly.''
To Westerners, the sense of disenchantment within the Soviet Union may be hard to fathom. These have been five years of breathtaking world change, with Mr. Gorbachev as catalyst.
If he did not exactly liberate Eastern Europe and singlehandedly end the cold war, he created the climate for the Europeans to liberate themselves by declining to prop up the tired old regimes and lending comfort to democratic alternatives.
Mr. Gorbachev's willingness to let one Communist tyrant after another fall without rattling a sword to defend them has made him the unlikely hero of dissidents throughout what used to be called the Soviet bloc. He did nothing to slow down democratization in Poland or in Hungary. Last fall, shortly after he met with Erich Honecker, the leader of East Germany was ousted, and this was soon followed by the opening of the Berlin wall and an accelerated exodus of East Germans to West Germany. The movement gave impetus to the drive toward German reunification, which Mr. Gorbachev has not opposed, although he has warned that it should be gradual. In Czechoslovakia, which Moscow invaded in 1968 to reinstall Communist orthodoxy, Mr. Gorbachev agreed to withdraw Soviet troops at the demand of the new, anti-Communist national leadership. Vaclav Havel, the dissident playwright turned president of Czechoslovakia, now tours the West appealing to capitalists to help keep Mr. Gorbachev in the Kremlin.
Mr. Gorbachev has acquiesced, so far, in the peaceful withdrawal of the Baltic republics - their creation of multiple political parties and private farming, their abandoning of Communism and their determination now to restore the independent statehood that existed between the two world wars.
The Soviet leader now faces the most serious test of his tolerance, as Lithuania's new, non-Communist parliament today declared its independence and called on Moscow to negotiate seriously the terms of disengagement.
Dissidents who were in prison when Mr. Gorbachev came to power are now in parliaments. The works they were jailed for writing or even possessing have been published in official magazines and newspapers.
Five million Soviet citizens now work in private ventures called cooperatives, and the Government has decreed an end to the state monopoly on industry and agriculture.
Political pluralism has become a reality, so far in the form of blocs and fractious alliances, but with a promise of full-fledged parties.
Perhaps most important, Mr. Gorbachev has begun the transfer of political power from the Communist Party to a law-based government, and from a fossilized center to more autonomous republics and local councils.
 
Amid Dazzling Tactics, Strategy Is Unclear
 Mr. Gorbachev has, through it all, been endlessly watchable. More surfer than swimmer, he rides the crest of events, barely keeping his balance by knowing when to lean forward, when to cut back, sometimes teetering precariously but never losing his sense of direction.
The Soviet leader's devotees have long maintained that he did indeed have a grand strategy, a sense of where the country was headed, but for tactical reasons - to keep the old guard off guard, to let the populace outgrow its conservative instincts - he could not be fully honest about his radical intentions.
The release of the colonies he could no longer afford or contain, the creation of a political and economic hybrid borrowing from both socialism and capitalism - those were in the master plan all along.
Short of a polygraph test, it is hard to be sure how much Mr. Gorbachev foresaw five years ago, and how much he learned along the way.
But unlike the new governments of Poland or Czechoslovakia, Mr. Gorbachev has never had a democratic mandate to do what he is doing.
The more the unfamiliar notion of democracy seeps into the public consciousness, and the more Soviet citizens follow events in Eastern Europe, the more irritated they seem that Mr. Gorbachev has limited their right to choose.
 
Can a Democracy Be Built by Decree?
 The issue is now focused on Mr. Gorbachev's proposal to create a new executive-style presidency with sweeping powers of decree and to diminish the authority of the parliament. Future presidents would be elected, but Mr. Gorbachev wants a five-year term given him by the 2,250 members of the Congress of People's Deputies, who are to converge on Moscow for a special session on Monday.
''I get hundreds of telegrams a day from citizens from all over the country, who are categorically against the election of the president at the congress,'' said Anatoly A. Sobchak, a popular lawyer-legislator from Leningrad. ''They say: 'You, the deputies, don't have any right to do this. We did not give you any such authorization when we voted for you. Only the people can elect the president.' ''
When they have been given a choice, the citizens have opted for candidates who distance themselves from Mr. Gorbachev and urge greater changes.
The big winner in local elections last Sunday was not Mr. Gorbachev, but a bloc of pro-democracy forces centered on the Interregional Deputies Group, the parliamentary opposition, which Mr. Gorbachev seems to view with suspicion bordering on hostility.
Members of the bloc understand Mr. Gorbachev's strategy of feinting right, then left, and ending up on his feet in the middle. But Mr. Gorbachev is now a centrist in a country with a shrinking center.
''The overwhelming majority of the leadership of the Interregional Group and most of the activists supporting it don't have any desire to remove Gorbachev from the first place on the political scene,'' said Vladimir O. Bokser, a strategist for the political bloc. ''We only want to move him over to the left.''
''But every move he makes seems designed to get more people fighting against him,'' Mr. Bokser continued. ''Maybe from the standpoint of high-level intrigues, everything he is doing makes sense, but the masses don't understand this.''
 
Unfamiliar Missteps In Public Relations
 Sometimes lately, Mr. Gorbachev's vaunted sense of timing and public relations have seemed to fail him.
On the night of the elections, he took up 12 minutes of the evening news with a rambling, disengaged interview at his polling place, repeating socialist homilies and dwelling on his longstanding devotion to the Communist Party even as party apparatchiks were being shunned by voters across the country. He seemed like a man out of touch. Even more stunning was his abrupt about-face on the issue of presidential power.
Paradoxically, the idea of an executive presidency was proposed last fall by opposition lawmakers, who argued this was the only way to free Mr. Gorbachev from the clutches of the Communist Party. Mr. Gorbachev passionately rejected it as contradicting his philosophy of decentralization.
Then last week, in a performance that seemed on television petulant and arrogant, he forced the proposal through the standing legislature in a rush, arguing that only a strong executive could cope with outbreaks of ethnic unrest and other crises.
Even those who favor a strong presidency were alarmed at the way Mr. Gorbachev lunged for it.
''I got really angry at the way he pushed through the law on the presidency,'' said Vasily S. Shakhnovsky, a young Moscow Communist who has been active in organizing a pro-democracy faction within the party. ''I just can't believe that a man for whom democracy is something inside him, something natural, could behave in such a way. I started having big doubts.''
Mr. Stankevich, who has won election both to the Soviet Parliament and to the Moscow City Council, contends that Mr. Gorbachev has allowed himself to be isolated by an inner circle of yes-men and misled by party and government apparatchiks who fear dramatic change.
''I see more and more signs that he is far from reality,'' Mr. Stankevich said. ''He is too slow to recognize reality.''
 
Does the West Really Understand?
 Perhaps Mr. Gorbachev is just waiting until the moment is right, until the public consensus is more clear, and then he will submit himself to a plebiscite or otherwise move to establish his public authority.
Or perhaps he has accepted the view of some around him that the country cannot, after all, move from totalitarian rule to democracy without a period of benign autocracy to force through unpopular changes.
What annoys the political newcomers trying to take Mr. Gorbachev up on his promise of democracy is how readily the West seems to accept that Mr. Gorbachev himself is the main thing.
Ilya I. Zaslavsky, a young member of the parliament who is one of the most popular political figures in Moscow, said it is condescending for Westerners to think of Mr. Gorbachev as a benign paterfamilias, and to dismiss his more radical critics as somehow destabilizing.
''When people are elected in non-democratic ways, and then play the democrats, as Gorbachev has done, then that's not democracy either,'' Mr. Zaslavsky said. ''It is just another form of the same old thing.''

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST;
PARLIAMENT IN LITHUANIA, 124-0, DECLARES NATION INDEPENDENT

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
VILNIUS, Lithuania, March 11 -Lithuania tonight proclaimed itself a sovereign state, legally free of the Soviet Union, and named the leaders of a non-Communist government to negotiate their future relations with Moscow.
The Lithuanian parliament voted 124 to 0, with 9 abstentions and absentees, to restore the independent statehood ended by Soviet annexation 50 years ago. The Lithuanian Communist Party, which won only a minority of seats in parliamentary elections last month, joined the non-Communist majority in the vote, and in an outburst of songs and embraces that followed.
''Expressing the will of the people, the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian Republic declares and solemnly proclaims the restoration of the exercise of sovereign powers of the Lithuanian state, which were annulled by an alien power in 1940,'' said a resolution passed late tonight. ''From now on, Lithuania is once again an independent state.'' 
 
Full Implications Unclear
It was not immediately clear what the full implications of the Lithuanian action were. According to Lithuanian leaders, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet President, has indicated a willingness to negotiate the conditions of independence. But there was no immediate reaction to the declaration of independence either from Mr. Gorbachev or the Soviet Government.
Tass, the Soviet press agency, issued a factual report of the Lithuanian action without comment. Reports on national television were similar. [The Bush Administration urged the Soviet Union to respect the Lithuanian move, but stopped short of an explicit statement of recognition of the newly declared government. Noting instead that the United States never recognized Soviet authority over the Baltic republics, officials urged nonviolence and said that only through talks with Moscow, not unilateral action, would Lithuanians achieve what they want. Page A11.] Hundreds of Lithuanians gathered outside the parliament building, singing national hymns and chanting independence slogans, as the legislators changed the name of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic to simply the Lithuanian Republic and ordered the hammer and sickle replaced by the old Lithuanian coat of arms.
At one point, people in the crowd outside used screwdrivers to pry the copper Soviet insignia from the front of the building, to a roar of approval.
But behind the united front, many legislators and ordinary citizens voiced deep worry about how Moscow would respond to this precedent-setting breach in the union. The most common fear was a wave of economic repraisals that could produce fuel shortages and unemployment, threatening the state with chaos.
Other legislators worried that such a dramatic act of defiance, especially on the eve of an important Soviet congressional gathering, would weaken President Gorbachev, who has so far generally acquiesced to Lithuania's drive for freedom.
Before approving the law completing the political break with Moscow, the parliament elected as Lithuania's new president Vytautas Landsbergis, a soft-spoken music professor who led the pro-independence movement called Sajudis from an eclectic band of dissidents to a legislative majority.
By a vote of 91 to 38, the Sajudis-dominated legislature elected Mr. Landsbergis over Algirdas Brazauskas, the Lithuanian Communist Party leader, whose personal popularity has soared since his party broke with the Soviet Communist Party in December, but not enough to overcome the Communists' association with decades of occupation.
 
New Leader Urges Calm
Mr. Landsbergis urged the 3.7 million citizens of the republic to be calm and united as they enter a period of tense negotiations aimed at persuading Moscow to treat them as a friendly neighbor. On Monday the parliament is to consider an appeal to Mr. Gorbachev asking for withdrawal of the more than 30,000 Soviet troops based in Lithuania and the speedy repatriation of Lithuanian men serving in the Soviet Army.
''We cannot ignore the interests of our neighbors, particularly our neighbors to the east,'' the new Lithuanian president said. ''But we will not be asking for permission to take this or that step.''
Mr. Brazauskas is an economist by training, and supporters said the Communist leader would be a more reassuring presence at the bargaining table where details of the disengagement are to be worked out. But Mr. Landsbergis represented a clean break with the 50-year period that Lithuanians regard as an armed occupation.
The neighboring Baltic republics, Latvia and Estonia, are also moving toward secession.
''It will be contagious for other republics,'' said Mr. Brazauskas, who voted for today's decision but had earlier argued for a more gradual separation. ''Perhaps some will follow our example. But a great state like the Soviet Union will not collapse easily.''
Although the Communists here voted for the declaration of independence, Mr. Brazauskas declined an offer to be vice president, and other party members said they were not interested in prominent positions in the new government.
 
Other Officials Named
Mr. Landsbergis appointed three deputies, one a Communist and two who have quit the party, and named as prime minister a market-oriented economist, Kazimiera Prunskiene, who has announced her plans to leave the party.
Ustas J. Paleckis, the Communist party ideology chief, said that the Communists were persuaded that Sajudis did not want to share power on a more equal basis and that some party officials had decided they would remain aloof from the government and let Sajudis take responsibility for the consequences.
In the corridors outside the parliamentary chamber, Mr. Brazauskas's Communists - about one third of the 133 legislators - and some non-Communists wondered aloud about the wisdom of moving so quickly to declare independence.
''Probably a third of the deputies think it is crazy to rush into this,'' said a local journalist sympathetic to Sajudis. ''But anyone who speaks against it is sure to be branded a traitor.''
No representatives of Moscow were evident in the hall.
 
Rights Advocate Applauds
Though there was no official reaction from the Kremlin, members of the parliamentary opposition in Moscow sent a message of congratulations, and Sergei Kovalyov, a human rights advocate and former political prisoner recently elected to the Russian republic's parliament, came here to applaud Lithuania's move.
''A lot of Russians will say, ''We liberated you from the Germans, we helped you industrialilze,' '' Mr. Kovalyov said in a brief address to the parliament. ''None of them will say that we deported half of the Lithuanian people to Siberia.''
In recent days Mr. Gorbachev and other Soviet officials served notice that Moscow would make billions of rubles in financial claims on Lithuania if it secedes, and challenged Lithuania's boundaries, including its right to the Baltic seaport of Klaipeda, also called Memel. Mr. Gorbachev has also repeatedly cited security risks for Moscow in the loss of the republic, and promised to defend the rights of the republic's non-Lithuanian minority, 20 percent of the population.
There have already been some signs of stepped-up pressure, including a freeze by the Soviet Government-controlled banks on the assets of Lithuanian savings banks, that have led leaders of the republic to speculate about a possible economic blockade.
 
What Moscow Could Do
Annual trade between Lithuania and other Soviet republics is estimated at $24 billion at the official rate of exchange, including almost all of Lithuania's subsidized oil supplies.
Another fear is that Moscow could shut down centrally run industrial enterprises, throwing half a million Russian blue-collar workers out of jobs and raising ethnic tensions.
''My fear is that if we do not understand the progressive forces in Moscow, we can bring them a lot of danger,'' Mr. Paleckis added. ''And it will be danger for us as well. If Mr. Gorbachev loses, our declaration of independence will make moral sense, but. . .''
Mr. Landsbergis replied that ''the people of Lithuania are not naive. Even after listening to frequent warnings about how difficult it was going to be, they voted all the same for the Sajudis platform. We consider that a kind of referendum.'' Mr. Landsbergis said he hoped for prompt recognition from foreign countries, including the United States, which has never formally acknowledged the annexation of the three Baltic republics but has been wary of undermining Mr. Gorbachev.
The vote was the climax of a campaign that began gathering momentum less than two years ago, with the creation of the Sajudis initiative group in June, 1988.
A year ago, the alliance proved its strength by capturing most of the republic's seats in a new Soviet Parliament.
Mr. Landsbergis and several other lawmakers said they would no longer participate as voting members of the Soviet Parliament, although they might come to Moscow as observers or as members of a bargaining team to work out the details of secession.

HEADLINE: Panama's New Leader Fasts To Dramatize Need for Aid

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PANAMA, March 11

 BODY:
Nearly three months after American forces invaded Panama, the Panamanian economy is in ruins and $1 billion in emergency aid remains stalled in the United States Congress. At the Metropolitan Cathedral here, President Guillermo Endara has devised an unusual but apt way to dramatize the plight of a country starved for money: he has gone on an indefinite hunger strike.
''It is an act of commiseration,'' he said. ''This is a fast to remind all Panamanians of good will that there is suffering in our country and that this suffering consumes flesh, bones and stomachs of beings as human as those of us gathered here.''
Mr. Endara, a rotund man whose normal weight runs well above 200 pounds, began his fast on Feb. 28, Ash Wednesday, in what he described as an expression of Lenten religious sentiment ''that has absolutely nothing to do with American aid.'' But he acknowledged that he probably would not have had to undertake his campaign at all if his friends in Washington had been quicker to help him reconstruct his country. 
 
A Gesture of Solidarity
The Panamanian economy, Mr. Endara said, is now in even worse condition than before the American invasion that overthrew Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega on Dec. 20. Unemployment is above 30 percent, many people are going hungry and businesses are in ruins.
Mr. Endara said he felt that only by relinquishing the air-conditioned quarters of the Presidential Palace and its ''excellent cuisine, a first-class cook, and all the food I want'' could he show ''solidarity with my fellow citizens who are suffering from malnutrition and poverty.''
''Something must be done for these people,'' he said. ''Unfortunately, I cannot do anything, because all the plans we have to help them require money that we don't have.''
''It's hard for the President, with all the comforts of the presidency, to go to the people and say 'I am suffering with you,' '' Mr. Endara continued. ''The people are going to say, 'That fat guy is full of it. It's nothing but talk.' ''
 
Life in a Rocking Chair
The President, whose reputation here is that of a good-natured bon vivant, said he does not intend to continue his fast through the entire 40 days of Lent, but would not say when he would begin eating again. His staff said that Mr. Endara is consuming only liquids, and though he appeared more pale and somewhat slimmer than normal, he is good spirits and lucid, even presiding over Cabinet meetings in the cathedral and at the Presidential Palace.
''When I see I can no longer continue with my Government chores and that I am debilitated, I will suspend my fast,'' he said.
Mr. Endara is spending most of his time in a rocking chair in a corner of the cathedral, a large electric fan at his side and a cot on which he sleeps at night just behind him. A few feet away, beneath a large statue of Mary cradling a crucified Jesus in her arms, aides answer telephones and try to conduct normal Government business.
The United States Ambassador, Deane R. Hinton, has gone to the cathedral to confer with Mr. Endara several times during the fast, as has Michael G. Kozak, a Panama expert in the State Department in Washington, and various other American officials and bankers. But there is also a steady stream of poor and humble Panamanians, who take up positions behind a red rope to watch Mr. Endara with hopes of catching his attention and perhaps asking a favor.
 
'We Are All Hungry'
''I am here because I sympathize with the President,'' said Elisa Lam, a peasant woman visiting the capital from the interior. ''I want Mr. Bush to let go of that money, because we are all hungry here and there is no work. If we get the money we've been promised, things can start moving again.''
Mr. Endara's hunger strke has been widely publicized throughout Latin America, where it is seen as an example of American abandonment of a faithful client. In nearby Nicaragua, the Sandinista Front is already predicting that President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro will be left in the lurch by a penny-pinching Bush Administration, Washington's promises of generous assistance notwithstanding.
''If the United States doesn't even have the political vision and pragmatism to understand that it is necessary to put some money into Panama in order to strengthen Panama, what can we other Latin Americans expect besides congratulations and messages?'' President Daniel Ortega Saavedra asked mockingly this week. ''With congratulations and messages, you cannot resolve the grave economic problems that affect our countries.''
Mr. Endara's Government originally requested $1.5 billion in American aid after evaluating the damage done by the invasion and two years of American efforts to strangle the Panamanian economy through sanctions. Late in January, the Bush Administration responded with a package of $1 billion in loans, grants, credits, investment guarantees and other aid, in Mr. Bush's words ''as instant a relief as we can hope for.''
 
Aid Package Stalled
But the package has run into problems in Congress. It recently approved the first $500 million installment, but it provided only $42 million in direct emergency aid money with the balance made up of loan guarantees, credits and other similar aid measures.
The second $500 million component remains stalled while the Bush Administration and lawmakers debate the size of the package, how the funds should be spent and where to cut the Federal budget to pay for the increased aid.
Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who heads the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, said the Panama package raised broader questions over how to expand foreign aid funds to newly emerging democracies when the United States is experiencing its own serious budget problems. The Administration, he said, is ''telling the Panamanians that the check is in the mail, but there's no balance in the checkbook and no checks.''
In response to such arguments, Mr. Endara said he remembered ''when economic sanctions were imposed during the Noriega dictatorship, numerous Congressmen, Senators and State Department officials came here.
''When we reminded them of the damage being done to the economy, all of them said: 'Don't worry. When Panama becomes a democracy, we will help reconstruct your economy.' '' Mr. Endara said. ''These promises must be kept.''
 
'It's Our Money'
Mr. Endara said he was particularly distressed that more than $200 million of Panamanian Government funds in Washington's hands had not yet been released to his Government. That money, including payments from the Panama Canal, was frozen by Washington in 1988 and 1989 as part of the sanctions imposed on the Noriega regime.
''Part of the money that is being held back in the United States is ours,'' he said sadly. ''It's not aid from the U.S. It's our money that was being held by the U.S. against Noriega. Now it's being held up by some sort of bureaucratic problem and hasn't got to us for reasons that are still unexplained.''
The Panamanian President, who went on a hunger strike last September as part of a civil disobedence campaign against the Noriega regime, also finds himself wondering if Capitol Hill's reluctance to authorize the aid package is related to Washington's desire to see his Government take a tougher stand against the laundering of drug money here.

HEADLINE: Four Oil >Spills Turn Spotlight On New York's Vital Straits

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD

 BODY:
Before four spills dumped hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil into the Arthur Kill and the connecting Kill Van Kull this year, the two waterways were hardly known outside maritime circles, even though they carry more traffic than the Panama Canal. But the 16-mile channel winding between northern New Jersy and Staten Island is an important contributor to the economic vitality of the Northeast.
The area's rich history of heavy industry goes back more than 100 years, most of which passed without concern for the surrounding flora and fauna.
The kills, as the Dutch settlers named them, became a convenient industrial dump, as well as sewer system for nearby communities. Today small, unpublicized oil spills occur regularly, and runoff from urban life also fouls the water.
Still, in the last 15 years this degraded environment has been making a comeback, most visibly heralded now by the return each spring of hundreds of graceful, long-legged wading birds. 
''It's an incredible phenomenon,'' said Dr. Katharine Parsons, director of the Harbor Herons Project, a study of wildlife habitat in the kills. But conservationists say the recovery could be stymied by the amount of oil that has spilled recently.
Until now, economics have prevailed. Nearly two billion gallons of oil products can be stored in the hundreds of tanks on the New Jersey side of the kills, and tankers, barges and container ships plying these waters carry the most shipping tonnage of any port in the nation.
Each day an average of 100 commercial vessels pass through the Kill Van Kull, which separates Bayonne from Staten Island. In a vivid demonstration of the strait's value, when it was reopened after 24,000 gallons of heating oil spilled on Feb. 28, 500 commercial and pleasure vessels passed through it in 48 hours, the Coast Guard said.
From the air or ground, the sprawling fields of oil tank farms and smoke-spewing, malodorous refineries are grim industrial eyesores. But their presence has established the area as the Northeast's distribution hub for gasoline and home heating oil.
Three-quarters of the 70 daily oil-related vessel movements in the Port of New York are through the kills.
Three of the other recent spills involved vessels loading in the waterway, including the explosion of a barge last week that dumped more than 100,000 gallons of oil into the Arthur Kill. In by far the largest incident, a faulty Exxon pipeline poured 567,000 gallons of oil into the Arthur Kill on Jan. 1.
An extraordinary collection of more than 200 businesses are assembled along the Arthur Kill and the Kill Van Kull, accounting for thousands of jobs in New Jersey and New York, although the numbers have been declining. The most visible presence is the oil and chemical complex, represented by many of the industry's major companies.
Some have been there for years: American Cyanimid, Du Pont, GAF and Exxon or their corporate forerunners all had operations in Linden, N.J., by 1920.
Besides the petrochemical complex, the Arthur Kill is home to two electric power plants, a sewage treatment plant on the New Jersey side and a power plant on the Staten Island shore.
 
Pollution by Landfill
Also, the world's largest landfill -now 150 feet high and rising - sits at Fresh Kills, S.I., along the Arthur Kill. Sixteen to 20 trash-laden barges make their way daily from New York City's four other boroughs down the Arthur Kill to the New York City landfill.
In use since the late 1940's - it was supposed to be temporary - the landfill is hardly a benign neighbor. It illegally discharges millions of gallons a day of toxic liquid, leached from the trash, into the Arthur Kill. New York City is making efforts to seal the fill.
The landfill and industry have occasionally been the source of interstate disputes. In the mid-1980's, Staten Island residents complained about the horrible smell that wafted through their neighborhoods. It surely must be New Jersey and all those factories, they asserted.
Perhaps not, according to a consultant's study paid for by the Chemical Industry Council of New Jersey. Much of the odor came from the Fresh Kills landfill, the study concluded, as well as a sewage treatment plant along the Arthur Kill on the New Jersey side.
The Arthur Kill and the Kill Van Kull have had chronic pollution problems since the petroleum industry settled in the area in the 1880's. Before then, local waters were a vibrant fishery. Oyster beds flourished in nearby Newark Bay and even provided seeding for beds in the much better-known oyster centers of New England and Chesapeake Bay, said Andrew Willner, a researcher with the American Littoral Society, an environmental group in Sandy Hook, N.J.
 
Rockefeller a Trailblazer
Among the earliest petroleum businesses to settle in the kills area was John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company. He persuaded Bayonne's City Council in 1880 to let Standard lay an oil pipeline through the streets. Five years later the company, Exxon's forerunner, opened a refinery in Bayonne.
In the late 1880's, spills from Newark Bay refineries reduced catches of fish and shellfish. What was left became unmarketable because the products tasted like kerosene.
People continued to fish and swim in the kills through World War II, despite the great growth in industry along their banks. As children, ''we used to go crabbing and fishing in that area,'' said George Hudak, the 55-year-old former Mayor of Linden.
''You know how you go down the shore and it smells like the ocean?'' said Robert Watkoskey, 57, who grew up in Bayonne and is district director of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union. ''That's the way it used to smell.'' Mr. Watkoskey said he and his father, who worked for Exxon, crabbed in Newark Bay in the 1940's.
 
Damaging Effects of War
The factories went all out during World War II, without much regard to the health of the Arthur Kill, Mr. Hudak said. At the war's end, he recalled, he went down to the kill for a swim in Linden's Tremley Point neighborhood and sank six or seven inches into oily residue at the shore.
''That's when we stopped swimming,'' said Mr. Hudak, a State Assemblyman.
In any case, local residents did not care much about the pollution because the companies provided good jobs, Mr. Hudak said.
The story is told in the area about the time in 1940 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt took his campaign for a third term through Perth Amboy. The economy was sluggish, and an upbeat city councilman introducing the President told the enthusiastic crowd of several thousand, ''If F.D.R. is re-elected, the skies over Perth Amboy will be black again.'' His audience is said to have cheered lustily.
 
Focus on Economic Gains
Polluting industry also did not make much of an impact on Bertha Matuska, a 97-year-old resident of Linden who went there at the age of 14 from Czechoslovakia. Mrs. Matuska said she ran a Tremley Point restaurant that catered to workers from plants like the American Cyanimid operation.
Joseph Kuban has lived all of his 34 years in Linden within view, and scent, of the Exxon Bayway plant. ''What do you want me to say?'' Mr. Kuban asked with a shrug. ''When you live here, you don't really notice that stuff.'' His father worked at a nearby Cities Service operation.
Few paid much attention to the ecological condition of the kills until the late 1960's. In a study by the Federal Government in 1967, cages containing blue crabs, clams and minnow-like killifish were lowered into the Arthur Kill. Several days later the cages were withdrawn and the fish were dead, said Dr. Parsons, of the Harbor Herons Project.
A major culprit was the raw sewage that had been dumped into the kill through the years and had robbed the water of oxygen. But laws like the Clean Water Act of 1972 required municipalities to clean up such discharges. Environmentalists credit curtailed sewage dumping with the revival of wildlife in the Arthur Kill.
 
Return of Water Birds
As food sources were restored, wading birds found a new home. In 1974, birders discovered nesting by snowy and cattle egrets and black-crowned night herons on Shooters Island in Kill Van Kull. In 1978, egrets were found on Pralls Island in Arthur Kill.
''Nowhere does such important wildlife exist in such immediate juxtaposition with a highly industrialized urban area,'' said Dr. Donald McCrimmon, former president of the Colonial Waterbird Society, in a report on the value of the kills as a wildlife habitat.
The report, to be released today by the Trust for Public Land and the New York City Audubon Society, proposes wetlands preservation measures on Staten Island to protect animal habitat. It suggests that the intensity of industry along the kills has helped keep people away from remaining wetlands and has led to an ecological revival.
''Just because we label something industrial, that doesn't mean we should just write it off,'' said Dr. Royal Nadeau, a member of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency's environmental response team based in Edison, N.J.
But one environmentalist, Gary Ott, a science support coordinator from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, could not help but notice the impact of years of chronic pollution on Pralls Island.
So many oil products have found their way into the water that Mr. Ott calls the goo surrounding the island ''Pralls Boulevard.''

HEADLINE: Two Years Temper Hopes in Baltimore

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, March 7

 BODY:
A little more than two years ago, when Kurt L. Schmoke took over as Mayor of Baltimore, expectations soared that he would get this troubled old port city moving in a new direction. Time has tempered those hopes. An athletic Rhodes scholar who had managed to become the first black elected to the job, Mr. Schmoke took office with a splash of national publicity. Soft-spoken, introspective, even a little shy, he had a far different agenda from that of his blunt-spoken, relentlessly political predecessor, William Donald Schaefer.
He talked of rejuvenating Baltimore's spreading slums and of educating the poor youngsters living in them. He wanted Baltimore to be known as ''the city that reads,'' not as the city of glittering waterfront hotels and packed restaurants serving tasty crab cakes. 
Mr. Schmoke is still a politician to be watched. But getting Baltimore moving in a new direction, away from business district development toward solutions to serious problems of poverty, education and public health, has proved to be much more difficult than he initially calculated, though he says momentum is shifting toward him.
 
Creating His Own Roadblocks
''It's been tough, a learning experience,'' he replied when asked to assess the first half of his four-year term. ''But the good days have begun to outnumber the bad days.
''I'm in office at a time when Baltimore has some very difficult problems to solve,'' he added. ''I'm confident we can do it.''
While the major barrier is money, many of Mr. Schmoke's detractors, as well as some supporters, say he has created roadblocks of his own.
They credit him with pushing much-needed initiatives in education and housing. But in their judgment he has also been guilty of ill-considered personnel changes, foot-dragging, tangled lines of communication and political naivete, including one instance in which he was widely criticized for suggesting that some drugs be legalized because the nation's drug epidemic was more a health problem than a crime problem.
''The Mayor and everybody else knows by now what the city's problems are,'' said Michael C. Middleton, executive vice president of MNC Financial Inc., a major bank here. ''So it's time the Mayor sat down and stopped just studying things and scattering projects around. He needs to really lay out a game plan, make decisions and get things moving. People are more than willing to work with him.''
For all that was achieved during the 15-year tenure of Mr. Schaefer, who gave up the mayor's job to make a successful run for Governor, Mr. Schmoke inherited a city with some daunting unfinished business. There is much more, or less, to Baltimore than its bustling downtown business district and waterfront, nationally acclaimed examples of urban rejuvenation.
 
City's Greatest Cheerleader
As Mayor, Mr. Schaefer was perhaps the greatest cheerleader the city ever had. He achieved national stature by endlessly coming up with ways to promote his town. He was a tough political act to follow, especially for a self-effacing politician like Mr. Schmoke, whose instincts are to make common cause with the downtrodden, particularly the blacks who now account for more than half the city's 780,000 residents, and to study a problem at length before taking action.
Though Mr. Schaefer now lives in Annapolis, he obviously left his heart in Baltimore. Several times when Mr. Schmoke has seemed to him to be reacting too slowly, as when a musicians' strike dragged on, the Governor has shown up to push a solution.
Mr. Schmoke is not easily given to such aggressive politicking. But he has made high-profile appearances at major fires and pointedly toured a school supply office when a textbook shortage became a major issue. He has also streamlined his staff to speed the flow of ideas and has begun to publicly chastise city officials, including his own appointees, for shortcomings.
The Mayor is especially concerned about the city's schools because the illiteracy and dropout rates are among the highest in the country. Some employers are having trouble finding qualified workers and have joined Mr. Schmoke in a drive to fashion corrective programs, some of them offering job and college incentives to students who graduate.
Other city statistics and municipal failings also deeply concern the Mayor.
The rate of illegitimate births is one of the nation's highest, and the city's AIDS epidemic is one of the worst.
 
Block After Block of Slums
Within walking distance of the Baltimore's waterfront restaurants and boutiques are block after block of slums, with the number of abandoned houses and apartments steadily outstripping rehabilitation efforts in most places.
Property taxes, a main source of city revenue, are among the highest in the state and have driven many middle-class families to the suburbs.
The port, once the city's main reason for existence, is plagued by labor trouble and competition from other ports, particularly Hampton Roads, Va., at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay.
As things now stand, the city will not have enough money this year to maintain basic services, like fire and police protection, let alone start new programs to solve old problems. A shortage of about $50 million, out of a budget of $1.6 billion, is anticipated.
City law requires that the budget be balanced, so city officials are pressing the Maryland Legislature for aid and are preparing to lay off as many as 1,000 of the city's 29,000 employees to save still more money.
 
Feeling Effects of Reagan Era
''Some people are going to have to go,'' said Mary Pat Clarke, the President of the City Council. ''The transition from the Schaefer years to the Schmoke years has been difficult, just in terms of style, but it has been doubly difficult because the effect of the Reagan years has been to drastically cut Federal aid to cities.''
Delegate Charles Ryan, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee in the State House of Representatives, said Mr. Schmoke's standing in Annapolis is good enough to win the city ''maybe $20 million'' to help close the $50 million spending gap.
''He's been very effective during his visits with us,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''We are sympathetic. We're going to try to take over some city expenditures that are really expenditures for the whole state, such as money for the zoo and for some law-enforcement functions.''
Mr. Schmoke takes heart from such news. He called it proof that Baltimore is moving forward, that new headings are being set, that the city and its Mayor are solving their problems.

Nations Widen Role of Bank for East-Bloc Aid

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, March 11

 BODY:
A dispute over the role of a new international development bank to help Eastern Europe has been resolved with a decision that the bank will provide loans not only to the private sector, but also to public-sector projects like road building, European officials said today.
Jacques Attali, the French official who headed a meeting this weekend of 39 nations to lay the groundwork for the bank, said a consensus had developed on the issue, despite the reluctance at first of the United States and Britain to allow loans to public-sector projects in Eastern Europe.
Mr. Attali, a senior adviser to President Francois Mitterrand of France, said the group had also agreed that the capital of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development should amount to about $12 billion. 
Officials at the two-day meeting said this would make the bank the most important international financial institution to be set up since the World Bank and International Monetary Fund were established after World War II.
 
Roads and Communications
The bank aims to help revive the economies of Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany and other Eastern European nations.
Many Eastern European officials had argued that public-sector investment was needed in areas like roads and telecommunications to help the private sector grow. Under one proposal, a maximum of 40 percent of the bank's loans could go toward public-sector infrastructure.
Asserting that major progress had been made at the meeting, Mr. Attali said he hoped that the documents to establish the bank could be signed at a meeting on April 9 in Paris. He expressed confidence that the bank could begin lending money late this year or early next year.
Officials at the meeting said a consensus was forming that the Soviet Union should not only be allowed to be a member of the new bank, but should also be able to receive loans. American officials had originally opposed loans to the Soviet Union on the ground that Moscow has not moved as far toward democracy as many other Eastern European nations. #6 Percent From Moscow They also argued that the bank would be unable to meet the Soviet Union's considerable financial needs and grant enough money to Eastern European nations as well.
One official said there was tentative agreement that the Soviet Union would contribute 6 percent of the bank's capital and be limited to receiving 6 percent of the loans.
For Soviet officials, membership in the bank is important because it would give them a role in an institution that is expected to play a wide role in shaping the future of Eastern Europe.
Mr. Attali said it was also agreed that 51 percent of the bank's capital would come from the 12 nations of the European Community, from the community itself and from the European Investment Bank, a community development bank.
Still subject to debate, Mr. Attali said, are the exact shares contributed by the other nations participating and by two community institutions. Nor has it been decided who should sit on the bank's board of directors, he added.
The bank's members will include the United States, Canada, Japan and most European nations. Liechtenstein, South Korea, Israel, Egypt and Morocco all sent representatives to the meeting and plan eventually to join.
The two announced candidates to head the bank are Mr. Attali and Onno Ruding, a former Dutch Finance Minister. After first supporting Strasbourg, France, as a potential headquarters for the bank, French officials proposed this weekend that it be based in Paris.
Officials said other cities on the list includedLondon, Prague and Budapest.

Romanians' Lives Quickly Improve

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUCHAREST, Romania, March 11

 BODY:
There was a birthday party here last week for Dana Madolciu, who turned 34, and in a number of ways it illustrated the remarkable changes that have taken place in Romanian households since the overthrow of President Nicolae Ceausescu in December.
There were 100-watt bulbs in the chandelier instead of the 40-watt bulbs demanded by the Communist dictator in his last years and enforced by street patrols. There were the plates piled high with pork schnitzels, fried fish, pate, olives, cheese and three kinds of chocolate cake - all of which were either in short supply or unavailable in the shops of Bucharest only three months ago.
Cristian Madolciu, Dana's husband, said food stores for the most part get daily deliveries in the afternoon now, when most of the 10 million employed Romanians are at their workplaces. They are quickly sold out. ''We still have queues, but then most of them are our older relatives buying for us while we are working,'' Mr. Madolciu said. 
 
Food Donated From Abroad
Much of the food now on the store shelves is from foreign donations sent here after the Ceausescu regime was toppled. The cheese on the Madolciu table, for instance, came from the Netherlands in a box stamped, ''Best Eaten Before February 1990.''
Gaiety marked the evening after the 11 guests sang ''La Multi Ani,'' the Romanian version of ''Happy Birthday,'' to Mrs. Madolciu, a slender woman smartly turned out in an acid-washed miniskirt.
Her two daughters, joined by two young cousins, engaged in mock combat over who would get precedence to blow out the single birthday candle on the first cake after it had been re-lit for them. The children then presented their own idea of a lambada for their mother to the accompaniment of a tin drum and a tambourine.
The television set was on the whole evening, and there was elation around 10:30 P.M. when it showed the Romanian national handball team eking out a one-goal victory over the world champion team from Sweden.
During the Ceausescu reign, Romanians were subjected nightly to an hour or more of the daily doings of the dictator and his wife, Elena, followed at best by a Czechoslovak detective series.
No sports events were shown even when it was certain that Romanian athletes would be the winners. The sole exception was the Los Angeles Olympic Games, where Romania was the only Soviet bloc participant, which suited the Ceausescu foreign policy.
 
Crime Also Increases
Other signs of liberty in the Romanian capital today include an increase in crime, strikes and forms of free enterprise.
While the Ceausescu regime did not publicize crime statistics, Jean Moldoveanu, the Deputy Minister of Interior, said in an interview this week in the newspaper Dimineata that there had definitely been an increase in crime since the revolution.
He said there were 311 assaults in January and 380 in February across the country. Over those two months, there were 128 murders, 74 attempted murders and 28 cases of manslaughter, he said. Many of these cases were attributable to ''excessive consumption of alcohol,'' he added.
Although not as omnipresent as during the dictatorship, blue-uniformed policemen, formerly called militiamen, are still a visible presence in the streets of Bucharest.
This did not prevent a thug from robbing a French television cameraman one night recently in front of the Intercontinental Hotel and then beating him so severely that he had to be flown to Paris for medical treatment.
 
Strike in Subway System
On the strike front, employees stopped the capital's new subway system, one of the few giant projects of the Ceausescu era that has popular approval, for several days last week to underscore their demands for higher pay and better conditions. The strike caused Bucharest's first traffic jams on thoroughfares in recent memory.
Above ground on Nicolae Balcescu Boulevard, two shepherds from the mountains of Transylvania maintained a hunger strike through the weekend, saying they wanted the new Government to give them the 315 sheep, 30 goats and 3 donkeys that they said had been taken from them by ''the dictator's regime'' last November.
Waving his crook, one of the shepherds, clad in the shaggy sheepskin cloak and pink lambswool hat of his trade, told passers-by: ''The law is for all. We want our flock back!''
 
'Exclusive Sensation' Offered
A new twist in Romanian free enterprise occurred on Wednesday, when an official of a state enterprise called an acquaintance who works for a foreign newspaper at 8 A.M. and offered him ''an exclusive sensation - the last sculpture of Ceausescu.''
Meeting four hours later, the official produced photographs and a video cassette of a huge-looking modernistic victory monument, at the base of which was a tall frieze plainly depicting Mr. Ceausescu and his wife. The official said the work was 42 meters tall and added, ''We made it.'' The sculpture is on a list for demolition.
Asked where it was situated, he said: ''That is a secret, but it is standing within 200 kilometers of Bucharest. It was a gift from Ceausescu to his son Nicu.'' Nicu Ceausescu, the former Communist Party chief in Sidiu County, is in prison awaiting a military trial.
The official asked, ''How much will you offer me for the photograph and cassette?''
His face fell when he was told to seek out an illustrated magazine or a television company.

U.S. Advises Moscow To 'Respect' Lithuania

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11

 BODY:
The Bush Administration urged the Soviet Union today to respect the decision of the Lithuanian parliament to restore its sovereignty, but stopped short of an explicit statement of recognition of the newly declared government.
Noting instead that the United States had never recognized Soviet authority over Lithuania or the two other Baltic republics, officials urged nonviolence and said that only through negotiations with Moscow, not through unilateral action, would Lithuanians achieve what they want.
''The United States would urge the Soviet Government to respect the will of the citizens of Lithuania,'' the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said in a statement.
He added: ''We have consistently supported the Baltic people's inalienable right to peaceful self-determination. We call upon the Soviet Government to address its concerns and interests through immediate constructive negotiations with the government of Lithuania. We hope that all parties will continue to avoid any initiation or encouragement of violence.'' 
 
Avoiding Trouble for Gorbachev
Explaining the Administration's position, a senior official said it grows partly from the view that only through talks will the Lithuanians truly achieve their aims, and partly from the view that there is no reason to make matters worse for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev with defiant statements of support for the Baltics when the Soviet leader appears to be moving in the direction of setting them free anyway.
''Gorbachev has to accept the principle that the Baltic states are going to become independent and the Balts have to accept a process through which this independence can be peacefully and gradually negotiated,'' said an Administration official. ''This is not an issue we intend to take the lead on. We will only get involved if invited by both sides.''
The staff at the Lithuanian legation in Washington, sustained for years by Lithuanian gold reserves hidden in the United States, greeted today's news with unexpectedly mixed emotions.
To be sure, there was the triumphant clink of champagne glasses. But beneath the heady jubilation there was an undercurrent of sobriety - natural for a people who know Soviet power well enough not to celebrate as though today's vote were the end of the story.
 
'We Went Through a Desert'
''We went through a desert for so many years, no one ever believed in us, and now we have reached the oasis,'' said Stasys Lozoraitis Jr., the charge d'affaires who has been representing a government that existed only in his peoples' memory for 50 years.
The United States first recognized an independent Republic of Lithuania in 1922 and never stopped recognizing it, despite the Soviet occupation in 1940.
Being a diplomat without a country is neither easy nor much fun, as evidenced by the dented Oldsmobile Omega that serves as Mr. Lozoraitis's official car. It was no surprise to hear him exude, ''I am happy, very happy.''
He was also quick to add: ''But the story is not over. You see, I am a European. I know the Communists well. I know that the situation has changed radically - but, but, but. There are still many buts. Gorbachev could be replaced tomorrow. The Soviet economy is in horrible shape. We will have to negotiate with some very serious people in Moscow. We still don't control the banks, the police, the railway system. We don't even control the electricity yet. We will see now how the big brother reacts.''
 
Saving the Best Champagne
In some ways those mixed emotions seemed to be displayed in the repast the legation laid out for today's reception: a single bottle of California Winemaster champagne, nestled between jugs of diet soda and surrounded by a few cookies, cakes and miniature yellow, green and red Lithuanian flags. Celebratory, but not too celebratory. The best champagne will wait. Mr. Lozoraitis said today's statement by the White House met with his legation's approval for the moment. He said that ''as soon as the Soviets hear the Americans declaring their support for our independence they will realize that if they try to stop it they will be going against the United States.''
That the White House statement did not include overt recognition of the new government was also calculated, explained Lithuanian diplomats; they said their countrymen want to make sure that the new government is allowed by Moscow to take over the reins of power before they aggressively seek world recognition.
Asked whether the United States would establish diplomatic ties with Lithuania, the State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said: ''We recognized the independent state of Lithuania in 1922, and United States practice has been to establish formal relations with the lawful government of any state - once that government is in effective control of its territory and capable of entering into, and fulfilling, international obligations. When we are satisfied that the Lithuanian government can meet these requirements, we will establish formal diplomatic relations.''

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST;
Gorbachev Seeks Party Overhaul but Not Open Election of Congress

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 11

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today proposed a basic overhaul of the troubled Communist Party, but stopped short of demanding competitive secret-ballot participation by all 19 million Communists in the election of the 5,000 delegates to the approaching party congress.
Party insurgents seeking emergency doses of democratization had been urging direct competitive elections of congress delegates as their best chance for rapidly opening the party up to pluralism and stave off the collapse Communism has suffered in Eastern Europe.
Mr. Gorbachev, however, beginning a difficult week in his strategy to de-emphasize the party's position and seek a greatly enhanced role as national President, proposed a crucial compromise that would let local party organizations decide the precise details of electing delegates to the convention, which is due to open in July and debate retreating from the party's traditional monopoly of national power.
The Soviet leader made his proposals at a closed meeting of the party's Central Committee. A tightly limited account of the meeting was offered by Tass, the official press agency. 
At the meeting, Mr. Gorbachev urged that democratization be used to make ''the focus of party life'' the individual party members, who have in the past been treated as passive followers in the affairs of the traditionally oligarchic party.
 
Sweeping Changes Uncertain
But it was far from clear that his long list of proposals offered in the name of decentralizing and democratizing the party machinery would effect sweeping changes in the party congress, whose meeting would begin July 2 under Mr. Gorbachev's plan.
The proposals to overhaul the party that he did offer included several that were expected, including ending the General Secretary's role and installing more of a shared-authority party system relying on a chairman assisted by deputies. He also proposed a two-term limit on party official posts, and a sharing of the central party members' dues with local party groups.
These and other measures appeared secondary to the proposal that local party organizations retain control over the selection of party congress delegates, although in some otherwise unspecified ''elective'' process. This is a move likely to invite less, not more democratization as entrenched machines protect their patronage from insurgents' challenge.
The next step in Mr. Gorbachev's double-edged move to switch his executive focus from party to Government will begin on Monday, when the party hierarchy he addressed today goes into recess and the nation's elected Parliament takes center stage to consider Mr. Gorbachev's proposal for a more powerful governmental presidency who eventually would be popularly elected.
With considerable prodding from the Soviet leader, this ''super presidency'' proposal already has been approved by the Supreme Soviet, Parliament's standing chamber. The other chamber, the Congress of People's Deputies, will take up the issue Monday, with 1,500 of the 2,250 votes needed for approval.
 
First Elected by Congress
Under the Gorbachev proposal, the first five-year term of the strengthened presidency would initially be filled not by popular election but by a vote among the congressional deputies. Critics in the Congress's nascent minority opposition already have denounced this provision, saying it weakens the idea of popular democracy, even though many of them concede that Mr. Gorbachev is now the only figure with the standing to take up emergency powers to deal with the deepening economic and political crises.
Critics have been complaining as well that the rush to institute such a powerful post would be accomplished without benefit of the constitutional changes promised by Mr. Gorbachev as a basic part of his program for national renewal. Opponents fear the Gorbachev proposal will permanently weaken the legislature's fledgling role in national affairs and end all chances of an effective system of checks and balances.
The presidency bill would increase Mr. Gorbachev's present powers to rule by decree under a cabinet system. He would also have veto power over parliamentary actions, subject to the Supreme Soviet's overrule by two-thirds of its members. Even then, Mr. Gorbachev could appeal the overrule directly to the people's deputies.
There was some expectation that the closed meeting today of the 250-member party hierarchy, the Central Committee, might be the first to annoint the formality of Mr. Gorbachev's candidacy for the superpresidency. But no mention of this was made in the Tass report.
 
Two Separate Spheres
In effect, Mr. Gorbachev is acting this week in two ever more separate spheres, easing the party from its position of dominance while using his control of the Congress to create the larger presidency he would use to execute national changes without the usual repeated need for persuading and cajoling a panel of party doubters.
The decision to give local party machines the crucial say in how to elect the party congress delegates underlined once again Mr. Gorbachev's centrist predilection for displaying compromise and gradualism in easing the party from its dominance even as events rush the process forward at an ever-increasing rate.
Politically, through five years of popular strategems and hierarchy prunings, the Soviet leader already has assumed many of the party's prerogatives himself or begun sharing them with the legislature. But the vast patronage machinery that controls government and business institutions across the nation has remained largely inert in the face of his demands for change, and this is one of the targets of his dual political and governmental activity this week.

HEADLINE: Elected President Replaces Pinochet

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VALPARAISO, Chile, March 11

 BODY:
The long and often bitter era of military rule came to an end in Chile today with the installation of Patricio Aylwin, a genial Christian Democrat and longtime political figure, as the elected successor to Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
Hours later, returning in triumph to Santiago, the capital, after his inauguration in the unfinished new Congress building in this Pacific port city, President Aylwin promised to do everything possible to establish the truth about the repression of the Pinochet period.
Declaring that Chile ''doesn't want violence or war, it wants peace,'' he said he would ''build the country we dream of.''
The passions and controversies that surrounded General Pinochet throughout his 16 1/2 years in power followed him into the plenary hall of the Congress for the ceremony. 
A small group of people threw tomatoes and other objects at the general when he approached the Congress in a black limousine convertible, but nothing appeared to have hit him.
Chants of ''Pin-o-chet, Pin-o-chet!'' and ''A-se-si-no, a-se-si-no!'' - meaning ''Assassin!'' - came from his supporters and opponents as he climbed the steps to the soaring portico looking out toward the Pacific Ocean. The same competing chants resounded inside the hall. Mr. Aylwin and General Pinochet stood side by side as Sen. Gabriel Valdes, elected president of the new Senate earlier in the day, swore in Mr. Aylwin in a brief ceremony without speeches.
 
A Broad Coalition
Mr. Aylwin embraced Mr. Valdes, a fellow Christian Democrat, and shook hands with General Pinochet, who then left the hall with his wife and ministers, stopping along the way to shake hands with Mrs. Aylwin.
Mr. Aylwin swore in a 20-man Cabinet that reflected the broad coalition from center to left that brought him to power, then departed in a 1962 black Ford convertible that had been used by Eduardo Frei, the only previous Christian Democratic President of Chile.
Back in Santiago, 75 miles southeast of here, tens of thousands of people lined the city's main thoroughfare, the Alameda Bernardo O'Higgins, as Mr. Aylwin arrived at La Moneda, the presidential palace. Half-destroyed by bombing in the Sept. 11, 1973, coup against President Salvador Allende Gossens, it has since been restored and refurbished. Even though the new legislative complex is being built in Valparaiso, the executive branch will remain in Santiago.
General Pinochet, who called free elections after losing a plebiscite to extend his rule by eight years, urged Chileans in a television address on Saturday night to ''unite in one fraternal embrace'' and show a ''responsible attitude'' toward their new leader.
 
A Short Guest List
The international isolation that the Pinochet Government faced manifested itself to the end, with only three foreign Presidents - those of Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil - arriving while General Pinochet was still in power and, therefore, in time to take part in the formal inauguration.
Eight other national leaders, including Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain and President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua, deliberately planned their arrivals for a few hours after the new Government had taken power. They were invited to take part in celebrations in honor of President Aylwin tonight, and some will remain for events on Monday and Tuesday.
Vice President Dan Quayle, leading a delegation that included Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, arrived late Saturday and paid a courtesy call on General Pinochet this morning before the inauguration. General Pinochet had said that no delegation leader could attend the inauguration without first presenting credentials to him.
Several hundred supporters of General Pinochet were massed outside his residence, and as Mr. Quayle's caravan pulled away they beat and kicked the Vice President's bulletproof Cadillac and other vehicles. Mr. Quayle said he had told General Pinochet that if the transfer of power went peacefully, ''the 1990's will write the history of President Pinochet as much as the years in the past.''
 
Keeping Command
Even though he has given up the Presidency, the 74-year-old general is allowed by the Constitution to continue as army commander, a fact that has led to concerns among many people that he will try to function as a parallel power.
But Mr. Aylwin has said he can work with General Pinochet as long as the general stays within his constitutional role, which means he is not supposed to interfere in politics. Mr. Aylwin, a 71-year-old lawyer and former senator who supported the 1973 coup, has harmonious relations with leaders of the air force, the navy and national police.
The main reason General Pinochet has given for holding onto his army command in the face of Mr. Aylwin's request two months ago that he step aside is that he feels he must be there to protect members of the army from possible prosecution for the political killings, disappearances and torture of prisoners that occurred under his rule.
The new President has said he will not intentionally set out to persecute General Pinochet or anyone under him but that neither will he block congressional or judicial investigations that might lead to charges.
 
A List of Abuses
Abuses attributed to the Pinochet Government fall into three categories. First, an unknown number of people, possibly as many as 1,000, died in the days and weeks immediately after the coup, many in executions and many others in shootouts between troops and members of the Communist Party and armed groups of the far left. Second, nearly 700 people disappeared in the 1974-77 period after being detained by the intelligence police. Finally, countless others have been reported tortured while in detention.
With Chile's economy the healthiest in South America, it is the human rights issue that will probably be the toughest challenge for Mr. Aylwin in his first months in office. He has to find a way to avoid confrontation with General Pinochet and the army while responding to demands for justice from victims and their families.
About 400 people are currently imprisoned on charges that human rights groups say are political.

HEADLINE: No Advantage for Disadvantaged Found in a 60's Military Program

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11

 BODY:
A Vietnam-era program intended to give poor youths and those with low aptitudes a ''leg up'' on life by lowering standards for entry into the military was a failure, a new study says.
Allowing those people to enter military service did not improve their lot later in civilian life, said the study, conducted for the Defense Department by the Human Resources Research Organization of Alexandria, Va.
''In fact,'' it added, ''in terms of employment status, educational achievement and income, those who never served were better off than those who had been in the military.'' 
''These data provide no evidence to support the hypothesis that military service offers a 'leg up' to low-aptitude and disadvantaged youth as they seek to overcome their cognitive and skill deficits and compete successfully in the civilian world,'' the study said.
About 300,000 entered the service under the program from 1966 to 1971, with nearly two-thirds entering the Army. Fifty-four percent were volunteers, and 46 percent were draftees.
 
Named by McNamara
Janice H. Laurence, a social scientist with Human Resources Research, told the House Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations last month that the project's ''social promises were not kept.''
Under the program, advanced by Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara, the military was viewed as a steppingstone for social advancement.
The study raises questions about current proposals to encourage the use of the military to some help youths overcome social and educational disadvantages.
Under the program, ''low-aptitude recruits'' - those scoring below a normal cutoff on the Armed Forces Qualification Test - entered the service with promises of traditional and remedial skill training.
Half the those who entered the program came from the South. More than 40 percent were from minority groups, and the average reading ability was at the sixth-grade level.
Most went to combat or to jobs like food service, supply, wire communications, motor transport and automotive repair.
Flaws in the enlistment test allowed another group of about 300,000 people - also lacking the traditional qualifications - to enter the military from 1976 to 1980, the study said.
 
Lagging Behind in Life
According to the study, veterans of the project wound up earning $5,000 to $7,000 less per year than their nonveteran counterparts. Veterans were more likely to be unemployed, less likely to be married and more likely to have been divorced.
The low-aptitude veterans who served from 1976 to 1980 were not found to be better off economically, educationally or socially than their non-veteran counterparts. There were no significant differences regarding employment status, occupational category or average income, the report said.
But the veterans had less formal education, had higher divorce rates and were more likely to be dissatisfied with their jobs.
Ms. Laurence offered no reasons, but gave some theories: employers may be biased against veterans; time away from ''mainstream civilian activities and pursuits'' may be damaging, and the transition to civilian life is particularly hard for those of low aptitude.

HEADLINE: New Land Panel Has Trouble Gearing Up

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
The way New York City governs land, perhaps its most precious commodity, is in quiet turmoil these days, with the Dinkins administration behind schedule in putting in place changes under the new City Charter and developers rushing to act on big projects before the system changes.
Eleven days after the charter requires Mayor David N. Dinkins and other city officials to have appointed a chairman and all the members of a new 13-member City Planning Commission, none have been named. The existing 7-member commission, which will review projects until the end of June, has two vacancies.
The City Council, which after Sept. 1 will have final power for the first time over zoning changes and where to build city projects like jails and homeless shelters, does not yet know how often its committee on land use will meet, what its rules will be or just how it will divide its work. 
''It's sort of natural, because you have the old system rapidly ending, and the new system which is a mystery to everyone, and you have a gap where people don't know quite what to do,'' said City Council President Andrew J. Stein. ''It's a funny period.''
So far, no projects have been delayed by the slowness in naming the new commission because it is not to begin reviewing projects until July 1. Among the many problems to be resolved are new guidelines governing the ''fair-share distribution'' among communities of city projects from sanitation garages to libraries. The Mayor is to propose such rules by July 1, and the staff of the city planning department is working on them. But officials there say only so much can be done without a new chairman in place.
''It's all extremely important,'' said Jeannette D. Kahlenberg, executive director of the Citizens Union, a civic group that supported the new charter last year. ''This is a land city and that's the most important new area the Council has taken over. If things are behind now, what's going to happen in the future?''
So sensitive is the subject that several lawyers, business executives and lobbyists for major developers declined to comment on the record, for fear of alienating the new Mayor or council members who will have power over their projects. But a number said they receive constant inquiries about the changes and uncertainties.
''You've got a client and you want to take them to talk to somebody,'' said one former city official who is now a lawyer in private practice. ''You can't do it, because the people you need to talk to either aren't there yet or aren't sure themselves how things will work.''
And while Mr. Dinkins voted for many major projects as Manhattan borough president, some developers fear that he will not be as sympathetic to their wishes as the former mayor, Edward I. Koch. Two weeks ago, in what some saw as an important test, the developer of the huge Riverwalk project on the East Side withdrew the proposal after the administration let it be known it would oppose it.
Mr. Dinkins had spoken out against the plan in the past, but it was supported by Mr. Koch and the city's Public Development Corporation, which was a co-applicant with the developer.
 
Changes Were Extensive
Mr. Dinkins's deputy mayor for planning and development, Barbara J. Fife, began negotiating changes to make the project more acceptable. Then city planners said such changes would be so extensive as to require the project to begin the review process all over again, and Mr. Dinkins's First Deputy Mayor, Norman Steisel, and Mrs. Fife decided simply to oppose it.
Mrs. Fife said the Mayor was working on choosing a planning commission chairman but could not say when one would be appointed.
Among the names that have been mentioned as possible candidates are Edward L. Sadowsky, a lawyer and former Councilman, Edward Wallace, a former Councilman and aide to former City Council President Carol Bellamy and Linda Davidoff, head of the Parks Council, a nonprofit civic group.
Mayoral aides said the other six mayoral appointees to the new commission were being held up because of delays by the city's screening panel and delays in background checks.
Mr. Stein and each of the five borough presidents must also appoint one member to the commission, and some of them have set up screening panels of their own. Several of these elected officials said they also wanted to see who the Mayor named to the commission before making their own appointments.
 
Ruled Unconstitutional
Now, the six-month Uniform Land Use Review Process, known as Ulurp, that virtually all major projects must undergo is geared to the twice monthly meetings of the Board of Estimate, which has the final say. Consideration of projects begins with a 60-day advisory review by the local community board, 60 days at the Planning Commission and another 60 days at the estimate board.
But the board was ruled unconstitutional last year, and voters approved a new charter that redistributes its powers, which are being phased out.
In recent weeks, developers have pressed to have a number of major projects certified by the city planning department as ready for review, so they will still be considered by the Board of Estimate.
Among these proposed projects are a major biotechnology building by Columbia University in Washington Heights and a major commercial residential development along the Queens waterfront in Long Island City known as Hunter's Point.
 
'Knowing What Buttons to Push'
''There's a sense of knowing what buttons to push when you go to the Board of Estimate,'' Mrs. Fife said, ''in the other case, there's uncertainty. It's a case of the devil you know versus the devil you don't.''
Any big project for which the formal review process has not already begun, is virtually certain to end up at the Council. One of the first major plans that is expected to go through the new process is the huge Trump City proposal for the Upper West Side.
Council members themselves say they are conscious of the responsibilities that are about to fall on them.
''It hasn't yet reached the point where people start to come to your door to talk about it,'' said Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey of Queens, chairman of the land-use committee's subcommittee on franchises. ''My concern is that suddenly on a Monday morning my staff is going to hand me seven messages from seven different people, all wanting to talk with me at once.''

Japanese Work To Link Business To Philanthropy

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Last fall, five days before the Mitsubishi Estate Company of Tokyo bought control of the Rockefeller Group, which owns Rockefeller Center, Mitsubishi's sister companies made another New York investment.
This one was considerably smaller and generated less publicity than the Rockefeller Center deal, but its implications could be nearly as profound: Several Mitsubishi companies and other Japanese corporations underwrote the first United States tour by the Takarazuka Revue dance troupe. In its debut at Radio City Music Hall, the troupe raised $100,000 in a benefit for the United Way of New York City.
The Rockefeller Center deal was among the most dramatic examples of Japan's appetite for American companies - it even prompted some Japanese to caution against acquisitions with such symbolic value. (In New York, the Japanese represent the largest contingent among foreign-owned banks; they are second among foreign companies in commercial real-estate holdings and third in hotel space). 
The investment in United Way was emblematic of another trend: a broadening embrace by Japanese-owned companies of the American tradition of corporate philanthropy.
Hisao Kondo, president of Mitsui & Company (U.S.A.), Inc., has become what the New York City Chamber of Commerce hails as the first foreign national to be elected a director of the chamber in more than two centuries. About 60 of the chamber's 1,500 member companies are Japanese owned.
Mr. Kondo and Minoru Makihara, president of the Mitsubishi International Corporation, have also been elected partners of the New York City Partnership, the chamber's sister organization, which promotes corporate social responsiblity. Last fall, Mr. Kondo, who is president of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry of New York, joined the board of United Way. Sam Kusomoto, president of the Minolta Corporation in the United States, sits on United Way's board in Bergen County, N.J.
The emerging spirit of volunteerism marks a profound strategic shift. Underlying earlier reticence was the short tenure of many Japanese nationals in this country and, more fundamentally, a culture gap: ''Good corporate citizenship is not second nature to the Japanese,'' said John K. Wheeler, vice president of the Japan Society in New York. In Japan there has been little private involvement in public affairs.
When Ronald K. Shelp, president of the New York City Partnership, tried to explain to Japanese executives the role of private industry in addressing social problems, one businessman interjected: ''Which branch of government did you say you work for?''
But in 1988, the Keidanren - the Japanese business federation - said the lack of philanthropy by Japanese concerns abroad ''would be detrimental to their harmonious integration into host communities and would also invite unfavorable impacts and friction.''
Last month, the Japanese Foreign Ministry proposed to offer Japanese companies tax deductions for philanthropy in this country. Next month, the Keidanren is sending another study mission here to explore community service.
Philanthropy and volunteerism represent a vehicle for improving recruiting, enhancing government relations, providing tax deductions and for ''gaining acceptance and thereby improving American community perception of the Japanese transplant company,'' says a ''call to action'' just issued by the Japanese Chamber of Commerce of New York.
''All of this comes down to the bottom line: community involvement and volunteer programs are ultimately good for business,'' the chamber's guide concludes.
Early Japanese versions of involvement were largely limited to endowing professorships, subsidizing research and giving money but remaining disengaged. More recently, volunteerism has manifested itself in more direct efforts, ranging from Hitachi America Ltd.'s commitment to Tarrytown's schools and hospitals to participation in the New York City Partnership's summer-jobs program by Mitsui and the Japanese Chamber of Commerce.
Increasingly, Japanese companies are being courted by potential beneficiaries of partnerships, which are viewed as one means of ameliorating economic conflict between the two countries. Moreover, community involvement conforms to a more familiar Japanese tradition of creating long-term relationships.
''If Japan is going to be investing as a partner they feel it's essential to become part of the community,'' said Penelope Benson-Wright, director of the New York-Japan Initiative, founded by the New York Chamber and Partnership.
''We think the future of the city depends on their active involvement,'' Mr. Shelp said.

HEADLINE: Last Cast of 'Chorus Line' Wonders About Taking Its Next Steps

BYLINE: By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
For 25-year-old Jack Noseworthy, singing and dancing in ''A Chorus Line'' was always the stuff of dreams. Last month, Mr. Noseworthy's dreams came true. He was offered, and he accepted, a role in the Michael Bennett musical, the longest-running show in Broadway history. And then came the afternoon of Feb. 21.
''That day, the day they announced the closing of the show, was my opening-night performance,'' Mr. Noseworthy recalls with a shrug while sitting in a dressing room at the Shubert Theater, where the musical has been playing since July 25, 1975. ''I left 'Jerome Robbins's Broadway' to come here. And my immediate thought was that I'm going to be out of a job.''
Joseph Papp, head of the New York Shakespeare Festival, the musical's producer, announced on Feb. 21 that the 15-year run of ''A Chorus Line'' would end on March 31, after 6,104 performances. The 32 cast members, including Mr. Noseworthy, would all be out of work, most of them facing the painful prospect of going from audition to audition in search of a job. 
It was a case of life imitating art, because ''A Chorus Line'' is about the thoughts, fears and frustrations of chorus dancers looking for work. In the show, 17 performers take part in an audition, competing for 8 jobs in a Broadway musical. ''I really need this job,'' they sing. ''I hope I get it. How many people does he need?''
 
The Real Job
They talk, dance and sing about the trials and tribulations they are willing to put up with, the long periods of unemployment many of them accept out of their love for what they do, their need to get on a stage in front of a thousand or more faces in a darkened theater and grab their moment in the spotlight. To get there, they accept the often demeaning process of audition and rejection until some director decides they are just the right ones for what he has in mind.
''It's unquestionably a tough life,'' Mr. Papp says. ''But there's an essential quality I have found in all the dancers. There's a kind of courage there and a lack of self-pity. There's a strong sense of affirmation. They just keep going and they still manage to smile.''
As one veteran cast member, Angelique Ilo, who plays Judy Turner, the somewhat daffy dancer from El Paso, Tex., says: ''A performer's job is looking for a job. And if you don't come to terms with that, you're in the wrong business.''
Many cast members, however, have not had to endure long periods of unemployment in the last decade. They have had the security of ''A Chorus Line,'' a show they could leave for other shows and return to when the other shows closed. But now that security is gone, and for some, it is time for making decisions.
 
The Old and the Young
Some say the moment has come to weigh whether they are finally too old to continue dancing - though none can agree on precisely what the words ''too old'' mean. There are thoughts of leaving the business, as at least one did when unemployment became too tough to bear. Where to go, though, is a tough question. For a few there is the possibility of moving from dancing to choreography, or becoming stage managers.
Many, however, are quite young and have been lucky and talented enough to get fairly steady work in their first few years in the business. But even they worry that perhaps their time of unemployment, the word they have heard so much about, has come.
Mr. Noseworthy, who had been in ''Jerome Robbins's Broadway'' for a year and a half, says he does not regret making the move. ''This month is going to be exciting, and I think only positive things can come of it,'' he says of his role as Mark, the youngest dancer at the audition, fresh off the bus from Tempe, Ariz. ''I had seen 'A Chorus Line' 10 years ago, and what always attracted me about the show was its history. And now I'm going to be a part of that history.''
He has worked for pretty much all his three-and-a-half years in the business. Now, he says, he will ''audition for whatever there is to audition for.''
''I'm a little neurotic, though, and I'm hoping that it won't be too long that I'm unemployed, because I haven't experienced that feeling and I don't know what to expect,'' he says. There is the possibility of returning to ''Jerome Robbins's Broadway,'' he adds, ''but there has to be an appropriate opening; if the tall, blond girl on the left leaves, they're not going to hire me.''
 
An Actress in 5 Roles
Laurie Gamache, 30, has the major role of Cassie, the former star who is trying to make a comeback and is willing to take a job in the chorus. Ms. Gamache has been with the show since 1980, when she was hired during an audition in Iowa, her home state, just after graduating from college. She has played the roles of Sheila, Kristine, Judy and Bebe, as well as Cassie, on Broadway, in the national and international companies, on the bus-and-truck tour and on tours of Japan, Europe and Canada. She is part of a singing group called Blue Avenue, which also includes two present members and one former member of the company, and all are hoping to develop the group further as a cabaret act.
After all these years, she says, auditioning will be strange, but she is not worried. ''There are a lot of places around the country where I can work,'' she says. ''Whether or not I will be the lead in a Broadway show again is a different question. It's a pretty big dream to think about getting my picture outside in front of a theater again.''
 
The Only Original
Robert LuPone, 43, is the only member of the original cast now in the show. In 1975 and 1976, he played Zach, the director who decides which performers will make it into the chorus; he was away for 12 years, and then in 1988 he became Zach again. In between his two stints, he says, he did ''films, television and theater, and I formed my own theater company, the Manhattan Class Company.''
When the show folds, he says, he plans to ''continue doing films, television and theater.''
''I'm a working actor, and I will continue to be one,'' he says. ''If not, I'll do something else. If all else fails, I have my own company.''
Michael Gruber, 25, plays the role of Mike, who studied tap when he was young because his sister was taking lessons. Mr. Gruber already has another job: He leaves May 1 for the Vienna company of ''42d Street.'' ''A Chorus Line'' is his first Broadway show. He has been in the business only about two years, and he has been in ''A Chorus Line'' since January 1989. ''I've really only been out of work three months tops,'' he says, ''but then I haven't been in the business long.''
William Mead, on the other hand, is very familiar with the long periods of unemployment the show speaks about. ''I've left the theater several times because of them,'' he says. ''Once I didn't dance for almost seven years. It was when I went to see 'A Chorus Line' that I decided I wanted to dance again.''
Mr. Mead understudies four roles in the musical and has been a dancer for 30 years. He has been with ''A Chorus Line'' on and off for four years, including the last two and a half. Now, he says, he is trying to put together a solo act, and he will start auditioning, ''for summer stock, I guess.''
 
A Month Off to Decide
Fraser Ellis, 33, is an understudy and assistant stage manager who joined the bus-and-truck company in 1981 and has been with ''A Chorus Line'' for eight and a half years. ''The closing is sad for me because it represents getting older,'' he says, ''and that's always hard to come to terms with. You always think, 'What am I going to do when I can't dance anymore?' and now it's a reality.''
He is a member of Blue Avenue. He is also ''toying with the idea that I might make a career move to something else,'' though he is not sure what. ''I'm not worrying about surviving, but I've been out of the mainstream of auditioning for a long time. It may be time to stop dancing. That's why I'm taking a month off to decide what to do.''
Troy Garza, another member of Blue Avenue, also has a decision to make. Mr. Garza, who will be 36 this year, is the dance captain. He was in the original London company in 1976, spent 20 months on the road and came into the New York production late in 1977, more than 12 years ago.
''Being out of work is a bummer,'' he says. ''I thought I would want to take two months off, but now that there's a visible end in sight I would rather keep working. I have a choice of whether I want to stick to captaining or get into choreographing. But I find that I do like performing a lot more than I thought I did.''
Gordon Owens, 31, plays Richie, who gave up the idea of teaching for the glamour and risk of the stage. Mr. Owens has been in the show off and on for 10 years. ''This time it's been a year,'' he says. ''I joined in 1980, quit, did 'Dreamgirls,' came back, did 'Starlight Express' and came back for the third time.''
Now, he says, he is working on a couple of plays in development, including one that is to have a staged reading and that he hopes will turn into a full-scale production. He has also written a screenplay - ''and I am determined to fight for it until it gets done.''
 
The Reason for Dancing
Doug Friedman, 26, plays Greg, the former Sidney Kenneth Beckenstein, who is the most experienced of the dancers. He has been with the show only four months, but those four months have meant a great deal to him. ''This is why I became a dancer,'' he says. ''I saw this show with my junior high school class when I was 13 years old, and once I saw it, I decided I wanted to be a dancer. I wanted to be in 'A Chorus Line.' ''
In the eight years he has been in show business, he has done the national tour of ''Cabaret,'' ''A Chorus Line'' in Europe and on the road, and a revival of ''Mack and Mabel'' that was supposed to go to Broadway but didn't. And, he says, he has performed on ''cruise ships and things like that.''
''There was a time, about a year and a half, when I couldn't get a job,'' he says. ''You just wind up at unemployment. I waited tables, and that was fun sometimes. And then I started performing, and for two years it's been good. Like a miser, I saved my money. I wanted to buy a co-op.'' Now, he says, he has begun auditioning again. And he's also doing something else: ''I'm closing on my co-op.''
Finally, there is Ms. Ilo, who is one of those who has thought about the words ''too old.'' She has spent 5 of the last 10 years in the show, and at one point played Cassie. ''I came back as Judy after I had two babies,'' she says.
''I've been in show business since I was 17 - I won't tell you my age,'' she says. ''And at times I think, 'Aren't you getting a little old for this?' I don't know. I don't think you ever get too old to do it. So I think I'll audition for anything I think I'm right for. And I think I'm going to keep on auditioning until they tell me I'm getting too old to do this.''
She laughs. ''And maybe even then I won't believe them,'' she says. ''After all, as long as I can keep kicking. . . . ''

HEADLINE: Christie's Reverses Stand on Price Guarantees

BYLINE: By RITA REIF

 BODY:
Christie's, one of the world's two major auction houses, has abruptly reversed a longstanding policy and has guaranteed a minimum price for a collection of artworks it is to auction in May.
''During the last 12 months or so, we have in certain cases found it difficult to compete without offering guarantees,'' Christopher Davidge, the managing director of Christie's International, said late last week by telephone from London. ''It is a recognition with executors and trustees that we have to be competitive.''
Mr. Davidge cited an increased demand for guarantees over the last year in announcing that his auction house has guaranteed five paintings to be sold for heirs of Robert Lehman, the financier, at Christie's in New York on May 15. The presale estimate for the collection is $40 million to $60 million. Mr. Davidge would not say what the guarantee figure was, other than to say it was between the high and low estimates. 
 
A Lure for Sellers
In the high-flying and increasingly lucrative business of fine-art auctions, the guaranteed price has become a powerful magnet for houses to attract sellers. As prices skyrocketed into millions of dollars, the demand for financial devices strongly increased.
Adherents say price guarantees are a perfectly reasonable way of bringing in new business and of lifting the burden of risk from sellers. Both adherents and detractors agree that guarantees have brought art to the auction market that would otherwise have passed through galleries or remained unsold. But the detractors contend that guarantees have served to inflate prices and, in giving the house a greater financial stake in the work of art, have provided further reason for buyers to beware.
No auction house has used the device more effectively in recent years than Sotheby's, the archrival of Christie's. In fact, Christie's has frequently been critical of the use of guarantees by Sotheby's.
When told that Christie's would now use guarantees, Diana D. Brooks, the president of Sotheby's in North America, said: ''I find it hypocritical after the public criticism Christie's has leveled at us for our practice of giving guarantees.''
Mr. Davidge, who controls Christie's policy worldwide, declined to say how often, under what terms and where Christie's would offer guarantees to clients in the future.
 
Competition for Consignment
Mr. Lehman, the financier, was chairman of the Metropolitan Museum of Art at his death in 1969. He left the paintings - an 1888 self-portrait by Vincent van Gogh and studies of women by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Amedeo Modigliani, Pierre Auguste Renoir and Kees van Dongen -to the children (there were two and are now three) of his son, Robert Owen (Robin) Lehman, a film maker. Robin Lehman decided recently that the artworks should now be auctioned and with the trustees of the estate went to court to get permission to sell the five paintings.
Christie's had stiff competition in winning the Lehman collection from Sotheby's, which offered a guarantee, and from Acquavella Galleries, which offered to buy the collection for an undisclosed price. The prize painting of the group, the most valuable announced thus far for the May auction sales, is the van Gogh, which is expected to bring $20 million to $30 million.
''Guarantees are a very potent kind of lure,'' said David P. Tunick, a major New York art dealer. ''A guarantee is money in the bank. However, if a guarantee is not disclosed, the whole question of conflict of interest does arise. Once a guarantee is made, it means the auction house has equity in the object that is going to be sold.''
Mr. Tunick said this weekend that he was not surprised that Christie's had guaranteed the Lehman paintings. ''It is very clear that Christie's has caved in to the demands of the marketplace,'' he said. ''They have thrown their ideals to the wind. They took such a strong stand, and now it is a 180-degree reversal. I don't blame them. I think it is a very competitive situation.''
Sotheby's has used the guarantee to win consignments from museums, estates and owners of major artworks. Under a guarantee, the auction house and the seller agree on a minimum price, either for an individual work or for an entire lot, and the house must pay the seller at least that much, whether or not the art is sold.
The fate of any amount the house brings in over the guarantee depends on the individual deal. It may go to the seller, or it may be split with the auction house. The auction house becomes the owner of any unsold art.
 
Failure Could Bring Ruin
Sotheby's was not alone in offering guarantees. At least three other auction houses - Butterfield & Butterfield of San Francisco and Los Angeles, Habsburg, Feldman of Geneva and New York, and William Doyle Galleries of New York - offered them, too, but they have nowhere near the financial impact on the market of Sotheby's.
Until now, Christie's shunned guarantees, at least guarantees for which it would be responsible. For the last year or so, Christie's has said it would help clients to arrange third-party guarantees, possibly with a merchant bank in London, an offer on which there were no takers.
''We want to remain at arm's length on a transaction,'' the president of Christie's in New York, Christopher Burge, said in late January. ''If a guarantee goes wrong in a down market, it could destroy the business. In the long run, it could be fantastically dangerous to the business itself.''
Mr. Burge said Saturday, ''I am happy to stand by what I said earlier.''
Mr. Davidge said he still agrees with Mr. Burge that the failure of an expensive guaranteed work or collection to sell could ruin Christie's.
''We stand by what we have always said,'' Mr. Davidge said. ''Guarantees are not the proper business of the auction process. As far as I am concerned, we do not like guarantees. We do not believe they should be offered. However, we do have an ability to give a guarantee and still maintain a professional standard that people seek from us.''
Mrs. Brooks of Sotheby's said, ''I find it hard to believe they are going to be giving guarantees if they don't believe they should be doing it.''
 
Demand Is Increasing
The detractors of guarantees, art dealers being among the most vocal, have had some effect. Sotheby's announced early this year that it would fully disclose what works or collection had guarantees and mark them prominently in its sale catalogues, eliminating what to some extent had been guesswork for potential buyers.
During the first four months of the auction season, which began in September, the sum of Sotheby's guarantees represented 10 percent of its $1.5 billion in international sales - more than three times the value in guarantees of any comparable period in the past.
''Guarantees seem to be more in demand,'' Mrs. Brooks said. ''We did increase our market share in 1989.'' She added that in the fall period Sotheby's market share, which was 55 percent in 1988, rose to 58 percent. ''The guarantee definitely helped that.''
Sotheby's May sales are to offer numerous guarantees, the largest of which is the early 20th-century art holdings from the estate of Lydia Winston Malbin, valued at $65 million to $85 million. A lawyer for the Malbin estate, Ralph E. Lerner, said Sotheby's price guarantee was the crucial factor. No Longer Impartial? Dealers have criticized Sotheby's role as potential owner, saying it compromised the house's function as an impartial agent for both the seller and buyer by serving as a banker for the seller. Dealers say that buyers should be wary because guaranteed works may be overestimated or overpublicized, but no specific incidents have been cited. They have also questioned Sotheby's wording - or absence of it - on guaranteed offerings in its catalogues. In New York sales through December, Sotheby's identified guaranteed lots as properties in which the auction house ''has an interest,'' without saying which of several forms of interest it was. In London, guarantees have not been identified at all.
Last fall, the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, responding to inquiries from the press, informally looked into Sotheby's policies on disclosure of guarantees but said it found no violations of regulations. Because of the widespread discussion in the press about financing and guarantees, though, Sotheby's reviewed its programs and said it would make some changes anyway. These were announced in January. ''We are going to disclose guarantees in our sales all over the world,'' Mrs. Brooks said. Any individual property or collection auctioned with a guarantee, she added, is to be identified with bold graphics - probably a circle - and an explanation of the guarantee is to be included in the front of all its catalogues. The changes are to apply not just in New York, but to Sotheby's auctions worldwide as well. Mr. Davidge said the guarantee on the Lehman artworks would be noted in the catalogue.
Mrs. Brooks said Sotheby's would continue to guarantee some major individual artworks but would focus more on larger properties, preferably collections or groups of three or more items, ''to mimimize our risk by spreading it over many objects.''
When asked whether it is by design that individual works guaranteed are among the highest-priced, running to seven figures, Mrs. Brooks said: ''We have never established a minimum value of the collections or properties we will guarantee. We would do it on something valued at $100,000 if we really wanted it for sale.''
 
An Ambitious Guarantee
Probably the most ambitious guaranteed deal involved the sale at Sotheby's in October of the art and antiques collection of John T. Dorrance Jr., an heir to the Campbell Soup fortune; the sale totaled $131.3 million. The transaction was criticized because Sotheby's refused to acknowledge until December that it had guaranteed the collection.
Mrs. Brooks said Sotheby's guarantee was ''less than $100 million.'' However much it was, it was sufficient for Sotheby's to win the competition for the collection against Christie's and against Acquavella, the New York dealer, which offered $100 million for the artworks alone.
David Grimbley, of the London brokers UBS Phillips & Drew, said guarantees were a factor in Sotheby's success in the fall season. ''It is something that got them more business,'' he said. ''I think that Dorrance - historically a client of Christie's - went to Sotheby's because of the guarantee.''
Guarantees could present other problems, he said. ''The most dangerous situation for the art market would be if both companies offered guarantees - because then they would bid each other up.'' He said overly aggressive estimates on guaranteed artworks might result, spurring further inflation in the art market.
 
Revival of a Past Practice
The guarantee has been a source of dispute since it was secretly introduced at Sotheby's in New York. David J. Nash, who heads fine art sales at Sotheby's in New York, recalled the short but lively life of the guarantees after he and Peregrine Pollen, who was president of Sotheby's in New York when it was still known as Parke-Bernet Galleries, began them in 1972 or 1973 at a time when selling at auction, instead of through a dealer, was viewed as risky. The guarantee worked, wooing owners of major artworks like Norton Simon, the California industrialist; Arnold Maremont, a New York businessman, and the estate of the art dealer Edith Halpert and the contents of her Downtown Gallery.
The Arab oil embargo ended the art boom by mid-1974, and in 1975 the Department of Consumer Affairs changed its regulations, requiring auction houses to disclose any financial interests in their catalogues. When the art market heated up again in 1986, guarantees were revived.
Richard L. Feigen, a prominent New York dealer, is a frequent critic of guarantees, but that has not stopped him from negotiating four guarantees with Sotheby's, one of them for a painting he personally consigned and three for paintings he consigned for clients. Two of these paintings were sold for prices below the guarantee; one brought more than the guaranteed minimum, and one did not sell.
Mr. Feigen has criticized the guarantee as ''definitely inflationary.'' ''Free market forces are not allowed to go work,'' he said.
As for his using a device he condemns, he said: ''I used the guarantee in instances where we were agents for the vendor, where I am obligated to get the best possible terms for those vendors. That's my job.''

HEADLINE: Realty Hurts American Express

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 11

 BODY:
The American Express Company's dabble into real estate in the 1980's is proving to be one of its biggest blunders.
Now the company faces a difficult decision of whether to unload its primary real estate subsidiary. Such a move would please shareholders but infuriate thousands of people who bought partnership interests in real estate through Shearson Lehman Hutton, American Express's stumbling brokerage subsidiary.
In 1982 when it acquired the Balcor group, a leading seller of real estate partnerships, American Express hoped the new division would pick up the slack if business weakened at its brokerage subsidiary.
Balcor, which is based in Skokie, Ill., outside Chicago, sponsored partnerships that would invest in mid-size office buildings, shopping centers and apartment complexes. But most of the 153 realty partnerships that Balcor sponsored between 1982 and 1989 invested heavily in the Southwest and have stumbled badly during the economic slump in that region, unable to achieve the occupancy levels or rents that had been forecast, Balcor officials say. 
 
Paying the Banks
The partnerships have been forced to renegotiate or refinance scores of bank loans they obtained to buy property, and American Express has advanced nearly $250 million in loans and loan guarantees to keep the most troubled partnerships from defaulting.
Making matters worse is that another of Balcor's core businesses -real estate finance - is also not doing as well as American Express had hoped. Under Stephen Silverstein, Balcor's 41-year-old chief executive, Balcor accelerated a program of lending against commercial properties nationwide. By last November, the company had $1.1 billion in such loans, but repayment of $114 million has been listed as late. While Balcor has estimated that losses on those loans will not exceed $10 million, analysts are not nearly so optimistic.
Organizationally, Balcor is a part of Shearson, and its problems will show up in the brokerage's results. ''You're going to see Shearson take a big charge for Balcor in the first quarter,'' said Michael Blumstein, the brokerage analyst at the First Boston Corporation. ''A couple-hundred-million-dollar reserve for those Balcor loans wouldn't surprise me.''
 
Favoring a Sale
At American Express headquarters in New York, top company officials are understood to favor unloading Balcor. They think - and analysts agree - that selling Balcor would help American Express's stock, which has fallen in recent months in good part because of Balcor's problems as well as problems in the rest of Shearson Lehman Hutton.
But their decision is complicated by the fact that a sale would make it virtually certain that American Express would lose the $250 million it has sunk into the troubled Balcor partnerships. Even more important, given American Express's willingness to stick with the partnerships until now, a sale would probably provoke a furor among the hundreds of Shearson stockbrokers who sold interests in the partnerships and the 400,000 investors who invested in Balcor partnerships. While Balcor itself reported a profit last year because of its other businesses, many of the partnership investors face losses.
 
Keeping Investors at Bay
''There is a desire to keep investors at bay and Shearson stockbrokers at bay,'' said Michael Kirby, a principal at Green Street Advisers, a Newport Beach, Calif., firm that monitors real estate companies. ''Imagine what would happen if suddenly you had thousands of Shearson customers pounding on their brokers' doors, complaining about real estate partnerships that had gone bad. The brokers would then be screaming bloody murder to New York.''
Balcor investors have reason to be upset. An information circular distributed earlier this year under a Shearson recapitalization plan disclosed that some of the partnerships had halted interest payments to lenders while others had defaulted on loans and had their properties seized. As for the nearly $250 million that American Express has spent to keep the most troubled partnerships afloat, the information circular says that $32 million will probably never be recovered.
In an immediate financial sense, the risk to American Express or Balcor appears minimal because neither American Express nor Balcor guaranteed the partnerships' bank loans. But if the partnership investors incur big losses when their properties are sold - the outcome most outside experts expect - the reputation of Shearson's sales force could be sullied badly. That could be of much longer-term consequence than Balcor's bad loans.
 
Perspective on Revenue
In 1989 Balcor contributed revenue of $260 million to Shearson, which had total revenue of $12.5 billion, while the parent company had revenue $25.05 billion.
Balcor was founded in the early 1970's by Jerry Reinsdorf, a wealthy Chicagoan who is best known as the principal owner of the Chicago White Sox and the Chicago Bulls. Mr. Reinsdorf saw a niche for Balcor: sponsoring partnerships that would invest in mid-sized office buildings and apartment complexes.
His idea was a huge hit. Exploiting holes in the law permitting partnership shareholders to claim tax deductions well above their investments, Mr. Reinsdorf attracted money from individuals nationwide. In 1982, after he sold Balcor to American Express, money poured in as interests in Balcor partnerships were sold through Shearson offices around the country. Balcor raised $582 million in 1983, $630 million in 1984 and $835 milllion in 1985, making it the leading sponsor of realty partnerships for three consecutive years. At its peak, Balcor controlled properties worth more than $4 billion.
In January 1985, Mr. Reinsdorf turned over his duties at Balcor as chief executive to Mr. Silverstein, a former top finance executive at Playboy Enterprises Inc. who had been hired by Mr. Reinsdorf several months before. No sooner had the change in command taken place than did problems that had been brewing begin to surface.
 
Started to Realize
''When I came in, we started to realize that some of the properties were already not performing as planned,'' Mr. Silverstein said in an interview.
What no one had apparently realized, or acted on, was that Mr. Reinsdorf had sent the Balcor partnerships down a dangerous path, concentrating their investments in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and other cities that depend on the oil and gas business. Balcor officials say a majority of the investments were in apartment complexes and smaller office buildings precisely the type of properties that have since fared the worst in the current oil recession.
''Jerry felt that the Sun Belt was the place to be investing,'' Mr. Silverstein said. ''If oil had gone to $100 a barrel, everyone would say we were the smartest guys in the world.''
Whether Shearson executives knew what was going on at Balcor during this period is unclear.
 
'All Over the Country'
Reached while traveling on Friday, Mr. Reinsdorf disputed Balcor's contention that Balcorps concentrated its holdings in Texas. ''Balcor was invested all over the country,'' he said. ''Texas was a state where we had a substantial stake, but so were Florida, Georgia, Nevada, California and Michigan. I don't think anybody would have foreseen that oil prices would fall off the table.''
As for American Express's involvement with Balcor, Mr. Reinsdorf said, ''We were autonomous, and they were not involved in the investment process. It would have been foolish, because that was not their expertise.
Mr. Silverstein, who had been on the job barely six months, then made a critical decision. Rather than let the partnerships collapse, he would attempt to renegotiate their bank loans and lease their buildings as fully as he could. He also persuaded American Express to begin making loans to partnerships most desperate for cash.
Mr. Silverstein's idea was simple: If the partnerships could be kept afloat there was at least a chance that their buildings could regain lost value.
 
A Doomed Business
Meanwhile, sensing that a pending tax-law change would doom Balcor's mainstay tax-shelter business, Mr. Silverstein immediately began moving Balcor away from partnerships and into lending.
As it turns out, Mr. Silverstein's strategy has been successful - to a limited extent.
Balcor's troubled loans notwithstanding, the lending operation has generated millions of dollars in interest income. The efforts to keep the partnerships alive have also been fruitful, reducing investors losses.
Working with Thomas Meador, Balcor's 42-year-old president, Mr. Silverstein has been able to stanch the cash-flow deficits that had been moving the partnerships closer to insolvency. At the same time, with the Southwest economy beginning to recover, he has been able to raise rents on certain partnership buildings, and the value of a number of the buildings has increased.
 
'Under Control'
''Right now, our feeling is that we have the situation under control,'' Mr. Silverstein said.
The problem is that Balcor investors want more than that. And as things now stand, Balcor officials acknowledge, it could be years, if ever, before investors get all their money back, let alone a return.
''Investors will get some of their money back to most of their money back,'' Mr. Meador said. ''But given the declines in the market, it's unlikely that you will get all of your money back plus a return.''
For Balcor investors, the story will have an painful epilogue. Because many of the investors claimed big tax deductions in the early years of their investment, they will face hefty capital-gains taxes when the properties are sold.

HEADLINE: Venezuela and Banks Near Agreement on Debt Relief

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Venezuela and its commercial bankers are moving toward a debt agreement that is expected to include a provision for substantial, but temporary, debt relief.
The relief would come in the form of a large reduction in the interest rates that Venezuela pays on its $21 billion of loans from commercial banks. These rates, now around 10 percent, could be reduced by several percentage points. If economic conditions improve over the next several years, the interest rates would return toward their present level. 
Commercial bankers and officials in the negotiations, which have been going on and off for more than a year, said the proposal was necessary because the bankers believe that Venezuela, unlike Mexico and Brazil, does not need debt reduction.
 
Political Motives Cited
The country's push for it, they argue, is politically motivated to help the Government win support for the difficult economic changes it put through to fight inflation. Those changes include the privatizing of state-owned industries and opening the economy to foreign investment. The restructuring has pushed the country into a deep recession, with the economy declining by at least 8 percent over the last year.
If an agreement is reached that contains the temporary reduction, it would be the latest under the Brady Plan, the Bush Administration's strategy to ease third world debt, named for Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. Mexico was the first to reach an agreement under the Brady plan, which was announced a year ago. The Philippines and Costa Rica have also reached agreements.
''We are certainly moving very nicely in a very good atmosphere toward an agreement,'' said one banker about the Venezuela negotiations. ''In the next couple of weeks we could be there.'' Like others commenting on the negotiations, he asked not to be identified.
Miguel Rodriguez, the Minister of Economic Development and head of the Venezuelan negotiating team, was in New York last week to meet with the banks' advisory committee, led by the Chase Manhattan Bank.
 
Several Options
In a final plan, a temporary debt-reduction provision would be one of several options. Bankers and officials said the plan also contains an option to buy back debt, with Venezuela purchasing some existing debt at a discount below the face value that would be based on bids from banks.
It also contains an option, comparable to one in the Mexican agreement, that would set a specific level of debt reduction. It was 35 percent in the Mexican plan.
In Venezuela's case, the banks would exchange existing debt for securities with a lower face value or a lower interest rate. These securities would come with guarantees that would cover the principal and interest payments. The money for these so-called enhancements would be provided by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other countries, probably including Japan.
There is still intense discussion over the temporary debt-reduction proposal, bankers and officials said. In debt terminology, the provision is called recapture. While there were recapture provisions in the Mexican agreement, bankers involved in both sets of talks said the banks were unlikely to regain anything under the Mexican agreement because they were not very stringent.
''They are looking for something better, but I don't know if they are going to get it,'' one Bush Administration official said.
 
Advantage of Temporary Cut
Several bankers said a temporary debt-reduction option would probably offer a larger cut in interest rates than a proposal in which the level of debt reduction is set by agreement.
Another issue is the contention of some bankers that regardless of the debt reduction and loan options agreed upon, there is also a need to redefine the terms and conditions of Venezuela's existing debt. Bankers will also want Venezuela to keep current on interest payments. It has begun to pay some interest on its existing debt, bankers said, but is still behind on a payment that was due at the beginning of the year.
Venezuela's new President, Carlos Andres Perez, said when he took office a year ago that he wanted a 50 percent reduction in the country's existing debt to commerical banks, but bankers refused, saying no debt reduction was justified. In September, Mr. Rodriquez, the lead negotiator, proposed an approach that included the current list of options and backed away from the 50 perecnt demand.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
A Freer, but Shrinking, Market

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUDAPEST, March 6

 BODY:
In Eastern Europe, Hungary is leading the way in shifting trade away from the Soviet Union and toward the West. The abrupt about-face has jolted many Hungarian companies that grew fat and happy relying on the huge Soviet market.
At Ikarus, one of the world's largest bus manufacturers, 11,000 workers are fuming over a Government order to cut exports to the Soviet Union by 1,000 buses this year. As a result, managers at Ikarus, where layoffs were long taboo, have for the first time announced a temporary ''forced holiday.'' More than 5,000 people have been idled for a month at the company's grimy jumble of hangar-like buildings.
Hungary is pressuring Ikarus and hundreds of other manufacturers, many of them state-owned, to export less to the Soviet Union. That is because Moscow still owes almost a billion rubles for all the buses, machinery and other Hungarian products it imported last year. 
 
Trade With West
Equally important, Hungary's Government wants to force the companies to sell more to Western Europe and the United States. This effort will push Hungary's inefficient enterprises to upgrade their products and production to Western standards. It will also provide the Government with much-needed hard currency -money like francs, marks and dollars that can be converted into other currencies - to make payments on its large foreign debt.
''This trade policy is part of the process of de-Sovietization,'' said Laszlo Lang, deputy director of the Hungarian Institute for Foreign Relations. ''We're seeing it not only in economics, but also in politics, defense and culture.''
Hungary's efforts to slash exports to the Soviet Union - whose appetite for imports is far larger than its ability to pay for them - are part of the huge economic changes sweeping through Eastern Europe as the region hurtles toward capitalism. Many economists predict that Czechoslovakia, Poland and other Eastern European nations will soon follow Hungary in pursuing a wrenching reorientation of their trade relations.
One of Hungary's aims is to reform or replace Comecon, the creaking Soviet-led trading group, with Western-style trading based on hard currency and world prices.
Such a move would at first be bitter medicine for Hungary. Its industry will be under severe pressure to become more competitive, because Comecon customers, long accustomed to barter trade, may decide that if they are paying hard currency, they might as well buy Western goods.
Some economists say a move toward hard-currency trading could cut trade among the Comecon countries by 50 percent and cause huge layoffs in many industries. At the same time, it could create huge opportunities for Western companies seeking to increase sales to Eastern Europe.
 
Bankruptcy Chain Feared
Industry is so rattled by the shock therapy that some economists fear a chain of bankruptcies, with Ikarus going under and pulling many of its suppliers down with it. Ikarus is widely viewed as the hardest-hit company because it historically exported more than 80 percent of its annual production of 12,000 buses to the Soviet bloc.
''We're in a difficult situation,'' said Zoltan Vadnai, the director of Ikarus's assembly plants. ''If Ikarus goes into the soup, all of Hungary is going to go with it.''
Some days Ikarus's management seems to spend more time lobbying Government officials for permission to export more to the Soviet Union than figuring out how to manage a scaled-down company. Last year, Ikarus exported 5,500 buses under an agreement between Budapest and Moscow. In January, the Trade Ministry reduced that to just 4,500 buses. Ikarus exported more than 3,000 buses last year to other Soviet bloc nations, but the Hungarian Government has ordered a freeze on exports to those nations. Another 1,000 buses went to the Soviet Union through barter agreements that Ikarus arranged itself.
''Things are very uncertain for us now,'' said Gyula Siska, a mechanic, as he labored on a red-and-white bus that had been destined for Czechoslovakia. Ikarus officials are now looking for another country to take these buses.
''Work is so slow nowadays that even those of us not on temporary layoff don't know how long we will be around,'' Mr. Siska said.
 
Better Buses for the West
The biggest shock has come at the assembly plant that makes buses destined for other Eastern European countries. There workers, many of them in their teens, toil at half speed on no-frills buses that use nongalvanized steel and low-horsepower engines based on 45-year-old designs.
Next door, at the plant for buses going to the West, the workers are older and more experienced. The buses are made with rust-resistant steel, often have powerful engines imported from the West, and are given a slick, shiny paint job that puts the Comecon buses to shame. The fully equipped versions for the West cost $150,000, more than five times what the Comecon buses go for.
Mr. Vadnai, the Ikarus manager, expects bus shipments to the East bloc to fall to about 6,000 this year from about 10,000 last year. By putting more energy in selling to the West, he expects hard-currency exports to double this year to about 2,000, which includes sales to Houston and Jacksonville, Fla.
But sales to the West will not come close to taking up the slack. ''It's not so easy to sell more buses to the West, which is already a very competitive market,'' said Mr. Vadnai. ''For us to concentrate on that market, someone would have to close down Mercedes-Benz and Daf,'' two of Western Europe's leading bus manufacturers.
Hungarian officials acknowledge that their tough policies will mean layoffs and other strains for a year or two, but they are confident their strategy will ultimately produce a more competitive, healthier economy. These officials have grown impatient with the Comecon system, which relies heavily on primitive barter. Not only that, they complain that Comecon's insular trading system promotes laxness by keeping inefficient companies alive as long as they feed the hungry Soviet market.
''The Soviet Union is much easier to sell to than any other market,'' said Sandor Richter, an economist and trade expert. ''Their technical requirements are much less than those of industrial nations. The Soviet Union buys a lot of goods that couldn't be sold elsewhere.''
 
Meaningless Trade Surplus
In 1989, Hungary ran up a trade surplus of 1.6 billion rubles with other Soviet bloc countries, but in the topsy-turvy world of Communist economics, a trade surplus is the last thing Government officials want. Under Comecon rules, a country with a surplus gets a i.o.u. that does not bear interest from its Socialist trading partners. So Hungary has received nothing in return for its surplus, which amounted to almost 3 percent of its economic output last year.
Hungarian officials have sought to reduce their trade reliance on the Soviet bloc, which takes about half of Hungary's exports, for three years, and in January, they stepped up their efforts. First, they froze all export licenses for the Soviet Union. Then they issued new permits, but at far lower levels than before. Machinery exports to the Soviet Union will be slashed by a third.
''A lot of people on the production line think what we are doing is madness,'' said Deputy Trade Minister Piroska Apro. ''But there is no other solution. We want to end this crazy system of barter within Comecon.''
Hungary is slashing exports to the Soviet Union because it is afraid of creating another huge trade surplus this year and wants Moscow to step up its exports to offset Hungary's 1989 trade surplus. The Soviet Union provides Hungary with oil, natural gas, chemicals, textiles and other raw materials, but Moscow's economic woes have caused its Comecon exports to dip.
Hungary is in a bind because the Soviet economic crisis has made it hard for Moscow to provide enough products for domestic consumers. Whatever products the Soviet Union can spare for export it would much prefer selling for hard currency than shipping to Hungary.
The Soviet Union and Hungary have agreed in principle that next year they will start carrying out their bilateral trade on a hard-currency basis at world prices. Surpluses at the end of the year would, in theory, be settled by a clearing in hard currency. This would replace a system using negotiated prices, unresolved surpluses and ''transfer rubles,'' a Comecon accounting unit.
Comecon's members are debating among themselves whether to follow Hungary's lead in moving toward hard-currency trade, something that would shake up all of Eastern Europe.
''The basic problem is that only part of the products exported to Comecon can be redirected to the West, the third world or the domestic market,'' said Bela Kadar, director of Hungary's Institute of Economic Planning. ''Many of these enterprises stuck to their comfortable market as long as they could.''
 
Marketing and Capital Needed
Now these enterprises need to learn to market to the West, and many of them will need Western capital, often through joint ventures, to upgrade their products and production.
But Mr. Vadnai, the Ikarus manager, and many Government officials say it is important not to shun the Soviet market. Mr. Vadnai said Ikarus has established a spare parts system, maintenance system and sales network throughout the Soviet Union, which gives his company a leg up on its competitors. ''We have the experience there, and if we start to ignore the market, then I'm sure Western companies will be eager to step in,'' he said.
Under the current trend, some experts say that Ikarus's annual production could fall to 6,000 buses within a few years and that its work force should be cut in half.
Still, the company has been reluctant to dismiss employees, trimming only 400 Polish and Czechoslovak guest workers. Ikarus officials say they hope the new Government that will be installed after elections later this month and next month will soften the hard-nosed policies.
In response, Mr. Apro, the Deputy Trade Minister, said, ''It's much easier for Ikarus's management to bring its demands to the Government than to put its own house in order.''

HEADLINE: Rostenkowski Presents Plan to Cut Deficit

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11

 BODY:
In what he described as a budget challenge to his own party and the Bush Administration, the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee today called for a combination of tax increases and spending cuts, including a one-year freeze on increases in Social Security benefits.
The chairman, Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, offered the proposals as a blueprint for reducing the Federal deficit by $511.6 billion over the next five years without what he called the ''smoke and mirrors'' and ''feel-good promises'' that have characterized past efforts at paring the deficit.
Mr. Rostenkowski's committee, one of the most powerful in the Congress, is responsible for writing tax legislation as well as for overseeing entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare.
 
Challenge Issued
''Here's my challenge: adopt my plan to fix the deficit or come up with a better one,'' he said in an opinion article published today in The Washington Post.
He elaborated on his views this morning in a television interview on the CBS News program ''Face The Nation,'' saying he expected ''a verbal hazing'' from Democrats and Republicans over his call for a one-year freeze in Social Security cost-of-living increases. 
Judging by the polite, noncommittal responses from other lawmakers and Administration officials, there was little immediate indication that Mr. Rostenkowski could succeed in altering either the terms or the substance of the debate of fiscal policy.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic majority leader who was in California this weekend, declined to comment. A spokesman for Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee, said the Senator would have no immediate comment.
In a statement, Representative Leon E. Panetta, the California Democrat who heads the House Budget Committee, said, ''It has always been clear that tough choices have to be made on defense, entitlements and taxes if we are going to confront the deficit head on.''
White House officials did not respond publicly.
 
Catalyst for Talks
Avoiding any pointed criticism of President Bush, whom he describes as a close friend, Mr. Rostenkowski made clear he would like his plan to be the catalyst for high-level budget negotiations between Congress and the White House.
His aides said he had discussed the general outlines of the plan last week with the White House chief of staff, John Sununu, and the director of the Office of Management and Budget, Richard G. Darman.
Efforts by Mr. Rostenkowski to broker a similarly broad tax and budget package last year ended in his embarrassment and political isolation.
Mindful of Walter F. Mondale's stinging defeat in the 1984 Presidential election, in which he bluntly called for tax increases, Mr. Rostenkowski has always insisted that any broad tax increase plan would have to be endorsed by the White House. The Ways and Means panel will not begin its tax deliberations for at least another two months, and aides to the chairman said that if the White House is unresponsive to Mr. Rostenkowski's plan, he would abandon it.
In addition to taking aim at the politically sensitive Social Security program, Mr. Rostenkowski's proposal categorically rejects the Social Security tax cut suggested by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, and the reduction of the capital gains tax sought by President Bush and supported by a majority of the members of Mr. Rostenkowski's committee.
Instead, he proposed raising taxes on tobacco, alcohol, gasoline and pollutants; raising the Federal income tax rate that the highest income earners pay 33 percent, from the current 28 percent; freezing spending on domestic programs at current levels for one year, except for programs that cover the poorest citizens; eliminating for one year the tax provisions that automatically adjust tax brackets for inflation, and cutting the military budget by 3 percent from this year's spending level.
 
Candidates for Increases
Mr. Rostenkowski's plan envisions doubling the current tax of 16 cents a pack on cigarettes and doubling the taxes on beer and wine. The last time beer and wine taxes were raised was 1951 and 1955, respectively. All three categories are regarded as prime candidates for higher taxes this year, regardless of the fate of Mr. Rostenkowski's proposal.
The proposed 3 percent reduction in military spending would cut $10 billion from the Pentagon budget in 1991 and $150 billion over five years. All these cuts, he said, should be used to reduce the deficit rather than to fund other programs.
Mr. Rostenkowski also called for repeal of the 1987 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing law.
''Gramm-Rudman is a crutch, a collective confession of our inability to lead and our unwillingness to face up to our responsibilities,'' he said in the article in The Washington Post. He added that his other proposals would cut the deficit to the point where the budget-balancing law would be irrelevant.
 
Detailed Tax Proposal
Although Mr. Rostenkowski has frequently spoken about the need for tax increases, the proposal he advanced today marks the first time he has laid out his views in so detailed and comprehensive a fashion.
While Mr. Rostenkowski's budget prescription draws on suggestions that have been advanced at various times by other lawmakers in both parties, it comes at a time when Democrats are deeply divided on how to respond politically or substantively to President Bush's unyielding opposition to tax increases and his go-slow approach to reductions in military spending.
Several major elements of his plan are at odds with the policy statements and proposals from other Democratic leaders, notably Mr. Gephardt and Mr. Bentsen.
Only last week, when asked by reporters whether the Democratic Party wanted to raise taxes, Mr. Gephardt replied: ''It is not the position of the Democratic Party to raise taxes.'' Mr. Bentsen has been urging a plan that would amount to a modest tax cut for middle-income taxpayers by expanding the limited deductions currently available for contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts.
But Mr. Rostenkowski's proposal rejects that approach as well as the Administration's variation on it, arguing that the measures are costly and unlikely to encourage more saving by Americans. Mr. Rostenkowski's long-held view that gasoline taxes should be increased has some support among Democrats and Republicans, but Mr. Bentsen, like most politicians from the Western and Southwestern states, is a vocal opponent.
 
Fairness of Tax Rates
The one element of the Rostenkowski blueprint that comes the closest to reflecting a consensus among Democrats is an effort to address the issue of tax fairness. In recent weeks, Congressional Democrats have produced a series of studies aimed at showing that tax changes over the last 15 years have resulted in a system that favors the wealthiest taxpayers.
Mr. Rostenkowski's proposal would address that issue in two ways: by raising the tax rate for the highest income earners and by allowing rebates on the gasoline tax for lower-income taxpayers.
Under an anomaly in the current tax system, people with taxable incomes of $47,050 to $109,00 and families with incomes of $78,400 to $185,730 pay a top tax rate of 33 percent. But taxpayers whose incomes exceed those amounts pay a top rate of 28 percent. Mr. Rostenkowski's plan would eliminate this so-called bubble in the tax code so that the top rate would be 33 percent for the wealthier as well.
When House Democratic leaders advanced a similar plan to change the top tax rate last year in an effort to counter Mr. Bush's capital gains tax cut proposal, they were deserted by 64 members of their party and suffered a humiliating defeat on the House floor. At that time, Mr. Rostenkowski was at best a lukewarm supporter of the leadership's proposal.
 
A Political Club
The last time that either party took a serious look at freezing cost-of-living adjustments in Social Security benefits was in 1982, when Senate Republicans got President Reagan to agree to it in principle as part of a broader deficit reduction package. But Democrats were quick to use the propsoal as a political club against Republicans, and Mr. Reagan altered his course.
Even suggesting a reduction in Social Security benefits has been virtually taboo ever since, although many lawmakers in both parties are willing to say privately that any serious proposal for dealing with the Federal defict must address the issue. Senator Moynihan said he would oppose a freeze on Social Security cost-of-living adjustments as a matter of principle, even though he agreed with many of the other suggestions in Mr. Rostenkowski's proposal.
''I think he's got a lot of votes in the cloakroom, and he would get a lot of votes on the floor if the Administration is willing to join him,'' Mr. Moynihan said of the overall plan.
But the Senator rejected Mr. Rostenkowski's contention that Democrats are engaged in a bidding war with Republicans over tax cuts by considering a reduction in Social Security payroll taxes. The problem both parties have on the question of Social Security, he said, is a failure to distinguish between general tax revenues and the money paid into the Social Security trust funds through worker and employer payroll contirbutions.
Mr. Moynihan has argued that the current surplus in the Social Security trust funds, intended to finance the benefits of the baby boom generation that will reach retirement age early in the next century, is instead improperly being used to help offset the current Federal budget deficit. As a result, he has urged that Social Security payroll taxes be reduced.

HEADLINE: Business Scene;
High Technology In Plants Abroad

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
WITH an energy not seen since the heyday of the multinationals 20 years ago, American companies are building factories overseas, buying companies and getting into all sorts of joint ventures. But while they expand their production abroad, they are somehow managing to do it without hiring a lot of foreign workers.
The hiring hold-down is a badge of the new global corporation, and a revealing one. Hiring is not robust because the overseas plants are increasingly as high-tech, automated and labor-saving as those back home. And the mix of what American companies own abroad is changing. They are losing interest in the labor-intensive ventures that were past favorites, among them the manufacture of clothing and other consumer products now purchased increasingly from foreign suppliers. 
The shift to high-tech production has shown up vividly in Mexico, where General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler - and also Nissan and Volkswagen - have built state-of-the-art auto engine plants since 1985, staffing them with people drawn from that country's plentiful supply of labor. ''In two or three years, these workers have achieved U.S. quality and productivity levels at less than $3 an hour,'' said Rudiger Dornbusch, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The success of these ventures is helping to erode the old idea that the big industrial powers have a corner on high-tech, state-of-the-art production because only their technicians and workers have the necessary skills. True, the auto-engine technology comes from the industrial world, but the combination of foreign capital and efficient, inexpensive Mexican workers is making that country a big producer of the engines. ''What we are looking at here is offshore automation by American companies, and not the return of sophisticated production to the United States,'' said Harley Shaiken, an economist at the University of California at San Diego.
Perhaps no company illustrates better than General Electric the phenomenon of booming investments abroad carried out with a shrinking work force. G.E. is spending huge amounts to build plastics factories in Japan, Singapore, Spain and South Korea. A stove factory is earmarked for Mexico and G.E. has purchased control of a Hungarian light bulb company.
But with all this activity, G.E.'s employment abroad dropped to 49,000 last year (including 500 Americans), from more than 60,000 in 1984. The reason is plain: G.E. has shed two labor-intensive operations. Utah International, an overseas mining subsidiary, was sold in 1984 and G.E.'s consumer-electronics division was purchased by Thomson S.A., a French company, in 1987.
In partial payment from Thomson, G.E. received a company that makes high-tech medical diagnostic equipment, but with far fewer workers than the old electronics factories it used to own. While the new plastics factories are beginning to add workers to G.E.'s overseas payroll, these modern operations are not big users of labor. And the work force at the Hungarian light bulb company, acquired this year, is to be shrunk. ''Our foreign investment today is more sophisticated,'' said Walter Joelson, G.E.'s chief economist.
The activity of American corporations abroad is not well documented. The Commerce Department collects data on investment and employment, but with a two-year lag. The latest numbers, for 1987, show that while net investment has been rising since 1985, employment overseas declined through the 1980's to 6.2 million in 1987. The figures cover operations in which an American company had at least a 10 percent stake. Two-thirds of the employment was in Europe, Canada, Japan and Australia. But Mexico, Brazil and the Far East accounted for more than a million of the workers, demonstrating the enduring allure of low wages.
Almost certainly, the 1988 and 1989 numbers will show an upturn in employment, one that reflects the robust overseas investment reported in the last two years by numerous executives and business organizations. The Conference Board, for example, last week released the results of a survey of 1,000 American manufacturers. It showed 217 new investments overseas in 1989, a rise of 20 percent from 1988. Most were in Western Europe.
The global company, however, is not likely to be a big generator of jobs, whether it is an American corporation expanding abroad or the British and Japanese setting up in the United States. But small as the job pie might turn out to be, the American worker appears to be getting a share. Foreign companies operating in the United States employed 3.1 million people in 1987, nearly 3 percent of the American work force. That was a 30 percent rise from the 2.4 million in 1982, and the figures for 1988 and 1989 are likely to show similar increases.

HEADLINE: Trade Negotiations Create an Uproar in Japan

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 11

 BODY:
The proper number of knotholes in a sheet of plywood does not constitute anyone's definition of subject matter fit for review by the leaders of Japan and the United States.
But a flood of questions about how specifically Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and President Bush discussed trade problems at their meeting earlier this month has created a furor in Japan's Parliament and underscored the sensitivity of trade talks between Tokyo and Washington.
''This is an extremely trivial matter, and we would prefer to see the focus placed elsewhere,'' said an American official, referring to the latest trade controversy between the countries. A Japanese official echoed the view that the commotion was ''ridiculous.'' 
 
What the President Said
Knotholes were apparently not discussed at the meeting between Mr. Bush and Mr. Kaifu in Palm Springs, Calif., although they have been a matter of contention in some trade talks between the United States and Canada, as well as talks with Japan. Washington has argued that these nations place limits on the size of knotholes in plywood in a way that discriminates against American goods.
Mr. Bush did say afterward that he pressed the Prime Minister to have Japan import more forestry products.
In a speech on Wednesday, the President also said he had pressed for more imports of satellites, supercomputers, semiconductors and telecommunications products, which like forestry products are the focus of American threats to retaliate if Japan is not more forthcoming.
By mentioning these items, however, Mr. Bush was seen here as having violated what Japanese officials say is an unwritten rule of meetings between heads of state. Nobody denies that American pressure is important to get Japan to change its ways, but it is considered impolite to say so publicly.
Trade disputes are at the heart of growing tensions between the two economic superpowers. But the Japanese sensitivity also reflected the view that it would have been demeaning for Mr. Kaifu to agree to take action on any particular demands by Mr. Bush.
 
Carrying Out the Ritual
The ritual of trade negotiations is such, Japanese officials say, that if Mr. Kaifu had been specific about what steps Japan might take, he would be seen as catering to his patron in Washington and would not be able to carry anything out.
By the end of this week, the trade talks between Washington and Tokyo had thus become overshadowed by a sudden rush of statements, denials and clarifications from Japan's Foreign Ministry, the Prime Minister's office and the White House, all to carry out the ritual.
When Mr. Kaifu returned from the Palm Springs meeting last Sunday, he was asked in the Parliament if he had responded positively to any specific demands by Mr. Bush that Japan make structural changes that would open Japan up to more American imports. He said no.
Then it was reported in the United States that Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, had said that Mr. Bush had pressed the Prime Minister to increase spending on public works, eliminate anticompetitive business practices and make it easier for big discount stores to flourish in Japan.
 
'Forcefully Tackle' Problems
Mr. Kaifu's office then said that even if Mr. Bush had raised these matters, Mr. Kaifu did not respond except to say, in a general way, that Japan would ''forcefully tackle'' these problems.
This assertion quieted protests from the opposition in Parliament.
But then came reports of a speech by Mr. Bush, asserting that he and the Japanese Prime Minister had specifically discussed American efforts to increase exports of forestry products and other items.
The Bush speech brought yet another clarification by Misoji Sakamoto, the chief Cabinet secretary. Even though these items were mentioned, he said, they were not elaborated on. He added that no commitment had been made beyond an agreement by both countries to ''do their utmost'' to solve their problems.
Michael H. Armacost, the United States Ambassador in Tokyo, who was with Mr. Bush and Mr. Kaifu in Palm Springs, then stepped in, directing the American Embassy here to issue a clarification. It said the President ''did not raise any specific structual issues'' in the meetings.

HEADLINE: Ortega Sees Quayle and Reaffirms A Transfer of Power in Nicaragua

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile, March 12

 BODY:
Backing away from an earlier threat, President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua assured Vice President Dan Quayle today that he would surrender control of the military and the security police to the new Nicaraguan government next month.
Mr. Ortega and Mr. Quayle talked for more than 90 minutes during a lunch in La Moneda, the presidential palace in Santiago. The meeting was the highest-level Nicaraguan-American contact in a decade. Mr. Ortega, in remarks to reporters after the session, said, ''I guaranteed to him that the process of the transfer of power was going to take place with the utmost normality.''
 
Disbanding of Rebels Preferred
Mr. Ortega said ''the best thing for that purpose would be that the contras cease to exist by April 25,'' when he and the governing Sandinista Front are scheduled to hand over power to an opposition coalition led by Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. 
But he also said that the transition ''will go forward with or without the contras.'' He said there are ''no conditions'' attached to the transfer of power. [Administration officials in Washington said President Bush would ask Congress for $300 million in special aid to Nicaragua. Page A7.] Mr. Ortega's comments were in contrast to recent statements by Sandinista leaders demanding continued control of Nicaragua's 65,000-member army and security forces and warning that armed citizens might rise up if the contras were not demobilized. Negotiating Tactic? Those statements, in a speech to supporters in Managua last Thursday night, were interpreted by many diplomats as an attempt to gain leverage in negotiations over the transfer of power. Mr. Ortega said that Nicaragua was experiencing ''the calm before a storm'' and warned that he could not guarantee a peaceful exchange of power if the contra army remained intact.
Such statements were combined with Sandinista-sponsored legislation that would protect departing officials from prosecution and give away large amounts of state property before the turnover of power on April 25. They were also backed by the widespread distribution of automatic weapons to Sandinista supporters.
International and diplomatic criticism of such steps apparently encouraged Mr. Ortega to moderate his stand just before his departure from Nicaragua on Saturday, when he delivered a conciliatory message promising that the transition of power would be peaceful.
Administration officials said that in his remarks today, Mr. Ortega was emphatic that the transfer of power would be peaceful.
''He guaranteed me two things,'' Mr. Quayle told reporters before he left Santiago for Asuncion, Paraguay. ''One, on April 25, he will turn over his presidency to Violeta Chamorro, and two, he guaranteed to me that Violeta Chamorro will appoint all of the ministries, including the Defense Ministry and the Interior Ministry.''
 
What U.S. Wants
The United States has been seeking guarantees that the Sandinistas would turn over these ministries, which control the army and the police.
Administration officials said Mr. Ortega also expressed a willingness to accept an American plan to use United Nations peacekeeping forces to insure the security of the contras when they disband and to keep track of the government transition in Nicaragua.
Asked if he accepted Mr. Ortega's promises, Mr. Quayle said, ''We're going to work with him and others to make this happen. I believe it will happen.''
But officials with Mr. Quayle cautioned that some negotiations remain to be concluded, and said the transition could not be conducted on Mr. Ortega's guarantees alone.
Administration officials said Mr. Ortega asked Mr. Quayle to lift all the economic sanctions imposed against his country. They said Mr. Quayle replied that Mrs. Chamorro had already made such a request and ''it was being actively considered.''
 
Quayle's Journey
Mr. Quayle, in the midst of a weeklong swing through Latin America, met with Mr. Ortega three times today. In the first encounter this morning, they shook hands and chatted briefly before a service at the Metropolitan Cathedral. Mr. Quayle said he ''congratulated him for the way he has conducted himself, especially his statement that democracy has won and will be implemented in Nicaragua.''
A second, 10-minute meeting took place at the Chilean presidential palace, where the new President, Patricio Aylwin, was host at a lunch for visiting officials.
Administration officials said that in that encounter, Mr. Quayle complained about what he said were military attacks on rebel units and ''intimidation'' of supporters of Mrs. Chamorro by pro-Sandinista mobs, and he pressed Mr. Ortega to accept international monitoring and guarantees of the transfer of power in Nicaragua, they said.
The officials also said Mr. Quayle assured Mr. Ortega that the United States was ''willing to work on a process'' that would lead to dismantling the contra army, and they described the meeting as ''quite cordial.'' One official said the two men ''expressed their common goal as well-being and a democracy in Nicaragua.''
 
Closer Proximity
The third, 90-minute meeting came during lunch, after Mr. Ortega persuaded President Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica to change seats so that he could sit next to Mr. Quayle.
That Mr. Quayle held the meeting with Mr. Ortega reflected both the inevitable shift in Washington's policy after the Sandinista Front's loss in the Feb. 25 elections and the urgency Mr. Bush has assigned to the effort to arrange a peaceful transition of power.
The issue dominated Mr. Quayle's meeting in Macuto, Venezuela, on Friday with President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela and Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain, both of whom have sought to act as coordinators of the international effort to arrange the Nicaraguan transition.
Mr. Ortega flew to Chile on Sunday night with Mr. Gonzalez, Mr. Perez, Mr. Arias and President Rafael Leonardo Callejas of Honduras. Mr. Arias said today that the leaders had agreed to hold a meeting of Central American officials on March 30 and 31 to discuss the transition. Both Mr. Ortega and Mrs. Chamorro would be invited, he said.
 
MRS. CHAMORRO IN TEXAS
 HOUSTON, March 12 (AP) -Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the Nicaraguan President-elect, has returned to Houston for the removal of a brace from her knee.
She fell and broke her kneecap on New Year's Eve and underwent surgery in Houston on Jan. 4. She returned to Nicaragua on Jan. 16 and campaigned on crutches in the successful effort to defeat the Sandinistas.
Last Thursday, she came back to Houston, and an orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Malcolm W. Granberry, removed her brace on Friday.

HEADLINE: White House Sees 'Room to Talk' In Democrat's Plan on the Deficit

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12

 BODY:
The Bush Administration signaled interest today in Representative Dan Rostenkowski's plan to raise certain taxes and freeze domestic spending, while Democratic colleagues of the House Ways and Means Committee chairman responded with far more caution.
The reactions underscored the political maneuvering set off by Mr. Rostenkowski's exhortation to both parties to get serious about reducing the Federal budget deficit. On Sunday, Mr. Rostenkowski had outlined a package intended to reduce the deficit by more than $500 billion over five years and establish a basis for negotiations between Congress and the Administration.
The White House moved quickly to project an appearance of reasonableness while affirming - in more polite language than usual - President Bush's opposition to tax increases. But Democratic leaders were holding back, in part out of fear that the White House might be preparing a trap that would leave them in the position of calling for unpopular tax increases and cuts in Social Security benefits. 
It was clear that with his plan Mr. Rostenkowski had upstaged the House and Senate Budget Committee chairmen and the Democratic leadership. And compared with the cautious reaction of many Democrats, the cordial response of the Bush Administration appeared almost enthusiastic.
The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, told reporters: ''We think there's some room to talk. We don't want to pour cold water on a plan we may want to swim around in for a while.''
Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, praised the plan as ''courageous and serious,'' pointedly saying it was the first the Administration had seen from Congressional Democrats that it considered worthy of discussion.
''We've said all along that we were prepared to discuss any reasonable proposal on its merits,'' Mr. Darman said in an interview on public television's ''MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour.''
But Mr. Darman acknowledged that the Administration opposed the two key elements of the plan by the House Ways and Means Committee chairman: the tax increases and a one-year freeze on cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security recipients.
''We do have some very fundamental objections to parts of it,'' Mr. Darman said.
The proposal is to increase excise taxes on gasoline, alcohol and tobacco and to raise the income tax rate of the wealthiest taxpayers to 33 percent, from 28 percent, while freezing all Federal spending for a year and cutting military spending by $150 billion over five years.
The House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washington, called Mr. Rostenkowski's plan ''a very interesting suggestion,'' but repeated his longstanding view that tax increases had little chance of approval without President Bush's support. While Mr. Darman offered nothing to suggest that the President had altered his opposition to tax increases, the budget director's comments on the tax issue were considerably less strident than those generally offered by Administration officials.
''We think the whole reason to get into deficit reduction is to enhance economic growth, not to have tax increases that hinder it,'' he said. Mr. Rostenkowski's plan would result in a $30 billion increase in taxes for the 1991 fiscal year, he said, and ''we think that's too heavy.''
The Democratic leadership seemed wary of embracing either the Rostenkowski plan or the immediate possibility of budget talks with the Administration. Rank-and-file Democrats avoided endorsing any of the specifics in the plan, and House Democrats were especially cautious.
President Bush has repeatedly said he opposes any tax increases, and Mr. Fitzwater insisted that the Administration's willingness to discuss Mr. Rostenkowski's plan did not indicate a change in that position.
''I'm not signaling any action on our part, except to say this gives us a basis for discussion,'' Mr. Fitzwater said. He added, ''Once you get into specifics, we're going to be negative.''
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader and a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, said he was also willing to explore the issues outlined by Mr. Rostenkowski in an article on the Op-Ed page of the Washington Post. Mr. Dole had previously endorsed an increase in gasoline taxes if the revenues were earmarked for highway and bridge repair.
He praised the Ways and Means chairman in particular for urging that any ''peace dividend'' achieved from cuts in military spending be used to reduce the budget deficit rather than pay for new programs.
''His proposal could be the wake-up call we've been waiting for,'' Mr. Dole said. ''We'll see who answers it.'' He pointedly noted the lack of enthusiasm from Democratic Congressional leaders.
Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas who heads the Senate Finance Committee, who is traveling on the West Coast, issued a statement praising Mr. Rostenkowski for demonstrating leadership. Mr. Benstsen called the proposal ''a good starting point'' for debate on reducing the deficit and said he was willing to give Mr. Rostenkowski's ideas ''my full attention.''
''It's sort of like, 'Let a hundred flowers bloom,' '' said one House Democratic aide, who described the Rostenkowski plan as simply one element to be considered as the party struggles to reach a consensus this year on tax and budget policy.
 
Seeking Response to Moynihan
 Democratic leaders in both houses have been trying for more than a month to develop a unified response to a proposal by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, for a cut in Social Security taxes.
Representative Charles E. Schumer, the Brooklyn Democrat who serves on the House Budget Committee, noted that many Democrats were uneasy about any budget negotiations with the Administration. ''The White House will let us walk out on this plank only to saw it off at an opportune moment,'' he said.
Despite the restrained reactions of Mr. Rostenkowski's colleagues, tobacco, liquor and trucking lobbies are taking the committee chairman's proposals for higher excise taxes seriously and are preparing campaigns to oppose any increases. The Ways and Means Committee is expected to begin its deliberations on a tax bill in May.

HEADLINE: The Big Bailout
A special report.;
U.S. HAS TROUBLE COPING WITH ITS SAVINGS EMPIRE

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12

 BODY:
Seven months after President Bush signed into law the largest Federal bailout in history, savings and loan regulators are mired in bureaucratic bickering and frustrated by their inability to sell off hundreds of sick savings institutions quickly.
With few buyers stepping forward, private analysts now say the cost of rescuing the industry's problem institutions could exceed $200 billion over 10 years, far higher than originally projected. And for the short run, the Congressional Budget Office said last week that in the next two or three years alone, the cost of the bailout could rise $25 billion to $30 billion over the $50 billion anticipated earlier.
 
The Failures Continue
The costly, slow-moving Federal rescue package could prove a political liability for the Bush Administration. Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader, warned today that his party could face a political backlash unless work was speeded up on the savings bailout. ''This thing could be an albatross in 1992, which happens to be an election year,'' Mr. Dole said. 
Hundreds of savings and loans ran into trouble after Federal regulations were relaxed in the 1980's. They plunged into a wide range of speculative investments, ranging from real estate ventures to ''junk bonds.''
The bailout legislation assumed that the Government would end up taking over about 400 institutions. But more continue to fail, and regulators fear that the number could go as high as 800 institutions, with almost one-third of the assets in the industry. All these institutions are expected to become insolvent by mid-1992; they will have to be liquidated or sold to investors.
Accordingly, some banking experts predict that what began as a Federal rescue could turn into a de facto nationalization of a large segment of the savings industry, with the Government having to run hundreds of hobbled institutions for years to come.
The cost of the bailout to the American public was initially put at $159 billion over 10 years. But the total rises by almost $12 million a day, or more than $4 billion a year, as troubled savings institutions that have not been closed continue to lose money.
''The United States Government is now the single largest operator of financial institutions, dwarfing Citibank, and yet we are doing little more than marking time,'' said Richard Pratt, a former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and now chairman of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
Few dispute the difficulty of the task. The Resolution Trust Corporation, established by the law to manage the bailout, could eventually bring under its control institutions with assets of more than $450 billion, an amount that exceeds the largest banking company in the world, the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Tokyo, which just surpassed $400 billion in assets at the end of last year. A large portion of the assets controlled by the Government are loans that are not being paid back. In addition almost all of the institutions that have been seized are involved in an array of lawsuits.
This empire will make the trust corporation the largest financial institution in the world, the largest single owner of real estate, the largest liquidation company and the largest auction firm.
 
Criticism And Praise
 While President Bush was widely praised for tackling the savings industry's problems as soon as he took office, Democrats and even some Republicans are now taking the Administration to task.
They complain that Treasury officials have unduly meddled with the trust corporation while the White House has looked the other way, and they say such interference has prompted the resignation of key administrators of the bailout.
''President Bush's great promises are drowning in a sea of indecision, inaction and infighting,'' said Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the House Banking Committee.
But not everyone is so gloomy in assessing the trust corporation and its Oversight Board.
''I think they deserve a break; they have not been doing that horribly,'' said Preston Martin, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and chairman of WSGP Financial Management Inc. in San Francisco, which runs a number of savings institutions with assets of $10.3 billion. ''They have a huge task that will take time to get running smoothly.''
In Congressional testimony last month, L. William Seidman, chairman of both the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the trust corporation, acknowledged that he was getting defensive.
Mr. Seidman presented the lawmakers with a list of accomplishments: The agency has hired 2,300 people, established four regional offices, developed a strategic plan as well as bidding guidelines, initiated the sale of 60 institutions, and published an inventory of 30,000 properties for sale.
The agency's supporters, including Mr. Martin, say the trust corporation has made considerable progress since it came into existence in September. As of late last week, it had taken over 393 sick savings associations with assets of $193 billion. Of that number it has liquidated or sold to private investors 51.
 
Restrictions In the Law
 Among the greatest hurdles, the regulators have found, are the provisions in the bailout legislation that greatly restrict investment opportunities for potential buyers while increasing the underlying costs of running an institution - even though these measures were intended to curb the freewheeling business practices that contributed to the industry's troubles.
The law requires savings institutions to have at least 70 percent of their assets in mortgage-related loans, up from 60 percent. Another provision restricts institutions from entering the real estate development business and bars them entirely from holding ''junk bonds.''
But many investors contend that it is getting harder and harder to make money in mortgage lending, unless an institution is very large and has vast economies of scale. And they complain that higher deposit insurance premiums and capital requirements have discouraged them.
As a result, few institutions other than banks, which are interested in the branch networks of defunct institutions, have been willing to buy from the Resolution Trust Corporation.
''The bailout so changed the rules of the game that it cut deeply into the future profitability,'' said Jamie Jackson, president of Oak Tree Capital, a real estate investment banking firm in Washington. ''This certainly changed the opinion of investors.''
 
Conflicts In the Bureaucracy
 Frictions within the bureaucracy were considered inevitable when the Bush Administration insisted that it have the ultimate responsibility for the spending of billions of dollars in taxpayers' money. But the frictions have been greater than expected.
The White House insisted that Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady head the Oversight Board that was created to manage the trust corporation. The top administrators of the board found they had to clear policies and actions with the Treasury, and tensions developed over delays in getting policies approved by the Treasury, which was worried about potential criticism if the approach was too favorable to investors.
Investors note that those tensions seem to have come to the surface in the difficulty the agencies have had in formulating rules for bidding.
At first, the Oversight Board required that anyone seeking financing from the Government to buy property put up 25 percent of the purchase value in cash. Then after a multitude of complaints it has begun liberalizing many policies. For example, the cash requirement for financing was reduced to 15 percent recently.
And on several occasions, the board put ailing institutions up for bids, then pulled them off the market at the last minute. The board took that step because it expected to change the bidding rules and also feared a shortage of bidders.
But its decision angered some would-be buyers who had already spent time and money.
''We had people with airline tickets, hotel reservations, who at that last moment had to call it off,'' said Robert S. Boyd of the Secura Group, referring to a recent bidders conference called off at the last minute.
Insiders say that when Daniel P. Kearney resigned on Feb. 9 as president of the Oversight Board, he blamed the Treasury for ''micromanaging'' the board. Publicly Mr. Kearney has said he did not have sufficient authority at the agency.
Soon after, two senior aides to Mr. Kearney also left.
''The organizational chart speaks for itself,'' said Fred Alt, Mr. Kearney's deputy and one of the aides who left. ''Anything with that many parties involved is extremely difficult for people to work with.''
The organizational problems have made it hard for the Bush Administration to fill key posts. Two remain vacant on the Overight Board.
And only late last week, more than three months after M. Danny Wall announced that he would step down as director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, the nation's top savings and loan regulator, did the Treasury come up with his replacement. He is T. Timothy Ryan Jr., a Washington lawyer who was a counsel to the Bush for President committee. He has no formal training in banking and the savings industry but is regarded as a strong manager and tough enforcer.
Mr. Ryan's selection is a sign that the Administration could not persuaded a well-known figure in the savings or banking industries to take the post.
Until Mr. Ryan is confirmed by the Senate, Salvatore R. Martoche, the former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for enforcement, is running the savings office.
 
Faith That The System Works
 But some banking lawyers and experts, though still a minority, believe that the situation could turn around soon. The Treasury seems to have backed off somewhat, allowing Mr. Kearney's temporary replacement, William Taylor, the Federal Reserve Board's director of banking regulation, more autonomy.
Less intervention by the Treasury is also likely to make for a smoother relationship between Mr. Taylor and Mr. Seidman. If they work well together, the bailout will have a better chance of success.
Last last month, the Oversight Board also extended the time during which a buyer can return assets it deems worthless to the Government to one year, from six months. And besides reducing the 25 percent cash requirement, the board is considering several other measures to make sick savings institutions more attractive.
''Over time the R.T.C. will probably work itself out,'' said Gerald P. Carmen, the former head of the Federal Asset Disposition Association, which managed troubled savings institutions' assets for the Government before the bailout. ''The public tends to look at the short term, and in that sense we haven't done very well. But from my government experience, somehow over a 10-year period, bureaucracies muddle through and get the job done.'' But he added, ''The costs are still enormous.''

HEADLINE: No Matter How You Measure It, We're Not Saving Enough

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Though right in some particulars, Prof. Robert Eisner's ''Low U.S. Saving Rate: A Myth'' (Op-Ed, March 1) is mischievously misleading.
Professor Eisner is right when he says that many kinds of public spending in the United States that the statistics treat as consumption (for example, spending on infrastructure, education, and research and development) will increase the future productive capacity of the economy and should therefore be counted as investment. He is also right that, so adjusted, the net national saving rate turns out somewhat higher than appears from the conventional figures. 
What he fails to say, however, is that no matter what reasonable measure one uses, the share of net national saving in gross national product between 1982 and 1989 has been a fraction of what it was from 1950 to 1979. Taken together, personal and public consumption, and the replacement investment needed to offset depreciation have absorbed a much larger share of G.N.P. recently than in the past.
Professor Eisner says that it is not surprising that ''Rapidly growing nations have to save more.'' But that is just the point. To make real potential national income (and thus our stagnant real wages) grow faster - indeed to avoid risking a further slowdown -we must sharply increase national saving - the combined total of private saving and Government saving. The only reliable method for doing that is to increase Federal Government saving. That means gradually shifting the Government's structural operating budget - what the budget would be at high employment, including Social Security, but excluding Federal civilian investment - from a large deficit to a large surplus.
Professor Eisner is right that, by itself, tightening the budget would mainly reduce personal consumption and Government purchases, thus freeing resources: labor and plant capacity. Drawing those resources into producing investment goods and exports - and that is the objective -would require timely Federal Reserve action to drive down interest rates and more public investment.
But at least in an economy that is operating near its inflation-safe capacity - and barring a large spontaneous increase in private saving -tightening the Government's operating budget is a necessary though not sufficient action. If, that is, we want to restore public and private investment.

HEADLINE: Fighting the Deficit Too Bravely

 BODY:
''I've participated in the binge of irresponsibility,'' says Representative Dan Rostenkowski. ''But, no more,'' vows the blunt chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Writing in The Washington Post, Mr. Rostenkowski outlines a bold plan to attack the Federal budget deficit with a combination of new taxes and spending cuts. 
The plan, which includes unpopular measures like suspending next year's Social Security raise, deserves high marks for honesty and courage. He has even prompted a glimmer of interest from the White House. The chairman is right to offer a responsible attack on the deficit, especially with two irresponsible tax cut plans hurtling down the Congressional railroad track.
But in execution, the Rostenkowski plan risks causing more pain than it would relieve. It contains good ideas, but also bad and unnecessary ones.
Huge Federal deficits siphon money out of private capital markets. The threat is a long-term erosion of the nation's capital stock. The solution is for Congress to stop spending more than it collects in taxes. Resolving this imbalance requires permanent changes, not merely one-shot tax hikes and spending cuts. Mr. Rostenkowski's plan turns on some of both:
The Good: The proposed permanent tax hikes on gasoline, alcohol and tobacco are sound. These would raise tens of billions each year while helping to clean up the environment and lower health-care costs. These changes should be part of any long-term budget plan. The Bad: The core of the Rostenkowski plan is a package of one-year fixes. He proposes, for instance, to freeze spending that is not targeted on the poor and to suspend indexation of the tax code. These changes will cause pain, despite his commendable proposal to expand the earned income tax credit that benefits the working poor. The elderly would lose some Social Security benefits; low-income families would pay more tax.
And Mr. Rostenkowski's plan would renege on commitments made during reform of the tax code and Social Security. Breaking commitments could be justified in times of severe crisis. But the deficit presents no such short-term threat.
Mr. Rostenkowski recommends repeal of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit targets because, he argues, they would be superfluous under his plan. Not true. Without those targets, Congress would be free to offset his measures with a new round of tax cuts and spending hikes. Gramm-Rudman remains a regrettable but useful straitjacket.
The Unnecessary: Deficit reduction is one, but only one, way to promote economic growth. Investment in the nation's disadvantaged children and dilapidated infrastructure is at least as important. The deficit needs to be reduced substantially, but how much should depend on case-by-case evaluation of public investments.
Mr. Rostenkowski challenges his colleagues to adopt his plan or improve on it. It's a welcome challenge to those attracted by reckless reductions in the Social Security tax or in the capital gains tax rate. The test now is whether Washington can turn his one-shot fixes into permanent remedies.

HEADLINE: Replacement Workers: Management's Big Gun

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12

 BODY:
To keep operating in a strike, more and more companies have been deploying a weapon they long shunned -hiring permanent replacements for workers who are on the picket lines.
When 6,300 drivers for the Greyhound Corporation abandoned their buses 10 days ago, management had 700 new recruits on hand to drive its fleet and 900 more in training. Thousands of new pilots, mechanics and flight attendants who have been assured careers with Eastern are keeping the airline aloft. And long after the end of the strikes in which they were hired, thousands of new workers remain on the job at the International Paper Company, the Boise Cascade Corporation, the Phelps Dodge Corporation and at Continental Airlines. 
The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations has made prohibition of replacement workers its No. 1 labor law goal this year. But legislation in Congress prohibiting such workers, introduced last month by Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum of Ohio and Representative William L. Clay of Missouri, both Democrats, faces tough going and a probable veto by President Bush if Congress should pass the bills.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has agreed to decide a case that could strengthen management's hand in using replacement workers to thwart unions. The case involves a request by a small company in Texas that the National Labor Relations Board presume that permanent replacement workers oppose unions, thus expediting the company's effort to banish the union.
 
'The Balance Has Shifted'
Labor experts maintain that management's wide use of permanent replacements has upset the symmetry that has been a tradition of labor disputes. On the one hand, management has said it has a right to lock workers out at the risk of losing profits; on the other, labor has said it can withhold its services at the risk of losing income.
''The balance has shifted,'' said Mark A. de Bernardo, director of the Labor Law Action Center at the United States Chamber of Commerce here. ''Labor's trump card in a dispute, the strike, is no longer trump.''
Robert M. Baptiste, a Washington attorney for labor unions, said that in a strike ''there was always a sense that people would eventually say, 'Enough, let's sit down and get serious.' '' But he added, ''Now, companies just want to get rid of unions.''
One reason that companies now think that goal is possible is the lesson they drew from the illegal strike of 11,500 Federal air traffic controllers in August 1981, seven months into Ronald Reagan's first term as President. After the controllers defied a back-to-work order, Mr. Reagan dismissed them, filled their ranks with permanent replacements, and the union collapsed.
 
'A Signal to Other Employers'
The Government's success in keeping the air traffic system working impressed many unionized companies.''Reagan made it respectable to bust unions,'' Mr. Baptiste said.
Gary Burtless, a labor economist at the Brookings Institution, said Mr. Reagan emboldened management to risk the strain to its business of taking on less experienced workers. ''The fact that the President was able to keep the air traffic system going indicated that there was a lot more scope for replacing workers than people imagined,'' Mr. Burtless said. ''If you can replace air traffic controllers you can certainly replace bus drivers.''
The permanent replacements, often recruited from the ranks of the unemployed or from low-paid employees of other businesses, are a variation on the temporary substitutes vilified by trade unionists as ''scabs'' or ''strikebreakers'' but nevertheless regarded as a part of management's legitimate arsenal. Temporary replacements leave at the end of a strike, but permanent replacements are assured the strikers' jobs. After a strike, the law allows strikers first claim on their old jobs, but only if replacements vacate them.
 
Risk of Permanent Replacements
Many companies still shun permanent replacements, in part because they run some risk in using them. Even if they decide they can get by without the expertise of skilled workers, companies must weigh the potential costs of incurring the wrath of workers who are not involved in the strike and of losing customers because of consumer doubts about the quality of the service provided by replacement workers.
This change in management's attitude has occurred along with a change in workers' loyalties, both to their unions and to their companies, which makes it harder for unions to sustain strikes and easier for management to persuade workers to move into the strikers' jobs.
Workers no longer think unions can deliver the gains in wages and benefits that made blue-collar members the world's best paid workers. For several years, union workers in private industry have been winning smaller wage increases than nonunion workers, and trade union membership as a part of the national work force has declined from 30 percent in the 1970's to 16.4 percent in 1989.
And for all that attention that recent strikes at companies like Greyhound, Eastern, the Pittston Coal Group Inc., Boeing and the Nynex Corporation have received, unions are increasingly wary of using their ultimate weapon, the strike, and risking both their members' jobs and the embarrassment of failing to win concessions from management. In the 1970's the Bureau of Labor Statistics recorded an average of 289 strikes a year involving 1,000 or more workers. In the last five years the average was 52.
 
The Seeds of Acrimony
Furthermore, some companies have found it easier than they expected to find replacement workers.
That is what happened in an especially vitriolic strike in 1987 and 1988 involving three International Paper mills in Jay, Me. The company proposed eliminating premium pay for work on Sundays and holidays, and the paperworkers union walked out. The company started bringing in permanent replacements just 13 days later, planting the seeds of acrimony that local officials say will persist for years.
''It's something you do only as a last resort,'' said James W. Gilliland, the company's director of employee relations. ''It's not fun for anybody.''
In Jay, he said, the company has reduced its work force from 1,250 to 1,062, and 80 percent of the employees are permanent replacements. They started at $9 to $10 an hour, about $4 less than the strikers, Mr. Gilliland said, and premium pay was abolished.
Once the company decided to proceed, Mr. Gilliland said it found a surprisingly large pool of candidates for the strikers' jobs despite the nation's relatively low unemployment rate.
''As more and more young people have entered the labor market, they have found fewer and fewer high-paying industrial jobs,'' he said. ''So when an industrial company enters the market to hire permanent replacements, it has no trouble whatever.''

HEADLINE: Aide Differs With Cheney on the Soviet Threat

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12

 BODY:
Differing with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, a top Pentagon expert on Soviet affairs has endorsed the assessment of William H. Webster, the Director of Central Intelligence, that there is little chance of renewed Soviet dominance over Eastern Europe if President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is ousted by hard-liners.
The official, Phillip A. Petersen, a specialist on Europe and the Soviet Union for the Pentagon's policy planning staff, also said that the Warsaw Pact has already ceased to exist as an effective military organization and will be maintained largely as a political ''fiction'' in the future.
Mr. Petersen's conclusions in a unclassified research paper have drawn attention because they come after a dispute between Mr. Webster and Defense Secretary Cheney over the future Soviet military threat.
Critics of Mr. Cheney on Capitol Hill have argued that the Defense Secretary is increasingly the odd man out in the policy debate in Washington. The emergence of Mr. Petersen's unclassified study has provided ammunition to detractors who argued that the Defense Secretary is even out of tune with some specialists within his agency. 
The Pentagon demonstrated unusual sensitivity to the political implications of Mr. Petersen's analysis.
A Pentagon spokeman read a statement asserting that Mr. Petersen's study is a ''research paper for input into the policy process, and is intended to neither draw policy conclusions nor make policy recommendations.'' Requests to interview Mr. Petersen about his research paper were rejected by the Defense Department.
The dispute over the Soviet military threat came to the fore two weeks ago when Mr. Webster, in Congressional testimony, said that the economic pressures on Moscow are so severe that even a new hard-line regime would be unlikely to begin a major military buildup or to try to revive the Warsaw Pact.
Mr. Webster's analysis undercut one of the main arguments that Mr. Cheney has used to win support for his military spending request: the threat that a reversal of Mr. Gorbachev's policies could rejuvenate the Soviet military.
Mr. Cheney has struck different notes. He has said that he believes Moscow is likely to completely withdraw its forces from Eastern Europe. But he has also stessed caution; in his January report to Congress he said changes in Soviet foreign and military policy ''are only just beginning to be implemented and are still relatively easy to reverse.''
A new classified assessment by the Joint Chiefs of Staff also allows for the possibility that Soviet foreign and domestic policy may be reversed, but plays down the likelihood of this.
The Joint Chiefs' assessment says that the transformation of Soviet foreign and domestic policy is not complete and adds that there are some imaginable circumstances under which the policies might be reversed. But the Chiefs' assessment adds that there is widespead agreement that Soviet leaders have decided to abandon a two-decade-long policy of military growth.
Mr. Petersen's paper centers on his thesis that Soviet leaders, starting with Yuri V. Andropov, have developed a new view of European security that emphasizes economic rather than military relations.
While the paper does not directly address the debate between the Defense Secretary and the C.I.A. Director, Mr. Petersen cites approvingly Mr. Webster's statement that there is little chance that ''Soviet hegemony could be restored in Eastern Europe'' because even hard-line successors to Mr. Gorbachev would be under severe economic and political pressures that would deter them from engaging in a military buildup and taking a confrontational stance toward Washington.
Taking note of Soviet statements of the need to maintain the Eastern and Western military alliances, Mr. Petersen writes that the Warsaw Pact has essentially ceased to exist as ''an integrated military command.''
Mr. Petersen attributes the new view of Soviet security to Mr. Andropov, who he says placed like-minded officials in important positions before he died.

HEADLINE: Bush to Seek $300 Million in Funds for Chamorro

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12

 BODY:
President Bush will ask Congress this week to provide the newly elected government of Nicaragua with $300 million in assistance to rehabilitate the country's war-ravaged economy, Administration officials said tonight.
They said Mr. Bush would ask Congress to appropriate the money before April 25, when President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro is scheduled to be inaugurated.
That would require extraordinarily fast action by Congress. Administration officials said they wanted Congress to vote for the aid, if possible, before lawmakers leave town for an Easter recess that runs from April 6 through 17. 
White House officials said that Mr. Bush would probably make a televised appeal for the aid to Nicaragua in the next day or two. A State Department official said: ''This aid package absolutely has to be on a fast track. If it's not, it will be too late.''
Battered by more than a decade of war, Nicaragua is in the midst of an economic crisis, with high inflation, high unemployment and shortages of basic commodities. Agricultural output and export earnings have fallen as a result of the war and a trade embargo imposed by the United States.
Administration officials said they might ask Congress to provide Nicaraguan aid beyond the $300 million, for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
Mrs. Chamorro's office said today that her Government was seeking a total of $500 million in emergency assistance from Washington, Reuters reported. She is hoping that Managua will receive $300 million shortly after she takes office and the remaining $200 million in the course of the year, the statement from her office said.
Mr. Bush is also expected to announce this week that he will lift economic sanctions imposed on Nicaragua by President Reagan in May 1985. The sanctions prohibit the import of Nicaraguan goods into the United States, forbid the export of most products from this country to Nicaragua and bar Nicaraguan air carriers from the United States.
Of the $300 million aid package, $30 million is earmarked for demobilization and repatriation of Nicaraguan guerrillas camped in Honduras, White House officials said. The United States has been providing food, clothing, shelter and medical supplies to the contras and has also been urging them to return to Nicaragua.
Mrs. Chamorro's chief economic adviser, Francisco Mayorga Balladares, visited Washington last week and outlined her ''agenda for economic recovery.'' He said that the plan would include economic incentives for the contras to return to Nicaragua.
The incentives could include small plots of land and ''starter kits'' containing farm tools, seeds and fertilizer, Administration officials said.
Mrs. Chamorro led a 14-party alliance that crushed the Sandinistas in elections on Feb. 25. Many Nicaraguans cited dissatisfaction with the state of the economy as a reason to vote for her. About two-thirds of the $300 million in Mr. Bush's request is for oil and for agricultural commodities like seeds and fertilizer.
 
Year's Supply of Oil Gone
Administration officials said that the Sandinistas had somehow disposed of a full year's supply of Soviet oil in the last three months. The Sandinistas either used or sold most of the oil, they said. Nicaragua used to get large amounts of oil from Mexico and Venezuela, but the supplies were cut off because Managua did not keep up with its payments, the Administration said.
Paul S. Reichler, a Washington lawyer who has represented the Sandinista Government of Nicaragua since 1979, said that in recent years Managua has been getting most of its oil at little or no charge from the Soviet Union.
Mr. Reichler said that the President of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega Saavedra, ''supports U.S. aid for Nicaragua and will cooperate in efforts to expedite delivery of such aid.''
''I have been instructed by the Nicaraguan Government to lend my support to lobbying efforts to get U.S. economic assistance for Nicaragua and to collaborate with Mrs. Chamorro's people in these efforts,'' Mr. Reichler said.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Shadow Cast By Dukakis Over Cuomo

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 12

 BODY:
He's a Northeastern, liberal Governor with a Mediterranean heritage. He used to brag about his state's prosperity but now is beset by financial difficulties. And as New York's budget problems mount, politicians here are posing the inevitable question: Is Mario Cuomo at risk of becoming the next Michael Dukakis?
Most political analysts say Mr. Cuomo's fiery style is so unlike Mr. Dukakis's lukewarm manner that the differences between the two overwhelm the similarities. But Republicans, hoping to damage the Governor, have already begun raising the analogy as Mr. Cuomo heads into a gubernatorial campaign. And even Democrats acknowledge that the comparison could be a liability if he decides to run for President. 
 
Sentences With Both Names
''To the extent that we always try to avoid the mistakes of the last campaign, a Northeast liberal Governor with fiscal trouble is not what the doctor ordered, given the campaign we've just gone through,'' said Tony Podesta, a Democratic political consultant. ''People who would like him not to run will surely be using a lot of sentences that contain both the words Dukakis and Cuomo.''
In most lines of work, it would seem too early to ask questions about events that, like the 1992 Presidential election, are two years away. Not in politics. Maneuvering for the Presidential campaign is already under way, and many politicians long ago started to handicap the race.
Mr. Cuomo, who is considered a favorite among potential Democratic candidates, has yet to indicate if he intends to run in 1992. With President Bush's popularity so high, it would seem that the biggest factor in his decision would be whether he wants to tackle a strong incumbent.
But the state of New York State is also bound to play a crucial role in Mr. Cuomo's decision whether to run for President. And right now the economic indicators suggest that the state's financial problems will grow worse over the next two years, rather than better, meaning that the state budget will probably continue to plague Mr. Cuomo through 1992.
''If the budget begins to hurt Cuomo in New York, it will hurt him in the rest of the country, just like we saw it in Massachusetts,'' said Al From, head of the Democratic Leadership Council in Washington.
 
The 'Miracle' That Ended
In Massachusetts, the end of the economic boom that Mr. Dukakis labeled the ''Massachusetts miracle'' has left that state with a $500 million budget deficit. Together with Louisiana, it has the worst credit rating in the nation. Reports surfacing toward the end of the 1988 campaign that Massachusetts's finances were falling into disarray weakened Mr. Dukakis's already faltering campaign and helped undermine the image he had fostered as a tough manager.
In New York, economic troubles have all but consumed the state government in recent months, and although Mr. Cuomo insists the problems are not so bad as in Massachusetts, every week seems to bring more bad news. Just today, for example, the State Comptroller said the state's budget gap had grown to $1.5 billion, almost three times what Governor Cuomo estimated last month.
Mr. Cuomo, always coy when it comes to discussing his ambitions, insists he is not worried about how New York's ballooning budget problems play politically and is certainly not interested in how they play nationally. ''It's not our concern,'' he said. Point-by-Point Rebuttal But this indifference is belied by a point-by-point rebuttal the Governor has devised to respond to charges about the state budget that Republicans have yet to level.
In this rebuttal, outlined by the Governor in a recent speech in Washington and in subsequent interviews, he raises the kind of criticism that a Republican Presidential opponent might be expected to raise and then disputes it, dismissing assertions that New York taxes too much, that it spends too much and that its budget problems are its own fault.
If anyone should be faulted on management skills, Mr. Cuomo says, it is the Republicans, who have presided over the largest deficit in the nation's history. ''National Republicans are the last people in the universe who should try to criticize us because once they start it, they'd be dead,'' he said.
Far from shirking comparisons between the Republican Administration in Washington and his own administration in Albany, Mr. Cuomo in recent months has often used New York's budget problems as an opportunity to attack Federal policies.
''While we got into trouble, we were spending generously on people problems,'' the Governor said recently. ''They cut back on people problems like education, drugs, roads and bridges. And part of our problem, everybody knows, is the national economy.''
But Mr. Cuomo appears to be sensitive to the notion that on the national scene he is already being compared to Mr. Dukakis, and in a recent interview he raised the analogy himself. ''What are you going to talk to Cuomo about?'' he asked, referring to his Republican critics. ''You're going to say, 'You guys are Massachusetts?' If we're Massachusetts, you're Massachusetts squared.''
 
National Economic Slowdown
Many economists and even many Republican politicians acknowledge that New York's budget problems cannot be viewed separately from a national economic slowdown that has left many states reeling. But they also point out that during Mr. Cuomo's tenure, state spending has grown by almost 80 percent while inflation increased prices by only 30 percent.
Republicans like Roger Ailes, the media consultant who directed Mr. Bush's 1988 campaign advertising, call Mr. Cuomo's attacks on the White House an effort to avoid blame for the problems in New York.
''This man's never taken responsibility for anything in his life,'' Mr. Ailes said of the Governor. ''He'll blame things on Mother Teresa before he'll take responsibility.''
So far, there is little evidence that the state's budget problems have affected Mr. Cuomo's popularity in New York, where he is expected to run for a third term as Governor in November. The most recent survey by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, a Poughkeepsie group does frequent polling on state issues, shows Mr. Cuomo with a comfortable 64 percent approval rating.
 
No Republican Challenger
Politicians here say it is not surprising that the budget has not yet translated into problems for Mr. Cuomo. After all, they say, he does not yet have a Republican opponent in the gubernatorial race. This has left criticism of the state's fiscal policies to a chorus of Republican legislators, whose charges that the Governor taxes and spends too much rarely reach beyond the State Capitol.
''I think Cuomo has the potential to skate through his problems for lack of an opponent,'' said Roger Stone, a Republican political consultant. ''You can't beat somebody with nobody.''
Just how much of a liability New York's fiscal problems would prove to a Governor-turned-Presidential-candidate would depend, analysts say, on the forcefulness with which Mr. Cuomo deals with the problem.
''If Cuomo is able to manage the problem and deal with it effectively, it won't even be a blip on the radar screen,'' Mr. From of the Democratic council said. ''If it gets out of hand, it could really be problem.''

HEADLINE: Medicaid Help for AIDS Patients Proposed

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 12

 BODY:
Unemployed New Yorkers with AIDS would have private health insurance premiums paid for through Medicaid, under legislation proposed today by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. 
If the program is carried out, Governor Cuomo estimated it would help 1,800 people with AIDS and cost the state $2 million and local governments another $2 million.
AIDS patients at 185 percent of the Federal poverty level or below would be eligible.
Local social service commissioners can authorize Medicaid payments of health insurance premiums for AIDS patients. But, for example, a single person would have to be making $5,700 annually or less to qualify, said Pamela Rehak, the Governor's assistant secretary for human services.

HEADLINE: Review/Art;
Landscapes Show Rembrandt's Peaceful Side

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BRENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
''Rembrandt's Landscapes: Drawings and Prints,'' which opened Sunday at the National Gallery of Art, will give pleasure to anyone who likes Rembrandt and anyone who likes prints and drawings. What the exhibition will not do is provide a way of coming to terms with the polemics that have thrown almost everything about Rembrandt into question. These 99 works on paper seem as removed from the turmoil of recent Rembrandt scholarship as they seem untouched by the emotional swells and dramatic turbulence of Rembrandt's painting.
The exhibition is unaffected by the Rembrandt Research Project in Amsterdam because that group of five Dutch scholars has been involved in a 21-year effort to establish a secure corpus of Rembrandt's paintings, not of his work on paper. The project has disattributed or reattributed many paintings. There is a sense that no work is safe from the machinery of re-evaluation, not even Rembrandt favorites like ''The Polish Rider,'' from 1657, in the Frick Collection in New York. 
The show also offers little or no response to revisionist art historians like Gary Schwartz, who has raged against what he sees as a misguided view of Rembrandt as a totally independent genius whose work is the embodiment of the noblest human values. In ''Rembrandt: His Life, His Paintings,'' published in 1986, Mr. Schwartz, an American living in the Netherlands, concentrates on patronage and argues that Rembrandt gave his Dutch clients exactly what they wanted and that far from being a prince of a human being he was manipulative, arrogant, greedy and ruthless.
On the surface, this show is as peaceful as its art. It includes sketches, studies and finished drawings, as well as all 26 of Rembrandt's landscape prints. There are etchings made from life and etchings no bigger than matchboxes. There are a few works in which Rembrandt aimed for a monumental statement, including the overblown ''Three Trees,'' in which Dutch farmland is transformed into a heroic theater.
All the works are intimate in scale. There is a feeling both for the rapid, almost Zenlike gesture and for detail so fine that you almost need a magnifying glass to see it. No matter how expansive the vista, the works have to be seen up close, like pages in a book. The drawings appeal to the eye in their demand for keen visual observation; they appeal viscerally in the darting immediacy with which stumpy and flowing lines seem to impose themselves upon the paper.
In all the works there is a sense of the artist as an outsider, as a city boy in nature. Rembrandt was interested in cultivated, not untamed, land. In all the works there is a sense of detachment. Although Rembrandt felt entirely at ease with what he drew or etched, he never identified himself with landscape as did van Gogh, a Dutchman influenced by Rembrandt's expanses of fields and trees and artistic license with what he saw. Although Rembrandt is widely perceived as a romantic, these are really not romantic works.
The tone of the work is puzzling, and a clear indication that questions raised by the revisionist scholars need to be addressed. The combination of nonchalance and self-consciousness, calculation and conviction, has an odd, almost modernist edge. It is hard to know to what degree Rembrandt cared personally about what he was drawing, and to what degree his scenes of stable, down-to-earth rural life were intended to please patrons.
One of the most instructive aspects of the show is the insight it provides into Rembrandt's relationship with other artists. Titian's ''Mountainous Landscape With Riderless Horse Emerging From a Lake'' is shown alongside Rembrandt's copy of it. The copy is close to the original but freer, and it suggests both tribute and competition.
Centuries before Robert Rauschenberg struggled to erase an actual drawing by Willem de Kooning in a famous Pop Art gesture of generational assertion and rebellion, Rembrandt took a print by Hercules Seghers, an artist a generation older than he, and burnished away the right-hand section, transforming a scene of ''Tobias and the Angel'' into a ''Flight Into Egypt.''
In the catalogue, Cynthia P. Schneider, an assistant professor of art history at Georgetown University and the curator of the exhibition, writes that Rembrandt's action was ''truly a labor of love.'' ''Rembrandt,'' she writes, ''could not have expressed his respect and admiration for Seghers more eloquently than by reaching across time to work together with him as he did in the 'Flight into Egypt.' '' It does not make a lot of sense, however, to interpret an artist erasing the work of another artist as a declaration of love.
The catalogue does not challenge any deeply held view of Rembrandt. Some of its caution is understandable. Few of the works on paper are dated, and Ms. Schneider writes, ''no documentation exists regarding Rembrandt's working process from landscape.'' The installation is not chronological but thematic. It is divided into five sections: farmhouses and cottages (by far the largest), imaginary landscapes (including the works after Seghers and Titian), architecture and town views, along the Amstel and IJ Rivers, and panoramas.
It is also hard to know how Rembrandt perceived these works. He was a figure painter for whom history painting was the key to art heaven. Landscape became an established genre only in his lifetime (he died in 1669 at the age of 63). Ms. Schneider writes that Rembrandt's landscape paintings ''number no more than eight'' and that they were executed between 1637 and 1647. Most of the landscapes on paper span 30 years and were made, Ms. Schneider thinks, after the landscape paintings, in the 1640's and early 1650's.
The catalogue avoids speculation. It offers no comprehensive overview. While the entries provide a great deal of information and an essay by the Dutch art historian Boudewijn Bakker offers new documentation about routes Rembrandt followed on his walks and the two kinds of farms he depicted, the show makes no statement or argument about the place of these landscapes in Rembrandt's oeuvre.
What, then, are these works, and what was Rembrandt trying to do in them?
They can be seen as an attempt by the artist to establish some distance from the politics of the rough and tumble art world in Amsterdam and from the kind of emotional involvement required in his commissions.
The landscapes are economical and often quick. In many of them there is a feeling for space and light that contrasts sharply with the dense and often darkish paintings. In ''A House in Sunlight,'' the brown ink seems to set off the glare of the sun concealed within the paper; the feeling for ink or pencil is almost Chinese. In ''Winter Landscape'' Rembrandt manages in a few dark lines to make blank paper seem like snow.
The works are also about continuity. The Netherlands does not have the artistic and architectural history of Italy or France. In some of the best 17th-century Dutch landscape painting, there is a sense that the country's true wealth and tradition lay in its rivers, fields and trees.
The relationship between the flatlands and trees in the northwestern Netherlands has an elemental purity to which Rembrandt responded long before Piet Mondrian found in it an inspiration for the vertical and horizontal grids of his abstract painting.
Rembrandt's farmhouses are enduring and accessible, and they suggest community. They also seem as organic as the trees that grow beside them. In a drawing like ''Three Cottages Along a Road,'' the ramshackle farmhouses suggest a link between the 17th century and mud huts of prehistory.
Rembrandt also seems to have truly enjoyed working outdoors. In a number of drawings, a man, sometimes barely visible, is alone in the fields, drawing or, like a monk in Chinese painting, sitting in contemplation before a village, field or tree. Although Rembrandt may always have been considering the market, and he was ambitious enough that he probably wanted to show landscape painters that he could outdo them without trying, he really seems to have loved the Dutch landscape and to have found in it an anchor. This might help explain why these drawings are unsearching and untroubled.
But there is still invariably this sense of shrewdness and distance that makes one wonder. How much did Rembrandt tap this unsearching and untroubled air for himself, and how much did he draw it into his paper because he thought it was what the good burghers of Amsterdam wanted to breathe?

HEADLINE: Big Effort Is Begun To Reverse Decline Of Turtles

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
Turtles crawled the earth and swam in its waters before the dinosaurs appeared. Now they are facing the first broad-scale threat to their future in 200 million years, and some of the world's leading conservation organizations are gearing up to combat it.
The campaign goes far beyond, and is separate from, a much-publicized effort to preserve six species of sea turtles whose numbers are being reduced by fishermen and shrimpers. The broader effort encompasses about 300 species of land and freshwater turtles on every continent.
They are afflicted by an accelerating decline, according to a comprehensive survey by the World Conservation Union, with about a third of the species requiring conservation attention. ''That's a very high percentage for a group of vertebrates,'' said Michael W. Klemens, a herpetologist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, who is the director of the worldwide conservation effort now beginning. 
The problem is that the pace of modern change has placed many kinds of turtles in an evolutionary bind. Over the eons, they have owed their success and their survival to what Dr. Klemens calls a ''conservative'' adaptive strategy. That is, they have relied on longevity - some turtles live more than 100 years - to insure that their species survives.
They lay a relatively small number of eggs, and there is a high mortality rate among hatchlings. ''The one thing they have going for them is that they live a long time,'' said Dr. Klemens. ''Once a turtle reaches adulthood, it can reproduce for 30, 40, 50 years. The individual adult turtle is very important.''
For this strategy to work an undisturbed and unfragmented habitat is required. Now the development activities of another well-adapted species, Homo sapiens, are disrupting many turtle habitats. This affects turtle populations in two ways: eliminating adults who wander out of their truncated home range and are killed, and cutting breeding populations off from each other, thereby reducing the number of eggs and surviving hatchlings.
 
Fewer Reproducing Adults
 On top of this, many turtle species around the world are exploited for food and other uses, further reducing adult populations.
The special danger faced by many species of turtles is that with reduced numbers of reproducing adults and fewer breeding opportunities, not enough young turtles are being produced to replace the adults.
''In Asia, in Africa, even in the New York metropolitan area, some populations are made up almost entirely of aged adults, and juveniles are just not present,'' said Dr. Klemens. ''Once they're gone, that's the ball game; or extinction may proceed over several generations. But that's the pattern.''
The effort to head off this decline is being undertaken jointly by the World Conservation Union, the American Museum of Natural History and the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology in Canterbury, England. Nearly 50 projects are being undertaken, with a projected budget of $2 million to be contributed by a number of conservation organizations.
The goal is to help declining populations through tactics like breeding turtles under controlled conditionsand releasing them into the wild and erecting fences around eggs in natural breeding areas to keep predators away. A few programs of this kind are already under way. In Madagascar, for example, threatened tortoises are being bred in pens. The program employs people from local villages, and the fruits and vegetables that the tortoises eat are purchased locally. ''Local people have to see a real economic incentive to preserve these animals,'' said Dr. Klemens.
One incentive is the need to maintain an important source of protein, which turtles provide in many areas of the world. In Southeast Asia and Latin America, river turtles in some places are under heavy pressure from people who hunt them for food. In other places, tortoises are kept in village pens for food and as a source of hatchlings that, according to the World Conservation Union, fetch high prices and are easily smuggled.
As an example of how habitat fragmentation endangers some species, Dr. Klemens cites studies of the common wood turtle of North America. Its relatively flat, brownish shell and orange legs are familiar in the Northeastern United States. It lives in streams in the fall and spring, but travels overland in the summer over a home range extending for several miles.
''But there's no place in Westchester or Fairfield County that's more than a mile from a road,'' said Dr. Klemens, who has studied the problem. Some adult wood turtles are killed crossing roads, and adults are often prevented from reaching each other to mate. While adults still live in those two counties, they have essentially stopped reproducing. ''They are the last remnants of that population,'' Dr. Klemens said. ''Once they die, that's it.'' Wood turtles, he said, are now ''functionally extinct'' in those two counties.
 
Long Life, High-Domed Shell
 The wood turtle is not to be confused with the common box turtle, an even more familiar sight in the Northeast. Its hallmark is a high-domed brown and yellow shell. With a life span exceeding 120 years, it is the longest-lived vertebrate in North America. Because its home range is much smaller than that of the wood turtle, it is one species not affected by habitat fragmentation.
Of the species not getting conservation attention but in a decline judged serious enough to warrant it, 39 are known to be declining and threatened over a substantial part of their range, according to a scientific study carried out by the World Conservation Union.The seriousness of their plight has not been clearly established, however. These species include, for example, the alligator snapping turtle of the Southeastern United States; the bog turtle and Blandings turtle of New York State; the Mexican mud turtle; the Egyptian tortoise; the red-footed tortoise of South America, which is particularly exploited as food during Holy Week, and the big-headed turtle of Southeast Asia, heavily exploited by the pet trade.
Fifty-two species have been identified as being threatened because they are restricted to just a few bodies of water or drainage basins or are limited to a small, specific habitat. Disruption of those habitats could cause extinction of a species. Among these are the Burmese star tortoise, the Berger's tortoise of Namibia and the Bolson tortoise of Mexico.
A third category, including 16 species, is considered badly threatened or heavily exploited. Among those identified as heavily exploited are several varieties of river turtle in Madagascar, Southeast Asia and Latin America. Those considered badly threatened include the western swamp turtle of Australia, some species of Galapagos turtles and the plowshare tortoise of Madagascar, of which only about 15 specimens remain. These, said Dr. Klemens, ''are really on the edge.''

HEADLINE: Efforts to Halt Wetland Loss Turn Their Attention Inland

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
A new and contentious phase has opened in the struggle over the future of the millions of acres of marshes, swamps, bogs, prairie potholes and bottom lands that not only provide an irreplaceable habitat for wildlife but also help replenish the nation's water supplies and control its floods.
Despite longtime efforts by the Federal Government to arrest the steady shrinkage of this natural resource, an estimated 200,000 to 400,000 acres of wetlands continue to vanish each year, most in freshwater drainages in inland areas, where 95 percent of all wetlands lie. Largely untouched by Federal and state regulatory efforts, millions of acres of these freshwater wetlands have disappeared since the mid-1950's, overwhelmingly because farmers converted them to cropland.
Efforts to preserve wetlands have focused mainly on coastal areas, but now environmentalists, politicians and regulators are engaged in a campaign to control the attrition of inland wetlands for the first time and ultimately to reverse it. They have declared their near-term objective to be no net loss of wetlands. 
Under the no-net-loss principle, conversion of wetlands would be permitted only if the user restored previously converted wetlands or created new ones. President Bush has embraced it, and two Federal agencies and some state governments are requiring it. Congress is holding hearings about whether it should be Federal law.
But despite widespread acceptance of the basic principle, early attempts to put it into practice have encountered stiff and angry resistance. It comes especially from farmers who see regulatory efforts as a confiscation of their assets. ''I bought my farm, and if the Government wants it, they should acquire it the good old American way -buy it,'' Rick McGown, a Missouri farmer, said in handwritten testimony that he presented to Congress two weeks ago.
And on Maryland's Eastern Shore, where most non-tidal wetlands lie on farms and the issue has become especially heated, enforcement of the no-net-loss policy has discouraged banks from lending money to farmers because of the uncertain status of their lands. It has also stopped development by preventing farmers from selling excess lands to developers, a move many had counted on to provide for their retirement.
''The farmers are very upset,'' said Samuel Q. Johnson, an Eastern Shore legislator who is a member of the Maryland House of Delegates' committee on the environment. ''And not only the farmer. This thing is spreading to the banking community, to the real estate community. I know people who have been turned down on loans for land. It has nothing at all to do with their credit or ability to pay. It is simply the unknown factor about whether this was non-tidal wetlands.''
Two real-estate developments worth $22 million together have shut down because of uncertainty over the situation, he said.
Most non-tidal wetlands are on private property, and as the wetlands debate heats up, policy-makers are searching for ways to head off conflict and confrontation, allay concern and safeguard both public and private interests while making the no-net-loss principle a reality. Proposals are emerging in Congress, for instance, to offer tax incentives for wetlands conservation and even to pay farmers to reconvert land, which could then be placed in a wetlands conservation bank.
Underlying the action and argument is a shift in perception about wetlands. Through most of American history, they have been considered wastelands to be eliminated and converted to productive use. ''For a long time, we regarded swamps as sources of pestilence that should be filled in as quickly as possible,'' says James Leape, a wetlands expert at the Conservation Foundation, a Washington-based organization that sponsored an influential national study of wetlands loss.
 
Study Shapes New Debate
 The study was carried out by the National Wetlands Policy Forum, a broadly based group that included environmentalists, industrialists, government officials, developers and farmers. Its report, issued in late 1988, first proposed the no-net-loss goal. The report has largely shaped the renewed argument and is the focus of the Congressional hearings.
Wetlands today are seen increasingly not as nuisances, but as an invaluable resource. Scientists say that they protect shorelines from erosion by ocean waves and storms and reduce the severity of inland floods by slowing and storing flood waters. They remove pollution from waters that flow through them and recharge underground aquifers. They store water in the wettest parts of the year and release it at a constant rate to maintain regular stream flows.
They provide critical breeding and nesting habitats for a wide array of fish and wildlife, including migratory waterfowl. They support many commercial fisheries, provide an array of commercial products from cranberries and timber to fish and shellfish and offer widespread opportunities for hunting, fishing, boating, nature study and photography. And because of the gases they emit and absorb, like methane, nitrogen and carbon dioxide, they help maintain the planet's atmospheric balance.
 
From Marshes to Tundra
 Wetlands include marshes extending across thousands of acres to wet spots smaller than a room and from the vast Okefenokee Swamp in Georgia to the squishy borders of inland rivers and lakes. They include not only Alaskan tundra but also the Everglades and the bottom lands of the Mississippi Delta.
Ecologically speaking, the loss of wetlands can be disastrous. In one example, the conversion of prairie potholes of the upper Midwest to agricultural use has been ''extremely devastating'' to certain species of ducks, said Joseph S. Larson, an expert on wetlands who is the chairman of the department of forestry and wildlife at the University of Massachusetts.
The potholes, large depressions in the prairie created when huge chunks of ice were buried in the last ice age and then melted, are the nesting grounds for ''probably 80 percent of the ducks in North America,'' said Dr. Larson. But so many of the potholes have been converted from wetlands to wheat fields, he said, that there has been a tremendous loss of habitat, and species like the redhead and canvasback ducks are in serious decline as a result.
In addition, a number of communities have experienced serious flooding after wetlands were drained and replaced by streets, parking lots and other surfaces that allow water to run off more freely.
Of more than 200 million acres of wetlands that existed in the contiguous 48 states when Europeans arrived in North America, an estimated 95 million remain, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. They are found across the country but are concentrated especially in the Southeast, the upper Midwest and the Northeastern coastal states. Another 200 million acres remain in Alaska in the form of tundra, which is frozen wetland.
Government studies by the Fish and Wildlife Service have calculated that from the mid-1950's to the mid-1970's, 11 million acres of wetlands vanished, a net loss of about 550,000 acres a year, in the contiguous 48 states. About 80 percent of the loss resulted from the draining and clearing of inland wetlands by farmers. The remainder was attributed to such activities as urban and suburban development, which accounted for about 6 percent, dredging, mining and the discharge of pollution. Natural phenomena like erosion, storms and subsidence accounted for about 5 percent of the loss.
 
Losses Are Being Disputed
 How much additional loss has occurred in the last 15 years is a matter of sharp contention. The Congressional Office of Technology Assessment estimated in 1984 that the rate was about 240,000 to 360,000 acres a year.
Whatever the scope of the problem, spokesmen for farmers and developers minimize their constituents' contribution to it. ''I don't think agriculture has played that much of a part'' in the last 10 years, said Mark Maslyn, an official of the American Farm Bureau Federation, who took part in the Wetlands Policy Forum study. ''I think that was just a time and point in history that passed.''
 
Losing Wetlands by Increments
 But environmentalists and some government officials insist that interests like agriculture and real estate are responsible for the continuing attrition. ''We're losing wetlands by small increments,'' says Hope Babcock, general counsel for the National Audubon Society, who also took part in the Wetlands Policy Forum study, ''and when you start nibbling away, pretty soon you're destroying a whole ecosystem.''
Last month, the struggle over the issued sharpened as the no-net-loss principle was incorporated into an agreement between the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers over the enforcement of wetlands protection under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. This section, which regulates the filling of wetlands, is considered by environmentalists the most important tool available for controlling wetlands loss.
Some environmentalists say that the authority of the Corps of Engineers in some ways does not extend far enough because it does not apply to the excavation, clearing or draining of wetlands. Such activities are responsible for most wetlands loss, especially inland. While coastal wetlands are reasonably well protected, said the 1984 report by the technology assessment office, freshwater wetlands away from the coasts ''are generally poorly protected.''
In an attempt to help plug this gap, Congress in 1985 prohibited farmers from growing crops on any tracts converted from wetlands after that year. If they do, they are supposed to lose all their Federal farm program benefits, including subsidized loans, crop insurance and price supports.
A number of states are embracing the no-net-loss principle and expanding it beyond filling-in of wetlands. Maryland has adopted one of the most far-reaching state laws incorporating the no-net-loss principle, and the Legislature is in a hot battle about approving the new regulations to complete the law. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York has espoused no net loss. Among states besides Maryland that have enacted the principle into law is New Jersey, and other states, including Washington and South Carolina, are considering it.
 
Looking to Economic Solutions
 In the end, many conservationists and officials are convinced, wetlands protection will have to look beyond regulation to economic solutions. ''It's unrealstic to expect private land owners to do what's good for society just out of the goodness of their hearts,'' said Ralph Heimlich, an analyst in the Economic Research Service of the Agriculture Department who has studied the wetlands issue extensively.
Outright purchases of land for a wetlands conservation bank is one strategy being pursued in Florida, where officials plan to buy and restore more than 100,000 acres of freshwater marshland that were drained and converted into orange groves and truck farms.
Other strategies being proposed involve economic aid for not developing or otherwise converting ecologically important wetlands, as well as tax breaks for donating them to a conservation reserve.
''You have to begin to tilt the economic playing field,'' said Ms. Babcock.

HEADLINE: For Macy, a Bitter Pill to Swallow

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Afflicted by continuing high debt and costly competitive pressures, R. H. Macy & Company has been carefully preparing its investors, lenders, employees and suppliers for another bitter pill to swallow on quarterly losses.
Today, New York's biggest retailer is expected to report steeper losses for its second fiscal quarter, ended Jan. 27, compared with a loss of $33.1 million for its first quarter, ended Oct. 28. It would be Macy's fourth consecutive quarterly loss, one of the retailer's biggest and hardly what Macy's has been hoping for. In a recent letter to investors, Macy's management said: ''We don't expect that you will be pleased with the results of our most recent quarter. We certainly will not be.'' 
The latest results, which include the important Christmas season, are also expected to show a decline of more than a percentage point in gross profit margins from a year ago.
 
Reports Produce Caution
Yet, the warnings and bad-news meetings with bankers, investors and suppliers have produced more caution than consternation among them, indicating that the admonitions may be having a calculated effect. ''We hear the numbers to be reported are terrible,'' one supplier said. ''But the effect will depend much on the P.R. job they do before the losses come out.''
Some bankers and financiers said they had lost none of their enthusiasm for the skills of Edward S. Finkelstein, Macy's chairman and chief executive, and his team of 350 associates who led a leveraged buyout of the company in July 1986.
But others insist that Macy's management has lost its way by concentrating on raising cash flow to pay its merger debt, has unfairly blamed the price-cutting competition of Federated/Allied stores for its problems and needs a new strategy.
 
Employee Morale a Concern
If Macy's has successfully prepared outsiders for dismay, internally it has not been as successful. Concerned about employee morale, senior executives have held meetings with middle and junior managers to convince them that the company is doing fine, with lots of liquidity and good cash flow. But worry and fear over the losses and exhortations to work harder have affected some in the buyout group, as well as many employees.
''There seems to be definite concern among Macy's executives about the state of their business,'' said Robert E. Kerson, president of Walter Levy/Robert Kerson Associates, a retail-marketing and recruiting company in New York. ''We are seeing more executives willing to leave Macy than ever before.''
''Many of these,'' he added, are in the leveraged-buyout group, ''which suggests there are some nonbelievers.'' He continued, ''They feel the rewards predicted for them may not develop or will take longer than they expected, and the multiples promised for the return of their investment seem to be fading away.''
 
Meetings With Banks
Macy's has met several times in recent weeks with its main bank lenders. The executive of one, who asked not to be identified, said yesterday: ''We are concerned about the retail industry as a whole and about Macy's, too. Though they are highly leveraged, they have done a good job of bringing their debt down. We know their news is not great.''
But, the bank executive continued, Macy's officials had given assurances that they had taken steps to cut back store inventories, which some analysts had criticized as too high. The banker also said Macy's planned to keep pace with competitors ''without taking too much of a bath in markdowns.'' He added, ''Their sales are better.''
Mark G. Solow, senior managing director of acquisition finance for the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company's investment banking sector, declared: ''I have an awful lot of confidence in Ed Finkelstein and his team. I have been through two financings with them. But I believe that anyone who expects every year to be better with our present economic situation must be naive. The economy is going through a cycle that we have known was coming. I have a number of deals that I've worked on and some I've been concerned about. But not this one.''
 
The Strain Is Showing
Macy's, taken private by Mr. Finkelstein in 1986, has debt of more than $4.7 billion left from the buyout he led and from the company's acquisition of the Bullock's and I. Magnin chains in 1988. Macy's has taken steps to cut expenses, combine operations and lay off some people. The company denies reports of large layoffs, but others insist that the dimissals are growing.
Under the surface, the strain is showing within Macy's, creating some dissension.
Some executives have bristled at Mr. Finkelstein's urgings that they work Saturdays to achieve better results. ''If we've been doing such a lousy job in five days, it could be even worse in six days,'' one executive told his supervisor, according to a story making the rounds at the company. ''Maybe we need a new game plan instead.''
 
Effect of a Recent Appointment
The recent appointment of Myron E. Ullman, a former executive of Wharf Holdings, as Macy's corporate executive vice president and chief financial officer has caused what is described by insiders as a power play and some confusion among other top executives in the New York corporate headquarters and in the divisions in California and Atlanta.
For years, Mark S. Handler, president and chief operating officer, has functioned as Macy's No. 2 executive under Mr. Finkelstein. Now, apparently with the chief executive's approval, divisional presidents who reported to Mr. Handler are reporting to Mr. Ullman. ''Ed has handed Mike Ullman the responsibility for the daily operations,'' a Macy executive said.
While convinced that ''Macy's continues to be an excellent retailer,'' Walter F. Loeb, a retail consultant, said: ''Suppliers are nervous about Macy partly because they've been sensitized by the losses and bankruptcy at Campeau's Federated/ Allied Stores. Finkelstein has done a good job of keeping the suppliers warned about continuing losses, unlike Campeau, where there were unpleasant surprises. But I think that the critical year will be 1991, which could be very damaging to Macy if it doesn't turn around by then.''
Meanwhile, Macy and Pittsburgh City Center, a new shopping mall in Pittsburgh, said that Macy's had agreed to open a 250,000-square-foot department store in the mall in spring 1993. It will be the first big department store opened in the city in 65 years. The store is one of eight new ones Macy's plans to open in the next few years, although none is planned for the 1990 fiscal year, which began July 30, 1989. Macy, R. H.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Sharp Climb Against Yen

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar surged yesterday to its highest level in two and a half years against the Japanese yen and rose against the West German mark, buoyed by the market's negative sentiment toward the two foreign currencies.
The dollar closed at 152.63 against the yen, despite overnight efforts by the Bank of Japan to halt the rise. It closed at 151.27 Friday. 
The United States currency has not been higher since July 1987, when it traded at 153.45 yen.
Against the mark, the dollar rose to 1.7135, from Friday's 1.7035. Some dealers said the dollar would have risen further except for anxiety over the possibility that the West German central bank would intervene to sell dollars if the exchange rate rose much above 1.71 marks.
The volatile Tokyo stock market, where share prices have fallen sharply this year, and worries about Japanese interest rates have combined to weaken the yen. Tokyo's key Nikkei index fell 624.89 points Monday, a loss of 1.84 percent, to close at 33,368.23.
The dollar has marched higher since last month despite repeated sales of the currency by the Bank of Japan and other central banks trying to halt its rise.
''We've busted through the 152-yen area,'' said Francoise Soares-Kemp, a vice president at Credit Suisse. ''The dollar-yen situation is pretty clear.''
The dollar initially overcame the barrier in Tokyo as investors and speculators bet the United States currency would move higher still. The rise carried over into trading in New York.
Traders said that the dollar jumped further in late trading on rumors that Japan's Prime Minister might be replaced this spring. Smick Medley International, an influential Washington consulting firm, said in a report that there is a better than even chance that Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu will step down, possibly by the end of May, because of problems with the budget and the economy.
Traders remain wary of central bank intervention but that was not enough to prevent the sharp dollar rally yesterday.
''Bit by bit, the market is chiseling away at the central banks, while the central banks are trying to chisel away at the market,'' said Alexis Egan, a corporate dealer for Banque Indosuez in New York.
Traders said that only the Bank of Japan intervened yesterday, selling an estimated $100 million to $200 million for yen.
They added that the dollar is likely to continue appreciating gradually unless officials from the seven wealthiest industrial nations adjust their monetary policies to push the United States currency lower.
Psychology is bearish for the mark due to worries that Eastern Europe's political and economic liberalization will cause higher West German inflation.
In other currency action yesterday, the British pound fell to $1.6115 from Friday's finish at $1.6160. The dollar ended at 1.5265 Swiss francs, up from 1.5105 Friday and at $1.1795 Canadian, down slightly from Friday's $1.1800 Canadian.
Gold prices finished unchanged to slightly lower in New York after rising overseas. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery, on the expiring March contract settled unchanged at $399.80 an ounce. The active April contract was off 50 cents an ounce, to $401.10.
Gold was bid at $400.65 an ounce late in London, up from $399.05 on Friday. The late bid in Zurich was $401.10 an ounce, up from $399.50. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $400.55 an ounce, down from $400.65.
Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid of $5.13 an ounce, up from $5.11. On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery settled at $5.042 an ounce, down from $5.095 late Friday.

HEADLINE: Business and Health;
Research Outlays To Aid the Aging

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
MEDICAL experts and their supporters in the business community are putting pressure on Congress to spend more for basic research on a number of illnesses that make life miserable and expensive for millions of elderly Americans.
They argue that in the long run the best way to slow spiraling health-care costs is by devising better treatments for Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, incontinence and other conditions that force millions of the elderly into nursing homes.
Advancing their case, the Pepper Commission, a bipartisan Congressional advisory group named for the late Representative Claude Pepper, Democrat of Florida, recently recommended that annual Congressional appropriations for research into diseases of the elderly be gradually raised to $1 billion from the $380 million appropriated last year.
The $380 million includes spending by the National Institute on Aging and the other institutes studying heart, cancer and neurological diseases, said Daniel Perry, executive director of the Alliance for Aging Research, an advocacy group supported by foundations and businesses. In all, basic health research got $7.6 billion. 
The research outlay is minor compared with the cost of care for people aged 65 and over, which absorbed $180 billion of the nation's health-care spending last year. The amount is expected to grow rapidly as the population ages. The number of Amerians over 85, those most likely to enter nursing homes, may quadruple by the year 2030.
''If we don't make the investment in research, we will pay dearly later on,'' said Dr. Robert N. Butler, chairman of geriatrics at the Mount Sinai Medical Center's School of Medicine in New York. He said promising studies already under way could save enormous amounts in medical costs. For example, studies of hormonal treatments for enlarged prostates in older men may produce a far less costly alternative to the 400,000 prostate operations done each year.
Dr. T. Franklin Williams, director of the National Institute on Aging, said a simple skin biopsy to diagnose Alzheimer's, the memory-loss disease, might ''save $1 billion right up front in diagnostic tests,'' which are largely paid for by Medicare.
Dr. Alan M. Garber, an economist and assistant professor of medicine at Stanford University, said such medical advances would mean longer and better lives - ''80 good years instead of 70'' for many people. But he questioned whether overall health care costs would be reduced. ''More people will survive longer, which may even increase their costs,'' a Congressional aide said.
The major drug companies are spending $3.6 billion this year to find new treatments for the elderly. Merck & Company, for example, said it is spending ''a very substantial part'' of the $855 million it has allotted to research and development on illnesses that are common in older people. A growing share of industry research budgets is going to basic research in laboratories. ''But the National Institute on Aging helps to set priorities and to publicize those priorities,'' said Dr. John F. Beary 3d, a senior vice president with the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, an industry group.
Some financial service companies are also supporting Federal research to help the aging. The nation will have to try to reduce the number of elderly who lose their independence ''or the 11 percent of gross national product going to health care will inevitably go up,'' said F. Peter Libassi, a senior vice president with the Travelers Corporation, which manages health benefits and sells long-term-care insurance.
John L. Steffens, president of Merrill Lynch Consumer Markets and chairman of the Alliance for Aging Research, said business people had several concerns. They include paying the health costs of their retirees, the level of Government spending, and the financial implications for individuals who will face ''25 to 30 percent of their lives in retirement'' as life expectancy lengthens. ''If we begin to plan for some of these eventualities of changing demographics now, we can solve these problems,'' he said. ''I don't think we're going to ration health care.''
The Bush Administration's budget calls for a 4.7 percent increase in the budget for the National Institutes of Health, to $7.9 billion, next year. Congress usually adds a few percentage points to Administration requests for health research, Congressional aides said. Alzheimer's research, which has been gaining national support, is likely to get some added money, they said.
Representative Mary Rose Oakar, Democrat of Ohio, said she would urge the House Appropriations Committee to increase spending for research to help the aging. ''We are very pennywise and pound foolish,'' she said.

HEADLINE: JAPAN INVESTMENT IN U.S. PROPERTY OFF

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 12

 BODY:
Japanese purchases of United States real estate fell 10.7 percent in 1989, with investment shifting from office buildings to hotels and resort properties, the real estate accounting firm Kenneth Leventhal & Company said today.
The Japanese spent $14.8 billion on real estate in the United States last year, compared with $16.5 billion in 1988, the company's report said.
Purchases of office properties fell about 60 percent to $3.3 billion in 1989 from $8.31 billion in 1988. Investment in hotel-resort properties rose to $4.16 billion last year, from $3.58 billion in 1988, a 16 percent increase. 
Over all, offices remain the favorite target of Japanese investors, said Jack Barthell, a Leventhal partner. Of the total $5.7 billion that the firm's data show as invested in United States real estate, 44 percent is in offices.
The Japanese appear to be backing away from purchases of ''trophy properties,'' like Rockefeller Center, the study found. Mitsubishi Estate Company last year announced it was spending $846 million for a controlling interest in the compnay that owns Rockefeller Center, the New York office and cultural center.
The study also noted that the Japanese still own just 2 percent of United States commercial real estate, far less than European investers.
California was the leading state for the second year in a row, with 36 percent of the 1989 investment. Forty percent of the purchases were concentrated in the greater Los Angeles area.
Hawaii was second and New York third, but interest among Japanese buyers in New York properties appears to be waning.
''Most attractive properties have already been acquired, and the cost of acquisitions in Manhattan may cause investors to divert funds to other markets,'' Mr. Barthell said.
The top three states accounted ofr 81 percent of the Japanese investment.
Among the findings, investment in residential property jumped to 15 percent, triple the amount invested in 1988. Nearly two-thirds of that was in California, and 28 percnet in Hawaii.
Leventhal said the size of Japanese deals is getting smaller as investment moves into smaller American cities, and that Japan's largest institutional investors are turning attention to Europe leading up to economic unification in 1992.
Leventhal defines investment as both equity investment and convertible debt secured by United States real estate.

HEADLINE: Honda Blurs Line Between American and Foreign

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MARYSVILLE, Ohio

 BODY:
When the Honda Accord became the best-selling car model in the United States last year - the first foreign car ever to do so - not everyone viewed the event as simply another sign of American industrial decline at the hands of Japan.
A reason is that the Honda Motor Company, which once offered only cars imported from Japan, has in some ways become as American an auto maker as Ford or General Motors. And that is spurring a growing debate about whether a company like Honda, despite its foreign ownership, should not be nourished as a national asset rather than lumped in with companies that simply flood American markets with products manufactured abroad.
The debate affects a host of issues, including when to apply curbs on imports of autos or auto parts, and which companies' products the United States should champion in world markets. It involves not only automobile manufacturing but also other industries from consumer electronics to machine tools. 
More than any other foreign auto maker, Honda is blurring the distinction between foreign and American. The proof is Honda's huge plant here, which assembled 363,668 Honda Accords and Civics last year, more cars than any other single auto plant in the United States.
When the plant opened eight years ago, American workers, like many at Japanese-owned factories in this country, were mainly used to assemble parts mostly imported from Japan, to build cars designed by Japanese engineers. The engines, for example, were built in Japan and shipped so that they could simply be dropped into place.
But now, Honda is sharing skills and ideas with its American work force at levels from the assembly line to the design office, and it has increasingly relied on those workers for more than just relatively simple labor. Honda has begun to use its American engineers in Ohio and California to design cars for the United States market, the company's largest, and to improve the tools and processes used to build them.
''We're not here as puppets,'' said Dan Smith, 31 years old, a manager who supervises engineers involved in testing cars at the Marysville plant. Mr. Smith was once an engineer with the Cummins Engine Company.
The percentage of imported parts used at the Marysville plant has fallen significantly; the number of parts suppliers based in the United States has risen to 194, from 27, since the plant opened. (That group includes American companies, Japanese companies based in this country and joint ventures.) And the engines are now being built from scratch at a new plant near Marysville.
 
A Hybrid Vehicle
The Accord itself is now a hybrid, built by workers in both Japan and the United States and exported from both countries. Honda engineers here have designed a two-door version that is now being exported to Japan. An Accord station wagon and all the machinery needed to build it will also be designed at Marysville, and that car will be exported to the European market as well.
''Eventually, we will be able to create full and original vehicle models here, but we have to learn gradually the way Honda wants it done; you have to learn by doing,'' said John Adams, who supervises 150 engineers who build machines and tools for manufacturing the vehicles.
Honda's strategy is to develop and build cars in the main areas where they are sold - Japan, North America and Europe - and even export them, said Scott Whitlock, Honda's executive vice president for United States manufacturing and a former lawyer from Columbus, Ohio.
Viewed in this light, Honda may seem far less threatening to American economic interests than the stereotypical Japanese company.
 
Helping U.S. Competitiveness
Indeed, rather than undermining American competitiveness, the cross-pollination at Honda actually increases it, a number of experts say. They argue that Honda, one of the standard-setters in manufacturing and engineering cars, is helping Americans improve an essential product. The improvements will soon spread to other manufacturers trying to stay even, the theory goes.
For example, the Ford Motor Company last month became the first American auto maker to switch to the production of a new model without stopping the assembly line for more than a day, a practice Japanese auto makers, including Honda in Marysville, have used for some time to increase productivity.
Normally, a plant might stop work for four or five weeks to install new tools. But at Honda, by constructing reprogrammable machines that move on tracks, engineers can slow the production line and quickly shift from the old model to the new one.
As another example, Honda has shown its American supplier, the Inland Steel Company, how to remove tiny imperfections in its steel that hindered the effectiveness of a corrosion-resistant coating, said Matthew Lofton, Inland's general sales manager. Inland later signed up the Chrysler Corporation as a customer for the corrosion-resistant steel.
 
New Management Philosophies
''Plants like this force everyone else to put on their track shoes,'' said David Cole, head of transportation studies at the University of Michigan and an auto industry consultant. He said Honda's Marysville plant enhances American industrial competitiveness ''by introducing new management philosophies and becoming a model for other U.S. firms.''
Such arguments have been voiced passionately by Robert B. Reich, a professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Public Policy at Harvard University. Professor Reich argues that foreign-owned corporations that invest heavily in American operations can sometimes contribute more to American competitiveness than their American-owned counterparts. He says the United States must stop favoring companies simply because they ''fly the U.S. flag.''
As Professor Reich sees it, although profits from Honda go to Japan, that sum accounts for little when compared with the company's outlays for salaries, materials, research and training in the United States. Moreover, world securities markets allow American investors to buy shares in Honda.
Hence, Professor Reich contends that the nation should develop policies governing foreign investment, trade, antitrust and research and development that encourage ''any global corporation that invests in the American work force,'' like Honda.
 
New Spirit in Trade Matters
Specifically, he argues, the United States should work to open foreign markets to goods built by Americans, even if they work for Honda, rather than just to companies with headquarters in the United States, which might be assembling products abroad. He opposes import quotas or retaliatory tariffs, protectionist measures suggested by some American automotive concerns.
In the spirit of Professor Reich's arguments, United States trade officials seem in some ways to be accepting Honda and other Japanese car makers as among their own, despite frequent criticism of Japan. Last month, the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, strongly warned the European Community that this country would protest any attempt in Europe to restrict imports of cars built by Japanese companies in the United States. France and Italy are pressing hard for restrictions.
''We would be remiss if we didn't stress how strongly we feel that a Japanese nameplate car made in our country is an American car,'' Mrs. Hills told a press briefing.
But many in the United States auto industry disagree. They have urged the Government to take a hard line against Japanese auto makers.
 
Auto Workers' Position
The United Automobile Workers union, for example, argues that cars produced at plants like Marysville should be considered imports and counted toward the import quotas voluntarily adopted by Japan. That would mean that Honda and other Japanese auto makers would sell fewer cars in the United States, possibly making it uneconomical to manufacture here. Such a move could reduce the sales of individual models to the point that their American plants might no longer have the production volume to justify the capital expense.
Other proposals, while not specifically aimed at Honda or the auto industry, could restrict imports of engines or components the Japanese auto makers deem vital. The Automotive Parts and Accessories Association, an American trade group, has asked the Senate to tighten restrictions on imported auto parts used by Japanese car makers in this country. The group contends that American auto-parts makers are being excluded from Japanese markets.
American auto executives also criticize the rules and customs hampering American entry into the Japanese market, like the expensive requirement of building exclusive dealerships rather than selling through multi-brand dealerships as permitted in the United States.
The attitude of American auto executives toward the Japanese is complex. Each of the Big Three car makers owns stakes in Japanese auto makers and has joint ventures with them. But they also feel threatened by the stunning success of their Japanese counterparts.
 
'Adversarial Trade'
''I'm uneasy at this stage by the process of Asian ownership,'' said Donald E. Petersen, who recently retired as chairman of Ford. ''It's what Peter Drucker calls adversarial trade, rather than competitive trade. Their objective is to eliminate the competition.''
Don Hilty, chief economist for the Chrysler Corporation, said Professor Reich's argument did not hold up. For one thing, Mr. Hilty said, Honda carries out very little research or development work here. Moreover, as he sees it, the Honda Accord Coupe, which is made exclusively in this country, is no more than ''a derivative, strictly a P.R. exercise.''
Frank Joyce, a spokesman for the United Automobile Workers, criticizes Japanese car makers for paying less than union wages and benefits at American plants like Honda's. The union, anticipating a defeat, called off a vote at the Honda plant on recognizing the U.A.W. as bargaining agent.
Like Honda, other Japanese auto makers have increasingly been obtaining parts and components in the United States while giving American engineers, designers and managers additional responsibility. Nissan, Toyota and Mazda have opened American research and development centers.
 
Honda's Edge at Marysville
Honda management argues, however, that the Marysville plant is the farthest ahead in bringing in Americans at all stages of the process.
Honda workers make many engine parts, assemble engines, turn steel sheet into parts and certify cars for export to Japan.

HEADLINE: Civilian Sworn In as Haiti's President

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, March 13

 BODY:
Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, the only woman on Haiti's Supreme Court, became Provisional President of Haiti today, and the chief of the army declared, with a snappy salute, that his forces were ''at your command.''
''The army will stay in the barracks,'' Maj. Gen. Herard Abraham, its chief, said in a ceremony before hundreds of Haitians and foreign diplomats at the gleaming white presidential palace. The army has dominated the country for the last four years, since the three-decade dictatorship of the Duvalier family was overthrown.
Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot, who was appointed to the high court four years ago, broke an impasse by accepting the presidency after civilian political leaders rejected the chief justice, who was designated by the constitution to succeed Lieut. Gen. Prosper Avril when he stepped down as head of a military Government over the weekend. 
In a brief speech, Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot said that her principal task would be to lead the country to early elections.
 
'No Other Ambition' but Service
''I have no other ambition,'' she said, ''but for the singular service of my country. My Government will be what you want it to be, constantly animated by the breath of your aspirations and your invincible hopes.''
Thousands of Haitians crowded the boulevard and plazas in front of the palace, cheering and waving green branches from trees and shrubs, a symbol here of peace and freedom, as the new President, in a white linen suit, General Abraham, in an olive dress uniform, and his wife, Maryse, stood on the palace steps while the army band played the presidential anthem. Later, the crowd surged behind Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot's motorcade.
There was no violence in the vicinity of the palace, but scattered incidents were reported elsewhere in the capital.
The ceremony, in which the chief of the army and the entire high command indivdually pledged loyalty to a civilian President, was an emotional milestone in a country that since the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship in 1986 has repeatedly been frustrated and battered by military commanders seeking to perpetuate their own power.
Also present in the chandeliered palace chamber were the civilian political leaders who had struggled for the departure of General Avril and had selected Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot as President. Despite their triumph, the civilian political leaders still face street violence, severe economic problems, vast political differences, fierce rivalries and a paucity of political experience.
 
Civilians Outflank Military
Nevertheless, for the first time since President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to exile in France in 1986, civilians have outflanked the military, taken power for themselves and selected the country's temporary leader from their own ranks.
''It's certainly a great day for this country, a great day for democracy,'' said Alvin P. Adams, the United States Ambassador here, shortly before lifting a glass of champagne to the new President.
One concern of many Haitians is whether the army will try to disarm the hundreds of former members of the Duvaliers' Tontons Macoutes civilian security forces and, if so, whether they will succeed. One senior officer said he thought the former Tontons Macoutes might ''keep quiet'' if they were left alone. ''They would like to live in peace like everyone else in this new situation,'' the officer said.
 
Job Is Seen as Limited
Late this afternoon, the 12 political leaders who were instrumental in bringing about the latest changes met with the new president in her first formal meeting in the palace.
Most of the political leaders say they see the job of the provisional goverment as extremely limited and in her acceptance speech Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot, who has written several books on law, seemed to agree. She said she expected to oversee ''the normal functioning of the administration'' without undertaking ''profound initiatives.''
Francois Latortue, a former Minister of Justice who appointed Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot to the high court in 1986, said that contrary to widespread reports on Monday she was not the only woman serving as a judge in Haiti. He estimated that about 10 women serve on various courts, adding that most are justices of the peace and deal with misdemeanor crimes.

HEADLINE: Aid Hanoi on Boat People, U.N. Official Urges

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, March 13

 BODY:
Faced with continuing United States opposition to the forced repatriation of boat people from Hong Kong to Vietnam, a leading United Nations official appealed today for a sharp increase in international aid to Vietnam. The aim of the aid would be to stop the boat people from fleeing Vietnam in the first place.
But the official, Thorvald Stoltenberg, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, told a meeting of representatives from about 25 countries here today that he expected the impasse on the issue of the boat people to continue. 
Last January, an international meeting here came close to an agreement to start forcibly repatriating boat people in Southeast Asia determined to be economic migrants, next July. But the agreement fell through when the United States said it would not accept any forced returns until the beginning of next year.
The meeting asked the High Commissioner to mediate, but today her reported that the United States had not shown any willingness to compromise on the length of the moratorium before deportations could begin.
In response, Mr. Stoltenberg ''made a plea for more economic assistance for Vietnam to deal with those pockets of poverty where many boat people come from'' said a spokesman of the agency, Raymond Hall.
 
Most Are Fleeing Poverty
The agency is so eager to attack the root causes contributing to the outflow that it is prepared to play the unusual role of ''catalyst and coordinator'' of aid to Vietnam, Mr. Hall said.
Mr. Stoltenberg, a former Norwegian Foreign Minister who took over the United Nations job in January, told the meeting that 50 percent of the boat people come from four impoverished coastal districts of Quang Ninh province in the north, near Haiphong.
Since the Communist victory there in 1975, the United States has been at the forefront of efforts to stop foreign aid from reaching that country.
A Western diplomat at today's meeting said ''it's definitely true.''
''If you want to lure people back you have to offer them something,'' the diplomat said.
But donor countries have so far pledged only $18 million of the $108 million that the High Commissioner's office has appealed for this year to care for the boat people and help voluntary returnees readapt to Vietnamese life.

HEADLINE: Khomeini's Son Urges No Concessions on Hostages

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, March 13

 BODY:
Two leading militants in the Iranian leadership have issued statements strongly opposing the release of Western hostages taken in Lebanon by pro-Iranian militias, stating that Iran should refrain from talks with the United States on the issue.
The remarks, by Ahmed Khomeini, the son of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who died last June, and former Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, indicate that President Hashemi Rafsanjani has been unable to achieve a consensus in the Iranian leadership on the release of the hostages.
Arab and Western diplomats who are experts in Iranian affairs said that until a yearlong power struggle within the ranks of Iran's leadership is resolved, no action can be expected on the hostage issue.
President Rafsanjani and other Iranian officials have suggested over the last two weeks that Teheran was willing to mediate the release of the Western hostages in Lebanon in return for a resumption of economic, diplomatic and technical aid from the West. 
But Mr. Khomeini asserted in a speech to police officers on Monday that ''the United States will never see the day when the Islamic Republic will make concessions to Washington.''
 
U.S. Is 'Wasting Its Time'
Mr. Khomeini, who denied that Iran is directly implicated in the holding of hostages, said ''the United States is wasting its time'' if it is trying to open channels to Iran.
Ayatollah Khomeini's son is not a member of Parliament or of the Rafsanjani Government, but he continues to influence policy in Iran through a large network of allies in powerful posts in the Revolutionary Guards militia, several state-owned financial institutions, the Interior Ministry and the Iranian intelligence apparatus.
Hojatolislam Mohtashemi, a member of the Iranian Parliament, wrote in an editorial in the Teheran daily Kayhan on Saturday that ''freedom for the hostages means breaking the chains of bloodthirsty wolves.''
Arab intelligence officials and Western diplomats say Hojatolislam Mohtashemi played the major role in building up the Party of God militia in Lebanon as a fighting force. Groups attached to the Party of God are presumed to hold at least 16 Western hostages.
Experts on Iran say that a competition has been raging among factions in Iran over the control of the militias aligned with the Party of God. In the last few months, President Rafsanjani has tried to reassert his control over the militias' financing and supplies.
While this effort is believed to have been somewhat successful, a considerable segment of the assistance to the militias continues to come from other factions in Iran, notably those connected with Mr. Mohtashemi and presumably Mr. Khomeini. Arab experts on Iranian affairs noted that the militias encourage this competition within Iran, since they benefit from it.
Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, appeared to call for an end to the infighting within the country by suggesting that it gives an impression of weakness. He accused the Western press of encouraging the notion that Iran is seeking help from the West because the country has been ''finally brought to its knees.''
 
Iran Seeks $27 Billion
The latest Iranian contact with the West, made public only on Monday, was a visit in late February by an International Monetary Fund delegation at Iran's request. The negotiations in Teheran were the first talks between the I.M.F. and Iran in 10 years.
Iran is seeking $27 billion to repair its economy and increase production of oil and petrochemicals, industries that are vital to earning foreign currency but that were wrecked by the long war with Iraq that ended in 1988.
But Western officials say no loans can happen without approval from the I.M.F. and Western financial groups - which is unlikely as long as Western hostages are held in Lebanon.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From President's News Session on Foreign and Domestic Issues

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's news conference in Washington yesterday, as transcribed by The New York Times:
 
OPENING STATEMENT
Today I want to speak about how we can best help two democracies in our hemisphere, Panama and Nicaragua. These nations need our help to heal deep wounds inflicted by years of strife and oppression, years of loss and deprivation. . . . I've taken an important step today. As a demonstration of our resolve to be part of the process of reconciliation, I just signed an executive order to end the economic embargo against Nicaragua. . . . And next, I'm asking the Congress and the American people to join me in crafting a bipartisan agreement to help both countries. . . .
I'm proposing the creation of a Fund for Democracy to assist in the reconstruction and development of these two countries, and I'm requesting the Congress to approve, by April 5th, a package of assistance of $800 million for these two countries, using funds from the defense budget. This package consists of $500 million for Panama - already requested in that Jan. 25th proposal to Congress, along with $70 million for refugees, and an additional $300 million for Nicaragua. . . .
In addition, under existing authorities I'm initiating immediate action to provide $21 million of previously appropriated economic aid, principally for food and - and humanitarian assistance. I also will be sending to the Congress in the future a budget amendment for an additional $200 million in fiscal '91 for Nicaragua, consistent with the approach that we've taken this year. . . . 
I am prepared because of the dire need for these funds to ask for a waiver of the Budget Act to allow this critical program to proceed on a required timetable.
 
Quick Action Is Urged
I urge the Congress to move quickly, and also urge in the strongest terms that it not add any extraneous requests - items to this request. . . . Our help is needed swiftly to bring about demilitarization and advance the whole Central American peace process. . . .
Let me . . . give you the three broad categories of assistance: aid for democracy, for development and for demilitarization. . . .
Development and demilitarization, they go hand in hand. They start when we provide textbooks for children, when we create thousands of new jobs, when the hand that held a gun guides a plow. In short, as we demobilize the military we must mobilize the market. This is a great and historic task, but we are inspired by the courage of our neighbors. We're close - very, very close - to a hemisphere that is completely democratic, a compass of freedom that spans half the world, from Alaska to Argentina. . . .
And now I'd be glad to respond to questions. And, Helen, I believe you have the first one.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Taxes and the Deficit
Q. Your warm reception of the Rostenkowski plan - does that mean you are ready to negotiate tax increases and a freeze on Social Security benefits, things you have never gone for in the past?
A. No, it doesn't. The answer is no. . .
Q. You're not willing to negotiate, or what is your --
A. Overall feeling? Look, I think he, without rancour, without a lot of rhetoric, made a very broad proposal. We've made a proposal, the Administration. We now would like to hear from the budget process on the Hill what their proposal is, and then we'll talk.
But I . . . was being receptive through not knocking the things in it we don't like - and there are plenty. . . .
Q. You're not saying that you would go for a tax increase or --
A. No, I'm not for a tax --
Q. You don't want a freeze on Social Security --
A. Well, there's a lot of things I'm not for that are in his proposal. A lot, including taxes.
 
Recognition of Lithuania
Q. Mr. President, the United States has never recognized the forced incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union. Now that Lithuania has declared its independence, the United States seems to be moving tentatively toward full recognition. Is that because we're afraid of offending Mr. Gorbachev or don't want to alienate him?
A. It's because we want to see the evolution of the control of the territory there. And also we want to see peaceful resolution to this question.
Q. Well, do we still regard Lithuania as a captive nation, along with the --
A. We might not use the word, but we never have regarded Lithuania as incorporated into the Soviet Union. That's been our policy. . .
 
Disbanding the Contras
Q. Mr. President, are you concerned about the apparent reluctance of the contras to disband, and what can you do about it?
A. Yes, I am concerned about it . . . and I'm also concerned about certain military action by the Sandinistas. But I'm also encouraged, Britt, because yesterday I talked to Dan Quayle and he told me of his visit with Ortega, where Ortega seemed concerned about -seemed willing to transfer the Defense Ministry, seemed willing to transfer the Interior Ministry, and was open about the discussion of reducing - I want to be careful here I don't overstate it - but reducing military action on both sides.
So I can't say I'm not concerned, but I am encouraged the way it's going so far.
 
U.S. Policy on Israel
Q. Mr. President, do you regret the other day raising the issue of settlements in East Jerusalem?
A. No, I don't regret it. I think all the speculation and commentary of the last 10 days have blown things way out of proportion. What I was doing was reiterating United States policy. But let me say this: right now in Israel there is internal developments taking place in the political scene there, and I do not want to look in any way like we're trying to mingle into the internal affairs of Israel, as they're going through this difficult political problem right now. And so I will answer no more on it.
 
The Situation in China
Q. Mr. President, you opened your comments today by saying that the day of the dictator was over . . . and yet the exception to that rule is the situation in China. . . . Do you have any second thoughts about the approach that you took . . . and your sending of your high-level envoys there, and any thoughts that this policy must now change because of the lack of response from the Chinese?
A. No. But I'm not happy with the evolution of reform in China but I have no regrets about that. And I'm reinforced by - by a lot of expert opinion that feels that the approach I took, accomplishing something by executive order that the Congress wanted to do dramatically later on through legislation, was the proper approach. And I - so I hope - hope our policy will bear more fruit. But no, I am not happy with the status quo.
Q. Well, Mr. President, if you're not happy with the status quo, why not change your policy now to take a tougher line toward the Chinese regime?
A. Because I'm familiar with China and I think we're on the right track. And I hope that we'll see a - an evolution of more reform. And that's exactly why not change it now.
 
Reaction to Gephardt
Q. Why does Gephardt get under your skin so much? You've got a - I don't know, 80 percent approval rating. He makes a speech attacking you and --
A. Well, what have I said? Now what would make you think that he gets under my skin?
Q. He says you're not a strong leader, and want people around the White House --
A. Oh, I know, I know, that's so discouraging. But why do you think he gets under my skin? The honest answer is - I know you won't believe this - it doesn't. It doesn't. I think we're going in the right direction, we're taking substance in policy. I think the -many in the Congress think that we are being responsive. But look, I expect that, I expect that kind of political criticism.
But I think if you want to talk about the substance of his ideas, do I think it's a good idea to loan money to the Soviet Union today? No. We have no request for food aid to the Soviet Union; do you just want to put it on a ship and send it over there? No, I don't think that's a particularly brilliant idea. But I don't want to knock the man, maybe he'll come on a good idea one of these days.
 
Concern Over the Hostages
Q. Mr. President, last week you were so concerned about the hostages that you were willing to take a questionable call, and it might have been from the Iranian President and then, of course, you found out it wasn't. In response, Rafsanjani made a statement saying that you had been trying to get ahold of him for a month. Did you actually then try to place a call to the real person, or could you clarify --
A. I don't know where he got that. I saw that statement, and it was - there was no truth in it. . . . I think the bottom line is you have to say: would you do it again based on the information you had? And I'd say, yes, I probably would. . . .
But what's wrong with reaching out and touching someone when the hostages are at stake? The hostages are at stake here. And what's wrong with trying? And I, look, I feel this all the time. I've talked about this, that I will go the extra mile. And when the whole story comes out on this, you all are going to be very, very fascinated with the details.
Q. Tell us.
A. Very fascinated. But I'm just telling you that it is important - it is very important to run down every avenue in terms of these hostages. And I would be remiss if I didn't. . . .
Q. Can I follow up, Mr. President?
A. Yes.
Q. If you didn't try to reach him for a month, can you say whether you or anyone acting on your behalf did try to reach him at all?
A. Have we been trying to reach Rafsanjani?
Q. Have you tried, yes?
A. No, other than this one, one phone call that turns out to be a hoax.
Q. So as far as what you can tell, what he was saying just didn't make any sense.
A. Yes. It's very much like the rhetoric that they use from time to time. He's got some political problems at home, and we understand that. The main thing is can we move forward and get the hostages out. And I'll repeat, good will begets good will. . . .
 
Soviet Political System
Q. Mr. President, I understand that Tass is reporting this morning that the Soviet Parliament has granted President Gorbachev the expanded powers he wants and has been requesting. I'm interested, sir, if you side with those within the Soviet Union who fear that there are not sufficient checks and balances on this new Presidential system, that it could result in a more totalitarian Soviet Union? How you feel this might affect your dealings with Gorbachev, and whether you envision extending this Fund for Democracy perhaps one day to the Soviet Union itself?
A. I answer that by saying I stay out of the internal affairs and deliberations of the Soviet Union. And they are going through a process of reform which we support in broad terms, perestroika. They're going through a process of glasnost, which is openness, which we support. And it would be very inappropriate for the President of the United States to start passing judgment as that process of perestroika, democratization if you will, moves forward.
And so, yes, the Soviets have created a new post of president, I hear. But that's their business, and we will work with the - in this instance President Gorbachev. As you know, I think we have a reasonably good relationship there, a respectful one. And I'm going to continue to work with him.
Q. Well, can you say, sir, whether you think that as you continue to work with him, that will be affected in any way by these changes that have taken place? . . . And would you see involving the Soviet Union in this Fund for Democracy?
A. I think the answer is to help in a technical way as best we can for moving - helping the Soviets move toward a market economies and free markets and those kinds of considerations. . . . You know, there's discussion of an Eastern development bank. The question is out there whether the Soviets should be members of that bank or not. And as a matter of fact, we have some deliberations going on as to what the U.S. position should be right now. I'm not prepared to state it, but I've been spending some time on this question. . . .
 
U.S.-Japan Issues
Q. Mr. President, after your meeting in Palm Springs with Prime Minister Kaifu, he took a real beating in the Japanese Diet. And I wonder in retrospect were there any misunderstandings in your conversations? . . .
A. You know what? I think those reports just highlight the sensitivity of the situation in Japan. And I think the - as far as I'm concerned, the talk, the talks were very good.
Q. Just one follow-up. You said in a speech the day after you got back to the Electronics Association that you had discussed telecommunications with him. And that apparently came as a surprise to some people in Japan. Was that a brief discussion, a lengthy one?
A. A broad, a broad discussion of several categories. . . . We left the details of all of these categories that are so well known as differences between the U.S. and Japan to the experts.
 
Priority on Foreign Aid
Q. Mr. President, your opening statement - in your opening statement you appealed to Congress to pass your aid program, but you did not appeal to the American people. And one of the problems a lot of Congressmen say they're having is that foreign aid at this time is not a high priority for a lot of people. What do you - do you think an appeal, first of all, to ordinary Americans is necessary, and what do you say to people who think that perhaps what may be seen as the first part of a peace dividend is going overseas?
A. I think you put your finger on a good point. However, I believe that both Nicaragua and Panama have strong support from the American people. . . . And I am convinced that when the American people understand what we're talking about offsetting proposals in defense - in other words, not going in there and costing them more, or taking it away from some other program - that it will have strong support.
 
Cheney-Webster Differences
Q. What about the differences reported between Secretary Cheney and C.I.A. Director Webster over the threat assessment --
A. Just a minute --
Q. -- in the event that Gorbachev is thrown out of power.
A. One minute on that one. As I've said before, I don't see any real disagreement here. No. I tried to answer that yesterday and I expect I didn't, didn't lay it to rest. But I don't think anybody believes, including Cheney, that the Soviet system is going to go back to where it was in, in, you know, before 1980 and the middle of the 80's. But there are differences. When you go to try to predict with accuracy, based on intentions.
And so I, I've talked to them now and I, I feel that they're pretty close together and I -it's difficult when you have a fast-changing world and yet you take a position like I do. We must retain a credible defense. And you get into a big debate - well, what is credible? And I think that's what you're seeing here. So I can tell you - I mean, talk to these gentlemen. I don't think that there is this enormous difference between the intelligence community . . . and and the Secretary. I think we've come up with a prudent, well-thought out defense plan. And there will be changes, I'm sure, after our cooperation with and consultation with Congress. But believe me, there - these are not diametrically different views that you're reading about.
Thank you all very much.

HEADLINE: President of Panama Ends His 13-Day Fast

DATELINE: PANAMA, March 13

 BODY:
President Guillermo Endara of Panama today ended a 13-day fast begun as ''an act of commiseration with a suffering people'' and as a protest against his country's worsening economic situation.
The President left the Metropolitan Cathedral here late this morning, at approximately the time President Bush said in Washington that the United States ''must act and act soon'' on aid to Nicaragua and Panama. The Bush Administration has promised $1 billion in aid and credits to Panama's new civilian Government, but the proposal is stalled in Congress.
Mr. Endara had no immediate comment on Mr. Bush's pledge of a renewed effort to get the aid package approved. But he said ''the messages of solidarity received from inside and outside Panama, including from leaders of brother countries, fill me with satisfaction and faith in my people.''
The President said he was ending his hunger strike because his conscience had told him ''the moment has come'' to return to his daily work routine.
The Associated Press reported that Mr. Endara began the fast weighing 240 pounds and lost 16 pounds.
He expressed hope that his ''personal and individual gesture'' would inspire others to help him end the country's economic crisis.

HEADLINE: Nicaraguans on Both Sides Praise Embargo's End

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, March 13

 BODY:
After five years of deepening economic hardship, much of it attributable to United States sanctions, Sandinista officials and opposition business leaders today applauded President Bush's decision to end the American embargo on trade with Nicaragua.
''The lifting of the economic embargo against Nicaragua is an act of justice that has been delayed for too long,'' said Vice President Sergio Ramirez Mercado. ''The economic embargo, the financial boycott, the closing of source of credits for all these years was not an act of injustice against the Sandinista Front as the party in power, but against the entire Nicaraguan nation, against all our people.''
Relief over Mr. Bush's decision, which also includes proposals for $300 million in new economic aid, was expressed not only by the Sandinista Government, which was the target of the sanctions, but also by anti-Sandinista leaders, some of whom had come to oppose the embargo as an excessively blunt and destructive political instrument. 
''It is extremely positive for Nicaragua in all respects,'' said Ramiro Gurdian Ortiz, an influential opposition business leader, referring to today's announcement. ''This opens up for us the biggest market in the world: the American market.''
 
The Timing Wins Praise
The Vice President, Mr. Ramirez, said the new package announced by Mr. Bush would not directly benefit his Government, which was defeated in national elections by the United States-backed National Opposition Union last month and is scheduled to leave power April 25.
But he described the decision as an important step toward rebuilding the nation's battered economy. And he praised its timing, interpreting it as an effort to end a decade of conflict between the United States and the Sandinista leadership.
''This could have been done perfectly well on the 25th of April,'' Mr. Ramirez said. ''I interpret it as a positive gesture from President Bush to President Ortega.''
This afternoon, the Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry formally invited the Bush Administration to send a delegation to study the economic situation here ''so that the economic aid can reach the Nicaraguan people as soon as possible.''
In a further softening of his Government's public statements on the coming transition of power, Mr. Ramirez emphasized that the Sandinista leaders would respect the right of the President-elect, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, to name the senior officials of the Sandinista People's Army and the Ministry of the Interior, which controls the security police.
''Mrs. Chamorro has the constitutional and legal powers, and we are going to respect them,'' Mr. Ramirez said.
 
A Denial on Arms Handout
Commenting on widespread evidence that Government officials had been handing out automatic weapons to Sandinista supporters in urban neighborhoods and in the countryside, Mr. Ramirez denied that the Government had a policy of arming civilians, and said efforts were being made to control such activity.
In many areas of the country, Sandinista supporters have spoken openly of receiving arms from the Government in the days since its electoral defeat, and some senior Sandinista officials, insisting on anonymity, have defended the step as an effort to prevent persecution of Sandinista militants by the incoming government.
But Mr. Ramirez asserted that any such reports were of isolated incidents and did not reflect a Government decision.
''We are not pursuing any Government policy of handing out weapons,'' Mr. Ramirez said in an interview. ''The Chief of Staff of the army convened a meeting of the military commanders of all the regions today to analyze the current situation and take the measures necessary to control any abnormal situations that might have been raised in this sense despite the Government's policy.''
 
Harsh Stand Is Softened
Mr. Ramirez's remarks appeared to represent a further shift away from the harsh posture assumed last week by Sandinista leaders in support of demands for demobilization of the contra rebels and preservation of the Sandinista-controlled army and Ministry of the Interior.
That defiant position was most vividly expressed in a speech last Thursday by President Daniel Ortega Saavedra suggesting that the country was now in a ''calm before the storm.'' And it was buttressed by Sandinista efforts to pass sweeping new laws granting immunity from prosecution for any crimes committed during Sandinista rule, and granting full, permanent property rights to any person or institution occupying government property.
Speaking today, Mr. Ramirez defended the legislation, which has been condemned by opposition leaders, describing it as a necessary step to prevent ''revanchism and revenge'' after the transition of power. But he acknowledged that the early versions of the laws had been poorly drafted, and said that the Sandinista-controlled National Assembly had recognized the need for important changes during floor debate.
The law granting immunity from prosecution, he noted, had been heavily amended before being approved Saturday in a form that would specifically give amnesty to combatants on both sides of the country's long contra war. In addition, he said, the law was amended again this morning to put it into effect immediately so as to remove the possibility that it could be used to pardon crimes that have not yet been committed.
''It was an error to send to the Assembly a law that wasn't properly scrutinized,'' he said. ''The first law of amnesty was really a bad law because it would have erased the penalty for all crimes, including common crimes. That is terrible, and for that reason we changed it immediately.''

HEADLINE: INDIA RE-EXAMINES ITS FOREIGN POLICY

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MADRAS, India, March 10

 BODY:
In India, where a special relationship with Moscow has brought diplomatic and trade benefits for decades, the tumultuous collapse of European Communism and changes in the Soviet Union itself are forcing the most fundamental rethinking of New Delhi's foreign policies since independence in 1947.
The turmoil in the Soviet bloc has been a blow to Indian intellectuals, many of whom have become apologists for authoritarian Communist governments while living in a democratic nation professing to be nonaligned. Indian socialists have played large roles in making foreign and domestic policies.
''The deep alienation in Eastern Europe came as a big shock to many here,'' said N. Ram, editor of the liberal Madras-based national newspaper The Hindu. ''Nobody really knew the extent of it. It destroyed many impressions and delusions.'' 
India's Foreign Minister, Inder Kumar Gujral, said in an interview that the lesson of the last few months was that ''successful socialism needs democratic party participation.''
 
Redefining Issue of Alliances
As for nonalignment with the United States or the Soviet Union, a movement in which India has taken a leading role, he said it was made ''irrelevant'' by recent events and would have to be redefined.
Mr. Gujral, a former Ambassador to Moscow, said that the most welcome recent event from the viewpoint of the developing world was the collapse of the spheres of influence that developed after World War II.
''Spheres of influence was another name for covert imperialism,'' he said. In place of this division of the world, he said that regional cooperation was growing, replacing nationalism and altering the meaning of patriotism. He referred to the prospects of a united Europe as a lesson to other regions including this one, where a South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation has made little headway.
While there is general agreement here that relations with neighboring nations - Pakistan excepted - have improved, there are new questions about how much New Delhi can depend on traditional Soviet support. India has enjoyed generous trade concessions, including the ability to pay for goods and services in rupees, which are useless to Moscow except in return trade.
 
Moscow's Support Uncertain
Moscow frequently backed India in world organizations, using its veto at the United Nations to block action on Kashmir, which India partly controls in contravention of United Nations resolutions. New Delhi's troops are trying to crush a separatist movement there.
Nikhil Chakravarty, editor of the leftist magazine Mainstream, said that on a recent visit to Moscow he was left with the impression that the Soviet Union would not use its veto, which he called ''a cold war ploy,'' on the Kashmir issue again.
He added, however, that Moscow was firm in insisting that Kashmir was a matter to be settled between India and Pakistan. But he also said that ''anything the Russians do today they do in consultation with Mr. Baker,'' the United States Secretary of State.
Mr. Chakravarty was one of the few Indian journalists to visit Eastern Europe during the revolutionary changes there, and not until January. Only in the last few weeks have analyses by him and others begun to appear in intellectual journals and newsmagazines.
 
Slow to Debate 1989 Change
India's two Communist parties, in whose offices portraits of Stalin can still be found, have shied away from official comment altogether.
The debate on India's response to the remaking of Europe was slow to begin in this country for several reasons.
Neither newspapers nor the national television network had correspondents at the momentous events of 1989.
Second, India was also changing its government in December after a bitterly fought election. There was little time for a general foreign policy debate in the new administration as Prime Minister Singh and Mr. Gujral were forced to concentrate first on Kashmir.
A third explanation lies in the general lack of public discussion of foreign affairs, a topic largely kept out of the political arena by India's powerful and secretive Ministry of External Affairs.
Officials and former members of the foreign policy establishment insist that there has been been complete public consensus on the two guiding principles of Indian policy, which they do not see as contradictory: no formal alliance with either superpower bloc and close ties to Moscow, cemented in a 1971 friendship treaty. A corollary to this is a belief that the United States has always misunderstood and been hostile to India.
''If you were to have referendum in India today - or if you had taken it ten years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago -and you asked the question: Which country does an Indian admire most?'' said A. P. Venkateswaran, a writer on international affairs and former director of the foreign ministry, ''the answer would always have been the United States.''
''But if you asked the question: Which country has stood by India in her time of the need, the U.S.S.R. would always come first,'' he added. ''Maybe today it would still come first.''
Government officials say that relations with the United States began to improve even before India's November election or the changes in Europe.

Lithuanian-Americans React With Joy After 50-Year Wait

BYLINE: By SUZANNE DALEY

 BODY:
A party in Chicago for a local Lithuanian-language radio program on Sunday erupted into a more spontaneous celebration. Just minutes earlier, Lithuania had proclaimed itself free of the Soviet Union.
''People started applauding and, almost as if on cue, they stood up and started singing the Lithuanian national anthem,'' said Daiva Meile, who was among the guests. ''There was euphoria - such a sense of pride.'' 
By yesterday, Ms. Meile said, much of the elation in Chicago's large Lithuanian community had cooled to concern, as the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, struck a stern note, calling Lithuania's declaration of independence ''illegitimate and invalid.'' The concerns of Chicago's Lithuanians were echoed in several of the country's other Lithuanian communities.
Ms. Meile, a spokeswoman for the American Lithuanian Council, a group founded in 1940 to seek Lithuania's independence, said many Lithuanian-Americans were begining to realize that there would probably be difficult times ahead for their motherland.
 
'Not Going to Be Easy'
''We've begun to sense that it is not going to be easy,'' Ms. Meile said. ''We do not doubt that it will happen. But it's going to take years of negotiating with the Soviet Union - hopefully negotiating.''
''More than anything, I think people are worried about the possibility of economic sanctions,'' she said, adding that almost all of Lithuania's electricity, gas and coal in Lithuania comes from the Soviet Union. ''To cut that off would be really a hardship.''
The nationalist spirit that has motivated Lithuania to be the first among the states of the Soviet Union to declare independence has been nurtured by a number of factors, experts on Baltic affairs say. Among them are a homogenous population, a strong Roman Catholic faith and a long history of rebellion against foreign rule.
''In the 19th century under the oppression of the czars, Lithuanians were not even allowed to speak their own language,'' said Asta Banionis, the director of governmental affairs for the Lithuanian-American Community Inc., a group that seeks to foster and maintain Lithuania's heritage and culture. ''There developed a whole underground for books.''
 
Differences With Baltic Neighbors
Others point to a number of distinctions between Lithuania and its Baltic neighbors to the north, Estonia and Latvia.
After 50 years of domination by the Soviet Union, both Estonia and Latvia now have large numbers of Russians and others of non-Baltic descent, who were attracted by industrialization and better living in the Baltics or sent there by Moscow, or both.
But Lithuania, with a population larger than that of its two Baltic neighbors, has a higher percentage of people of Lithuanian descent - about 80 percent, compared with a population about 60 percent Estonian in Estonia and around 50 percent Latvian in Latvia.
Also, the Catholic church also never lost its grip on the population, experts say. It operated in secret for years, providing a framework for rebellion.
 
Church 'Gave Them Strength'
''It gave, throughout, a structure and a moral basis to hold together some sort of political alienation,'' said Martha Olcott, a professor at Colgate University who is an expert on the region. ''The church is part of their lives; they maintained secret churches. It gave them strength.''
Some Lithuanian-Americans expressed disappointment with the Bush Administration, saying they wished the President would take a more aggressive stance in the matter.
In the East New York section of Brooklyn yesterday, Cornelius Bucnys, the editor of a Lithuanian-language weekly, Darbininkas, was preparing today's issue. In it he calls for Lithuanian-Americans to write to Congress and to President Bush, urging that they strongly support Lithuanian independence.

HEADLINE: Upheaval in the East;
Cash-Starved Parties Introduce Voters in Hungary to the Fund-Raiser

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUDAPEST, March 11

 BODY:
Democracy has its price, as Hungary's new political parties are learning now that they must pay the bill for the posters, leaflets, 30-second television spots, lapel pins, cigarette lighters, helicopters, hot-air balloons and other props of this country's first full-fledged electoral campaign in 40 years.
To come up with money to get their message across, the parties are looking for help at home and abroad to supplement the fixed sum they get from the Government. Like-minded foreign political parties have been tapped for contributions in cash and in kind, and Hungary's aspiring entrepreneurial class is being wooed from all sides.
But fund-raising, in the style that Americans are used to, is still an undeveloped art in Hungary. ''It doesn't work here,'' said Anna Petrosovits, president of the Social Democratic Party of Hungary. ''We tried to invite people to coffees and teas, but there was no - how shall I put it - outcome.'' 
The Alliance for Free Democrats recently sent an invitation to foreign entrepreneurs in Budapest, written in English in gold letters, for a ''fund-raiser art exhibition and champagne reception.'' Several dozen business people showed up and joined in a vigorous discussion about Hungary's economic future, but few made any move toward the clear plastic contribution box.
''This wasn't really a fund-raiser,'' said Tibor Vidos, executive director of the Free Democrats, ''because we haven't raised any funds.''
 
Too Direct an Approach
Like door-to-door campaigning, asking people for money is simply not done at this stage of Hungarian democracy. In both cases, the approach is too direct and too intrusive and would rub people the wrong way, political strategists say.
So the parties resort to more indirect methods - like a series of balls sponsored by the Hungarian Democratic Forum, described as modest but elegant by one leader. After expenses, the balls brought in about 30,000 forints, or $5,000 at the official exchange rate, according to Attila Kollar, the party's general accountant.
''You have to handle these things very carefully,'' Mr. Kollar said. ''Hungary is still a poor country, and we don't have these traditions. Even spending too much money on posters can cause disapproval among the silent majority.''
As negotiated between the departing Communist Government and the opposition parties, Hungarian electoral law does not require the parties to report where they get their money or how they spend it until 30 days after the elections. Contributors of more than 50,000 forints have to be identified, and the only prohibition is against donations from foreign governments and state-owned companies.
The opposition parties say they deliberately left the door open for contributions from foreign political parties as a way to counterbalance the weight and wealth of the ruling Socialist Party, as the majority wing of the former Communist Party is now called. For the same reason, they mostly decline to say exactly how much they have received, saying it would only lay them open to political accusations.
 
Rumors Fill the Void
In the absence of hard information, rumors have filled the void, rumors so widespread that spokesmen for several parties denied them, even before they were asked. Thus, the Free Democrats said they had not received any help from the Soros Foundation, headed by the New York financier George Soros, and the Social Democrats scoffed at reports that they had received $4 million from the Socialist International.
But the Social Democrats confirm that they do receive considerable help from Western European social democratic parties. The Democratic Forum said it had received money and equipment from Christian Democratic parties from West Germany and elsewhere, while the Free Democrats said a significant sum had been contributed by the West German Free Democrats.
Most of the parties complain that they have had to raise their budgets sharply since the campaign got under way. The estimated costs range from $500,000 for the Democratic Forum to $1 million for the Social Democrats. Almost every party said that to meet its goal, it had to take out a loan.
To people's amazement, combined with bemusement, even the Socialist Party, which after 40 years in power has considerable institutional holdings, is claiming poverty. At a news conference last week, the president of the party, Rezso Nyers, said it had to take out a loan to pay for its campaign. While he would not say how much, he commented acidly that it was ''no more than what the Free Democrats get from abroad.'' A party spokesman later said the campaign budget was close to $833,000.
 
TV Time Is Limited
Because of a rule limiting paid political advertising on television to six minutes a day - distributed in 30-second spots to the 12 national parties -television time does not consume the money here that it does in the West. The cost of 30 seconds on the two state-controlled channels ranges from $1,000 to $20,000, depending on the time slots, which are distributed by lot.
Since no one party can mount a television blitz, the competition for the voters' attention is taking place elsewhere, with each party staking out its speciality. The Social Democrats are planning to drop leaflets from helicopters.
The Democratic Forum has a balloon it uses above provincial cities. The Socialists have a near-monopoly on Budapest's lampposts with thousands of banners, hung by a Spanish-Hungarian joint venture at a cost of $50 apiece.
The most graphically striking poster of the campaign is one distributed by the Democratic Forum, a mock film poster for ''Comrades,'' showing a Soviet officer, his beefy neck viewed from the back, with the words, ''The End'' written at the top in Russian.

HEADLINE: Fiscal Fire in New York

 BODY:
New York State has fallen into serious financial trouble. Gov. Mario Cuomo's proposed budget, just two months old, is already way out of balance. The outlook is so bad that the bond rating agencies have sounded the alarm. There's a fiscal fire. Where are the firefighters? 
Edward Regan, a Republican and the State Comptroller, says the budget gap has grown to $1.5 billion in just two months. Yet Mr. Cuomo has not come up with a plan to close that gap. Only he has the standing and strength to galvanize support for what have to be tough decisions. He is the Governor. The question reverberates: Where is the Governor?
The Senate Republicans, led by Ralph Marino of Long Island, continue to ignore reality in the face of Mr. Regan's credible findings. Assembly leader Mel Miller, a Democrat, recognizes the grave reality but lacks the political leverage of a governor. If Mr. Cuomo means to put the state back on a sound fiscal footing, he'll have to reach out to the public and the business community fast. The new budget should be in place in 17 days.
An economic slump now deprives New York and other Northeastern states of anticipated tax revenues. States cannot control such profound economic trends but they do control how they react to economic swings. Years of sloppy fiscal management in Albany mean a downturn can quickly become a crisis.
The state has consistently overestimated revenues. It has cut taxes without restraining spending. It has operated at a deficit and doesn't hesitate to roll debt from one year into the next. It has allowed short-term borrowing to mushroom to an all-time high of nearly $5 billion. And Mr. Cuomo's budgets, with the Legislature's concurrence, have relied too heavily on one-shot revenues and raids on the reserves of authorities and trust funds.
Now, with the economy slowing, the state is running out of options. Mr. Cuomo's January budget proposed a package of new fees and taxes, some spending cuts and increases. He urges holding off the next phase of the personal income tax cut, which could add about $400 million in revenue next year, and more than $1.5 billion the year after that. With remarkable irresponsibility, Senate Republicans continue to balk, but even if they ultimately agree, the budget will be out of balance because of the revenue shortfall.
Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature will ultimately balance the budget on paper. If recent history is any guide, they will probably come up with a patchwork of cuts and taxes for 1991 that will leave the structural problems to bite again in 1992. The most solid proposal - increasing the state's 8-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax - would provide a much-needed revenue stream.
But the state needs fiscal reform as well.
A comprehensive plan for reform would include adoption of the same strict budget procedures the state long ago imposed on New York City. The state has to reduce short-term borrowing, eliminate the accumulated deficit and reduce the cost of state spending, which has grown 80 percent during Mr. Cuomo's tenure. Its costly Medicaid program needs examination, as does education spending, up 84 percent in seven years.
''We need more discipline,'' the Governor acknowledged when he proposed his budget. ''Everybody knows it. This is an opportunity to develop that strength.'' Right, and what the state needs now is a leader who will do just that.

HEADLINE: Single-Room Housing Won't End Homelessness

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''The Homelessness Test'' (editorial, March 1), you recognize that the loss in single room occupancy housing, or S.R.O.'s, has had a serious effect on the numbers of people living on the streets and in shelters. Mental health research on the homeless confirms that this housing shortage is more critical than ''deinstitutionalization'' and other mental health problems among the homeless.
Unfortunately, you assume that most of the homeless are mentally ill or older people who once lived in S.R.O. housing. You argue that the mentally ill homeless were deinstitutionalized, moved into S.R.O. housing, and when this housing was transferred to other uses, they and many other S.R.O. residents became homeless - a plausible sequence. However, my own research, and data from surveys of the homeless across the nation, suggest that for most of the homeless the sequence of events has been very different. 
Most of the homeless are young adults, under age 45. Most have never lived in S.R.O. housing. Fewer than 15 percent have been hospitalized for mental disorders. And more than half the homeless population is homeless for less than six months.
You dismiss the causal role of deinstitutionalization in the 1960's and 70's because of its distance in time from the increasing homeless population of the 80's, but you fail to recognize that much of the loss in S.R.O. housing also took place before the 1980's. Though some people undoubtedly became homeless because of S.R.O. conversions - a deed that should be redressed - the evidence does not suggest the loss of S.R.O.'s as a widespread, direct source of homelessness. The real impact of lost S.R.O.'s on homelessness is that when a new segment of people became residentially unstable in the 1980's, they did not have this stock of cheap rooms to fall back on. What might have been hidden in the old problem of skid row homelessness became a new problem of emergency shelter homelessness.
That most of the homeless are young adults, not mentally ill and have never lived in S.R.O. housing suggests wider causes of the homeless problem and more ambitious solutions than increasing the number of S.R.O. units. Poor, urban, young adults have seen two decades in which growth industries have favored better educated suburban populations and where the jobs available to unskilled workers have paid wages that have steadily declined against inflation (the value of the minimum wage declined 31 percent between 1980 and 1988).
Across the country, people who rely on public assistance have likewise seen the value of benefits deteriorate against inflation, nearly 50 percent since the early 1970's. Compounding declines in income among young, urban adults has been a sharp rise in the cost of housing. S.R.O.'s have disappeared, and standard rental apartments consume nearly 65 percent of the average poor household's income. This dramatic combination of forces pushed a new generation into residential instability and, ultimately, homelessness. Given the intense competition for resources in impoverished communities, it is no surprise that the disabled, the defiant and the deviant were the first and most likely to be squeezed out or forced to choose out.
How can we best understand this new group of people from whom the majority of the homeless comes? They are people who cannot afford to form new households. They are adults who are not settling new families or living in their own apartments at the rate their parents did.
While more S.R.O.'s would provide an option for them, do we want to institutionalize a new skid row? More important, is that what most homeless people want? Before the boom in emergency shelters in the 1980's, residents of S.R.O.'s used to be considered ''homeless.''
What really needs to be addressed is the marginal housing and income status of a generation of young and poor adults. The homeless represent a small segment of a much larger problem of poverty and restricted opportunity reflected in the rapid turnover of the homeless population, in the increase in urban crime, in prison overcrowding and in the countless victims of the drug economy.
S.R.O.'s might be the solution for some people, including the older and disabled homeless, but many others, including the masses of near-homeless (and soon-to-be-homeless), await a more imaginative solution that gives them a chance at stable household formation, adequately compensated labor, social protection from disability and unemployment, and that supports more diverse and mixed household arrangements than is represented in the proposed S.R.O. solution.

HEADLINE: School Boards Said to Pad Their Payrolls

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Two Brooklyn school superintendents said yesterday that their school boards had hired a total of 150 unneeded people to patrol cafeterias and perform clerical chores at a cost of almost $2 million a year.
The revelations, made at a news conference called by the Joint Commission on Integrity in the Public Schools, lent support to the contention of the commission's chairman, James F. Gill, that many of the city's public schools are ''patronage troughs'' for political leaders and aspiring politicians.
Commission officials said later that perhaps half of the city's 32 elected school boards were hiring people for unneeded jobs to enhance their members' political support. In the process they are squandering many millions of dollars, the officials said. 
 
'Vulnerable to Corruption'
The commission's findings were bolstered yesterday afternoon when Michael P. Sofarelli, the Board of Education's Inspector General, issued a report describing the practice of hiring paraprofessionals and school aides as ''peculiarly vulnerable to corruption.''
The personnel officers who do most of the hiring, he said, serve at the pleasure of the boards and are subject to ''undue pressure'' to hire ''based on political considerations.'' The districts are spending $110 million a year for such positions, he said.
Mr. Gill said the new disclosures suggested that the state's decentralization law, which gives 32 local boards authority over elementary and junior high schools, ''needs a lot of repair work.'' In part, he blamed the inspector general's office, which investigates improper acts by school employees. It ''does not enjoy the confidence of people in the system,'' he said, suggesting that it be replaced by an entity outside the jurisdiction of the Board of Education.
At the news conference, both Brooklyn superintendents - Levander Lilly of District 19 in East New York and Marco Hernandez of District 32 in Bushwick - said they had sought to dismiss unneeded school aides who were hired before they took office. Board members, they said, threatened not to renew their contracts or to block their budgets and programs.
Mr. Lilly wore a concealed tape recorder for the commission to record conversations with board members, but commission officials said he was not able to obtain any evidence to corroborate his own statements. The officials speculated that the board members had been alerted by news accounts of previous use by the commission of a tape recorder and were cautious in what they said.
Nevertheless, Mr. Gill said, testimony provided in closed commission sessions by Mr. Lilly and Mr. Hernandez has been turned over to the Brooklyn district attorney's office.
 
Reward 'If I Played Ball'
''I was told by these board members,'' Mr. Lilly said, ''that if I played ball and did certain things they would like me to do, I would have no problem with my contract.''
He said that fewer than 100 of the 189 school aides in his district were needed. ''Anybody who wanted a job could walk in and get a job,'' he said. But when he protested to board members, he said, he was told, ''These are community people, and they deserve to work.''
Mr. Lilly said the board members seemed exclusively concerned with jobs they could parcel out and trips to conferences that they could take at public expense.
''The board has not mentioned children and education and what's good for children five times since I have been there,'' he said.
 
Threats 'to Get Me Out' Cited
Mr. Hernandez told a similar story. Half of his district's 120 school aides, he said, serve no legitimate purpose and should be dismissed. But he had difficulty trying to do this, he said.
''I was confronted by board members who have single-handedly told me, because I do not comply with their political ambitions and protect them, they will get me out of the superintendency,'' Mr. Hernandez said.
Both Mr. Lilly and Mr. Hernandez, superintendents since 1987, have been told that their contracts will not be renewed after June 30.
Last October the Gill commission presented dramatic conversations taped by Colman Genn, the superintendent of District 27 in Queens, suggesting that school board members were hiring firends and supporters as paraprofessionals and school aides. Yesterday's news conference, Mr. Gill said, was called to demonstrate that Mr. Genn's testimony was ''not an isolated case.''
 
'Without Reference to Merit'
''Hiring is being done without reference to merit, without reference to education, and you have nepotism and cronyism running rampant,'' Mr. Gill said.
The 13,000 paraprofessionals in the city's schools, who must have high school diplomas, assist teachers in classrooms and are paid up to $16,520 a year. The 6,000 school aides, who do not need high school diplomas, are paid $8.15 an hour for patrolling cafeterias, watching doorways and filing records. The Gill Commission said aides are paid an average of $12,000 a year.
Corinna Grant, president of the Community School Board 19, could not be reached last night for comment, but in past interviews she has denied that any hiring in the district is politically motivated. Repeated calls were made to John A. Battaglia, president of School Board 32, but he could not be reached.
Tito Velez, a member of School Board 31 and former chairman, said last night that Mr. Hernandez's comments were ''not true.'' Seven of the board's nine members were newly elected last July 1, he said, and Mr. Hernandez ''never recommended that we fire any school aides.''
Mr. Velez said Mr. Hernandez's contract was not being renewed because he had ''run up a deficit of $600,000 in the fiscal year that ended July 30.'' In the past, he said, the district either had a surplus or a deficit of no more than $100,000.
Edward Handman, a spokesman for District Council 37, the union that represents the school aides, said, ''The problem with the schools can hardly be laid at the feet of $8-an-hour part-time workers.''
 
'It Is Sinful'
Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez was briefed by Mr. Gill yesterday afternoon about the revelations and said that ''in the current economic climate, it is sinful'' to pad payrolls.
Yesterday's allegations of wasteful hiring were not confined to jobs as school aides. In an interview, Mr. Lilly said that to get his budget passed, he was forced to create four community coordinator positions each paying $40,000 a year. Three of the jobs, he said, were not needed.
He tried to insulate the appointments from politics, he said, but school board members went ''behind my back'' and pressured district officials to hire friends of board members.

HEADLINE: EDUCATION: About Education

BYLINE: By Fred M. Hechinger

 BODY:
Even more tragic than the fate of students who drop out of school is that of half a million children who drop in irregularly or not at all. They are not truants; they may not lack the desire to learn. What they lack is a home from which to register as regulars for school.
The children of the homeless, often shunted from one shelter or school district to another, are in danger of being lost to education. 
Fortunately, some educators make it their business to seek these children out, then try to make them comfortable in school and to make school a substitute home.
Terrence Quinn, principal of Public School 225 in Rockaway, Queens, kept a diary about his work with homeless children, which was published in The Executive Educator, a magazine of the National School Boards Association.
In an interview, he said that last year some 50 of his students came from a squalid shelter hotel. They were not the same 50 each month because the hotels have a maximum stay of 28 days, adding to the instability of the children's lives. This year, he said, the number has declined as permanent housing has been provided for some families. But whatever the numbers, the youngsters that Mr. Quinn tries to serve come from families who, he said, have ''fallen off the economic ladder'' and for whom ''the school is the only place that offers warmth, stability and hope.''
Mr. Quinn and some other principals have established after-school programs for homeless children. These youngsters are given a supply kit that includes a clock, calculator, pens, notebooks and other supplies.
They receive special tutoring, a daily snack and instruction in the arts, crafts and athletics. They can eat, play and do their homework at school until dark. Two nonprofit groups - the Studio in the School Association and the New York City School Volunteers - provide these and other services. Teachers and paraprofessionals help with homework and provide computer instruction. Mr. Quinn wants to see the centers expanded to accept all children who want to come.
He and some colleagues in other schools have learned that getting homeless children to come to school is not a matter of just opening the doors. ''They don't come out on their own as much as we'd like,'' he said. ''There is a shyness. We have to go to them. And there has to be a bus service to bring the children to school.''
He and the school's social worker went out to the Rockaway Park hotel and invited parents to a breakfast in the hotel lobby - the only available social space. About 20 mothers appeared at the first breakfast, and, said Mr. Quinn, they were ''decent, down-to-earth folks who truly care and want more for their children than a single 10-foot-by-12-foot room.''
The cards are stacked against homeless children: they have no quiet place to study or to rest; they don't know where their next shelter will be; they are surrounded by drugs and often by violence. Still, Mr. Quinn noted, there are some rewards for those who refuse to give up. He tells of one youngster from a shelter who was chosen to deliver the valedictory address at her graduation.
Donna Harrington-Lueker, an associate editor of The Executive Educator, said, ''Terrence Quinn isn't the only school executive who walks the corridors of a welfare hotel.''
''All over the United States,'' she said, ''scrappy educators and advocates for the homeless are teaming up to address the educational needs of the some 500,000 youngsters for whom home is a cardboard box, a welfare hotel, a car, or a concrete slab underneath an overpass.''
She quoted a study by the United States Conference of Mayors showing that families with children make up 34 percent of the country's homeless. As many as 43 percent of the homeless children, it is estimated, do not attend school regularly.
The Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987 requires that homeless children be given the same schooling as other youngsters, including special programs when needed. But implementation has been spotty and slow, with the bulk of financing left to states and local districts to provide.
Mr. Quinn worries about the schooling of all poor children, not just those who are homeless. He is raising money to send 30 to 50 youngsters to summer camp. He is proud of Project Giant Step, which helps 3- and 4-year-olds attend school for half a day.
Mr. Quinn, 42 years old and a principal for five years, said, ''I'm blessed.'' He celebrates his work in ''beautiful downtown Rockaway with an ocean view'' and takes his inspiration from the old advice to light a candle instead of cursing the darkness.

HEADLINE: EDUCATION;
An Insider Looks, Optimistically, at the University

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
Henry Rosovsky is that unfashionable thing these days: an optimist about higher education.
The university's critics are legion. They denounce tuitions that soar above the inflation rate, courses that either neglect Western intellectual traditions or exclude non-Western cultures, and a tenure system that allows professors to spend too much time off campus.
Mr. Rosovsky, the former dean of Harvard University's faculty of arts and sciences, who is now a senior professor, disagrees. He makes his case in a down-to-earth, provocative book, ''The University: An Owner's Manual,'' published this year by W. W. Norton & Company. 
Many groups believe they ''own'' the university - alumni, students, faculty, administrators. His book will probably anger some of them, as he is well aware. ''I have the sense,'' he writes at the outset, ''that every group will approve what is said about others.'' Is Nostalgia Misplaced? Mr. Rosovsky argues that many of the current debates about higher education stem from a misplaced nostalgia for a time when it might have seemed possible to define a common learning and heritage.
''Forty years ago, there may have been more of a common denominator for people,'' he said. ''Universities were generally white and male. There were very few blacks. Jews were carefully controlled. In those circumstances, it was easier to achieve a consensus. But most institutions I know are far better today than they were 40 years ago.''
His book eschews ideology, as befits a man who proudly labels himself a pragmatist and whom Joseph S. Nye Jr., a Harvard professor of Government, calls ''conservative with a small c.'' Like the man, the book is practical but also idealistic, focusing on the issues Mr. Rosovsky considers crucial for the future of the research university: recruiting top-notch faculty and breeding a new generation of scholars. And it is opinionated, with flashes of sarcasm directed at those who strike him as shrill, self-important or unreasonable.
He tells undergraduates that they are not at the center of a university, as they might be at a small college. But he tells them they can benefit from the university anyway because their teachers, if sometimes remote, are breaking new scholarly ground. He describes professors' enviable freedom and perquisites, but warns that they cheat students and the university if they schedule too much outside consulting and too little teaching.
 
Danger in Democracy
He holds that in running a university, more democracy is not always best - a position that has already prompted accusations of elitism, arrogance and excessive devotion to the status quo.
''The people who say universities have not changed enough - what they mean to say is, 'The change I want hasn't taken place,' '' he said. ''I think a school is a place where people who have more knowledge should have more voice.
''I would give students a great deal of latitude in governing their own lives. But in academic things, I feel too much democracy led to disaster. In Europe, Japan, Korea, you get all sorts of parity structures, and they paralyze universities. Our structure is why the American university has been able to change more creatively than universities elsewhere in the world.''
Mr. Rosovsky's 11-year tenure as dean, from 1973 to 1984, was a time of relative political quiescence. Rather than cope with students occupying university buildings and professors dividing into hostile camps, he devoted his energies to bringing the university's budget under control and negotiating Harvard's biggest curricular overhaul in decades, the Core Curriculum.
 
The Lines Are Drawn
The Core does not require certain courses or books, but exposure to the differences in the way scholars in different fields think.
Curricular debates continue to rage at American universities, with lines drawn between those who want a common curriculum based on Western thought to those who see the traditional curriculum as racist and exclusive and would require students to learn about non-European traditions. While Mr. Rosovsky says he does not think Harvard's course should be a model, he thinks it neatly sidesteps these issues.
''The curriculum committee was struck with the rapid growth of knowledge,'' he said. ''The idea was training minds in modes of thought and critical thinking. Given the diversity of the Harvard student body and faculty, the 'Great Books' format is too confining. And with all these ridiculous debates about Western, non-Western - we had none of that, because for us, who could question the need for a foreign culture requirement?''
Mr. Rosovsky acknowledges that some will see his views as too positive. A day of conversations with students and junior faculty at Harvard, in fact, turned up familiar and persistent complaints - student isolation from senior professors busy with their own research and government or business commitments, alienation of assistant professors who know their chances of tenure are slim, overworked graduate students uncertain of the rewards of scholarship, the dearth of women and minority teachers on Harvard's faculty, disputes about Harvard's South African holdings.
 
'This Is the Real World'
''The university is not a little paradise, a Shangri-La,'' Mr. Rosovsky said. ''This is the real world. Everything that happens in society happens here.''
While Mr. Rosovsky believes that students exaggerate professors' inaccessiblity, he does think senior professors should teach more undergraduates, while younger teachers concentrate on graduate students. Junior faculty should get more time for the research that determines their futures. Isolated graduate students should be able to find sympathetic faculty mentors.
True to his calling as an economist, Mr. Rosovsky proposes incentives -exactly what they should be he is still considering - to help persuade tenured professors to spend more time on campus and on teaching.
But Mr. Rosovsky continues to believe that some of the criticisms stem from unrealistic expectations of the university. ''A lot of these exaggerated expectations is society passing the buck,'' he said. ''We teach, we do research. Don't think of us as being the principal institution of social change. Our capacity to raise questions is far better than to answer them.''

HEADLINE: EATING WELL;
Nutrition Labeling: To Be or Not to Be?

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12

 BODY:
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter appears to be out of step with the rest of the Bush Administration on mandatory nutrition labeling. The day after the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, announced the Administration's proposals to require labeling on most packaged foods, Mr. Yeutter told the same audience that such regulations might be just another example of ''the heavy hand of government in the activities of Americans.''
Mr. Yeutter, speaking to the National Food Policy Conference here, said the Agriculture Department didn't necessarily disagree that packaged foods should carry nutrition information. But he said the nation might be moving the wrong way.
''When we have a lot of people in Eastern Europe trying to throw off the yoke of central government,'' he said, this might not be the moment for the Government to become more centralized. ''How much government do you want?'' he asked. 
Where food labeling is concerned, consumers seem to answer, ''More.'' In a nationwide telephone survey of 1,006 households, conducted for the National Food Processors Association, 83 percent of the respondents said ingredient and nutrition information had ''a great deal'' or ''some'' influence on what they purchased.
Asked to choose among five kinds of nutrition labels, they overwhelmingly chose one with more information on key nutrients than labels now carry, and more about daily dietary recommendations. The margin of error for the survey, conducted in September by the Opinion Research Corporation of Princeton, N.J., was plus or minus three percentage points.
The proposals would make label information more uniform, closer to the truth and more useful. The changes described by Dr. Sullivan would apply only to products that the Food and Drug Administration is responsible for; everything, that is, but meat and poultry, which are under the Agriculture Department.
Mr. Yeutter's statements reflect rivalries between the F.D.A. and the Agriculture Department over food regulations and offer a glimpse of how politics affects the food supply.
Even the food industry, which has opposed mandatory nutrition labeling as too expensive and too complicated, has now endorsed such labeling as long as Federal law pre-empts state law. And bills in both houses of Congress are similar in most ways to the proposal outlined by Dr. Sullivan.
Last Thursday Dr. Sullivan announced that the F.D.A. would make big changes in food labeling. He said it would publish proposals by midyear on mandatory labeling and on revisions in nutrition labeling. There will be a final proposal on health messages by next year, he said.
Many labels now list calories, protein, carbohydrates, fat, protein and certain vitamins and minerals, but the labeling has been voluntary since it began in 1973. Two exceptions exist: if a nutritional claim is made for a product or if it contains added vitamins or minerals, it must carry a nutrition label. About 60 percent of the processed food under F.D.A. jurisdiction lists nutrition information.
Under the F.D.A. proposals and bills that are expected to be reported out of committee to both houses of Congress within two months, the labels not only would be mandatory but would show the amount of saturated and unsaturated fat, not just total fat, and cholesterol, fiber, sodium and potassium. In F.D.A. hearings last year and in the survey for the food processors, consumers indicated a keen interest in such information.
The F.D.A has also proposed that B vitamins not be listed or that they be made optional because concerns about disease from nutritional deficiences have declined. But the survey for the food processors found that consumers did not want any information deleted.
The revised regulations would also set standards for terms like ''high fiber,'' ''no cholesterol'' and ''low cholesterol.'' Manufacturers can now call a product ''high fiber'' whether it has four grams in a serving or eight.
''The problem is all those snappy slogans don't mean a damn thing,'' Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, said on Thursday at the conference. ''For more than 10 years F.D.A. has been trying to come up with a definition of 'low cholesterol.' '' He is sponsoring a bill to bar use of ''no cholesterol,'' which frequently appears on food packages, if a product is high in saturated fat.
''People ought to be secure in the knowledge that a boldface health claim on the front label won't be contradicted by the fine print on the back panel,'' the Senator said. Like dietary cholesterol, saturated fat can raise blood cholesterol.
The regulations and bills would also require uniformity in the serving sizes for which nutrition information is given. Many food companies have simply listed more servings without making the package bigger, to make it appear, for instance, that there are fewer calories or grams of sodium per serving. One company's 10-ounce can of soup, for example, once provided two servings, then two and a half, and now two and three-quarters.
In its hearings the F.D.A. also learned that consumers didn't like ''either/or'' labeling, which permits the manufacturer to use the cheapest available oil (for example, a label can presently say, ''contains corn oil and/or sunflower oil and/or coconut oil''). Certain fats, like corn and sunflower oil, are unsaturated; others, like coconut and palm oil, are highly saturated. People who want less saturated fat and those who are allergic to a food, like corn, want to know what the ingredients are, not what they might be.
The F.D.A. said the industry wanted to retain the current system for economic reasons. The agency has suggested a plan to get around the issue; it would require the label to list the amount of saturated and unsaturated fat, preventing manufacturers from changing the ratio of fats unless they revise the label.
The F.D.A. also wants to allow more flexibility in the labeling of more healthful foods, so that, for example, a cheese made with less fat than a standard cheese could be called low-fat cheese instead of cheese substitute.
The thorniest matter - health messages - is addressed in all the proposals. The Administration and Congress agree that labels claiming a health benefit should be honest and supported by scientific evidence. But how to attain that goal is elusive. The F.D.A. is proposing that health claims be permitted in six areas: fiber and cancer; fiber and heart disease; fats and cancer; fats and heart disease; sodium and high blood pressure; calcium and osteoporosis.
In commenting on health labeling, the Acting F.D.A. Commissioner, James S. Benson, said that one criterion would be ''whether the good attributes of the food outweigh the bad.'' But the difficulty of determining that was evident in his response to a question from a reporter about whether a health claim would be allowed for the calcium in whole milk, which is high in fat. He said he couldn't answer.
The F.D.A. said it would also consider a new format for the nutrition information, to make it easy to compare the nutritional profile of a serving with the United States Recommended Daily Allowance. The survey for the food processors found that consumers wanted to be able to make that comparison quickly and easily.
Dr. Sullivan said he expected speedy action on the F.D.A.'s proposals, but others were less confident. Ellen Haas, the executive director of Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, a consumer group in Washington that co-sponsored the conference last week with the food processors, said the agency had been working on nutrition labeling regulations for 10 years. ''The Secretary should be announcing at this point what the agency is doing, not what they are proposing,'' Ms. Haas said. ''This is deja vu all over again.''
While the F.D.A. has the authority to make such regulations, consumer advocates and health professionals maintain that legislation would push the agency to speed the process.
The Congressional and Administration plans differ on one significant point. The Congressional proposals would keep states from enforcing different standards for labeling, which is the industry's preference, too.
''We would accept mandatory labeling, provided there is strong Federal pre-emption,'' said Roger Coleman, speaking for the National Food Processors Association. ''We don't want a bunch of state regulations.''
The Agriculture Secretary is also in favor of Federal pre-emption, but Dr. Sullivan said that under the Adminstration's proposal ''states would be able to add to the information required, but they will not be able to subtract from the bedrock information mandated by the regulation.''
All the work that has gone into the labeling bills and proposals could go up in smoke over pre-emption. Senator Metzenbaum's legislative assistant, Joel Johnson, said that when the food labeling bill goes to the Senate, an effort will be made to amend it to pre-empt state laws regulating the use of pesticides. Because environmental groups oppose such an amendment, some Senators who would otherwise vote for the nutrition bill might not.
So despite a basic agreement among the public, producers, Congress and the Administration that better nutritional labeling is needed, the matter of Federal pre-emption may undo the nutrition-labeling proposals of 1990.
 
What Labels Might Say
IF the sweeping changes recommended by the Food and Drug Administration and by legislation that is making its way through Congress become law, the labels that shoppers find on food will be very different. But no changes are likely for at least two years. Here are some of the proposals:
Mandatory Labels: Just about every packaged food under the jurisdiction of the F.D.A. - that is, everything but meat and poultry -would carry nutrition labeling. The following information now printed on some labels would be retained: serving size; the number of servings in the container; the calories, protein, carbohydrates and fat in a serving, and the percentage of the Federal Recommended Daily Allowances for vitamins A and C and calcium and iron. The percentage of protein, thiamine, riboflavin and niacin would either be deleted or become optional.
New Data: The new information would include the amount of saturated and unsaturated fat, fiber, cholesterol, calories from fat, sodium and perhaps potassium. Serving sizes would be standardized. A nutritional profile of the product might be included: the amount of calories, fat, saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium in a serving, compared with the Recommended Daily Allowances.
Labels might have to show the percentage of key ingredients.
Terminology: Definitions would be required for terms like ''low fat'' and ''high fiber.'' Products with reduced amounts of fat might be allowed to describe themselves as ''low fat'' rather than ''substitute'' or some fanciful name.
All sugars in a product might be grouped together, rather than being included among the ingredients listed in order of predominance.
Health Benefits: Regulations would say how and when health benefits could be cited on labels.

HEADLINE: Bonn Sets Mark Rate On Savings

BYLINE: By FERDINAND PROTZMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST BERLIN, March 13

 BODY:
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany said today that East Germans would be able to exchange their personal savings at a one-to-one rate for West German marks, but that this rate would not apply to East German marks held by businesses or other institutions.
Though the plan has been mentioned before by Bonn officials, today was the first time Mr. Kohl has specifically said the rate would be one-to-one for savers. Coming five days before East Germany's first free elections on Sunday, Mr. Kohl's comments were clearly political in nature, intended to sway the large number of undecided East German voters toward the conservative Alliance for Germany and to slow the flow of East German emigrants to West Germany.
''We want savers to know that when the change in currency comes, it will be at one-to-one for them,'' Mr. Kohl said in a speech at a rally for conservative political parties held in Cottbus, a city in southern East Germany not far from the Polish border. 
 
'Crucial' Support
''This will be valid for small savers but not for the whole currency,'' Mr. Kohl added. ''It is crucial that those who deserve our support and solidarity should not be disadvantaged.''
The exchange-rate plan for establishing a single German currency is a crucial step in the economic unification of the two Germanys. Mr. Kohl did not say when or how currency union would be realized nor did he specify a rate for the billions of East German marks in circulation. He also did not address the dangers, such as sharp rises in inflation and interest rates, that many economists say a one-to-one rate carries.
Western financial markets focused on the inflationary potential of the one-to-one rate. In New York, Treasury bond prices dropped, based on the view that higher inflation in West Germany would push German interest rates higher, forcing up rates elsewhere. The dollar rose sharply against the German mark on Mr. Kohl's announcement, but then retreated somewhat when traders recognized that the rate would apply only to personal savings.
East German citizens are estimated to have about 170 billion East German marks in savings accounts. At a one-to-one exchange rate, that would be about $100 billion.
A less favorable rate would wipe out much of the financial wealth East Germans have accumulated over the years. At present, East Germany's currency is officially nonconvertible to other currencies, but it trades on the black market at a rate of four East marks to one Deutsche mark.
Shortly after the Berlin wall was opened in November, the rate soared to 20 to 1, but it has fallen sporadically since and the East German mark has gained strength recently from the speculation that savings would be converted at one-to-one.
The generous rate on savings is likely to be coupled with a severe curtailment of the financial benefits East Germans receive when they resettle in West Germany, according to Reuters news service. It said sources in Mr. Kohl's Christian Democratic Union are saying East German emigrants would receive only the unemployment pay and pensions they would get in East Germany, rather than the extensive financial assistance they currently receive.
 
Currency Panel Meets
The comments by Mr. Kohl came on the same day that an inter-German currency commission charged with mapping the route to rapid monetary union met in East Berlin.
Members of the commission would not give details of the meeting, saying only that considerable progress had been achieved. ''Currency and economic union can be rapidly accomplished given the required political will,'' a statement issued by the commission said. The talks will be resumed shortly after the East German elections, but not specific date has been released.

HEADLINE: President Criticizes Deficit Plan

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13

 BODY:
President Bush took issue today with the main elements of Representative Dan Rostenkowski's plan for cutting the deficit, those that would raise taxes and lower Social Security benefits.
But at a news conference where he announced a proposal to give aid to Nicaragua, the President was careful to set a tone indicating that he saw the Rostenkowski plan as the basis for negotiations with Congress.
Democratic leaders in Congress applauded Mr. Rostenkowski's initiative. But, fearful of the political consequences, they said they could not endorse it until the President relaxed his firm opposition to new taxes. 
 
Too Early to Tell
It is too early to tell whether Mr. Rostenkowski's proposal, which embraces sizable tax increases and spending cuts over the next five years, is an important step toward breaking the longstanding political deadlock over the budget or merely another round in the shadow boxing that has dominated the relationship between President Bush and the Democratic Congress.
After saying at his news conference that he could not support a tax increase or a freeze in Social Security benefits, the President declared: ''I don't want to appear totally inflexible, but I'm not about to stand here and give him - give Dan or the Congress - the idea that I want to accept several of the things that are in his approach. But will I be willing to talk when they get all these proposals out there? Certainly. Are we prepared to negotiate? Absolutely.''
 
Source of Power
Mr. Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, heads the Ways and Means Committee, which must initiate all legislation involving taxes and Social Security. That makes him perhaps the most powerful committee chairman in Congress.
But within his own party, he is something of a maverick with a history of working with Republican Presidents. The sweeping Tax Reform Act of 1986, the most important tax legislation in the last half-century, could not have been enacted had Mr. Rostenkowski not joined forces early on with Ronald Reagan.
Before going public with his budget proposal, Mr. Rostenkowski discussed it in general terms with the White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, and the President's budget director, Richard G. Darman, Mr. Darman said today.
Last weekend, in an opinion article in The Washington Post and in a television interview, Mr. Rostenkowski described a comprehensive proposal that would reduce the budget deficit by $55 billion in the next fiscal year and lead to a surplus by 1995.
About 60 percent of the package would involve spending reductions, including slightly larger annual cuts than the President wants at the Pentagon, a one-year abolition of Social Security cost-of-living increases and a one-year freeze in spending for most other Government programs. The rest of the package involves tax increases, including higher income tax rates for the wealthy and an increase in the gasoline tax.
It was the first time in many years that an important politician had come forth with a budget plan that included the politically unpopular measures that many, if not most, economists believe are essential to bring the deficit under control.
The plan and the President's response to it left Democratic leaders uneasy. They fear that if they push the proposal, Mr. Bush will block it or veto it and then attack Democrats in an election year for wanting to raise taxes and cut retirement benefits. Mr. Bush gave no hint in his news conference that he would not attempt such a political maneuver.
The Speaker of the House, Representative Thomas S. Foley of Washington, said today that he found the President's response ''foggy'' and ''confusing.''
Mr. Foley has been saying for several years that a package like Mr. Rostenkowski's, with additional taxes and spending cuts, was the only way to achieve real budget reduction. But he said today, as he has many times before, that enactment of such a plan was ''politically and governmentally impossible without the prior approval of the President.''
Mr. Bush has an ''absolute veto,'' Mr. Foley added, and Democrats gain nothing by proceeding alone to try to raise taxes or reduce Social Security payments.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic majority leader, picked up on the prospect of a Presidential veto that could not be overridden after the Democrats had stuck out their political necks.
''The President has a pen that's worth two-thirds of us, and that's all you need to know,'' he told reporters.
Despite these reactions, the first buds of support for Mr. Rostenkowski from backbenchers began to bloom today. Representative Thomas J. Downey of Suffolk County, a Democrat on Mr. Rostenkowski's Ways and Means Committee, and Representative Jim Slattery of Kansas, a Democrat on the Budget Committee, were among several lawmakers who spoke on the floor of the House today in favor of the initiative.
 
Wake-Up Call
''It's about time this Congress had a wake-up call,'' Mr. Downey said.
A Republican member of the Ways and Means Committee, Representative Rod Chandler of Washington, urged Congress and the President to ''throw off the shackles of campaign rhetoric.''
And a senior member of the Ways and Means and Budget committees, Representative Bill Frenzel, a Republican from Minnesota, said in a speech in Minneapolis that he disagreed with aspects of the Rostenkowski proposal but added that ''today it's time to be thankful for leadership, even though it may be flawed.''
Most lawmakers kept their own counsel, and no one could measure yet the degree to which support in the cloakrooms might convert into votes on the floor.
Mr. Darman at his own news conference declared, ''Ultimately, serious deficit reduction has to be done on a bipartisan basis.''
But the budget director refused to give any political ground, saying the Administration was not inclined toward flexibility on either tax increases or Social Security cutbacks.

HEADLINE: Banks Shut By Brazil For 3 Days

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BRASILIA, March 13

 BODY:
Brazil's central bank closed the nation's banks late today for the rest of the week until an emergency economic package is announced by President-elect Fernando Collor de Mello.
The three-day bank holiday was decreed at the request of Zelia Cardoso de Mello, the nation's new Economic Minister, who is to take office on Thursday with the new President.
She said in a brief statement: ''The bank holiday was declared to preserve the stability of markets until the whole package of measures is announced. In the past few days, there has been a great deal of speculative activity and we wanted to calm the market down.'' 
 
Plan Is Awaited
Ms. Cardoso de Mello, no relation to the President-elect, offered no further information about the new economic proposals, which are expected to be announced when the President-elect addresses Congress on Friday morning.
The move took many citizens and economists by surprise because only a day earlier Ms. Cardoso de Mello had said, ''A bank holiday is absolutely not necessary.''
Analysts said the bank holiday was in response to large-scale withdrawals from the $60 billion that rolls over every day on the ''overnight'' -short-term deposits paying interest rates of up to 100 percent that the Government uses to finance its burdensome $31 billion public deficit.
Its public deficit contributes a large portion of Brazil's $114 billion foreign debt, which is the developing world's largest, followed by Mexico and Argentina. Most of its debt is owed to United States and European banks.
Investors, uneasy about Mr. Collor de Mello's economic plans, have used withdrawals from the ''overnight'' to speculate in gold and the illegal but widely tolerated black market for dollars, causing wild swings in their values in recent weeks.
 
Free Markets Promised
Mr. Collor de Mello, Brazil's first directly elected president in almost 30 years, has promised free-market economic reforms to try to bring down the debilitating inflation rate, which was 2,700 percent the last 12 months and 73 percent in February.
Bank holidays are not common in Brazil. The last was Jan. 15, 1989, when the Administration of Jose Sarney, the outgoing leader, decreed its fourth austerity package, popularly known as the ''Summer Plan,'' which froze wages and prices on basic goods. Both the President-elect and Ms. Cardoso de Mello have denied they will impose a freeze.
Mr. Collor de Mello's economic package is rumored to include privatization of state companies, layoffs of thousands of public employees and widescale spending cuts.
Business leaders have expressed concern about a possible wage-and-price freeze, the basis of four failed anti-inflationary plans by the outgoing Sarney Administration.
Brazil, with about 150 million residents, has been wracked for years by persistently high inflation that has caused labor unrest. Per-capita income in 1986, the latest figures available, was about $1,740, but real wages have declined for several years because of the high inflation.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene

BYLINE: By Peter Passell;
Social Security: Taxing Options

 BODY:
THE payroll tax increases of the last decade have hit lower- and middle-income families hardest, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan points out. If the tens of billions in surpluses piling up each year in the the Social Security trust fund are going to be used to paper over the current Federal deficit, he says, why not give working Americans a tax break?
One reason, which official Washington is cynical enough to believe but loath to admit, is that the payroll levy is the only tax without organized opposition. Every penny is needed to balance the budget - and balancing the budget on the backs of unsophisticated middle-income taxpayers may be better than not balancing the budget at all. 
A more surprising reason, documented last month in a little-noticed memorandum from the Congressional Budget Office, is that the tax cut Senator Moynihan wants would help the folks who fly first class even more than those who take the bus. And at least one of the proposed fixes, imposing a national sales tax to offset the revenue losses from the payroll tax reduction, would leave those at the bottom of the pecking order far worse off.
The average family's pretax income has risen 14 percent since 1977 in constant dollars, the Congressional Budget Office calculates. But families in the bottom two-fifths of the distribution, those with average incomes below $17,000, have actually lost ground as wages stagnated and social spending withered. And rather than cushioning the blow, changes in Federal taxes have actually added to their woes.
While the richest tenth of families have enjoyed an 8 percent cut in Federal tax rates since 1977, the poorest fifth have suffered a 3 percent increase. The second-poorest fifth - what might be labeled the struggling middle class - pay 7 percent higher rates.
The explanation is simple. Big income tax cuts in the early 1980's did not help lower-income families much because they did not pay much income tax in the first place. But everyone who works has been bludgeoned by increases in the payroll-based Social Security tax.
Senator Moynihan wants to reverse this drift toward income inequality by paring the combined employee-employer pension and disability tax to 10.2 percent from 12.4 percent. The catch, the budget office memo suggests, is that the benefits would not be accurately targeted to the neediest: All wage earners would end up with higher after-tax incomes, but a disproportionate share of the cash would go to the affluent.
The cut would raise after-tax incomes of families in the bottom fifth by an estimated 1.1 percent; the incomes of those in the next fifth would rise by 1.6 percent. Families in the next two-fifths would do even better, however, gaining 1.7 percent and 1.8 percent respectively.
The gain of the richest fifth would be proportionately smaller: just 1.2 percent. But since these families have far higher incomes - they take home an average of $82,000 - the dollar benefit would be $974 for each family, compared with just $360 for other Americans.
In any case, not everyone who favors the Moynihan rollback is prepared to accept the direct budgetary consequences. Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina would make up the revenue loss, estimated at $63 billion in 1995, with a ''value added'' tax - economists' jargon for a national sales tax collected at each stage of production.
But value-added taxes are regressive, even if the basics of consumption - food, housing, utilities, education and medical bills - are exempted. The budget office estimates that substituting a value-added tax for the payroll tax would reduce the incomes of the poorest fifth of families by 2 percent while increasing the incomes of the richest fifth by one-tenth of 1 percent.
Offsetting a payroll tax cut with an across-the-board income tax surcharge would, by contrast, be progressive: Almost everyone's after-tax income would rise, the budget office concludes, save those in the richest fifth.
One has to wonder, though, whether such a tax shuffle is in the cards. The President's proposed budget for 1991 suggests that lip-readers in the White House are prepared to turn a blind eye to taxes called user fees. But they are not likely to play dumb for a revenue enhancer as obvious as a value-added tax or an income tax surcharge. And neither are the majority in Congress, who seem reluctant to fall on their political swords merely to put Washington's fiscal house in order.
All this sounds like a formula for stalemate: much pointing of fingers, leading nowhere. But the gods may yet decide to punish Senator Moynihan by granting him his wish. A lower payroll tax would only marginally help those in need. The resulting increase in the Federal deficit might well stop initiatives for wage, child care and education subsidies dead in their tracks.

HEADLINE: Bush Denies Greenspan Rift

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13

 BODY:
President Bush said today he was not at odds with Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and had never discussed the possiblity of not reappointing Mr. Greenspan when his term expires next year.
''Every President would like to see interest rates lower,''
Mr. Bush said at a news conference. 
''A President has to be concerned about inflation, too,'' Mr. Bush said, but added, ''There is no bubbling war with Alan Greenspan.''
 
Last week, The Los Angeles
Times reported that Mr. Bush was unlikely to ask Mr. Greenspan to stay on when the Fed chairman's term is up in 17 months. The report has drawn strong denials from officials at the White House and the Treasury. Today was the first time Mr. Bush addressed the matter in public.
Some Administration officials are known to be unhappy with the high interest rates the Fed is maintaining in its drive to keep the reins on inflation.
''I'm not in a Fed-bashing mode,'' Mr. Bush concluded. ''I think it's very sensitive in terms of markets and everything else even to go as far as I have done in trying to say very little and succeeding only moderately.''

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Decline 0.9% As Demand for Autos Slips

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13

 BODY:
Retail sales fell nine-tenths of a percent in February, their steepest fall in four months, the Government reported today.
But analysts said the decline was almost entirely a result of sagging automobile sales.
''The nine-tenths of a percent decline is very deceptive,'' said Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group here. ''It's all cars virtually.'' Elsewhere, she said, ''consumer spending is holding up pretty well.'' 
William K. MacReynolds, forecasting director for the United States Chamber of Commerce, agreed. ''True, automobiles sales fell,'' he said, ''but almost all other sectors experienced nice increases.''
 
Biggest Drop Since October
Excluding automobiles, retail sales actually rose five-tenths of a percent.
The Commerce Department said retail sales totaled a seasonally adjusted $146.5 billion. The decline was the biggest since a 1.3 percent drop in October and followed a strong 2.8 percent gain in January. The January number had originally been reported at 1.6 percent.
Automobile sales plummeted 6 percent in February after jumping 9.9 percent in January, when sales incentives were restored. It was the biggest drop since auto sales fell 26.5 percent in January 1987.
John Silvia, an economist with Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, said the non-automotive spending, combined with the substantial upward revision of January's sales, suggested that consumer spending would be fairly strong in the first quarter.
Mr. Silvia said the level of spending was consistent with other recent economic reports, including employment growth and personal income.
 
'No Economic Recession'
''When you put it all together, you have a package that says that there's no economic recession,'' he said. Retail sales represent about a third of the nation's economic activity.
It also suggests, Mr. Silvia added, that the Federal Reserve will not act soon to lower interest rates further to stimulate the economy. The Fed had supported higher interest rates to slow inflation until early last year when it began to ease slightly to help the economy avoid a recession.
Some economists and Government officials, however, have urged the Fed to ease its grip on credit further because certain sectors, like construction and much of manufacturing, remain under pressure.
Sales of durable goods - big-ticket, interest-sensitive items expected to last more than three years - fell 3 percent in February after gaining 6.7 percent a month earlier.
Except for autos, however, the durable categories rose, with building materials up 3 percent and home furnishings up five-tenths of a percent.
 
'Pricing Problem'
Mr. Silvia said the volatility in auto sales was a ''pricing problem.''
''What seems to be happening is that in those months when we don't have incentives, we seem to have stronger than normal non-auto sales,'' he said. ''And when we have the incentives put on, then auto retail sales come up and non-auto retail sales come down.''
Most nondurable goods categories also posted gains. Department store sales were up 2 percent; apparel, 1.6 percent; restaurants and bars, 1.4 percent, and grocery stores, five-tenths of a percent.
Declines were registered in drugstore and gasoline station sales, but the latter reflected price declines, not volume, analysts said. Both were down eight-tenths of a percent.
For the three months from December through February, overall retail sales were up 1.2 percent.

HEADLINE: Trade Gap at $105.89 Billion In 1989, Lowest in 5 Years

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit declined to $105.89 billion last year, its lowest level in five years, as merchandise exports grew and travel abroad increased, the Government said today.
The Commerce Department said the current account deficit shrank by 16.3 percent from a gap of $126.55 billion in 1988. But even with the improvement the deficit remained above $100 billion for the sixth straight year. The 1989 figure was the lowest since a $104.19 billion deficit in 1984. 
The year ended on a positive note as the deficit declined to $20.57 billion in the fourth quarter, down 10.2 percent from the third-quarter level, and the smallest quarterly imbalance in almost six years.
The current account, also known as the balance of payments, is the most important trade statistic because it measures trade in services and investments as well as in merchandise.
The United States ended the 1980's in a far different position from the way it began the decade. In 1980, there was a small surplus in the current account. America was the world's largest creditor country, and its earnings on overseas investments were enough to offset perennial deficits in merchandise trade.
But as Americans transferred billions of dollars into foreign hands to pay for merchandise imports, the investment cushion shrank rapidly and disappeared in 1985, when the United States became a net debtor for the first time in 71 years.
The growing foreign ownership in America has set off a heated debate over whether the nation is losing control of its economic destiny.
Some economists predict that the current account deficit could rise again this year, reflecting higher dependence on foreign oil and slower sales of American exports.
 
JAPAN SURPLUS FALLS
TOKYO, March 13 (AP) - Japan's trade surplus fell 30 percent in February to $5 billion, from $7.23 billion a year earlier, the Ministry of Finance reported today.
It was the 10th consecutive month of year-on-year declines in Japan's trade surplus but was substantially higher than January's revised surplus of $338 million.
Japan's surplus with the United States shrank 28.5 percent, to $2.96 billion, in February, from $4.14 billion a year earlier, the ministry said.
In recent months, higher international oil prices and strong domestic demand have increased the value of imports, while growing overseas production by Japanese manufacturers has helped hold back export growth.
In February, exports fell 1.9 percent from a year earlier, to $21.9 billion, for the fifth consecutive decline, the ministry said. Imports rose 11.9 percent, to $16.9 billion, it said.
Japan's surplus with the European Community edged down to $1.88 billion, from $1.89 billion a year earlier.
Japan measures its trade balance on a customs-clearance basis, in which freight and insurance costs are included in import figures but not in exports.

A Sense of Crisis In Tokyo Markets

BYLINE: By James Sterngold

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
THE steep rise of the dollar and the tumble of the yen in global currency trading are contributing to a growing sense of crisis in the financial markets here. Traders and investors say they see little prospect that monetary authorities can turn the situation around.
Many people are worried that the yen's decline is not a result of speculation by financial institutions or a short-term run, traders said. Investors, particularly Japanese institutions, simply see more and better investment opportunities in other countries. 
''The point is that the yen is under pressure from Japanese, not foreigners,'' said Hiroaki Shukuzawa, deputy manager of the Treasury Department at the Sumitomo Bank, Japan's second largest.
In tumultuous waves of trading yesterday, the dollar shrugged off intervention from the Bank of Japan and rose to a peak of 152.90 yen before dipping to 152.67 near the end of the day. That compares with the late quote Monday of 152 yen. The dollar began the year at slightly less than 145 yen.
Later yesterday, in trading in New York, the dollar lost some of its strength and closed at 152.20 yen, compared with 152.63 on Monday.
The rise of the dollar in Tokyo again contributed to jitters in the stock market there. The closely watched Nikkei index of 225 stocks tumbled 747.66, to 32,620.57. With its 624.89 fall on Monday, the stock market has declined 4 percent this week, continuing a slump.
The turmoil in the Japanese markets stems from various factors, both internal and external. The leap in West German and American interest rates has contributed to the weaker yen and helped put upward pressure on Japanese interest rates. In turn, the higher rates have been a big factor in causing the steady slide in stock prices here. A public dispute between the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance have contributed to a perception that the problems are not being efficiently managed. Because in many ways Japan is reacting to a worldwide increase in interest rates, the tumult in the stock market is not sending out strong ripples to other stock markets around the world.
Contributing to Japanese anxieties is a perception that monetary officials here have become paralyzed. As decades of heavy regulation are lifted, the market is still getting used to the idea that the Government cannot simply decree the value of the yen or the level of interest rates.
The central banks of the large industrialized nations agreed in September 1985 to strengthen the yen against the dollar in an effort to reduce Japan's yawning trade surpluses and the United States' huge deficits. A strong yen tends to discourage exports to the United States while encouraging imports to Japan.
But late last year, the dollar started to rise. The yen's continuing slump threatens to undo the progress made in cutting the American trade deficit and could aggravate already strained relations between the countries.
In anticipation of a rate increase by the central bank, market-determined interest rates have been edging higher, too. Bond prices plunged as the yield on the Government's benchmark 10-year bond -the basis for many other commercial rates -jumped to 7.3 percent yesterday, its highest level in nearly six years, from 7.2 percent on Monday. For more than three weeks there has been speculation that the Bank of Japan will raise its discount rate to prop up the yen. Even if the bank does act, traders say, the yen is unlikely to respond because the rate change is anticipated.
''They've delayed so long that they've lost credibility in the market,'' said Takashi Okura, head of foreign exchange for the Bank of America here.
The Bank of Japan has also spent billions of dollars in recent days buying yen and selling dollars in fruitless efforts to reverse, or at least stabilize, exchange rates.
Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Finance Minister, expressed ''serious concern'' yesterday about the developments in the foreign exchange market, but outlined no plan to bolster the yen.
Making matters worse, there is a conspicuous lack of coordination among central banks to bring down the dollar, and that is unsettling the markets here. Five years ago, a coordinated effort did lower the dollar's value.
''The market does not see the central banks cooperating in their intervention,'' said Akira Suzuki, chief manager of foreign exchange of the Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation. ''But the demand for dollars is so strong that intervention is not effective.''
Traders here are nervously waiting for two potential moves by monetary authorities. One is a heavy round of coordinated intervention on the part of the large central banks, assuming some agreement can be reached among them.
Central bankers are meeting in Basel, Switzerland, with the Bank for International Settlements, an organization of central banks. That could provide a forum for coordination.
In addition, the governor of the Bank of Japan, Yasushi Mieno, is to return from Basel Thursday afternoon and plans a news conference that day. There is some expectation that he may announce an increase in the discount rate, currently 4.25 percent, of as much as a percentage point.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Prices Drop

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell sharply yesterday, pushed lower by stronger-than-expected February retail sales data and by reports that the West German Government has a plan to exchange West German marks on a one-to-one basis for the Ostmark, East Germany's currency, for savings.
The exchange-rate plan, an integral step toward forming a monetary union between the two Germanys, was announced by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who announced the plan at a rally for conservative political parties in Cottbus, in southern East Germany. Participants in the credit markets interpreted the report as being potentially inflationary for a reunified Germany.
''It means higher rates in West Germany and, in all probability, higher rates here,'' one Government bond trader said. ''But the market may have overreacted to the proposal, because we don't know all of the conditions that will apply.'' 
According to news agency reports, the one-to-one exchange rate plan would be aimed at East Germans with ''moderate'' savings. No details on the plan were immediately available.
 
Chancellor Kohl Proposal
The news of Chancellor Kohl's proposal came to credit market traders in the United States after the retail sales report, which had prompted a rash of selling early in the session.
Market participants were particularly concerned with a big 1.2 percentage point upward revision in the January sales numbers. The change showed that retail sales rose by 2.8 percent in January.
In addition, traders tended to de-emphasize February's nine-tenths of 1 percent drop because it reflected sagging auto sales. Excluding autos, sales rose by half a percentage point last month.
Neal M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation, suggested the market misinterpreted the retail sales data, but correctly assessed the importance of the day's developments in Germany.
''There is a better tone to the economic data, which reduces the chances that the Fed could ease policy now,'' he said.
''But we are having a period where the numbers being printed are healthier than what is going on in the true economy, partly because the mild weather this winter has been abnormally supportive of economic activity.''
Regarding developments in Germany, Mr. Soss said that ''there is a sense around that monetary authorities in West Germany are about to raise interest rates to compensate for the new risks that are emerging there.'' He added, ''If accomplished, those rate hikes would weaken financial markets in the United States.''
More than half of the price decline recorded yesterday came after news of the exchange rate proposal flashed across trading screens.
 
Treasury Notes and Bonds
Prices of longer-term Treasury notes and bonds, which are more sensitive to shifts in inflationary expectations than short-term securities, bore the brunt of the selloff.
By late in the day, the 8 1/2 percent bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 97 7/8, down more than 7/8 point, to yield 8.70 percent.
Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 98 21/ 32 late yesterday, down half a point, to yield 8.71 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 18/32, down 3/32, to yield 8.74 percent.
Treasury bill rates moved modestly higher.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.95 percent, up one basis point, or hundredth of a point. Six-month bill rates rose by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 7.88 percent. And one-year bills were offered at 7.83 percent, up three basis points.
In the market for investment-grade corporate bonds Texaco Inc. offered $250 million worth of 30-year bonds -its first sale of 30-year securities since it emerged from bankruptcy. The issue met with strong demand from investors, and its size was increased from $200 million.
The 9 3/4 percent bonds, which are noncallable for life, were priced at 100, 1.08 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent bonds at the time of pricing.
Salomon Brothers acted as lead manager for the underwriting, which is rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service and A+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. The ratings by both services have been upgraded since Texaco's last debt sale in December.
A number of new tax-exempt deals were also priced yesterday, including a competitive bid offering of $150 million worth of serial bonds from the the State of Connecticutt.
A bid from a syndicate led by Morgan Stanley & Company won the issue. Coupons on the bonds that were reoffered range from 6 percent on securities maturing in 1992 to 6.95 percent on bonds that mature in 2009.
The issue is rated AA-1 by Moody's and AA+ by Standard & Poor's.
Participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds said that prices of most issues were unchanged on the day.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, prices of actively traded issues dipped by 1/2 point to 5/8 point, traders said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises and Then Falls On Reports From Germany

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined in moderate trading yesterday in New York amid confusion about a plan for German monetary unification. The slide reversed earlier gains in overseas markets.
Traders said the dollar, which had opened higher in New York, continuing the overseas trend, rose further against the West German mark on a midday report that Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany had said East Germans would be able to convert their savings to the West German mark at a straight one-to-one rate. 
Economists say the dollar rose because converting the East German currency, which is traded on the black market around four to one, at that rate could cause inflation in West Germany, which would devalue the West German mark.
Later in the day, traders learned that the one-for-one currency swap under consideration would apply only to small savings accounts. The news sparked a sharp selloff in the dollar.
''I've never seen anything like it, and I've been in the market 11 years,'' said Abigail Cook, a dealer with the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.
She said the dollar drop lasted a few minutes before the currency stabilized at a lower level.
The dollar closed in New York at 1.7120 West German marks, down from its high of the day of 1.7218 and from Monday's late figure of 1.7135 marks. Earlier in Europe, the dollar closed at 1.7165 West German marks, up from 1.7110 Monday.
The market had little reaction to Government reports showing that the the broadest measure of United States trade deficit sank to $105.89 billion, a five-year low, last year, and that retail sales in February took their steepest fall in four months, nine-tenths of 1 percent.
The figures were about what the market expected, said Robert Hatcher, a dealer with Barclays Bank P.L.C.
In New York, the dollar fell to 152.20 yen, from 152.63 yen late Monday. Earlier in Tokyo, it had risen to a closing of 152.67 Japanese yen - the lowest level for the yen against the dollar in exactly three years - from 152.00 yen Monday. Later, in London, it fell to 152.52 yen.
The dollar also fell against the pound to $1.6097, compared with $1.6115 late Monday, although it had risen in London to $1.6005, from $1.6100 late Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday, included: 1.5215 Swiss francs, down from 1.5258; 5.7850 French francs, down from 5.7915; 1,264.50 Italian lire, down from 1,265.50, and 1.1761 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1787.

HEADLINE: Bush Turns Down Bid To Help Negotiators

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Baseball's labor dispute lay dormant yesterday as negotiators chose not to meet and President Bush opted not to become involved. The possibility of binding arbitration was raised and neither side rejected the idea outright, but the owners' labor spokesman said it would be ''a difficult sell'' for his side.
On the 27th day of the owners' lockout of players from spring training camps, officials also made no decisions on the cancellation of regular-season games, which are scheduled to begin in 19 days. The commissioner's office said an announcement would be made on Friday. 
The dispute between the players and the owners, which has made it almost impossible for the season to begin on time, reached the White House yesterday, where the President was asked at a news conference if he had any suggestions for ending the dispute.
''I am a ball fan and I want to go to the opening game someplace,'' he replied. ''But I don't want to intervene. I would simply appeal to both sides to get the matter resolved so the Amercian people can hear that cry 'play ball' again.''
 
Seemingly Indefinite Recess
With negotiations in seemingly indefinite recess, no settlement of the arbitration eligibility dispute over two-to-three-year players is in sight. The two sides are holding firmly to their positions, with no indication of a willingness to budge from them.
Charles O'Connor, the owners' negotiatior said he spoke with Donald Fehr, the players' labor leader, by telephone yesterday.
''So far we have not found a way to bridge the salary arbitration issue,'' O'Connor said. ''I can't say we made any progress. We talked about some ideas. The only good news is we're still talking.''
Sometimes when such circumstances exist, the two parties agree to submit their dispute to binding arbitration, a procedure in which an arbitrator determines the resolution based on arguments and proposals from the negotiators. It has never happened in baseball.
 
Differing Views
O'Connor and Fehr were asked yesterday if they would agree to submit the issue of the two-to-three-year players to that procedure if they could reach agreement on all of the other issues.
''I talked to Fay Vincent about it over the weekend,'' Fehr said, referring to his private meetings with the commissioner in Greenwich, Conn. ''If it was binding arbitration that would limit us, we wouldn't accept it. But if we could each submit what we wanted and the arbitrator could decide on the basis of either side's position or anything in between, we'd be willing to think about it.''
But, he added, ''my impression was the owners wouldn't have any interest in doing that.''
Vincent declined to discuss binding arbitration, saying that was something for O'Connor to deal with.
O'Connor said that it would be difficult to resolve all of the other issues and leave the two-to-three eligibility problem hanging because some of the other issues, such as minimum salary and the owners' contribution to the players' pension and benefit plan, have economic consequences and are linked to the way those players would be paid.
 
'Aversion to Arbitration'
''The clubs have an aversion to arbitration as opposed to negotiation,'' O'Connor said. ''It's historic, so it would be a difficult sell. Right now it's a fairly hypothetical question.''
From what he called the standpoint of fairness, O'Connor said: ''The clubs would be asked to put at risk something they have in the current contract. It's not an issue where there is equal risk.'' The players are seeking to reinstitute the two-year arbitration eligibility that was increased to three years in the last contract.
A labor relations veteran, who asked not to be identified, said that if binding arbitration were to be effective in settling the impasse, it most likely would have to be proposed and accepted fairly soon. The longer the dispute continues, he said, the less likely the idea would be accepted.
 
Wrong Terminology
President Bush acknowledged at his news conference that he called the work stoppage by its wrong name last week. He referred to it as a strike rather than a lockout. ''We got some calls from some of the players saying that's not technically what the situation is, please,'' he said.
O'Connor said that clubs had received permission to have their minor league teams play their exhibition games in major league facilities in Florida and Arizona. But, he stressed, the games would be strictly minor league. He also said that Bud Selig, chairman of the Player Relations Committee board, had given owners permission to speak out on the dispute.

HEADLINE: Florio Plans to Balance Budget With $1.4 Billion Tax Increase

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 14

 BODY:
Gov. Jim Florio, facing a growing shortfall in tax revenue, is to propose a state budget balanced with $1.4 billion in new and higher taxes on Thursday. The budgets of many agencies would be cut to achieve what he says is the first actual reduction in state spending in 14 years.
Looking beyond the immediate budget problems, Mr. Florio will also propose a sharp increase in the income tax for New Jersey's wealthiest residents for next year.
The immediate effect of the budget, if the Legislature approves it, would be a rise in the sales tax, to 7 percent from 6. The budget proposal would also mean higher prices for items like household materials, gasoline and train fares. The higher income tax, which would take effect on Jan. 1, 1991, would be used to shift more of the cost of government to the wealthy, reduce the burden of local property taxes and increase aid for poor school districts. 
Mr. Florio is to announce his two-step plan in his first budget message to the Legislature. Some details of the $12.1 billion plan released today by Treasurer Douglas C. Berman make clear that the remainder of this fiscal year, which ends on June 30, and the next year would be periods of bitter cutbacks in services and greater burdens on taxpayers.
 
Democrats See Need for Study
Republicans lashed out at the proposal, calling it the biggest tax increase in state history. Democratic leaders in the two houses of the Legislature, both controlled by Mr. Florio's party, said they were studying the plan. In his campaign last fall, Mr. Florio said he saw no need for higher taxes.
In addition, the size of the actual budget proposal is likely to be debated. While budget documents released by the administration today described it as a $12.1 billion budget, other items - including a surplus fund and hundreds of millions of dollars to restore or repay cuts that Mr. Florio is making in the current budget - bring the total to $12.8 billion.
The proposal calls for raising the sales tax and applying it to many additional products; raising alcohol and tobacco taxes, taxing telephone transmissions and all petroleum products, except heating oil, and ending the popular property-tax rebates for homeowners.
Although Mr. Florio proposes to spend $39 million less than the current budget, which was created by his predecessor, Thomas H. Kean, particularly dramatic reductions may be seen in some areas, including aid to education, because contracts have built-in increases in salaries and other expenses.
In a separate announcement, the Standard & Poor's Corporation, the bond rater, said it had placed New Jersey bonds on ''Creditwatch with negative implications.'' The high ''AAA'' rating remains, but is at risk of being revised. Standard & Poor's described the new budget as ''prudent in reversing the recent fiscal weakness.''
 
Harsh Immediate Steps
Like other Northeastern states, New Jersey has seen revenues fall short of projected increases as government continues to grow. New Jersey's budget doubled, to $12 billion from $6 billion, in Mr. Kean's eight years.
Although Govs. Mario M. Cuomo of New York and William A. O'Neill of Connecticut have responded to similar problems by proposing smaller than usual budget increases and various tax increases, Mr. Florio is proposing harsh immediate steps while calling on the Legislature to examine the tax system.
''New Jersey has the same problems that other states in the Northeast have,'' Mr. Florio's chief spokesman, Jon Shure, said. ''The difference is that Governor Florio is meeting the problem head on.''
To contend with a projected revenue shortfall of $592 million for the fiscal year that ends on June 30, Mr. Berman said, the state will save $150 million by freezing some operations, including hiring and travel costs, $255 million by reducing capital construction and hazardous-waste cleanups, $43 million by refinancing the pension system and $144 million by delaying payments to municipalities until the next fiscal year.
 
New Items to Be Taxed
For the next year, nearly every agency, except prisons and social services, would have their budgets cut.
The increase in the sales tax to 7 percent is expected to raise an additional $538 million. In addition, new taxes on cigarettes and alcohol that would raise the cost of a pack 11 to 13 cents and a fifth of liquor 38 cents would together bring in $142 million. The sales tax would also be applied to telephone calls and other telecommunications, soaps, detergents and non-prescription drugs.
A tax on all petroleum products except heating oil is projected to raise $255 million.
In proposals the Governor will ask the Legislature to enact to become part of the plans for fiscal 1992, he will call for an increase in the income-tax rates for people with incomes higher than $55,000, Mr. Berman said. Although the schedule was not announced, it would reach a maximum of 7 percent for people with incomes of $100,000 or higher.
 
Plan for School Financing
The $1.25 billion raised by that increase would be used for property-tax relief of up to $500 for people with incomes under $65,000. The money would relieve county and municiapl governments of $250 million in welfare and social-service costs. And it would finance a $600 million increase in school aid under a new formula that would try to insure adequate financing for educating students in poorer districts.
The State Supreme Court has heard arguments in a suit challenging the school-financing law as inequitable for poorer districts.
For years the ways New Jersey raises and spends money, and particualarly the dependence on property taxes for revenues, have been the subject of raucous debates. Critics, including liberals and Democrats, often called for shifting the reliance for revenues from property taxes to income and other taxes.
 
Position of Republicans
Mr. Kean, who left office in January, and other Republicans have fought a shift from property taxes to higher income taxes, saying it would retard economic growth and hurt rich and poor alike.
Because Mr. Berman did not disclose important parts of Mr. Florio's plan, including details on the income-tax increase and school-aid distribution, it was difficult to discern to what extent poor cities and school districts, as well as affluent people, would be affected.
If enacted, the income-tax increase would take effect on Jan. 1, 1991. The property-tax relief would take effect on July 1, 1991.
The short-term solutions Mr. Florio is offering to balance the next budget are considered stark and dramatic in a state that has grown accustomed to economic booms in the last 10 years.
 
Effects on Higher Education
State colleges and universities would face reductions that the administration estimates equals the costs of maintaining 1,414 employees; individual institutions will decide on reducing staffs or other costs.
Local school districts would face greater budget problems in fiscal 1991, Mr. Berman said, forcing them to cut services or raise property taxes, at least until Mr. Florio's property-tax relief takes effect.
N.J. Transit subsidies would not increase, making fare bus and train fare increases likely, Mr. Berman said.
The plan calls for ending the Homestead Rebate program, which returns an average of $180 a year to each homeowner.
Financing would be reduced in dozens of areas, including cultural programs, community drug treatment and pharmaceutical help for the aged. Scathed by G.O.P. Republican minority leaders in the Assembly lambasted the program and accused Mr. Florio of cynicism over his gubernatorial campaign in which he repeatedly said he saw no need for new taxes this year.
''While there aren't many of us on this side of the aisle who expected the Florio campaign promise of no tax increases to last the full two years that he stated, we certainly thought the promise would hold for two months,'' said the minority leader, Garabad Haytaian of Hackettstown.
''It seems that Jim Florio and Mario Cuomo are in a race to see who can become the next Michael Dukakis the quickest,'' said Assemblyman Rodney P. Frelinghuysen of Morristown, a Congressional candidate this year.
The Democratic president of the State Senate, John A. Lynch, who is also Mayor of New Brunswick and a longtime critic of the property-tax system, said the plans for property-tax relief and the income-tax increase seemed to fulfill his calls for tax reform to help poor cities.
But he added that the first step in Mr. Florio's proposals would make life difficult for everyone who depended on state financing next year, including the cities.
''It absolutely helps to address the problems of the cities,'' Mr. Lynch said. ''It is true tax reform.''

U.S. WARNS ALLIES ON AID TO SOVIETS

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14

 BODY:
The United States threatened today not to join a new financial institution designed to funnel the bulk of economic assistance to Eastern Europe if the Soviet Union were to become a major borrower from the organization.
The threat came from Nicholas F. Brady, the Secretary of Treasury, after representatives of 34 countries met to hammer out the charter of the new institution - called the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development - which has been conceived as the coordinating body for an effort to rebuild the impoverished economies of Eastern Europe on a scale comparable to the postwar Marshall Plan.
Mr. Brady's comments seemed intended to increase pressure on American allies to accept the American view that Soviet participation as a borrower under the plan should be rigorously limited.
 
More Sympathetic View
Most of the Western European countries have taken a more sympathetic position on Soviet borrowing. 
The present plan is to capitalize the bank at $8.3 billion, of which 30 percent would be paid in at the start, with the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France and Italy, each having an 8.5 percent stake. The United States told the Europeans it would be willing to take a larger share - up to 10.5 percent. The Soviet Union would have a 6 percent share.
The idea of a new lending institution for Eastern Europe was first proposed by President Francois Mitterrand of France last December as a means to speed the economic recovery of Eastern Europe, and the institution is expected to go into operation later this year.
At the outset, the United States had opposed any participation in the scheme by the Soviets, but as it found itself more and more isolated it moderated its reservations to accept Moscow in the plan but to insist on limiting how much the Soviet Union would be able to seek for its own economic needs.
 
Delayed Over Weekend
Disputes over Soviet participation and other matters kept negotiators from final agreement on the charter at a meeting last weekend in Paris. Before the bank can go into operation, the member countries have to agree on its charter and bylaws. Then, Congress and other national legislatures would have to authorize the capital to back the bank's loans. Mr. Brady said the United States has told the Soviets that any needs they wanted filled by the bank would reduce the amount of money available for the Eastern European countries. ''Our position is that the U.S. does not want to be part of the bank if a major part of the funds are diverted to Soviet lending.''
Mr. Brady's comments before the House Operations subcommittee on foreign operations signaled new battles ahead with European governments, and further distanced the Administration from remarks last week of the House Democratic Leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, who called for economic aid to the Soviet Union to bolster Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Mr. Brady, a former investment banker, said the Soviets should not be given borrowing power greater than the capital they put into the institution.
 
Working for Principles
For the first time in the postwar period, Washington is participating in the establishment of a multilateral lending institution that it will not control - reflecting the decline of this country's relative global weight.
As Mr. Brady observed somewhat philosophically: ''This bank will go forward, whether the U.S. is a part of it or not.''
Because the United States will not get the veto it enjoys in such other multinational institutions as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Washington is working to install the principles it wants in the charter.
In addition to restricting the borrowing of the Soviets, the United States wants to insure that at least 60 percent of the loans go to buttress the private sector of ''pluralistic democratic societies.'' Other Avenues for U.S. If the United States were to make good its threat to stay out of the new organization, it could channel aid to Eastern Europe through bilateral programs, which have been crimped by budget considerations, and through other multinational lending institutions, such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
The World Bank, in which the United States holds roughly 20 percent of the capital, expects to lend more than $5 billion to Eastern Europe over the next three years.
Any break with the Europeans, however, is likely to be be resisted by the State Department, which has stressed the importance of American participation in the European plan to maintain Atlantic political ties.
Michael Mandelbaum, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, said the argument that Eastern European countries would be deprived of funds that would be loaned to Moscow might be economically sensible but ''to single out the Soviet Union is wrong and foolish because we'll lose on that. The Europeans won't buy it.''
After meeting Mr. Gorbachev in Malta last December, Mr. Bush has been supportive of the idea of integrating the Soviet Union in the international economy.
A worsening Soviet economy is forcing the nation toward a faster and more radical reorganization of the system, Western and Soviet economists at a Moscow conference say.

HEADLINE: Mongolia Ousts Leaders and Ends Communists' Monopoly on Power

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ULAN BATOR, Mongolia, March 14

 BODY:
The Communist Party replaced its entire leadership today and voted to give up its constitutional monopoly on power in preparation for free elections expected to be held later this year.
The Central Committee, in a two-day session that is regarded here as a watershed in the transformation of Mongolia from an authoritarian one-party state to a multiparty democracy, also voted to expel its former leader from the party.
Mongolia, between China and the Soviet Union, has only two million inhabitants, half of them herdsmen, but political events here carry a significance greater than the population figure would suggest because of their potential effect on China.
Some Chinese, especially intellectuals and the three million ethnic Mongolians who live across the border, have paid considerable attention to events here since the democracy movement began in Mongolia in December. 
The entire Politburo resigned today and most Central Committee members over the age of 60, about half the total, offered to resign. The new five-member Politburo appears to be made up of advocates of rapid liberalization.
Gombojavyn Ochirbat, 61 years old, a former party official who had been criticized by the now-disgraced party leadership, was named the party's new General Secretary. He had been in the country for only a few days before his selection, and for the last two years lived in Prague, Czechoslovakia, as Mongolia's representative to the World Marxist Review, a journal.
 
A Remarkable Proposal
The Central Committee began its meeting Monday with a remarkable proposal from the Politburo to abolish the constitutional guarantee of power for the Communist Party, formerly known as the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party. The Politburo also suggested that it be replaced and called for a party congress that would choose a rejuvenated Central Committee and revise party policy.
The changes were prompted by small pro-democracy demonstrations that began in December and attracted growing support with their assertions of Mongolian nationalism and complaints about autocratic policies and economic mismanagement.
In a symbolic indictment of its own past, the Central Committee voted to strip the country's former President and party leader, Yumjaagiyn Tsendenbol, of his party membership. Mr. Tsendenbol, who was ousted in 1984 while on a trip to the Soviet Union, continues to live in Moscow, where he is 73 years old and is reported to be in failing health.
In addition to Mr. Ochirbat, the four other new members of the Politburo are all in their 40's. One is the Foreign Minister, T. Gombusuren, who last year visited Washington and signed a bilateral cultural agreement with the United States. Mongolia is trying to improve its relationship with the United States, Japan and Western Europe as a way of reducing its dependence on the Soviet Union.
The results of the Central Committee meeting were announced to foreign reporters late tonight by the chief Foreign Ministry spokesman, Terbichyn Tchimeddorj, as the meeting ended its session.
Apparently because the meeting ended at about midnight, there was no immediate reaction from the opposition forces. In recent days, several members of the ruling party and opposition have said they favor a coalition government that would include the ruling party and several newly created dissident parties.
 
Party Congress April 10
It was not clear how long the new leadership would serve, because the Central Committee also agreed to call an extraordinary party congress beginning April 10. The congress will choose a new Central Committee, which in turn is likely to hold an election for party leaders. It apparently could confirm those chosen today or elect a new slate.
The former party leader, Jambyn Batmonh, continues to serve as President of Mongolia. But the Great People's Hural, the legislature, is expected to be summoned within the next week for an emergency session in which some delegates are likely to seek to oust Mr. Batmonh and other top government leaders.
Little is known of Mr. Ochirbat, who before moving to Prague was the deputy head of the organization department of the party. He has also served as the Central Committee's ideology chief and as head of the country's trade union federation. In 1982 he was criticized and stipped of the union post, presumably because he offended Mr. Tsendenbol, who was then Mongolia's party leader.
The committee also voted to rehabilitate party officials who had been criticized during past purges, in the 1960's.
 
Many Critical Speeches
The Central Committee meeting was televised, and many critical speeches made by the delegates were printed in the newspapers. Mr. Tchimeddorj said that all the speeches and party documents would be published as soon as possible.
''Many letters and telegrams came from every corner of the country, from party members and nonparty members, from peasants and many others,'' said Mr. Tchimeddorj. ''Every letter and telegram was read before the committee.''
In addition to Mr. Ochirbat and Mr. Gombusuren, the new Politburo members are N. Michigdorg, whose background is not known, T. Oold, chairman of the party's control commission, and L. Tudev, the editor of Unen, the party newspaper.
Mongolia, the second oldest Communist regime in the world after the Soviet Union, had a Soviet-backed Communist revolution in 1921. The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party has had a monopoly on power since 1924.
A commission that includes dissidents is being formed to draft a constitution and both party officials and dissidents say they anticipate free elections before the end of this year.

HEADLINE: To Her Deepening Political Troubles, Thatcher Adds a Party in Rebellion

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, March 14

 BODY:
Well into her third term, Margaret Thatcher is in political trouble as deep as any she has been in during nearly 11 years as Britain's Prime Minister.
''The worst news for the Government is that its luck has run out,'' Peter Jenkins, the authoritative political columnist of The Independent newspaper, wrote this week, summarizing the effects of more than a year of steadily bad news that is getting worse for the Government all the time.
With their party trailing the opposition Labor Party in national public opinion polls by 17 to 19 percentage points for months in succession, many Conservative members of Parliament are in a restive and rebellious mood. On Tuesday night, 33 of them voted against the Government in a move to amend part of a bill reorganizing the National Health Service. 
Though the 256-to-253 defeat on a move to subsidize retired patients in private nursing homes was later reversed, it was the first such embarrassment since the 1987 elections, when Mrs. Thatcher led her party to her third victory and a 100-seat majority.
 
To Avoid Cabinet Changes
Mrs. Thatcher visited her rebellious troops today and let it be known that after David Hunt succeeds Peter Walker as Cabinet Minister for Wales in May, she would avoid making any more changes in her cabinet, which is still shaking from the reshuffles and resignations of some of the best known ministers last year. Her office also said that she would have talks with President Bush in Bermuda on April 13.
That may touch up her fading image as the senior European leader with the best connections in Washington, but here at home, her embarrassments in Parliament came on top of a continuing national uproar over an unpopular new per capita tax, the ''community charge.'' She is insisting on putting it in place all over England and Wales on April 1, a year after it went into effect in Scotland, and insists that it will curb local government spending.
The ''poll tax,'' as opponents call it, is being set by local governments across the country at unexpectedly high rates of $500, sometimes even much more, for every member of a household over the age of 18. Many people who gave their votes to Mrs. Thatcher's Conservatives for leading the country out of the economic decline of the 1970's are now reeling from high interest rates that the Government had to raise, to curb inflation caused by its own monetary policy mistakes after the stock market crash of 1987. For thousands of them, the ''poll tax'' is the last straw, and they say they are withdrawing their support.
Just how deep the disenchantment really is will become clear on March 22, when the voters of the prosperous, tidy residential and rural election district of mid-Staffordshire in the English midlands go to the polls to replace a Conservative M.P. who won the seat by 14,654 votes, one of the largest Conservative majorities in the country, in the 1987 elections.
 
A Cathedral Town
Until his death last December, the seat was thought safe in Tory hands. It is a rural Midlands constituency winding from the placid cathedral town of Lichfield in the south to the prosperous industrial parks of Stone in the north.
Lichfield is proud to be the birthplace of Dr. Samuel Johnson, but in Beacon Park it also has a stern and possibly apposite memorial to Edward John Smith, the captain who went down with the Titanic in 1912.
For the Conservatives are in serious danger of losing next Thursday, according to polls, politicians, and many ordinary people in the constituency. The likely cause is Mrs. Thatcher's ''poll tax,'' but the underlying issue seems to be dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister herself.
''I'm deeply upset,'' Thelma Bartlett, who said she had been a Conservative voter all her life, told Charles Prior, the party's candidate in the mid-Staffordshire by-election, as he stumped the neighborhoods of Lichfield with his wife, Sarah, on Tuesday. ''I've always been a very great admirer of Mrs. Thatcher, but I look at her now, and she's losing her marbles.
 
'I Know Things Are Sticky'
''It seems you are looking after the rich and not the poor,'' she told the candidate, who disagreed that the per capita charge was unfair because it would replace a real estate tax paid mainly by property owners and people who rented from them.
''I know things are sticky,'' Mr. Prior, a 43-year-old accountant, told her. ''I know things are tough now, but I am sure that in a year we'll look around and see that things have come round all right.''
That may be true for Mrs. Thatcher, but it might be too late for Mr. Prior if the pre-election opinion polls are right. A survey of 862 adults in the constituency by Market & Opinion Research International when the three-week campaign opened found that 50 percent said they would vote Labor, only 36 percent Conservative.
Mrs. Thatcher, who her aides say does not campaign in by-elections, is not planning to do so for Mr. Prior. But Michael Heseltine, the former Defense Minister who is the favorite among the substantial minority of Conservative Members of Parliament who reportedly want her to resign as their leader before the next national elections, campaigned with Mr. Prior today. And Neil Kinnock, the opposition leader who hopes to defeat the Conservatives in the next national elections, is appearing on behalf of the Labor Party candidate, Sylvia Heal, a 48-year-old judge, who, like him, comes from Wales.
Mrs. Heal, between campaign appearances, said she had been selected by her party to run in the Conservative district last January. ''I thought then that it would be a tall order,'' she said. ''Certainly it's going to be close - but while people here have been Tory in the past, they are feeling let down. The main issue is the poll tax, but close behind it are high interest rates and mortgages.''
As in the country as a whole, Labor's chances of upsetting the Conservatives have been significantly enhanced by the collapse of support for the center parties, the Social Democrats and the Liberal Democrats, that figured so importantly in British politics in the early 1980's, before Labor began expelling left-wing militants and gave up its commitment to unilateral British nuclear disarmament under Mr. Kinnock's leadership.
In the 1987 election in mid-Staffordshire, Labor and the center parties won nearly half the total vote, but divided it almost evenly between them.

HEADLINE: Democrats Shift on Military Cutbacks

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14

 BODY:
House Democrats said today that they had reached a consensus to forgo deep cuts in military spending for the next fiscal year and to seek more dramatic reductions in spending for future years.
''There is a great deal of unity and unanimity in the approach that is going to be used,'' said Speaker Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washington. ''There is a solid consensus that we ought to approach it on a multiyear basis.''
The approach would place more emphasis than the Bush Administration budget does on cutting major strategic weapons programs, and it would reduce troop strength more gradually than liberal Democrats initially envisioned. 
Force reductions and base closings are politically painful, and the House Democratic strategy contemplates some form of economic or job retraining assistance to military personnel and communities that would be affected. Major weapons programs that would be cut back sharply in the future include the B-2 bomber, the MX and Midgetman missiles and the proposed shield against a missile attack.
 
An 'Important First Step'
The decisions, thrashed out in two days of closed-door meetings, have not yet produced agreement between conservative and liberal House Democrats on an actual military spending figure, and there is not yet a clear picture of how the budget changes would translate into a revised defense strategy.
''What has happened is a very important first step in getting the kind of consensus we will need for arriving at defense number,'' said Representative Leon E. Panetta, the California Democrat who heads the House Budget Committee. ''But there are a lot of hoops we will need to go through before we reach that point.''
The agreement, such as it is, represents something of a retreat for House liberals, who had hoped to see big military savings in the upcoming 1991 budget year.
 
Approach Called Impossible
Over the past several weeks, more conservative Democrats, including Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin, who heads the House Armed Services Committee, and Representative John P. Murtha of Pennsylvania, who heads the House Appropriations subcommittee on defense, have convinced their liberal colleagues that such an approach was both politically and logistically impossible.
Mr. Panetta said the most difficult task had been getting liberal lawmakers to understand that even the termination of every major weapons program would not produce immediate savings in the military budget. ''What you now have is a building consensus where liberals recognize that significant reductions will take a period of time to achieve, but will be much more meaningful,'' he said.
At the same time, he added, conservatives are more comfortable because they see a ''responsible transition'' to lower military spending. ''The most encouraging thing to come out of the meetings is that for the first time you will be able to have liberals and conservatives going to the floor and defending the same military budget,'' he said.
A united front is particularly important for House Democrats this year, because leaders believe they will have to pass the budget with little support from House Republicans.
 
The Democratic Approach
The budget strategy means that Democrats will be looking to spend from $290 billion to $296 billion on military programs in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. The figures reflect the portion of the military budget known as outlays. President Bush has proposed an outlay figure of $303 billion.
Under the House Democratic approach, the much larger cuts would come in the portion of the budget known as budget authority. Mr. Bush has proposed a budget authority figure for fiscal 1991 of $306.4 billion, and House Democrats are looking at figure that could be as low as $282 billion.
''I think there is an understanding that the defense bill is driven by budget authority primarily and that immediate, very deep reductions in budget outlays are difficult,'' Mr. Foley told reporters. ''But over time, there is going to be a significant reduction in the defense budget.''
In today's closed-door meeting of 155 House Democrats, Mr. Aspin outlined some examples of the kinds of savings that could be expected from various combinations of troops and weapons cuts. Mr. Aspin said that reducing Army and Air Force troop strength in Europe by 80,000 in the 1991 fiscal year would save $1.5 billion in military outlays for that year and $18.9 billion by fiscal 1995.
Troop cuts of 155,000 by fiscal 1993 would save only slightly more in the 1991 fiscal year - an estimated $1.6 billion - but would save $48.1 billion by fiscal 1995.
Halting production of the B-2 bomber after this year but completing research and development for 15 of the planes would save $200 million in fiscal 1991 and $17.6 billion by fiscal 1995. Terminating all money for the bomber would save $1 billion in fiscal 1991 and $21.4 billion by fiscal 1995.
Terminating the rail-mounted MX missile program and MX missile production would save $800 million in fiscal 1991 and $6.5 billion by fiscal 1995. Terminating the Midgetman missile program would save $100 million in fiscal 1991 outlays and $2.3 billion in outlays by fiscal 1995.

HEADLINE: Split Between Army and Marines Surfaces in Debate on 3d World

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14

 BODY:
The behind-the-scenes rivalry between the Army and the Marine Corps burst into public view today as the leader of each service laid claim to being the primary force for American military operations in the third world.
Gen. Carl E. Vuono, the Army Chief of Staff, and Gen. Alfred M. Gray, the Marine Corps Commandant, avoided any direct criticism of the capabilities of each other's service in a hearing of the House Armed Services Committee.
And there were smiles all around when the Army and Marine Corps leaders posed for photographers along with Gen. Colin L. Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, before the hearing began.
But the thinly disguised competition quickly surfaced despite General Powell's seeming effort to keep peace by telling the committee that the United States needs to maintain a broad array of Army and Marine forces. General Powell had not been invited to testify, Congressional aides said, but asked to appear. 
 
'The Right Mix' Is Debated
Competitive even in times of growing defense budgets, the various military forces are struggling to retain as much of the budget pie as possible as money for defense diminishes. Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the panel, said the hearing had been called to begin a debate on ''the right mix of forces'' for operations in third world countries.
General Vuono of the Army struck first, reading excerpts from a long statement that advertised the fighting capabilities of the Army's 82d Airborne Division and the need for the service's ''civil affairs'' units that can help third world countries rebuild after an American military intervention.
The American invasion of Panama, an Army-dominated operation in which the Marine Corps played a minor role, loomed large in General Vuono's presentation.
Future conflicts in the third world, General Vuono said, will require ''the overwhelming application of combat power.'' And while General Vuono paid homage to joint operations with other military services, he underscored the speed with which the Army ''can place substantial combat power on the ground anywhere in the world.''
General Gray, whose gruff one-liners have long entertained members of Congress, followed with a formal statement that was laden with political-science jargon.
 
Concerns About Third World
But the main message behind his economic and political theories was that troubles in the third world were on the rise even as the Soviet threat is diminishing and that most of the potential battlefields in developing nations would be near the coastlines and thus within reach of the Marine Corps.
Or as the usually blunt-spoken General Gray put it, ''The international security environment is in the midst of changing from a bipolar balance to a multipolar one with polycentric dimensions.''
He added, ''Migration patterns will continue to shift populations away from the heartlands to the coasts,'' adding to the demand in those areas for food and housing and making them ''breeding grounds of discontent.''
That, plus an anticipated decline in overseas bases and the need for vital resources in the third world, ''drives us toward the development of a strategy that is maritime in character,'' he said.
But General Gray did allow that the Army airborne units were a ''most useful feature'' and that they complemented the capabilities of the Corps.
 
The Discussion Heats Up
The polite discussion over future American military capabilities heated up when Representaive Aspin asked the military leaders to comment on statements by a Marine Corps general who said in December that Army light forces, which could rapidly be transported by plane to third world nations, lack the firepower and capability to sustain a fight.
General Vuono replied gruffly that top Pentagon officials saw the need for the light Army forces. ''I do not think I need to comment any further on the quote,'' he said.
General Gray said that the Marine Corps General, Brig. Gen. John J. Sheehan, had not been denying the need for Army units that could be used in the third world, but that he was raising important questions about the sort of forces that were needed.
''What he was saying was, 'Yes, we need that,' '' said General Gray, referring to Army units poised for third world conflicts. But many Army forces are needed for third world contingencies, and whether they can be afforded ''is a question that has yet to be asked,'' he said.
''I think the statement speaks for itself,'' he added.

HEADLINE: Johnny Could Read in 1905, but Had to Go Work

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Johnny Couldn't Read in 1905, Either'' (Op-Ed., Feb. 24), Maurice Wolfthal attempts to equate the educational failure rate of black and Hispanic children with those he attributes to white European children at the turn of the century. There is no basis for comparison if one is to take into consideration the economic and political environments of the eras.
I might even suggest that a study of those conditions might have persuaded Mr. Wolfthal to consider the circumstances of failure among the white European children of that era as ''extenuating,'' as I might view his comparison attempts as ''palliative.'' I offer myself as a witness since I was there about that time as a first grader in a New York City public school. The year was 1912. 
Consider those circumstances. The ferries from Ellis Island were daily pouring immigrants into the city's lower belly at a rate that simply could not be handled by any civic organization. Manhattan was a gridiron of ethnic neighborhoods growing more stifling as more immigrants sought to settle there. The threat of Babel hung over us.
We were an immigrant family of eight. As the youngest child, I saw how my father was unable to support his family with what sweatshop labor or hod carrying could pay. So, as in many other such families, my older brothers and sisters, left school in their early teens to find work that would help our family survive. They were hungry for education, but their hunger could only be satisfied by devoting evenings to studying at free night schools or with friendly tutors.
I remember the sixth graders in my school who obtained working papers and sadly dropped out to help the family survive. But by the time those kids had reached the sixth grade, they were proficient readers. I can attest to that because the motivation for reading was great. The environment in which we lived made reading our only escape to a world of fantasy and adventure. There was no radio or television, and the movies of that era had not yet learned to talk.
I was amused by Mr. Wolfthal's ''evidence'' of the white children's failures in education. He quotes a complaint by a 1905 principal to the effect that children in the seventh and eighth years couldn't write a sentence without a mistake in grammar. Does this not mean that the children were able to write sentences whose only flaws were grammar?
If reading failures were as high as Mr. Wolfthal suggests, I might point out that Street & Smith publishers could scarcely keep up with the demand for children's dime novels, the paperbacks of their day. Books by such authors as Horatio Alger Jr. and Victor Appleton (the Tom Swift series) were in the hands of every kid in my impoverished neighborhood. Those kids used to go to ''swapping corners'' to exchange their books for others they hadn't read.
If illiteracy existed in an inner city like New York, resulting from the educational failures among the white children of that era, as suggested by Mr. Wolfthal, I point out that the population of New York City (much smaller than now) supported the circulation of more than a score of daily newspapers, including the local foreign-language press. The ubiquitous Saturday Evening Post was a must even in poorer neighborhoods, and pulp magazines to suit every literary taste occupied the entire display front of every newsstand.
Yes, very few of those kids at the turn of the century made it through high school, much less through college, but only because they did not have the opportunities available to children today.

Change Must Come

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Maurice Wolfthal informs us that ''white children of European origin were failing in our schools long before blacks and Hispanics were'' (Op-Ed, Feb. 24). Although the statistics of truancy and dropouts at the turn of the century were higher than today, students who dropped out of school in the early part of this century did not drop out of society. 
A further examination of the statistics will also show that these children found employment in what was then a factory-oriented society. The availability of drugs and sex in today's society, coupled with a highly technological job market, makes it almost a certainty that today's dropouts will add to the statistics of tomorrow's unemployment or homeless.
As educators, we need to study history so that we can alter our future. It seems to me that if we accept that our 40 percent dropout rate today is an improvement over the 75 percent dropout rate of the early 1900's, we are dooming the future of this country. We need to recognize that if what we did in the early 1900's in the classrooms of New York City didn't work and if the same strategies aren't working today, alternative strategies are called for.
Society has changed and the students have changed. The question is when will the schools change to offer the solutions called for in this changing society?

HEADLINE: Rostenkowski Plan: A G.O.P. Triumph

BYLINE: By Paul Craig Roberts; Paul Craig Roberts is professor of political economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In offering a plan to balance the budget by 1994, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Dan Rostenkowski, was trying to avoid two tax traps. In the process, he fell into a political trap of his own making.
Mr. Rostenkowski wanted to sidetrack both Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's plan to cut the Social Security payroll tax and President Bush's proposal to lower capital gains taxes. In their place, he came up with a plan that plays right into the Republicans' hands. 
Little wonder that the White House has praised his proposal: He has torpedoed the Democrats' image of Republicans, so carefully crafted over the past 10 years, as the party whose fiscal policy favors the rich.
Mr. Rostenkowski has managed to put every element of the caricature of the ''rich man's government'' together in his package: spending cuts that would lower interest rates and raise bond prices; attacks on cost-of-living adjustments; reinstatement of the inflation tax hated by the blue-collar constituency, and regressive consumption taxes that shift the tax burden down the brackets. How can any Republican fault him? Specifically, Mr. Rostenkowski wants to save $105 billion by freezing most Federal spending programs for a year, including cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security.
To this attack on Democratic spending programs, he adds a $200 billion tax hike. The rich, whose top tax rates would rise from 28 percent to 33 percent, would pay $44 billion -or 23 percent. The remaining 77 percent would come from middle- and lower-income taxpayers.
A little more than half would be raised by consumption and pollution taxes: an additional 20 cents a gallon on gasoline and a doubling of the taxes on beer, wine and cigarettes. About $50 billion, or 27 percent of the new revenues, would come from a one-year suspension of tax indexing that prevents workers from being taxed on cost-of-living adjustments that merely compensate for inflation.
Adding a 3 percent cut in military spending that is probably in the cards anyway and $62 billion in interest savings from a lower deficit, Mr. Rostenkowski comes up with a total deficit reduction of $511 billion - enough to please bond holders by producing a $34 billion surplus by 1995.
Mr. Rostenkowski says that his attack on his party's constituencies is motivated by the need for a balanced budget: ''Our budget deficit limits our ability to deal with problems at home and abroad,'' he said. It is impossible for Republicans to hear such music without dancing.
If Mr. Rostenkowski's proposal attracts Congressional support, it will signal the triumph of traditional Republicanism. However, few Democrats may find the deficit so compelling a problem as to want to balance the budget on their constituents' backs. This is especially the case now that Congress sees that the alleged benefits of a balanced budget - lower interest rates and a stronger dollar -are either nonexistent or undesirable.
Supposedly, interest rates will fall when the budget is balanced. Then why do West Germany, with its trade surplus, and Britain, with its budget surplus, have higher long-term interest rates than the U.S.?
Supposedly, the dollar will rise in value when the budget is balanced. But why try to drive the dollar up when we are simultaneously supporting massive central bank intervention to drive the dollar down? Moreover, if ''twin deficits'' explained currency values, it wouldn't be the Japanese yen that is now falling.
The traditional case for a balanced budget no longer makes sense. Today capital markets are international, and the Federal Reserve Board has lost much of its power to sway U.S. interest rates. If other countries raise their interest rates, we have to let ours go up too in order to stay competitive. This competitive pressure is independent of the budget.
Slaying the deficit dragon won't do a thing to lower interest rates or raise the dollar. But raising taxes could put the economy in the tank. And won't that do wonders for the deficit?

HEADLINE: Panel Seeks at Least $5 Billion to Improve Child Care in U.S.

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
A new study by a panel of the National Academy of Sciences concludes that the nation's child care services are inadequate and calls on the Government to allocate an additional $5 billion to $10 billion a year to improve them.
The report, released yesterday, also recommends that the Federal Government require employers to offer a year of unpaid leave to workers, with their jobs protected until they return, for each baby. The report also calls for development of national standards that set limits on the ratio of children to staff in day care centers and on the number of children who should be kept together in one group, and that set requirements for training and for physical space and facilities.
The report comes at a time when Congress is debating the amount of money the Federal Government will spend on child care. The House leadership said this week that a bill the Senate has passed to help low-income families pay for child care is likely to go to the floor later this month after being stalled for months in the House. 
Including Head Start, tax credits and other subsidies, the panel estimated, the Federal Government now spends about $6.8 billion a year on child care. The report, which did not say where the new money should come from, said the priorities should be to expand Head Start, increase child care subsidies for low-income families and ''strengthen the infrastructure of the child care system'' by steps like improving the training and wages of child care workers.
 
'Quality Matters'
''This report establishes that quality matters, that it matters even more for low-income families and that it doesn't come cheap,'' said John L. Palmer, dean of Syracuse University's Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, the chairman of the panel that wrote the report. ''A strong base of research over the last 10 years has shown that the quality of child care influences a child's emotional and cognitive development. And we know what constitutes good care.''
The report, which reviewed existing child care studies, was produced by a panel convened by the National Research Council, the research arm of the National Academy of Sciences, at the request of the Department of Health and Human Services, which may use it as background or as a basis for administrative or legislative action.
The report, a 347-page book called ''Who Cares for America's Children?,'' will be available in late April from National Academy Press.
Because the nation's child care system is such a patchwork of arrangements, from formal day care centers to care in the home by relatives or neighbors, the panel said it was impossible to determine the number of openings in day care that exist nationwide. Nor does the report favor any form of day care over another.
''High-quality and low-quality care can be found among all types of services, whether they are provided in the child's home or outside it, in schools, child care centers, or family day care homes, in programs operated for profit or those operated not for profit,'' said the report.
 
Concerns Over Poor Children
But the panel concluded that only a small percentage of the child care available today meets the standards of good care and that poor children are especially likely to receive poor-quality care that threatens their development. And it said most Federal child care spending is no longer directed at low-income families, as it was in the past.
One of the crucial problems in day care, the report said, is high turnover in staff, with about 40 percent of the nation's day care workers leaving their jobs each year, in large part because of low salaries and poor benefits. According to studies cited in the report, most women who care for children in their own homes earn less than the minimum wage, and the average hourly wage for workers at day care centers in 1988 was $5.35.
Almost half the nation's day care centers are for-profit operations, the report said, and for-profit day care centers consistently spend a smaller portion of their budgets on wages and have fewer staff workers for each child than not-for-profit centers.
 
Some States Set Standards
While family day care, or care provided in a home, is often unlicensed and unregulated, almost every state has established rules on the number of workers there must be in relationship to the number of children at formal day care centers. But there is great variation in the rules. For example, North Dakota requires a worker for every seven 3-year-olds, but Arizona, North Carolina and Texas permit one worker for 15 children.
The report recommends national standards requiring that centers provide at least one child care worker for every four babies under 2 years of age. For 2-year-olds, it said, the acceptable range is one worker for every three to six children. For 3-year-olds, it suggests one worker for every five to ten children; and for 5-year-olds, one worker for every seven to ten children.
The report also recommended limits on the number of children in one group or class. Only six to eight babies under 1 year old should be kept in one group, the report said, while 1- and 2-year-olds may be kept in groups of 6 to 12, 3-year-olds in groups of 14 to 20, and 4- and 5-year-olds in groups of 16 to 20. The report said the standards should also limit group size to 6 to 8 for babies under 1 year of age, 6 to 12 for 1- and 2-year-olds, 14 to 20 for 3-year-olds and 16 to 20 for 4- and 5-year-olds.
The report notes that the United States lags behind almost all industrialized countries in its efforts to address child care needs and parental leave.
The panel found that ''developmentally appropriate care, provided in safe and healthy environments, has been shown to enhance the well-being of young children.'' By enabling the parents to work, the report said, good child care can enhance the families' economic status and the parents' personal and career development.

HEADLINE: Big Splash for 'a Basketball Guy';
UConn's Calhoun Went From Success to Struggle to Success

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, March 14

 BODY:
It wasn't really necessary for the sun to come up Monday morning. For as the regulars came into the Sugar Shack, on the edge of the University of Connecticut campus in Storrs, the afterglow would have been more than enough.
The coffee is on the house when the Huskies win a Big East game, and there had been a lot of free coffee lately. The Huskies were Big East champions, and the No. 1 seeded team in the East Regional, and they would be playing a first-round game at the Hartford Civic Center against Boston University on Thursday evening. 
Sometime before 9 o'clock on Monday, Jim Calhoun stopped by as he has since his first season three years ago, when his team lost 19 games, several players became ineligible for academic reasons, a baseball player named Greg Economou suddenly became a starter, and there were clouds in the coach's coffee.
 
Hard Offer to Refuse
''I congratulated him,'' said Nick Buonocore, the owner of the shop and a 1966 Connecticut graduate. ''He said, 'How would you like the trophy?' ''I looked at him. 'What?' ''He said, 'How would you like the trophy?' ''I said, 'Are you kidding?' ''
Would the coach of the Huskies kid about a thing like that? Calhoun walked outside to his car and created the biggest stir to hit a doughnut shop in the state of Connecticut since Ivan Boesky was seen at the Mister Donut in Stamford.
Calhoun returned with a silver cup on a wooden pedestal.
''He said, 'Bring this to the office in a couple of hours,' '' Buonocore remembered. ''He said, 'You earned it.' ''
There are more than a few people in this state who feel that the coach has earned the trophy, too. After five trips to the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament in his 14 years at Northeastern University, Calhoun smiles when he hears about a coach who has become an overnight success.
Eight years ago this month, in the first round of the 1982 tournament, his Northeastern team defeated St. Joseph's, which had reached a regional final the year before. It was a major victory for a growing program, but as Calhoun walked to the interview area, a reminder of the relative obscurity of his situation was waiting in the form of a security officer.
 
A Fateful Call
Calhoun was wearing the wrong color pass. He could not get into the room. It was not until a supervisor had been summoned that the winning coach would be allowed to pass.
His teams won 250 games at Northeastern, an average of 17.9 per season. Calhoun would examine his situation after each year, and he said he would have been happy to stay, and make the N.C.A.A. field, and create a splash now and then. But Connecticut called in 1986, and Calhoun remembers asking himself a question:
''But how far could we go?''
John Toner, the athletic director at the time, appealed to his competitive instincts. Calhoun would have access to resources that Northeastern, for all his achievements there, could never provide. The possibilities that have come to pass, a major-conference championship and No. 1-seeding in the national tournament, provided a challenge.
Then, months later, Calhoun's program still had not acquired an academic adviser, and Cliff Robinson and Phil Gamble were ineligible.
''I woke up days and said, 'What are we doing?' '' Calhoun remembered. ''It wasn't that we were doing the wrong thing. No one was doing bad things. But no one was doing the right things.''
 
Pivotal Year
Now he can look back and see that the problems had been a longterm blessing, because academic-related items that had been specified in his contract suddenly became priorities because of the embarrassment the university suffered.
''The key year for Jim was the year he lost Gamble and Robinson,'' said Dave Gavitt, the Big East commissioner. ''For a guy who had the success he had at Northeastern to be able to have the patience to get through that situation, to not overreact, not be tempted to take a short cut, without that he would not be enjoying this success.''
There are three years left on a seven-year contract, and the recent success has already begun to create the sort of speculation that the fans of the Huskies do not want to hear. The process happens this time each year. Calhoun said he was surprised that he was the object of the rumors.
''I'm not exactly a guy who has been jumping around a lot,'' he said. ''I do have a pretty good job. But I don't think every single coach in the country is trying to get this job.''
 
Another Question
The quiet nervousness in Connecticut is this: If a place with greater possibilities showed an interest, would the coach who was ambitious enough to question How far could we go? begin to ask himself How often can we get this far?
Calhoun said that when the season ended, he would follow the same procedure that has guided his career.
''I assess my situation from a professional standpoint,'' he said. ''Where are we going to go? What can I do here? Basketball certainly has a place in this state, and I'm a basketball guy.''

HEADLINE: Negotiators Led to Water but Don't Drink

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Negotiators in baseball's labor dispute saw each other in Manhattan yesterday, but they did not negotiate.
The absence of talks in the owners' four-week-old spring training lockout was not new, but at least the dispute brought the two sides together for a hearing before baseball's arbitrator, George Nicolau.
The Players Association asked Nicolau to order the owners to place $51.6 million in escrow as the minimum amount of damages the union says the owners will have to pay as a result of the collusion case involving players who were free agents after the 1986 season. 
Nicolau, who has yet to rule on the damage phase of the case, took the union's request under advisement. He asked for a transcript of the hearing by tomorrow.
On the bargaining front, meanwhile, no one said or did anything that brought the players and owners closer together in their efforts to negotiate a new collective-bargaining agreement.
Each side continued to hold to its position on the salary arbitration eligibility issue, but for the first time this week, Charles O'Connor, the owners' labor negotiator, was not available to reporters by the end of the business day, leading to speculation that he and his aides were working on something new or different.
However, in recent days, O'Connor and some of the owner-members of the Player Relations Committee board have said they would not move off their position that arbitration eligibility should remain at three years of major league service. Instead, they have said they would negotiate on their bonus pool proposal under which players with two to three years in the majors would receive post-season bonuses from a $4 million pool.
On the side issue of collusion damages, the association contends that based on testimony of the clubs' own expert economist, Louis Guth, and their exhibits, the least the damages would be for the salary shortfall in the 1987 and 1988 seasons is $51.6 million. The players want the clubs to have to relinquish that amount now rather than have it for their use in supporting their lockout.
The owners' lawyers argued at the two-hour hearing yesterday that they shouldn't have to do anything with any amount of money until Nicolau renders a decision on the whole matter of damages. Furthermore, they said, the arbitrator shouldn't do anything now because it would interfere with the negotiations.
The union's lawyers countered by saying it's not their motion that would interfere with the negotiations but the owners' collusion that is interfering because the owners have money that rightfully belongs to the players.
 
Figure Not Disputed
The owners' lawyers questioned somewhat the amount the association seeks for escrow, but they did not disagree vehemently with the number. The association says the total damages for the period in question should be approximately $130 million.
Barring some movement in the negotiations, the next significant development in the dispute is expected to come tomorrow when the commissioner and the league presidents have said they will make the first announcement on the cancellation of regular-season games.
They had decided to wait until the end of the week for the announcement, giving negotiators more time to reach an agreement and maybe salvage the season openers. But the additional time has not produced additional movement.

HEADLINE: The Getty Is Said to Be Weighing Buying 'Irises'

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
Vincent van Gogh's ''Irises'' is now at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., which is considering the purchase of the work, staff members of the museum who declined to be named said yesterday. The painting was bought by Alan Bond, the Australian businessman, for a record $53.9 million at an auction in November 1987 at Sotheby's in New York.
The staff members said that ''Irises'' arrived at the museum last week and that negotiations involving the Getty, Mr. Bond and Sotheby's were taking place. No specifics of the deal are known. 
''The museum has not bought the painting, and I have no further comment,'' said George Goldner, the curator of paintings and drawings at the museum.
John Walsh, the director of the museum, was not at his office yesterday, his secretary said, and he did not return phone messages. Lori Starr, the head of public information for the museum, said the museum would not say anything about the painting.
Matthew Weigman, a spokesman for Sotheby's in New York, said, ''We're not commenting about 'Irises.' ''
 
Recent Gaudy Purchases
In recent months, the Getty, one of the world's wealthiest museums, has been active at auctions, purchasing several expensive and widely admired paintings, including works by Jacopo Pontormo, Edouard Manet and Pierre Auguste Renoir.
The sale to Mr. Bond of ''Irises'' aroused much interest not only for the price paid but also for the terms of the deal Mr. Bond struck with Sotheby's.
When it was revealed last October that half of the price paid by Mr. Bond was financed by a loan from the auction house, and that the collateral for the loan was the painting itself, various dealers, museum officials and others in the art world expressed concern, asserting that the price of ''Irises'' had been inflated because of the loan. Sotheby's has since discontinued using works on sale as collateral.
The New York dealer Richard L. Feigen said yesterday that in lending Mr. Bond the money for ''Irises,'' Sotheby's had ''stimulated the market by giving an incentive to a potential bidder who might not have bid, and thereby they elevated the art market.'' Buoyed by a Falsehood? Critics said that the sale, which came less than a month after the stock market crash of 1987, created a widespread impression that the art market had weathered the financial crisis. They said the spectacular price paid for ''Irises'' smoothed the way for a subsequent series of high-priced sales at auctions of Impressionist and modern paintings, including the $51.3 million paid for Picasso's ''Pierrette's Wedding,'' in November, and the $47.9 million paid in May for a Picasso self-portrait.
''Every painting sold since then has been measured against it,'' the director of fine arts at the Didier Aaron gallery in New York, Alan E. Salz, said of the ''Irises'' sale.
Mr. Bond, who still owes an undisclosed portion of the $27 million loan to Sotheby's (it is not known how much more Mr. Bond may owe in interest), is reportedly more than $5.5 billion in debt because of the failure of several of his businesses. He owns brewing, communications and real estate companies. In November, he sold a painting by Manet to help repay the debt to Sotheby's.
He had also been offering ''Irises,'' independent of the auction house, for roughly $65 million to Japanese and other collectors during the last six months, said one collector familiar with the Impressionist market who asked not to be identified.
Before Mr. Bond bought it, the painting was owned by John Whitney Payson, who agreed, Sotheby's said, to allow financing under the condition that the auction house assume all risk. Mr. Whitney had the work on long-term loan to a small museum in Maine.

HEADLINE: A New Assault On Brazil's Woes

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRASILIA, March 14

 BODY:
Harried by hyperinflation and mounting debts, a new young economic team takes office here Thursday carrying blueprints of free-market reforms designed to turn Brazil into an economic world power this decade.
The team, led by Zelia Cardoso de Mello, the 36-year-old Economy Minister, is of the same generation as Brazil's 40-year-old President, Fernando Collor de Mello, who also takes office Thursday.
Prepared to act quickly, Mr. Collor and Miss Cardoso are expected on Friday to start a muscular economic package that will be a frontal assault on Brazil's long-entrenched tradition of Government controls administered by a huge bureacracy, state-owned enterprises and monopolies. They also plan an attack on Brazil's 80 percent monthly inflation rate by slashing spending and raising tax collection.
To restore high growth rates to Latin America's largest economy, the team plans to lower barriers to foreign investment and to imports. 
 
Bank Holiday Declared
To calm nervous markets, the central bank here declared a surprise bank holiday on Tuesday that will keep banks closed the rest of this week.
With an eye toward the failure of President Carlos Saul Menem in neighboring Argentina to gradually control inflation, Mr. Collor has repeatedly warned members of the Brazilian Congress that, ''I have only one bullet in my gun.''
''Collor has learned that the only way you get the tail off the cat is with a whack,'' one American economic analyst here said today.
On Friday, Mr. Collor's hatchet will be aimed squarely at Brazil's hyperinflation: In the 12 months ended in February, consumer prices here increased 2,751 percent. Restaurant patrons complain that the cost of their meals goes up as they eat. Shoppers complain that prices are marked up while they wait in checkout lines.
''On March 15, we will declare a state of war against inflation,'' Mr. Collor vowed last Sunday in a nationally televised interview.
While previous leaders have made similar declarations, Mr. Collor's plans will be bolstered by the mandate of Brazil's first fully democratic Presidential election in 29 years.
In that election last November, several candidates argued that Brazil's inflation was caused by the payments due on the $114 billion foreign debt.
But Mr. Collor, an admirer of Margaret Thatcher, advanced a different argument, saying his country's inflation is largely caused by printing money to cover Brazil's yawning Government budget deficit.
Another arrow in Mr. Collor's quiver is a further devaluation of Brazil's currency, the new cruzado. Following a 10.2 percent devaluation this week, he is thought to be planning to reduce its value by an additional 30 percent. In January 1989, when the new cruzado was introduced, it was worth $1. Now, it is worth a little more than 2 cents.
To attack the deficit, Miss Cardoso has vowed to lay off a third of the 140,000 civil servants hired by the departing President, Jose Sarney, and to sell one state company a month to private investors during Mr. Collor's five-year term. This would mean selling about one-third of Brazil's 188 state industries.
In addition, she plans to cut out a third of Brazil's $5.5 billion worth of subsidies and tax incentives.
Many measures are to be undertaken as Presidential decrees, which means the changes go into effect immediately, but remain subject to approval by Congress within 30 days. Mr. Collor's Congressional leaders say they have forged a center-right majority to support his program.
But Brazil's left-wing civil service unions have vowed to fight the sales of state companies to private buyers.
To raise tax collection, Mr. Collor delegated Romeu Tuma, general director of the Federal Police, to run Brazil's equivalent of the Internal Revenue Service.
On making the appointment last week, Mr. Collor estimated that 7 percent of Brazil's official gross domestic product of $303 billion goes uncollected in taxes. This amount is the equivalent of Brazil's entire Federal payroll.
While Miss Cardoso and Mr. Tuma will work from diffferent ends to close Brazil's budget gap, Ibrahim Eris, the new central bank president, is to serve as guardian of the currency.
''The central bank will not be a cemetery for money,'' Mr. Eris, a 44-year-old American-trained economist, vowed after winning Senate confirmation last week. ''It will not be treated like a commercial bank, nor a press for printing money. It will act as a true guardian of the money.''
 
Three Successive Currencies
During the Sarney years, Brazil drifted through three successive currencies - the cruzeiro, the cruzado and the current, cruzado novo. During Mr. Sarney's five-year term, the central bank had six presidents. For months, Mr. Collor has argued that Brazil needs a ''credibility shock.'' Seeking to restore seriousness to Government here, he has introduced most of his 12 Cabinet members to the press saying that the appointments are for five years.
Symbolizing his determination to reduce Government, Mr. Collor has reduced the number of ministries from 23 to 12. In practice, this has created ''superministries.''
Ozires Silva, who will direct the privatization program, will bear the title Minister of Infrastructure. With a payroll of half a million workers, this mammoth ministry combines the former ministries of transport, communications and mines and energy.
Zelia Cardoso de Mello - no relation to the President - will be responsible as Economy Minister for the former ministries of finance, planning and industry and commerce.
''She is going to have a difficult time mananging the machine,'' the Sao Paulo representative of a New York bank said of Miss Cardoso, who was largely unknown until she emerged last year as Mr. Collor's principal economic adviser.
 
Previous Experience
The Sao Paulo economist's previous experience with national Government came in 1986, when she worked with the Finance Minister, Dilson Funaro, in an anti-inflation plan that froze prices but failed to close the budget gap.
Miss Cardoso has promised that this time there will be no price freezes. But fearing a freeze, supermarket owners have increased prices in the last two weeks by as much as 170 percent.
And Rio's O Globo newspaper predicted today that the Friday package will contain a ''one-to-three-month'' wage and price freeze to start the economy in the direction of Mr. Collor's year-end goal of bringing inflation down to 10 percent a month.
''I hope the measures work out, but without a freeze,'' Sandra Piraja, a 23-year-old college student, said today in Rio as she stood in one of the many lines that formed in front of automatic bank tellers. ''We know that freezes don't work.''
For the long run, Miss Cardoso promised the gradual abandonment of a decades-old policy that automatically raises wages, rents and the terms of private and public contracts according to the monthly rise in inflation.
 
Desire for Debt Relief
Also for the long term, Brazil's new economic team plans to renegotiate the nation's $114 billion foreign debt, the largest in the third world. With free-market reforms in place, the economists believe that Brazil will be eligible for the kind of debt relief that the United States Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady mediated last year for Mexico.
Last July, Brazil stopped paying its foreign debt. When Mr. Collor takes office he will inherit arrears of $5 billion. Buy he is determined not to allow the debt to block growth and he has repeatedly vowed to cut Brazil's annual service payments in half.
''We will not sacrifice Brazilian economic growth because of the foreign debt,'' Miss Cardoso said at a news conference here two weeks ago. But she added quickly: ''We don't want confrontation - we want negotiation.''
In recent years, Brazil has serviced its debt by running up large trade surpluses. In 1988, the $19 billion surplus was the third largest in the world, after Japan and West Germany. In 1989, the trade surplus fell 16 percent, to $16 billion.

Combined Net Off at SmithKline Beecham

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
SmithKline Beecham P.L.C. said yesterday that it was encountering delays in reaping the benefits of the trans-Atlantic merger that created the giant pharmaceuticals and household products company last July.
As it announced consolidated annual results for the first time, SmithKline Beecham said net income in 1989, after $559 million in charges from the merger, declined 64.5 percent, to $209 million, from $591 million in 1988. Profits before the charges were $766 million, up 1.5 percent from $755 million in 1988. 
Combined 1989 sales were $7.9 billion, up 13.9 percent from $6.93 billion in combined sales in 1988. British pounds were converted at $1.61, the rate on Dec. 31.
Analysts said interest charges on SmithKline's $3.19 billion debt were responsible for the flat profits.
 
In Line With Expectations
Robert P. Bauman, SmithKline's chief executive, said the company, which was created by merging Beecham P.L.C. of Britain and the SmithKline Beckman Corporation of the United States, was ''pleased with the financial results, which were in line with our expectations.'' But he added in a telephone interview from London that he was ''disappointed'' by delays in finding a buyer for the Yardley and other European cosmetics lines. Money from a cosmetics sale could be used to reduce debt.
''Some of the major trade buyers like Unilever chose to make another acquisition,'' Mr. Bauman said. Unilever P.L.C. bought five cosmetics companies last year, including Faberge Inc. and Elizabeth Arden, for more than $2 billion. SmithKline's efforts to sell the cosmetics units were complicated when the Schering-Plough Corporation put its Maybelline line up for sale. Rising interest rates in Britain and investor concerns about corporate debt added to SmithKline's problems.
Mr. Bauman said he would not accept an unreasonably low price for Yardley. ''It has to be a transaction that makes sense to us,'' he said. The asking price has fallen to below $700 million, from $900 million last year.
 
Analysts Defer Judgment
Several analysts said they were deferring judgment on SmithKline's prospects. ''We probably won't know how well it's going for another six months,'' said Robert H. Uhl, an analyst with Salomon Brothers.
As for Tagamet, the ulcer drug that lost sales momentum last year, pushing SmithKline Beckman into the merger, Mr. Bauman said its sales stayed at ''just over $1 billion'' last year, with worldwide unit sales rising 9 percent. Tagamet has lost patent protection in Britain and will also lose protection in the United States in 1994, after which Mr. Bauman expects ''a substantial drop'' in Tagamet sales.
On a more positive note, he said the company's combined pharmaceutical sales force of 6,000 had helped raise worldwide sales of Augmentin, an antibiotic, by almost 30 percent, to ''over $500 million.'' He said worldwide sales of Dyazide, a SmithKline blood pressure drug, rose 30 percent after disclosures of improper practices forced American makers of low-priced generic versions of Dyazide to withdraw their products.

HEADLINE: Auto Sales Continue to Post Declines

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 14

 BODY:
Sales of domestically produced cars and light trucks continued to decline in early March, falling 3.8 percent compared with the comparable period of 1989.
That follows a 7.9 percent decline at the end of February. But some analysts said the latest weak results were balanced by strong sales in January, giving the first quarter a generally healthy appearance. New-car inventories currently stand at relatively healthy levels, but auto companies have given up profits by cutting production and paying hefty customer incentives. 
''After the strong sales in the beginning of the year, it's normal to see some cooling down and for rebates to lose some of their magic,'' said Scott Merlis, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.
 
No Impact on Production Seen
Car sales fell 3.3 percent and sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.3 million in the first 10 days of the month, falling behind last year's lackluster rate of 6.4 million for the similar period. The current rate is well below the 7.1 million rate for the first two months of the year.
Sales of light trucks were down even more, falling 4.6 percent, in early March from the comparable period last year. For the year, truck sales are up 3.2 percent.
The current downturn probably will not affect production plans for the second quarter, Mr. Merlis and other analysts said.
''Even if sales rates remain at this level for the rest of March, inventories would remain healthy and production plans for the second quarter would remain intact,'' said Mr. Merlis.
Still, the number of cars and light trucks that the nation's auto makers plan to build in the second quarter remains 6.4 percent below levels a year ago, according to Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry newsletter.
 
Big Three Down
The Big Three suffered sales declines for both cars and light trucks, while the Japanese producers in the United States all posted sales gains. Together, car sales by the Big Three were down 7.7 percent, while Japanese car sales were up 48.1 percent.
The combined market share of the five Japanese ''transplants'' in cars rose to 12 percent of sales in early March, compared with 7.9 percent a year earlier.
Sales of cars made by the General Motors Corporation fell 7.1 percent, to 76,675, and sales of G.M. light trucks declined by 3.1 percent, to 43,485.
The Ford Motor Company sold 49,734 cars, a decline of 8.1 percent from the comparable period last year, and 35,462 light trucks, down 3.1 percent from a year earlier.
The Chrysler Corporation's car sales were down 9.1 percent, to 20,208, while sales of light trucks fell 13.4 percent, to 20,033 units.
''It's a fight,'' said Robert Brest, the owner of Bob Brest Chevrolet in Lynn, Mass. ''We're fighting against the economy. People are still afraid to make any major outlays of cash.''
 
Japanese Gains
The Japanese producers that manufacture cars in the United States continued to steadily add sales and market share.
Honda of America Inc. sold 8,919 cars in early March, an increase of 2.4 percent. Mazda North America Inc.'s car sales rose 53.5 percent, to 1,331. Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America Inc. sold 1,122 cars, and Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. sold 6,797 cars, both sizable increases that reflect new production capacity at their plants.
The Nissan Motor Corporation U.S.A.'s car sales increased 17.4 percent, to 1,964, while its light-truck sales grew 25 percent, to 3,372.
Harvey Heinbach, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, predicted that sales of cars made by Japanese transplants will continue to climb ''for the foreseeable future.''
''The Japanese producers continue to add capacity,'' Mr. Heinbach said. ''They are broadening their product lines and their distribution systems, adding more dealers in the Midwest, where they weren't that well represented.''

HEADLINE: Fed Survey Shows Growth Remains at a Sluggish Pace

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14

 BODY:
The nation's economy continues to grow despite widespread weakness in the auto industry and a gradual slowing in construction activity, according to a survey by the 12 Federal Reserve banks published today.
''Most Federal Reserve districts describe economic activity as expanding slowly,'' said a summary report prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.
''The weakness in autos and auto-related industries, however, is widespread,'' it said. 
The report was based on information gathered from business and other contacts before March 6. A different Fed bank prepares such a summary about every six weeks for Fed policy meetings.
 
Consumer Spending Steady
Consumer spending, the main force in the nation's economic growth, continues to be moderate to strong, with the exception of auto sales, which fell after a January rebound, the Fed said.
Manufacturing activity was reported to be mixed, with Boston, Philadelphia and St. Louis reporting declines but most other districts reporting moderate improvement.
Construction was sluggish in most districts, the Fed said, including New York, where residential building has slowed because of high prices and weak demand. ''Most observers are not anticipating a pickup in 1990,'' the Fed said.
The report noted that financial institutions were less willing to extend credit or were tightening credit terms for many types of real estate loans.
''Loan demand also appears to be softening,'' the Fed said, especially for commercial and industrial loans. The New York Fed said loan demand was below levels a year ago despite recent widespread declines in interest rates.
Farm incomes were buoyed by prospects of good winter wheat crops, according to Fed banks in Richmond, St. Louis and Kansas City, Mo. Freeze damage to fruits and vegetables in December pushed produce prices up to the highest levels since 1984 in the Atlanta and Dallas districts.
Resource industries, like mining and forestry, were strong. And oil and gas drilling in the Southwest was up sharply.
Several Fed districts, including Minneapolis and San Francisco, singled out the continuing rise in health care costs as a cause for concern.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Money-Fund Yields Rise

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were up for the week ended yesterday.
Analysts expect these yields to remain near their present levels for the near term, while the Federal Reserve continues its policy of taking no action to influence short-term rates. They said the concern over rising interest rates abroad, which were exerting pressure on interest rates in the United States, was subsiding. 
Donoghue's seven-day compounded average yield for taxable money funds was up from a week earlier by 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 7.94 percent. The 30-day average yield was unchanged, at 7.93 percent.
 
Decline in Assets
Assets of taxable funds fell by $870 million in the reporting week, to $383.7 billion, with institutional funds accounting for all the decline. Institutional funds fell by $934 million, to $80.6 billion. Analysts speculated that institutional money managers might have gone to the open market, where rates have risen faster.
The average days to maturity of securities held in managers' portfolios was up by one day, to 43.
Among general-purpose money market funds with assets of more than $100 million surveyed by IBC/ Donoghue, the Harbor Money Market Fund, distributed by HCA Securities Inc. of Toledo, Ohio, reported the best return for the week, at 8.88 percent.
Yields of tax-exempt funds were up for the second consecutive week, perhaps reflecting an increase in the supply of new issues relative to stable demand.
 
Average Yield at 5.28%
Assets increased by $26 million, to $77.6 billion, with the average seven-day compounded yield up 7 basis points, to 5.28 percent.
The taxable equivalent for investors in the 28 percent tax bracket is 7.33 percent, and 7.88 percent for investors in a 33 percent bracket.
Donoghue's said the top tax-free yield this week was offered by both the Calvert Tax-Free Reserves Money Market Fund, distributed by the Calvert Group of Washington, D.C., and the Evergreen Trust Tax-Exempt Money Market Fund, distributed by the Saxon Woods Asset Management Corporation in Harrison, N.Y. Each had a return of 5.85 percent. The top yield was about 57 basis points higher than the seven-day average.
Managers also lowered their average days to maturity by a day, to 47, taking advantage of last week's higher rates.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Securities Prices Rebound

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rebounded yesterday, continuing a recent pattern of highly erratic movement.
The gains, which amounted to more than a point, or more than $10 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, erased big declines recorded Tuesday.
Market participants said that yesterday's bounce was caused by three disparate developments: a very weak report on 10-day auto sales that traders expect to help keep pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates; a rumor that members of the Group of Seven had not agreed on a common strategy to control the dollar, and an announcement from Columbia Savings and Loan, the big California institution, that it intends to sell its $3.5 billion portfolio of high-yield ''junk bonds.'' Concern that Columbia might unload such a large portfolio prompted some buying of high-quality Treasury securities. 
By contrast, the reaction to a report on economic conditions from the Federal Reserve's 12 regional banks was quite muted. In language strikingly similar to the last report, issued on Jan. 24, the so-called beige book said that economic activity expanded slowly in the roughly six-week period ending in early March.
''It seemed like the Fed went out of its way to issue a neutral report,'' said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides research and commentary on the foreign exchange and credit markets. ''It seems they are trying to sell the idea that slow growth is good.''
 
Trading Volume Is Thin
Despite the big upward movement in prices, dealers said that trading volume was thin.
''The market is not functioning well in the sense that it is bouncing up and down by about 10 basis points each day on very ephemeral news,'' said James R. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities. A basis point is one- hundredth of a percentage point.
Once again, prices of long-term Treasury notes and bonds were the most volatile.
In late trading, the 8 1/2 percent bonds of 2020 were offered at 98 30/32, up more than a point, to yield 8.60 percent. That compares with a yield of 8.70 percent late Tuesday.
Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered late yesterday at 99 6/32, up 17/32, to yield 8.62 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered at 99 11/32, up 9/32, to yield 8.65 percent.
 
Treasury Bill Rates Ease
Treasury bill rates eased slightly.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.91 percent, down four basis points. Six-month bill rates fell by three basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.85 percent. And one-year bills were offered late yesterday at 7.78 percent, down five basis points.
Fears that Columbia Savings might choose to dump its entire high-yield portfolio onto the market sent shivers through the junk bond market. Prices were off generally between a quarter- and a half-point in thin trading. However, details of how the bonds might be dispatched were sketchy, and some analysts said that under certain circumstances the liquidation could be beneficial.
''There was nervousness at first that the bonds would be put on top of the market,'' said Kingman Penniman, a high-yield specialist at McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei, a bond ratings and research firm.
But he said the market began to get the perception that they would be placed privately. He added that ''if these bonds are taken out of circulation that has to be a positive in terms of bringing the market closer to a balance between supply and demand.''
In the mortgage-backed securities market, Bear, Stearns & Company acted as lead manager on the pricing of a $1.275 billion issue of Remic, or real estate mortgage investment conduit, securities from the Federal National Mortgage Association.
The Remic issue is the largest derivative mortgage-backed deal in the seven-year history of the market.
The issue consists of 17 parts, all of which are backed by Fannie Mae's 9 1/2 percent bonds of 2020.
A number of new issues were priced in the investment-grade corporate bond market, including a $150 million issue of 10-year notes for the International Paper Corporation.
The 9.70 percent notes, which are noncallable for life, were priced at $99.87 to yield 9.72 percent, 1.05 percentage points over the prevailing yield on 8 1/2 percent Treasury notes at the time of pricing.
The First Boston Corporation acted as lead manager for the underwriting, which is rated A-3 by Moody's Investors Service and A-minus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Participants in the secondary corporate bond market said that prices of most issues rose by about 1/4 of a point.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, prices of most actively traded issues rose by 1/4 of a point to 3/8 of a point, dealers said.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Outlook on Peruvian Strike Sends Copper Up Sharply

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Copper futures prices climbed sharply yesterday on the Commodity Exchange in New York, reflecting a more optimistic economic outlook and concerns that a strike at Peru's largest copper company could last longer than a few days.
On other markets, precious metals were mixed; coffee and cocoa futures sagged; soybean futures retreated; grains were mixed; livestock and meat were mostly lower, and energy futures were mixed.
Copper futures soared 3.05 cents to 6 cents a pound in New York, with the contract for delivery in March up 6 cents, to $1.25, and the more actively traded April contract up 5.15 cents, to $1.203. Those were the highest copper prices since mid-October. 
The rally began early after the Labor Minister of Peru said he would not mediate talks between workers and management in the three-day-old strike at the Southern Peru Copper Corporation. The company produces about two-thirds of the copper in Peru, the world's eighth-largest producer and second-largest exporter.
The worries about copper supplies were compounded by a Federal Reserve Board report indicating that American manufacturing and industrial production were growing faster than had been perceived.
Coffee and cocoa futures fell sharply on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, erasing the previous day's gains, after Brazil's currency was devalued overnight. Further devaluation of the cruzado novo is expected after Fernando Collor de Mello is sworn in as President today.
Analysts said the devaluation would likely spur selling by producers of coffee, cocoa and soybeans.
Coffee futures fell 2.55 cents to 3.83 cents a pound, with March settling at 93.60 cents; cocoa settled $15 to $33 lower, with March at $1,080 a ton.
Soybean futures fell sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to the Brazilian economic situation and improved soil moisture levels in the Midwest. Corn and oat futures also retreated, while wheat futures rose.
Crude oil futures for near-term delivery settled lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange, but futures on refined products advanced. The action reflected Tuesday's weekly American Petroleum Institute inventory report showing larger United States supplies of crude oil, but smaller supplies of refined products, than the market had expected.
West Texas intermediate crude oil finished 17 cents lower to 15 cents higher, with April at $20.05 a barrel; heating oil was 0.38 cent to 0.51 cent higher, with April at 54.02 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.30 cent to 1.46 cents higher, with April at 55.85 cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Drifts Mostly Lower Amid Concern Over Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar drifted mostly lower against other leading currencies in light trading yesterday as traders appeared to be looking for direction.
Traders said there was little domestic economic news to affect currency trading and that concern centered chiefly on speculation about possible increases in Japanese or West German interest rates.
Thomas J. Palladino, a trader with the Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank in New York, said traders appeared to be unsure about the direction of the dollar. 
''Everybody seems to be standing pat, waiting for something to budge them one way or the other,'' he said.
He said traders remained concerned about a rate rise by the Bank of Japan, ''but it's been dragged out so long that it's mostly been discounted.''
 
'Underlying Bullish Tone'
''The market still has an underlying bullish tone to it,'' said Bob Morrissey, a trader with the Bank of Boston. But he added that concerns about possible central bank intervention and overseas rate increases kept the dollar from rising.
The dollar closed in New York at 1.1710 West German marks, down from 1.7120 late Tuesday. Earlier, in Europe, the dollar closed at 1.7131 marks, down from 1.7165.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 152.20 yen, down from 152.67 on Tuesday. In London late yesterday the dollar closed at 152.22 yen. In New York, the dollar bought 152.18 yen, down from 152.20 late Tuesday.
In London, a pound cost $1.6090 late yesterday, up from Tuesday's $1.6005. Later, in New York, a pound cost $1.6103, up from $1.6097 late Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Tuesday, included: 1.15245 Swiss francs, up from 1.5215; 5.7805 French francs, down from 5.7850; 1,263 Italian lire, down from 1,264.50, and 1.1733 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1761.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Tuesday, included: 1.5255 Swiss francs, down from 1.5275; 5.7877 French francs, down from 5.7915; 1.9290 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9312; 1,267 Italian lire, unchanged, and 1.1740 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1775.
Gold prices slipped in New York after rising overseas. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold of $398 an ounce, down 70 cents from late Tuesday. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery also settled at $398 an ounce, down $1.
Gold rose in London to a late bid of $399.05 an ounce, up from $396 late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold closed at $399.25, up from $396 Tuesday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $398.75 bid, up from $398.65.
Silver bullion closed in London at $5.09 an ounce, up from $5.05 Tuesday. In New York, silver bullion closed at $5.081 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange, up from $5.059 late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Soviet Crisis Worse, Economists Declare

BYLINE: By LEONARD SILK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 14

 BODY:
The economic crisis in the Soviet Union is worsening and forcing President Mikhail S. Gorbachev toward a faster and more radical reorganization of the system, say Western and Soviet economists at an international conference here.
Trying to convert the Soviet Union to a market-oriented economy in slow stages, said A. W. Clausen, former president of the World Bank and now chairman of BankAmerica, is ''like trying to extract a tooth slowly.''
Delegates to the conference, sponsored by the Stanford Research Institute, the Soviet Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Deutsche Bank, got a dim view of the results of perestroika thus far. Vladimir A. Tikhonov, president of the U.S.S.R. Union of Cooperatives, said the Soviet economy was ''falling apart.'' 
When asked about charges of corruption at many cooperatives, which he described as the enterprises closest to the Western model, Mr. Tikhonov replied: ''When a society is sick, its institutions are sick. When a mother is sick, her child is likely to be sick.''
 
Further G.N.P. Drop Expected
Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist who is director of the Stockholm Institute of Soviet and Eastern European economies, said that despite Soviet estimates of continued slow growth, the economy was in ''a very serious crisis.'' He estimated that real gross national product fell 4 to 5 percent in 1989 and would plummet 8 to 10 percent this year.
There are severe technical problems in estimating real Soviet G.N.P., because of the suppression of inflation by controls, the paying of under-the-counter prices and bribes, and the disappearance of goods from state stores selling at official prices. Until recently, most American experts on Soviet data have not accepted declines in real output as steep as those offered by Professor Aslund.
But Ed A. Hewett of the Brookings Institution, a leading American expert on Soviet data, said at the conference that the Soviet economy was ''deteriorating at an alarming pace.'' There is no sign of an improvement in the quality of goods and no gain in productivity; the money supply is out of control, and the Soviet credit rating is at its lowest ebb, he said.
The ''reforms'' made thus far, he added, are ''half-hearted,'' and entrepreneurs have still not been given authority to run their enterprises efficiently. ''Prices remain fixed, and fixed wrong,'' he said.
The Soviet economists here did not dispute such assessments. Indeed, high politburo officials have been paying close attention to the analyses made at this meeting. Among the Americans here are Senator Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey and former Senators Edmund S. Muskie of Maine and Gary Hart of Colorado, both now practicing law.
Mr. Clausen saw some positive factors in the Soviet situation, especially the increased stress placed by Mr. Gorbachev and his key supporters on the need for a ''market orientation'' and a ''pluralistic society,'' which, he said, held hope for the future. But he warned that these positive elements were in danger of being overwhelmed by some strongly negative forces.
The G.N.P. ''has turned negative,'' he said, ''and will remain so for the next two years. Soviet policy with respect to attracting foreign investment, he said, was ''unsatisfactory to date,'' and policies to stimulate joint ventures were ''not yet in place.''
Mr. Clausen said the Soviets did not seem to realize that foreign investors had ''real alternatives'' to investing in the Soviet Union, and particularly in Eastern Europe. He told the conference that he had been visiting European countries and asking investors which countries hold the greatest promise for them. ''The Soviet Union does not get many votes,'' he said.
He said it was of the greatest importance that the people trust their Government, and that ''one essential underlies all issues: transparency, gaining the support of the people.''
 
'Not Pessimistic'
Insisting that he was ''not pessimistic about the future of the U.S.S.R.,'' Mr. Clausen urged the Soviet leaders to ''move faster,'' and to concern themselves more with the social welfare. ''There is no social infrastructure in place,'' he said, to protect those hurt by loss of jobs and loss of income that could be expected to result from a radical change toward a market economy.
Fears of such disuption have been delaying the Soviet Government's movement toward a freer economy. Soviet economists have been talking in terms of making the changes in stages, starting with the reduction of the enormous budget deficit, which V. K. Senchagov, chairman of the state committee on prices, said amounts to 165 billion rubles.
There were indications here from Soviet economists that Mr. Gorbachev had distanced himself from the gradualism in the plan for economic reform presented by Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov. They said that during the last few years Mr. Gorbachev had focused on political reforms and had left the economic task to Mr. Ryzhkov and others, but was now dissatisfied with the results. Indeed, there was talk here that Mr. Ryzhkov would be replaced.
Abel Aganbegyan, a Soviet economist who is credited with being a leading pioneer of perestroika, said he welcomed the transition to an executive presidency, in which Mr. Gorbachev would have greater powers, ''especially if he will pay attention to the economy.''

HEADLINE: TRADE TALKS FAIL TO PRODUCE GAINS FOR U.S. OR JAPAN

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 15

 BODY:
Six months after opening talks on the deep-rooted causes of their trade problems, Japan and the United States are dissatisfied with each other's concessions. And the Japanese are fearful that the discussions themselves are making tensions even worse.
Negotiators opened the talks in September, resolving that for the first time the two economic superpowers would set aside the pattern of taking up one narrowly focused dispute after another and instead seek an easing of what they called ''structural impediments'' -deep economic and cultural barriers to American imports to Japan.
That approach came after both Governments realized that more than a decade of negotiations and currency realignments had failed to reduce the American trade deficit with Japan.
 
Tokyo's Condition
Japan agreed to participate on the condition that the talks be considered discussions rather than negotiations, rejecting the idea that the United States had the right to put pressure on Japan in such matters. 
The agenda included basic business and investment practices. Washington complained that the Japanese keep prices high, reduce consumption and permit monopolistic practices, all of which serve as a barrier to imports. The Japanese complained that the United States did not do enough to reduce the Federal budget deficit, encourage savings and invest in education, research and development.
Trade specialists in both countries say they fear that the talks have created demands for changes that could be accomplished only by a broad social revolution that is highly unlikely in either case.
''These talks should never have gotten started,'' said Yoshi Tsurumi, a professor of international business at Baruch College at the City University of New York. ''Japan's structural problems are too embedded in its system to justify the false hopes of resolving them in trade negotiations.''
Echoing the skepticism, Glen S. Fukushima, who resigned at the end of last year as deputy assistant United States trade representative for Japan and China, said it was doubtful that Washington could obtain benefits from the latest talks.
''The talks are a very blunt instrument,'' Mr. Fukushima said. ''The Japanese side may end up choosing structural reforms that will be more beneficial to the Japanese economy than to the U.S. side. For all that we're putting into them, I question whether the talks will be cost-effective.''
Now, the negotiators face an early April deadline for producing an interim report. As some Japanese officials warn that a failure to make progress could lead to a possible rupture in relations with Washington, Japan is assembling a modest package of steps that it hopes will defuse an atmosphere of crisis that followed the talks two weeks ago between President Bush and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
Responding to Congressional pressure, Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, told Tokyo officials recently that the talks should yield at least a ''down payment'' on a ''blueprint'' for action by spring.
Although some last-minute steps could be taken that the negotiators could then pronounce positive, Japanese political leaders and senior bureacrats are divided over how to answer American demands and concerned that the Bush Administration has unrealistic expectations.
''The infighting in the ministries is intense,'' a top Japanese official said. ''We never anticipated that American expectations of the results would get out of hand.'' The Foreign Ministry, for example, would like to accommodate the American request on an increase in public works spending; the Finance Ministry opposes the request, saying it would be inflationary.
After the talks with Mr. Bush, Mr. Kaifu said he would make the trade disputes a top priority of his Cabinet. Going further, Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama asserted this week that trade had become ''a matter of crisis control,'' producing ''a hair-trigger situation'' in which Japan had to act.
Japanese officials say they are preparing proposals to increase spending on public works; tighten enforcement of anti-monopoly business practices, and ease curbs on the the establishment of large retail stores. Such steps could stimulate Japanese consumer spending and improve consumer access of foreign products.
But these officials, who ask not to be identified, acknowledge that their steps fall far short of American demands and will not significantly reduce the trade deficit.
''Whatever we do, it will not affect the trade deficit right away or to a considerable extent,'' a Japanese official said. ''The American negotiators understand that. The problem is that outsiders, especially in Congress, do not understand.''
American officials insist the structural talks are worth pursuing.
''It's a good process, certainly a novel process,'' said Michael H. Armacost, the United States Ambassador to Tokyo. ''It's so novel that it troubles people. But I don't think it's the process that is generating troubles. It's the persistent trade imbalance that is generating trouble.''
But participants in the talks say Japanese officials have already informed the United States that Tokyo cannot accept several American demands, including the elimination of huge interlocking business combines and groupings in Japan.
Such combines, known as keiretsu, have existed since the 19th century. They buy and sell from each other, set prices, restrict the flow of goods and prevent outsiders from entering the market. American officials and business executives view the keiretsu as monopolistic; Japanese officials say these practices are widely accepted, and indeed are a key to Japan's economic success.
Changing these and other practices would strike at the heart of the business groupings that have just contributed about $200 million to the successful re-election campaign of Mr. Kaifu's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Japanese officials said.
''If you change these practices, the L.D.P. Government cannot survive,'' said a senior trade negotiator who asked not to be identified.
Mr. Kaifu's Government has agreed to take modest steps to improve enforcement of anti-monopoly practices, taking aim at bid-rigging among construction companies. But Japan is rejecting the American request for higher monetary awards to victims of such practices.
The United States is also demanding that Japan do something about the skyrocketing price of land, reasoning that cheaper land would lead to more housing construction, more consumer goods and, possibly, more imported goods.
Under pressures from farmers, Japan is resisting changes that many experts feel could make a difference, like a drastic increase in taxes on farmland, even those in metropolitan areas. Instead, Tokyo is due to promise Washington to review land pricing systematically in the years ahead.
And Prof. Chalmers Johnson of the University of California at San Diego, a specialist in Japanese industrial policy, said: ''These talks could be important because they are taking place at a high level of analysis and sophistication. But they are doomed to failure because Japan will not change voluntarily. To suggest otherwise is self-delusion.''
The structural talks have also been criticized by some people who feel the United States trade deficit is an American, not a Japanese, problem.
''The principal problems in trade are sourced in America,'' said James C. Abegglen, president of Asia Advisory Service, a Tokyo-based consulting company. ''With all due respect, these American criticisms of Japan are none of our business.''
Mr. Abegglen said that if Japan were to modernize its retail distribution system as the United States was asking, there was no guarantee that American exports would increase.
 
Small-Business Power
He was referring to the American suggestion that Japan eliminate, or at least curtail, its retail store law, which allows small businesses in a neighborhood to band together to block the establishment of large stores. Large stores are thought more likely to sell foreign goods.
Mr. Abegglen and others argue, however, that larger stores would not necessarily lead to American products on their shelves. More likely, they said, would be inexpensively made products produced by South Korea, Thailand and other developing countries.''
Also plaguing the talks is that Japan is demanding that the United States be more forthcoming on what Tokyo regards as fundamental problems reducing America's competitiveness and ability to export goods.
The Bush Administration is pointing to its proposed family savings plan, capital gains tax cuts, deficit reduction measures and tax credits for research and development.
A Japanese official said Tokyo was disappointed that these measures were minor in nature and little more than proposals to do something in the future. ''The American list is not very impressive,'' a Japanese official said.

HEADLINE: Bush to Streamline Advisory Panel on Intelligence

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15

 BODY:
President Bush will soon make major changes in his Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, converting what has been a wide-ranging watchdog over the intelligence community into a far smaller panel of expert policy advisers, Administration officials said today.
The new panel will apparently be headed by John G. Tower, the former Republican Senator from Texas, Mr. Bush's home state.
Mr. Bush nominated Mr. Tower to be Secretary of Defense last year, but the Senate rejected the choice after an unusually bitter political battle that revolved around assertions that Mr. Tower had a drinking problem.
Mr. Tower denied that he had ever been an alcoholic. In an effort to save his nomination, he pledged to the Senate that he would not consume any alcoholic beverages while Secretary of Defense. 
But a number of the Democratic Senators who voted against him cited the drinking issue as an important factor in considering someone to manage the country's nuclear arsenal and military forces. Questions were also raised about his relations with women. The decision to replace the 15-member advisory board with a more expert panel is potentially important because it could mean an enhanced role for outside consultants in setting the direction of American intelligence agencies.
The intelligence community has traditionally resented outside review of its policies and operations and Mr. Bush, a former Director of Central Intelligence, has found the current panel too large and diffuse to be of much use.
Administration officials said Mr. Bush was likely to give greater weight to a smaller group with more expertise in intelligence matters.
Experts in and out of Government have called on the Administration lately to set a new course for the intelligence community before other constraints like a tightening budget reduce his options.
Among the many issues are whether to collect more information on the United States' economic competitors, rather than its military rivals, and whether to focus some of the intelligence agencies' vast eavesdropping and photography resources on new targets.
 
Tower to Be Named Chairman
Mr. Tower already sits on the current advisory board. He is expected to be named chairman, a post that does not require Senate approval, after the board holds its final meeting in a few weeks. He would then carry the title over to a reconstituted panel. Reached today, Mr. Tower referred questions about his role on the board to the White House.
The White House said it had no comment on reported changes in the panel.
The current board, known by its acronym, PFIAB, held considerable power in intelligence matters under President Reagan.
But Mr. Bush has relegated it to a lesser position and had planned to abolish it, officials said.
In recent months the panel had been all but inactive, and one of its most prominent members, Henry A. Kissinger, resigned last month.
The group's regular bi-monthly meeting, originally scheduled for this week, was cancelled.
Officials said that the board's chairwoman, Anne L. Armstrong, asked to be relieved of her post some time ago, and that it was uncertain whether any of the other board members will be retained on the new panel.
Reached by telephone earlier this week, Mrs. Armstrong declined to comment on changes in the panel.
In conversations with President Bush, Mr. Tower said today, he has stressed the need for a strong advisory board that would report directly to the President.
The present board is a mix of intelligence experts and prominent Republicans appointed as a reward for their political labors.
The new intelligence panel is expected to be half as large as the current board and is likely to include more veterans of senior intelligence positions and experts on technical matters like satellite reconnaissance and electronic eavesdropping, officials said.

HEADLINE: Drug Program Is Said to Curb Peer Pressure

 BODY:
A drug prevention program that teaches high school students ways to resist social pressure can significantly curb marijuana and cigarette smoking, but not alcohol consumption, a three-year study by the Rand Corporation has found.
The $8.8 million study, paid for by the Conrad H. Hilton Foundation, was conducted by Phyllis L. Ellickson and Robert M. Bell, and is published in the current issue of the journal Science.
''Our study explodes three myths about previous school-based prevention programs: that they only help kids who need help least, that they only affect trivial levels of drug use and that they only work in white, middle-class, suburban communities,'' Dr. Ellickson said in an interview.
 
The Degrees of Success
She said the program was as successful in schools with large minority enrollments as in predominantly white schools. 
Dr. Ellickson said the program was designed to motivate youngsters to resist drugs and teach them how. ''It's not enough to tell kids, 'Just say no,' '' she said. ''They need to have reasons that are relevant to their daily lives and social relationships.''
Lauro F. Cavazos, the Secretary of Education, said: ''The Rand study offers further strong evidence that drug education is a critical part of the nation's drug strategy. The report confirms that a key ingredient to any good drug education program is showing students how to confront peer pressure to use drugs.''
The program, Project Alert, tracked 6,500 students, starting with the seventh grade, from 30 junior high schools in urban, rural and suburban communities in California and Oregon. The program was aimed at use of cigarettes, alcohol and marijuana, the drugs youngsters usually use first.
 
Lessons and 'Booster' Lessons
Eight lessons were given for seventh graders and three reinforcement, or ''booster'' lessons were given when those seventh graders reached the eighth grade. Over the next 15 months, as the program was assessed, student questionnaires on substance abuse were backed up - for honesty - by taking saliva tests.
In the first lessons, as the course is designed, students answer questions about how drugs can affect them -smoking yellows teeth and causes bad breath; marijuana and alcohol make one lose control in front of friends -and teachers help students identify pressures on them.
In later classes, the teachers and students come up with ways of saying no, using skits, movies and through the students' own written work.
The participating schools were separated into three groups: 10 in which teachers delivered the lessons, 10 in which teachers were assisted by older teen-agers, and 10 in which nothing was done. These were the ''control'' schools, for comparisons.
 
When Effective, When Not
The researchers reported that the substance abuse education was more effective against marijuana and tobacco than against alcohol and that it was more effective for non-users and experimenters than for users.
Students in the program were found a third less likely to try marijuana than students who had not taken part in the program. The project also reduced the ''experimenting'' by 50 percent.
For students who had tried cigarettes, the program reduced smoking from 30 to 50 percent, but did not help confirmed smokers. Their smoking increased.
The program made some gains on use of alcohol for those in the seventh grade, but because, in large part, of alcohol's acceptance by society, the gains had disappeared by the time the students were in the eighth grade. Why Seventh Graders? Contrary to expectations, using older teen-agers in classroom instruction did not produce better results than having teachers work on their own, the researchers reported.
Dr. Ellickson said seventh graders were chosen because their use of cigarettes and marijuana was still relatively low, and also because, at a seventh grader's point in life, pressures intensify and unchecked drug use more than doubles in the tenth grade.
The researchers are continuing to assess the students' progress through high school. Dr. Ellickson said she would report results in a year or two. ''We're hopeful about maintaining the some earlier gains, but we think that it may be important to add additional booster sessions in high school,'' she said.
 
Looking to Wide Availability
The Hilton Foundation plans to make the program available throughout the country, said Donald H. Hubbs, the foundation's president. But the costs, financing and timing have not been determined, Mr. Hubbs said.
William J. Bennett, the director of the national drug control policy office, said last week that he supports drug education but that it was crucial ''to determine how well it works, when it works and also when it does not work.''
Donald Hamilton, a spokesman for the Bennett office, said officials there had not yet seen the Rand report. ''We believe drug education works, but that it must be part of a larger package,'' Mr. Hamilton said. ''Studies we have shown that school policies on drug use are at least as important as curriculum.''

HEADLINE: New Poll Indicates Confusion Among Voters on Democrats

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15

 BODY:
A new poll conducted for a Democratic group underscores what many Democrats feared: The voters have little sense of what the Democratic-controlled Congress is doing.
The poll found that 61 percent of voters, and 62 percent of Democratic voters, could volunteer no response to the question, ''What issues do you think the Democrats in Congress are handling best?'' A majority of voters were also unable to answer a question about what the Democrats were handling poorly.
The poll, conducted by telephone Feb. 26 through March 1 with 1,494 people who described themselves as registered voters, was produced for Democrats for the 90's, a Washington advocacy group for the Democratic Party. 
 
A Time of Worry
The poll was carried out by the polling firms Greenberg-Lake, the Analysis Group and the Garin-Hart Strategic Research Group, and the margin of sampling error was plus or minus three percentage points.
The survey comes at a time when many Democrats are worried about a lack of Democratic figures of national stature and their trouble conveying a clear image to the public.
Many Democrats had hoped that their Congressional leadership could fill the void left by three straight defeats in Presidential elections, but others fear that a legislative body simply cannot compete with the White House for the public's attention.
 
Bush's Rating Was High
Like other surveys, the poll found President Bush to be extraordinarily popular, although the poll takers said much of his support was soft.
It also indicated that voters put more confidence in the Republicans than in the Democrats on most economic issues and in the general ability to lead the country: 41 percent said the G.O.P. would do a better job in leadership, while 34 percent said the Democrats would.
Areas were also found that could be seen as Democratic opportunities. When asked about the country generally, 46 percent said it was headed in the right direction and 33 percent said it was on the wrong track. But those numbers were reversed when voters focused on the nation's economic situation: 49 percent said it was on the wrong track; 36 percent said it was headed in the right direction.

HEADLINE: ABROAD AT HOME;
The Cost of Fanaticism

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

 BODY:
Nancy Klein of Long Island, 10 weeks pregnant, was severely injured in a car crash on Dec. 13, 1988. For two months she was in a coma. Doctors had little hope that she would come out of it, but they thought she might have a better chance if she had an abortion. Her husband, Martin, told them to go ahead.
At that point two men who did not know the Klein family, members of Long Island Right to Life, went to court to stop the abortion. Mr. Klein had to fight them through three state courts and the Supreme Court of the United States before the case was finally dismissed. 
Mrs. Klein had the abortion. It allowed her to have new medication and intensive rehabilitation therapy. She responded amazingly well. She came out of the coma. Now she can talk, dress herself, express her love for her family. Her doctors say she is still making progress.
That story tells us something about the extremist opponents of abortion. In their concern for a fetus they were prepared to condemn Nancy Klein to exist in a coma without end. In their zeal for potential life they wrote off a living woman.
The belief that abortion is wrong is a view that deserves respect. But in this country some people in the anti-abortion movement have carried opposition long past the bounds of reason and humanity.
Item. Scientists for the first time have hope of reversing the course of Parkinson's disease. The hope lies with experiments in which they have alleviated the symptoms by implanting fetal cells in the brains of Parkinson's patients.
But the Reagan and now the Bush Administration have forbidden use of Federal funds to implant fetal tissue in patients. Seven states have enacted laws against fetal cell implants.
Half a million Americans suffer from Parkinson's, a progressive and debilitating disease. A cure would lift them and their families out of misery and fear. But the anti-abortion lobbyists are not moved by that great humane interest. Once again zeal writes off the living.
Item. The National Right to Life Committee urges its supporters to cancel their memberships in, or drop their contributions to, 11 environmental and wildlife groups. Among those targeted are the National Audubon Society, Friends of the Earth, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club.
Why? Because the environmental and wildlife organizations, worried about world population growth, support U.S. aid to family-planning groups abroad. They back legislation to reverse Reagan-Bush rules to forbid aid to any such group that also provides information about abortion.
The rapid increase in human numbers, especially in the third world, is destroying the habitats on which birds and animals - and humans -depend. But the obsession with abortion overrides concern about a profound threat to the future of the earth.
Item. Anti-abortion groups pressured the State of California to stop funding family planning clinics. Some of the state's 500 clinics have been closed. Lobbyists are starting to work against clinics in other states.
The clinics give advice on contraception. That course would seem to reduce the likelihood of abortions. Why, then, would the anti-abortion lobby want to close the clinics?
A Wall Street Journal story on the California events quoted one anti-abortion leader as saying that the clinics promoted the idea of ''sex for fun'' - and that women who became pregnant then had abortions. Judie Brown, president of the American Life League, which was active in the California campaign, said: ''We must return to respect for chastity.''
In other Western countries there are many people who are conscientiously opposed to abortion. But there is nothing like the fanaticism of some elements in the American anti-abortion movement, and nothing like the political result in suppressing not only legal abortions but family planning and medical research.
The country that may have come closest to the ideal of the American anti-abortion extremists was Romania under its dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. He prohibited contraceptives and made abortion a crime punishable by up to five years in prison.
When Ceausescu was overthrown, one of his legacies most shocking to the first Western visitors was the misery caused by the policy against abortion and contraception: in the words of The Economist, ''the highest infant-mortality rate in Europe, overflowing orphanages and the deaths of many pregnant women.'' To Ceausescu, as to the zealots here, the lives of women did not matter.

HEADLINE: Yes, Economic Incentives for the Soviets

BYLINE: By Richard A. Gephardt; Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, is House Majority Leader.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
It is self-evident that the people of Eastern Europe have much to gain from freedom and democracy. What is less obvious, but no less important, is what America can gain: billions in defense savings, thousands of jobs, new markets and a chance to pull our children from the brink of nuclear Armageddon.
Yet an amazing chorus of caution warns against using the tools of investment and trade to advance American interests and values in the emerging democracies. But bold action is what these times demand. I have called for economic incentives to open new markets by moving Eastern Europe toward freedom. 
They include loosening restrictions on high-tech exports that are not essential to national security; lifting bans on loans and insurance for private investors in Eastern Europe; forming a ''free-enterprise corps'' to encourage Americans to return to the countries of their ancestors to help a new generation to freedom.
We should create a ''freedom international program'' to enrich both sides of the Atlantic through educational and scientific exchanges on an unprecedented scale and a ''food for freedom'' program to stock shelves and open markets for American farmers while Eastern Europeans move to private ownership. We should waive trade restrictions on countries that meet our requirements on human rights.
Soon a great competition among industrialized nations for these freer markets will begin. And in that competition, American jobs are already on the line. Eastern Europeans want to buy American cars, clothes and computers, but first they must be set firmly on the road to economic success. If Americans are not with them on that journey, they will naturally look to the European Community and to Japan. And what of the Soviet Union? The cheers were deafening last month when President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia told Congress: ''You can help us most of all if you help the Soviet Union on its irreversible but immensely complicated road to democracy.'' Republicans and Democrats alike applauded both the man and the message. But when I seconded Mr. Havel's motion, many of those same Republicans and the Administration balked and cried foul. They are wrong. American trade preferences, food shipments and investment insurance - all tied to progress on economic and political reform - would foster positive change in the Soviet Union.
This would be the logical extension of the moral and political support President Bush has already given to democratization in the Soviet Union. Regrettably, his Administration has not embraced this course of action and thus risks once again being a bystander to history.
The Administration defends its policy of timidity and reaction in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union by saying that we must go slow until we're sure of the success of democratic reforms. But if it won't encourage societies visibly moving away from Communism, why is the Administration subsidizing China, a Communist society that is moving deeper into repression?
The Bush China policy is one of destructive engagement. The U.S. is modernizing Chinese F-8 fighter jets and ammunition plants and selling anti-submarine torpedoes and artillery-locating radar to China. The Administration allows more high-tech exports to China than to Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia combined. Since the Tiananmen massacre, the Administration has allowed $76 million in World Bank loans and $33 million in Export-Import Bank assistance to China's repressive regime.
Unlike the giveaways in the Bush China policy, the measures I propose for Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union have strings attached, strings to pull them toward democracy and free markets. No one is proposing to send checks to the Soviet Union.
The Soviet Union has a long way to go toward freedom. Accordingly, our efforts should be tied to continued progress: to an end of foreign adventurism, improvements in human rights and emigration, and further economic reforms.
Yet the movement toward freedom is undeniable. We must act now to advance freedom and democracy in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Not because it is good for them, but because it is good for us.

From Mean Turf To Green Lawns And Back Again

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING

DATELINE: ISLIP, L.I.

 BODY:
It was Scott Fitzgerald who observed that the very rich are not like you and me - and not, as Hemingway retorted, because they have more money. The same might be said of the very poor, and that, too, it is not merely a matter of money.
''Everybody hates you,'' said Evette Gandia, who grew up in a housing project in the Bronx. ''You look at somebody and they say, 'Why are you looking at me?' You always have to look over your shoulder. There is no safety zone. There is no control. You're out there. You're just out there.'' 
It is not poverty itself, but the conditions of poverty - the squalor, the crime, the brutality and hopelessness and anger - that spin a web that ensnares whole families for generations.
''The majority of parents are just teen-agers,'' Ms. Gandia said, ''and their kids are out there, 5, 6 years old, doing drugs. Kids are selling, controlling the streets. The kids are brought up by street punks. They're the big brothers, they're the support system. Street punks. Who do you look up to?
''You have to get out,'' said Ms. Gandia, a pale, intense young woman with a shy smile and a frail look that is deceptive. ''The Bronx is not a place that gives you support. You have to get away. A lot of the kids I grew up with, half the guys are in jail, the girls are in jail or pregnant.''
Evette Gandia is one who did get out. At 22, she will graduate in June from the New York Institute of Technology here with a degree in business administration and begin a job with a Manhattan advertising agency as a market analyst, figuring out how to sell Arrid Extra Dry.
At 16, a boyfriend taught her how to use a .38. ''It was survival,'' she said, ''because of the gangs.
It's still home in a closet. It's registered under the name of one of my mother's boyfriends. I never used it on anybody.''
Now, ''I just carry a butterfly knife. I even have it here,'' she said, gesturing across the quiet tree-lined campus. ''It's in the drawer in my room. But when I go home it's in my pocket.
''When you go home you definitely need them. Being 16 and being out there. Getting hit for no reason. Being told you're a spic. Being hit, your jewelry, your money you worked for being taken. Being told you can't make it. Because you're short. I'm bowlegged. Being told you're bowlegged. That you're a whore. The anger. It came down to survival, learning how to survive.''
She says it all now without emotion, a matter-of-fact recitation that could be an oral essay in sociology class. She has been at Tech for four years, one of about 100 students here, one of about 7,500 on 79 campuses across the state, who are part of New York's Higher Education Opportunity Program, invariably called ''Heop.'' It is intended for economically deprived students with poor high school records but the potential to make it through college with financial aid, remedial courses, counseling and intensive one-on-one tutoring.
Ms. Gandia runs the student learning center on campus and is a driving force in the Big Brother and Big Sister program, which guides younger students through the academic and personal maze that college often is, especially for those who, like her, spring from backgrounds that ravage rather than nurture. She wants to expand the program to the Islip community. ''This was so good for me, and I want to give something back,'' she said. She was selected Tech's Heop Student of the Year.
But an older sister, an 18-year-old brother who dropped out of school and now has an 8-month-old son, and her mother, who has serious high blood pressure and neglects her medication, still live in the housing project, and, as a college graduate with a good job, Evette Gandia plans to go home to help. She does so with trepidation. The last time she was there, two weeks ago, she was robbed with a knife at her throat and her sister was thrown to the ground.
Here ''the guys look after the girls, you have picnics,'' she said. ''There are trees. I'm asthmatic and I need a lot of nature. You can walk here and feel safe. It's wonderful. I've made real friends. At home, you have to question even your friends. Are they real friends or are they going to stab you in the back?
''These kids in the projects are screaming for help, but they have to be the tough guy, the tough girl, so they don't get abused, don't get taken. I'm two people. When I go back there, I put on the face. Don't touch me. What's mine is mine.
''I don't feel trapped. I just feel anger - the destruction of young people.
''But I've learned from this program how strong I am. How much I can give.'' Small, pale and frail-looking, she holds up her arms in a Rocky-like gesture of triumph, smiles her little-girl smile and the little room where she is talking suddenly seems very big and sunny.

HEADLINE: Florio Defends Higher Taxes, Urging State to Face Reality

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 15

 BODY:
Gov. Jim Florio told the Legislature today that his plan to impose $1.4 billion in new taxes in the next fiscal year was unavoidable if New Jersey is to look the future squarely in the eye.
''We are confronted by harsh realities and hard decisions,'' Mr. Florio said in an address to a joint session of the Assembly and Senate. ''The time has come to face them. As one of my heroes, the great heavyweight Joe Louis, used to say: 'You can run but you can't hide.' '' 
Democrats praised their Governor's proposal of a harsh budget that sharply cuts spending for most departments, saying the state finally had a strong leader willing to confront the tough problems that Mr. Florio's Republican predecessor, Thomas H. Kean, had avoided.
 
Republicans Are Critical
Spokesmen for the state's cities, teachers and school districts and groups that will soon feel the sting of more than a billion dollars in cutbacks described the coming year in terms that ranged from bleak to disastrous.
And Republicans accused the Governor of political slickness. Mr. Florio, they said, campaigned last year indicating he would not raise taxes, and now is calling for excessive increases in the state's sales and income taxes in this non-election year to create a budget surplus in time for his next election campaign.
The effects of Mr. Florio's proposed $12.1 billion budget, in which spending is cut for almost every department, would include the following:
* No major increases in aid to school districts, making cutbacks in services and increases in local property taxes likely in the coming year.
* An $89 million, or 11 percent, cut in aid to higher education, making major staff cuts or tuition increases likely.
* Large cuts in financing for transportation, including a $25 million reduction in construction projects and $49.7 million less than New Jersey Transit is requesting, forcing the agency that operates the state's buses and subways to raise fares for the third consecutive year.
* A cut of nearly $20 million, or 15 percent, in financing for the state's Department of Environmental Protection, and a $50 million reduction in general funds for cleaning up hazardous waste sites.
* A freeze on the size of welfare checks and cuts in spending on AIDS and drug-abuse treatment.
Among the few areas that would receive increases in spending would be prisons, the Department of Human Services and three initiatives to improve education announced in Mr. Florio's speech today: a $600 million bond issue to refurbish school buildings, a $5 million appropriation to expand Head Start programs and $1 million in the more than $12 billion budget for a math and science achievement program.
''The budget I'm proposing for the fiscal year starting this July 1st is harsh,'' Mr. Florio said. ''It contains measures tougher than a compassionate people should have to take.''
''But the one-shot fixes, the refusals to face reality, that went into the budget under which we now live - the budget I've inherited - would be shortsighted if we applied them again.''
Like other northeastern states coming out of an era of economic growth, New Jersey has seen its revenues fall far short of expectations in the last two years. In the manner that often typified his political life, Mr. Florio, a former amateur boxer, chose to attack the problem with one swift knockout punch.
 
'Rainy Day Fund' Proposed
To address the budget gap in fiscal year 1991, which begins on July 1, Mr. Florio's proposal calls for raising the sales tax to 7 percent from 6 percent, and applying it to many more products; raising alcohol and tobacco taxes; taxing telephone transmissions and all petroleum products, except heating oil, and ending a popular property-tax rebate for homeowners.
To avoid future budget crises, Mr. Florio today proposed instituting a ''rainy day fund'' to save unexpected new revenues, and a cap on state spending.
And to address the complex web of problems that grow out of the state's heavy dependence on property taxes, Mr. Florio proposed an increase in the state income tax for residents with incomes of more than $55,000 starting next Jan. 1.
The income tax increase would be used to shift more of the cost of government to the wealthy, reduce the burden of local property taxes on individuals and poor cities, and increase aid for poor school districts.
 
Praise from Democrats
Many Democrats today described the swiftness of the Mr. Florio's moves during his first two months in office, the depths of his proposed cuts and his willingness to talk about shifting money from rich to poor, as hallmarks of political courage. Unlike Mr. Kean, and governors like Mario M. Cuomo of New York and Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, some Democrats said, Mr. Florio was not delaying pain for political gain.
''This Governor has demonstrated that he isn't about to run away and pretend we don't have a problem,'' said Senator John A. Lynch, the president of the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats. ''He's facing it head on.''
Mr. Lynch said that he was optimistic that the Senate would support most of Mr. Florio's proposals, but that most legislators still had to review the specifics.
The Democratic Assembly Speaker, Joseph V. Doria Jr. of Bayonne, was cautious about the bill's prospects, but said he preferred that all elements of the proposals, including the income tax and property tax relief for fiscal 1992, be voted on before July 1.
 
A Well-Worn Path
Republicans, predictably, were far less optimistic.
''This thing is called 'get me into a second term,' '' said Senator William Gormley, a Republican from Ocean County. Mr. Gormley said Mr. Florio had followed a well-worn but cynical political path, denying the need for taxes last year to win the election.
On first impression, Mr. Gormley said he believed the increases in sales and income taxes would bring in more money than the state needed, thus causing Mr. Florio the greatest political damage early in his term.
Mr. Florio's strategy, Mr. Gormley said, was based on the assumption he would not have to raise taxes again and that by the time Mr. Florio runs for re-election in 1993, voters will have forgotten the suffering of this year, and the state would be piling up large surpluses.
Representatives of the state's cities and environmental groups expressed disappointment and concern about the effect of the budget cuts on what they described as critical programs. But perhaps the most strident objections came from the New Jersey Education Association, the state's largest teachers' union.
''If this budget is the price of faulty past priorities and misjudgments,'' the association said in a statement, ''it must not be paid by the children.''
''The education budget put forward by Governor Florio,'' it said, ''would be nothing short of a disaster for schools, colleges, communities and children.''

HEADLINE: Rich and Poor in One World of Film

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
IF Whit Stillman's droll portrait of Park Avenue debutantes and their beaus catches on, it is quite possible that the acronym UHB (short for Urban Haute Bourgeoisie and pronounced ''ub'') will become a new slang term. UHB is the term invented in the film ''Metropolitan'' by Charlie, a bespectacled collegiate philosopher in an uppercrust clique nicknamed the S.F.R.P., for Sally Fowler Rat Pack, who hang out together at seasonal balls and in their families' gold-trimmed apartments over the holidays.
The film - one of two American features selected for this year's New Directors/New Films series at the Museum of Modern Art - was one of the popular hits at the Sundance United States Film Festival in Park City, Utah, and will have its first New York public screening a week from tonight at the museum.
The Ivory Coast film maker Henri Duparc's ''Dancing in the Dust,'' which will be shown this evening and tomorrow, shares some striking similarities to ''Metropolitan,'' though it comes from a different continent and explores a way of life that would be taboo on Park Avenue. Mr. Duparc's sex comedy contemplates with an amused good humor the uproar in the household of a polygamous village chief known as Demi Dieu, when his beautiful, independent sixth wife brings a more modern urban point of view along with a cheeky self-determination into his closed provincial way of life. 
In all probability the worlds of the S.F.R.P. and of Demi Dieu's harem will never see each other in the flesh. But it is the special opportunity of a series like New Directors/New Films to be able to have them figuratively rub elbows on the same movie screen, since both are part of the festival. Audiences who see both can hardly fail to sense the similarities shared by two closed, cliquish worlds of privilege, each with its own claustrophobic set of rules.
Ann Turner's ''Celia,'' which comes from Australia and has its first screening on Monday, and Pekka Parikka's ''Plainlands,'' from Finland, which plays on Wednesday and Thursday, also explore in elaborate detail the explosive pressures on individuals living in circumscribed social settings.
The protagonist of ''Celia,'' which is set in the late 1950's, is a 9-year-old girl reacting to the death of her much-loved Communist grandmother, at a time of anti-Communist hysteria. Even though the movie is set in Australia, the wary, conformist social mood it evokes is remarkably similar to the feeling in American suburbs during the McCarthy era.
One comes away from ''Plainlands'' with a similar sense of recognition. Set in Finland's farm country, Mr. Parikka's film undercuts the popular image of the Finns as willowy, ethereal children of the midnight sun. Its main characters are a family of embittered, hard-drinking farmers who on one hot summer Sunday afternoon go on a rowdy picnic, taking with them an illegally possessed automatic rifle. The movie presents the image of a Scandinavian type that until now has been unfamiliar to American film audiences: the Finnish redneck.
 
Comparative Sociology
If the chief purpose of the New Directors series, which this year enters its 19th season, is showcasing the work of young, talented directors from around the world, one of the side benefits for anyone who attends several films in the series is the lesson in comparative sociology that these films offer. In a way that ordinary tourism seldom allows, those movies with contemporary settings can plunge the viewer right into the heart of an alien society, with subtitles eliminating the barriers to comprehension. And with those barriers removed, what one usually finds is psychologically familiar.
As the technology of movie making has become more sophisticated and the videocassette revolution has accelerated the dissemination of movies around the world, this sense of familiarity has been increasing. In festivals like New Directors/New Films, one senses the world becoming more of a global village in many ways. The shared vocabularies of film and video are one aspect. A second is music. In Nanni Moretti's political comedy ''Palombella Rossa'' - which will be screened Wednesday and Thursday and is one of two Italian films in the series - the crowd at a water-polo exhibition stands at attention while a Bruce Springsteen song plays. The Platters' recording of ''Only You'' underscores a significant dramatic moment in the Soviet film maker Abai Karpikov's ''Little Fish in Love,'' which also uses the music of Sade in the background. (That film will be shown March 30 and April 1.)
 
The Merry-Go-Round
In a recent colloquy with the six members of the New Directors selection committee, who represent the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Museum of Modern Art - the organizers of the series - there was a general agreement that the videocassette revolution has made it much easier for film makers around the world to see and react to one another's work and also to have it seen by film festival committees.
Evaluating the situation, Richard Pena, the program director of the Film Society, painted a picture of world cinema as a kind of merry-go-round of interconnected styles and sensibilities.
''You have an incredible confluence of influences,'' he said of this year's festival. ''The Japansese film 'Untamagiru,' which opens the series this evening, could be read perfectly within what we call magic realism, which we tend to think of as a Latin American genre. That's just one example of the kind of cross-fertilization going on. In evaluating films nowadays, it's not at all unusual for us to find a contemporary Finnish film maker whose work looks like that of a Japanese film maker 20 years ago. 'The Seventh Continent,' from Austria, owes more to Bresson than to German film making, while 'Double-Edged Knife,' from Brazil, recalls Hollywood film noir. 'Metropolitan' reflects 1930's Hollywood filtered through someone who really knows Eric Rohmer's work.''
 
Downward Mobility
The worlds examined in ''Metropolitan'' and in Stephanie Black's ''H-2 Worker'' - the two American feature-length films in this year's series - couldn't be more economically disparate. Where Mr. Stillman's wealthy Park Avenue collegians worry about downward mobility and view affluence without significant accomplishment as ''failure,'' Ms. Black's film looks at the hard lives of Jamaican sugar cutters who through a special visa arrangement are allowed into the United States to harvest sugar cane for meager wages in the Florida fields around Lake Okeechobee. Eager to perform the same tasks that American workers refuse to do, they allow themselves to be exploited and cheated out of their contracted wages because a way of life that to Americans borders on slavery is still much more lucrative than what they can find at home.
''H-2 Worker'' is the first film by Ms. Black, a 28-year-old film maker who attended the graduate program of New York University Film School.
''Over 10,000 Jamaican workers come to Florida every year for six months, from the end of October to the beginning of April,'' she explained the other day. ''It's been going on for 45 years. The sugar industry claims that they make $5,000 for the season, but the highest figure I ever encountered was $2,200. The workers themselves are afraid to speak. What I think the sugar industry is trying to do is to create a third-world enclave in Florida. An industry can go to a third-world country to get cheap labor to manufacture things, but you can't ship your land somewhere else.'' Uneasy Over Privilege The early college-age youths who converse in the Park Avenue apartments shown in ''Metropolitan'' have no financial worries and are self-conscious about their privileged status. When two of the men decide to make a spur-of-the-moment trip to the Hamptons to rescue a friend they fear is in danger of losing her virtue, they can afford to hire a taxi to drive them there.
''Metropolitan,'' which was written and directed by Mr. Stillman, a 38-year-old native New Yorker, is deliberately set in an ambiguous timespan that could be anywhere from the present to the 1950's.
''I wanted it to be somewhat in the past, but also a bit timeless so it would not be pegged to one year,'' the director said the other day. ''My own memories are from December 1969. Two years ago, just before we shot the movie, I snuck into a deb party just to make sure things hadn't changed too much. It still seemed valid.''
Mr. Stillman, who went into book and magazine publishing after graduating from Harvard in 1973, became involved in films in the early 1980's when he took a job representing Spanish films for foreign sales. The main reason he chose New York as his subject, he said, was that ''by filming beautiful New York I could have an expensive-looking film without actually paying any money for it.''
''The only living film maker I feel a really direct affinity for is Bill Forsyth, because he likes to deal in this kind of comedy,'' he went on. ''I don't think this subset has been portrayed before in a detailed, authentic way -at least in a long time. Maybe certain things from the 30's like 'The Philadelphia Story' and 'Holiday,' but they put sugar coating on it. Those films were just gaga in love with the very rich. I didn't want my film to be cruel but accurate and funny.'' Haves and Have-Nots As an exercise in comparative sociology, one of the lessons that New Directors/New Films teaches every year - and perhaps this year a bit more forcefully than most - is that the world is made up of haves and have-nots, and that the latter vastly outnumber the former. Poverty is devastatingly addressed in Jorge Furtado's ''Island of Flowers,'' the 13-minute short film from Brazil that plays a week from tonight and March 25 with the Brazilian film maker Murilo Salles's sexy, high-gloss thriller, ''Double-Edged Knife.''
Poverty compounded by disaster is also the subject of ''Water, Wind, Sand,'' the Iranian film maker Amir Naderi's harrowing study of the effects of a drought on a rural Iranian village. In the film, which will be shown tomorrow and Sunday evening, an adolescent returns to his family's poor, drought-stricken community to find his parents have already pulled up stakes, leaving no word of their destination. While searching for them in a raging sandstorm, he finds an abandoned baby boy whom he tries to rescue by leaving him in the path of several departing nomadic groups.
The director, speaking through a translator, said the other day that his film had been made as an homage to the documentarian Robert Flaherty and had been filmed in southeastern Iran, near the Pakistan and Afghanistan border, where a prolonged drought has killed thousands and made conditions unlivable.
''The film was shot in 90 days in the most difficult circumstances,'' he said. ''The temperatures were nearly 100 degrees Fahrenheit every day, and the continuous winds ranged from 40 to 120 miles per hour. Working with only a crew of five people with limited supplies of food and water and sleeping in shelters without any ceilings, we eventually became part of the nature of that area.''
From the corridors of Park Avenue to Iranian desert sands, the selections in this year's New Directors/New Films offer several world tours worthy of armchair traveling. At the same time, however, it is remarkable how much of the psychological territory covered in those thousands of miles will seem familiar.

HEADLINE: St. Patrick's Day: The Parade and Much More

BYLINE: By RICHARD F. SHEPARD

 BODY:
It's a strange thing, the way the Irish take over New York on St. Patrick's Day. Strange because in this city of endless diversity - of citizens from the corners of the earth who have unpacked their bags to stay -the Irish are the best at persuading the rest of us that the rest of us, too, have some special attachment to that Atlantic island off the coast of Europe.
Take tomorrow, for instance. The ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADEhas been a staple of March 17 since Colonial times, and, even as the Irish presence in the city is diminished, gives the impression of becoming bigger each year. Tomorrow's procession, to stress the point, is expected to put more than 150,000 marchers afoot; who knows how many of them actually have roots in Erin? The parade goes from 44th Street and Fifth Avenue, starting at 11:30 A.M., to 86th Street and Third Avenue, where the marchers are expected to disperse by 6 P.M. in a neighborhood that was once a center of Irish life in Manhattan. 
Among the paraders will be 150 bands, providing a portable din of skirling bagpipes and tweeting flutes, and onlookers won't just be whistling Dixie or growing maudlin over the shillelagh me father brought from Ireland. The music makers will come from near and far, and those to be counted among the farthest are bands from Ireland and Bermuda, as well as the Bagad de St. Nazaire, from a section of France from which the Bretons, Celtic kinfolk of the Irish, hail. And if the ears are sated, there will be sights for winter-sore eyes as young (and older and old) men and women pass by in uniforms and civvies, sorted by community here and county there.
For the first time, paraders will carry signs other than the traditional ones, authorized by the parade committee, that urge the English to get out of Northern Ireland. The new banners - signs of the times, really -will proclaim ''Immigration Reform Now'' and are the work of the Irish Immigration Reform Movement, which speaks for the new wave of Irish taking refuge here from economic doldrums in Ireland.
 
Mass and After
The Day of St. Patrick, who has not surprisingly become the patron saint of New York as well as of Ireland, is one that, often lamentably to those seriously immersed in Irish culture, has become, like New Year's Day, one associated purely with revelry. It is worth noting that a mass at ST. PATRICK'S CATHEDRAL,at 50th Street and Fifth Avenue, will precede the parade itself at 9 A.M. tomorrow.
The day undeniably infuses a touch of lightheartedness into the usually impervious city. The EMPIRE STATE BUILDING'S TOWERwill change its illuminated nocturnal coat of many colors to clad itself in glowing green from tonight through Sunday in honor of the occasion. The zealous may even find, in certain precincts, green bagels specially tinted in honor of a saint who may have had only a nodding acquaintance with the product. But man (and woman) does not live by bagel alone. There will be scores of dinners, hundreds of parties and countless special nights in bars and pubs and restaurants that are familiar with the Irish-American trade. Every St. Patrick's Day morning finds a line waiting on Lexington Avenue for the opening at 10:30 of TOMMY MAKEM'S IRISH PAVILION,around the corner at 130 East 57th Street (759-9040). The attraction is an Irish pub in mid-Manhattan that opens early and includes two cocktails as part of the $10 admission.
In the evening, a $10 cover charge buys admission to the club to hear Heather Breeze, a trio that has played Makem's before with its repertory of contemporary Irish folk music. From today through Sunday, there are three sets nightly starting at 8 P.M.; drinks are $4 and up.
 
Theater and Music
Theater - the medium so illuminated by Irish talent over the centuries - maintains its Irish connection in New York, the city that gave birth to Eugene O'Neill, one of the great playwrights of any stripe. More than coincidence has led the three-year-old COLONY THEATERto its current stage program, ''Ode to the Irish.'' The company is performing J. M. Synge's one-act comedy ''In the Shadow of the Glen'' and, on the same bill, a reading of selected poems by W. B. Yeats, memorializing a theatrical association of the two talented Irishmen that began with the Irish National Theater, later called the Abbey Theater. The program runs through March 24, Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 P.M., at Taylor Hall, beneath the Blessed Sacrament Church, at 152 West 71st Street. Admission is $8; free for those over 65. Information: 662-6193.
The IRISH ARTS CENTERhas been contributing to New York theater life for 15 years, and its current production, ''Away Alone,'' by Janet Noble, is a play about Irish illegal aliens in the Bronx. The St. Patrick's Day performance, tomorrow at 8 P.M. at 553 West 51st Street (757-3318), is a benefit for a young man from Kilmallock in County Limerick who is dying of a liver ailment.
After the show, Black 47, a three-piece group, will conduct a session of Irish music. Admission for entire evening: $40; for the music session alone, at 10:30 P.M., $10.
 
Irish Spoken Here
There are several storehouses of Irish New Yorkiana, but none so open to public and eager to encourage further study as IRISH BOOKS AND GRAPHICS,a tiny treasure house of Irish culture at 90 West Broadway, not five steps from Chambers Street (962-4237). Angela Carter founded the place a dozen years ago and now has it comfortably stocked with about 5,000 items. On the street level are travel books, general books about Ireland in English, maps old and new, and prints. Down a spiral staircase to the lower level is a world of Irish language: books, magazines and tracts in Irish. Small wonder to learn that every two months an Irish-speaking group assembles to discuss, in Irish, new turns in literature.
If there is need for a pretext to visit the shop, which is open today from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. and tomorrow from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M., it may be in the lure of a free talk there tomorrow at 10 A.M. It is in English, and the speaker is Prof. Catherine McKenna, the director of Irish studies at Queens College. The topic: ''Irish Society and Politics at the Time of St. Patrick,'' a subject that takes the listener back 1,500 years.
 
Landmarks
The Irish were once a considerable force in the city: 100 years ago and more, they were the largest single ethnic group in New York, suffering the discriminations that have since been passed along to newcomers. Although New York's Irish Americans have now dispersed to New Jersey, Long Island and other cross-border points, they have left - in addition to a continuing presence in places like Inwood in upper Manhattan and Woodside, Queens - markers of a municipal past distinguished by achievement and trial.
The links between New York and the Irish are forged in steel and concrete, as well as in sentiment. ''The Book of Irish Americans,'' William D. Griffin's fact-filled and anecdote-laden compendium of Irish Americana published this month, lists more than 40 Irish landmarks in Manhattan. Among them: ST. PAUL'S CHAPEL, Fulton Street and Broadway, the resting place of many distinguished American Irish Protestants; OLD ST. PATRICK'S CATHEDRAL,on Mott Street, near Bleecker Street, dedicated in 1815; #7 STATE STREET, MISSION OF OUR LADY OF THE ROSARY, once a shelter for immigrants opposite Battery Park where Castle Garden was once the main conduit for millions of newcomers to America.
There are few neighborhoods the eyes can rest on that do not sport an Irish memento, either in name or substance. CARDINAL HAYES PLACE,near Police Headquarters and the Civic Center, the street where the illustrious former chief Catholic prelate in New York was born; MOYLAN PLACE, off 125th Street and west of Broadway, named for a Cork-born Revolutionary general; CLAREMONT AVENUE,which honors Michael Hogan, born in County Clare and a leading New York businessman in post-Revolutionary times.
These are Mr. Griffin's choices, but it is possible to arrange one's own expeditions in search of Irish memories around town.
The Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank Building - now the NEW YORK CITY OFFICE BUILDING- at 51 Chambers Street, just north of the City Hall compound, is the third home of an institution organized in 1817 to serve the incoming Irish. Almost next to it, on the corner, at #280 BROADWAY,is a landmark building that opened in 1846 as A. T. Stewart's Dry Goods Store, America's first grand department store. It became even grander years later as Wanamaker's, which had bought out the luxury trade enterprise established by an Irish immigrant. It now houses a discount store and city offices.
The Ancient Order of Hibernians, which has a major role in the parade, was founded in 1851 at ST. JAMES ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH,at Ames Street, near the Bowery in Chinatown. The church is still active, but its worshipers are more likely to speak in accents Hispanic or Chinese than Hibernian.
Some of these places will be visited during a WALKING TOURon Sunday, sponsored by the 92d Street Y and led by James Shenton, a history professor at Columbia University. It begins at 1 P.M. on the steps of City Hall and will wind past Irish landmarks in Chinatown and Little Italy.
Stops include St. Peter's Church on Barclay Street, built in 1785 and believed to be the oldest Catholic parish in New York State; the old St. Patrick's Cathedral; the former Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank Building, and the site of A. T. Stewart's store. The tour, which goes on rain or shine, costs $18. Reservations are advised: 996-1110.
St. Patrick's Day is also a time to pay homage to famous Irish New Yorkers. Al Smith, the Lower East Side half-Irishman who became Governor of New York and whose Catholicism contributed to his defeat as Democratic Presidential candidate in 1928, has come and gone, along with his famous Brown Derby. So have Jimmy Walker and William O'Dwyer, two of the best-known Irish mayors of New York. Father Francis Duffy maintains a stony presence in the space bearing his name just north of TIMES SQUARE,a plaza his statue shares with that of the ''Yankee Doodle Dandy'' showman George M. Cohan. As tomorrow's parade slogs up Fifth Avenue, it will be easy to remember that at least once a year, you can't take the Irish out of New York. And who would be wanting to, anyhow?

HEADLINE: Brady Sees Bigger Role For S.E.C.

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said today that the Administration was studying plans to enlarge the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission that would strip at least some authority from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
The measures outlined by Mr. Brady are intended to combat excess volatility and improve enforcement in the securities markets.
Mr. Brady said he was concerned about the effects of the C.F.T.C.'s regulation of stock-index futures. These futures contracts enable an investor to speculate on the future course of the stock market without investing large amounts of money in the actual common stocks. 
 
Enforcement Is Difficult
The Treasury Secretary said that trading in stock-index futures directly affected the price of the underlying stocks and that divided regulation made enforcement and monitoring of the two markets difficult.
He said he was mainly concerned that different financial requirements set by the two regulators - primarily different levels of margin - for trading in the two markets created dangerous and unnecessary stock market volatility.
''The sharp stock market decline of October 1987 made clear that the markets for stocks, stock options and stock-index futures are linked as one market,'' Mr. Brady said in a speech to the National Newspaper Association, the trade group for small newspapers. ''And it demonstrated dramatically how these markets, all operating by their own sets of rules, can interact to stimulate excessive volatility and reinforce the downward spiral.''
He added that such split jurisdiction had also resulted in counterproductive legal battles over whether new investment instruments could be traded on a futures exchange or a stock exchange.
It was one of the strongest statements on this issue by the Treasury Secretary, who has warned about the problems of split jurisdiction since the market crash more than two years ago. Until recently, market experts and members of Congress saw little hope of enlarging the S.E.C.'s authority, because of the tenacious lobbying power of the Chicago futures industry and the lack of support from the Reagan Treasury.
But since the Bush Administration has taken office, the balance appears to have tipped, with a number of lawmakers predicting that Mr. Brady will eventually prevail.
 
'We'll Reap Great Benefits'
Explaining his thinking, the Treasury Secretary cited the regulatory structures of several foreign countries, where both securities and futures regulation is under one large agency. ''Like our market competitors abroad, we'll reap great benefits if we end the fragmented regulation of our markets,'' he said.
Mr. Brady said his office was studying three approaches. One would be a complete merger of the two agencies so that stock, options and futures would all be regulated by one agency. A alternative would be to place within the S.E.C. jurisdiction of financial futures, including foreign-currency futures and interest-rate futures as well as stock-index futures. A third approach would simply be to give the S.E.C. authority to regulate stock-index futures.
''Many have recommended full merger as the most straightforward and the course chosen by countries abroad,'' he said. ''There are arguments in favor of the other approaches as well. What's important is that we get something done, and get it done now.''
 
Battle in Congress
The issue is shaping up to be a major battle in Congress, where the C.F.T.C.'s reauthorization bill has been held up for fear an amendment reducing its powers might be added to it. The battle in Congress is certain to pit the leadership of the Senate and House Agriculture Committees, which oversee the C.F.T.C., against the Senate Banking Commitee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversee the S.E.C.
But some members of the Senate and House Agriculture Committees have said they favor changes in the regulatory structure. This week, Representative Dan Glickman, Democrat from Kansas, and a prominent member of the House committee, said he would introduce legislation to merge the two agencies into one large one.
Treasury officials have said that in any merger the S.E.C. will come out as the dominant force.
Mr. Brady has been advocating the position he outlined today for more than two years, since he was chairman of the White House Task Force on the stock market crash. Occupied with the savings and loan bailout, Mr. Brady has had little time in the last year to address this issue, his aides say. But with the bailout measure wrapped up last August, they say he has put the regulatory jurisdictional issues among his top priorities this year.

HEADLINE: A Drexel Brainchild Haunts 'Junk' Market

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
A once-obscure bond, invented by Drexel Burnham Lambert to encourage financing for takeovers and leveraged buyouts, is now instead contributing to problems in the ''junk bond'' market.
The bond, known as a reset, was conceived to provide investors with insurance against falling bond prices. It does this by guaranteeing that at some point the interest rate it pays will be raised to maintain the original value of the bond. Such an increase could be necessary if interest rates as a whole are rising or if concerns about the corporate issuer's creditworthiness have grown.
While the guarantee is meant to reassure investors, recent developments have dampened enthusiasm for resets, many of which qualify as junk bonds because of their credit risk. Hillsborough Holdings, the building products company based in Tampa, Fla., blamed reset bonds for its sudden decision to file for bankruptcy protection last December. And fears that RJR Nabisco Inc. will not be able to meet the terms of its reset provisions are helping to depress the prices of some $6 billion of its bonds. 
 
How the Bonds Work
All told, more than 40 companies have issued a total of $12 billion of reset bonds since 1986, and some seem unlikely to be able to meet their reset obligations.
In an example of how a reset bond works, assume that interest rates have risen in the 18 months since the issuance of a bond paying 13 percent interest, or that doubts about the issuing company's ability to pay its debts have grown. If the price of those bonds has tumbled from 100 to, say, 85, on the appointed reset date the company would have to raise the interest rate from 13 percent to 18 or 20 percent, or whatever rate was necessary to increase the price of the bonds to 100 percent or so of their initial value.
Similarly, when interest rates are falling or a company's credit prospects have vastly improved, the interest rate on the bond could be lowered on the reset date.
Companies in the throes of an acquisition were willing to take on this added risk because few expected that they would actually have to pay higher interest rates. New owners expected to restructure their companies and sell assets, which would enable them to retire debt or refinance their deals long before the day of reckoning came.
In theory, everybody wins with resets. But in practice, resets, like many new Wall Street products, have their shortcomings. While they have helped investors during periods of rising interest rates, they have not provided investors with any protection from companies that turned out to be bad credit risks.
''I think they're a disaster,'' said David M. Schulte, managing partner of Chicago-based Chilmark Partners, which invests in troubled companies. ''They're trying to fool Mother Nature.''
 
A Case Study
Consider the fortunes of investors in Hillsborough Holdings, which was taken private by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company in 1988. To help pay for the company, then known as the Jim Walter Corporation, Kohlberg, Kravis issued $625 million in three reset offerings, all of which were to come due at the beginning of this year unless they were extended and the interest rate reset.
But a lawsuit filed by asbestos claimants against the company hindered its ability to sell assets to pay down debt. That caused the prices of some Hillsborough bonds to drop precipitously last fall, to about $35 for every $100 of their face value. In December, Merrill Lynch & Company and Drexel Burnham advised Hillsborough that there was no interest rate at which the notes could be reset to have a bid value of 101 percent.
When bondholders refused to accept an alternative package of securities from Kohlberg, Kravis that included some equity in the company, Hillsborough filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. The filing was made two days before the company was required to reset the rates.
The reset provision ''was what pushed them into default,'' said Sean St. Clair, director of high-yield research at Duff & Phelps, the Chicago credit-rating agency.
 
An Improved Version
Hillsborough's bonds belonged to the first generation of resets. Since then, investment bankers have come up with an improved version, with a cap on the reset interest rate. For instance, in the case of two other heavily indebted companies at which credit concerns have grown - the Southland Corporation and Farley Inc. - the interest rate on their reset bonds can go no higher than 16 percent and 17.625 percent, respectively. Those increases are not nearly enough to make those bonds trade close to par. Southland was recently trading at around $32 per $100 face value and Farley at around $24.
Other companies have been able to reset their bonds without coming anywhere near the cap. A $602 million bond issue from Owens-Illinois, which went private in a leveraged buyout in 1987, was reset yesterday at 13.45 percent, up from a rate of 12.625 percent and a long way from its 15.125 percent cap. The bonds traded at par after the new rate was announced.
While caps may take the pressure off companies issuing the bonds, they may deprive investors of higher yields, which could compensate for the increasing risk of owning those bonds. The irony of many resets, said Kingman Penniman, a high-yield analyst at McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei, is that ''what was intended initially to protect the investor has ended up protecting companies.'' Resets, he concludes, ''have offered a bell and whistle that in hindsight has not afforded the protection it promised.''
The biggest test for resets involves RJR Nabisco, the food and tobacco company that Kohlberg, Kravis acquired in early 1989. RJR has three reset issues totaling $6.125 billion. All must be reset in May 1991. Although these bonds were issued long after the benefits of caps had been discovered, all but $225 million of RJR's reset bonds have no cap. Drexel Burnham advised Kohlberg, Kravis that investors would balk at absorbing such a huge amount of bonds unless the company agreed to forgo its cap protection.
 
Price Down Sharply
Because of jitters in the junk bond market and concerns that RJR Nabisco will not be able to meet its reset obligations, the company's bonds have been severely depressed and two of its issues are now trading in the $60 range. If Kohlberg, Kravis had to reset the rate tomorrow, bond traders and credit analysts said, there would be no reasonable interest rate that would cause the bonds to trade back up to par.
An RJR spokesman said the company had any number of options, and added that 14 months was a long time away. But many bond analysts and portfolio managers said they remained unconvinced.
If RJR is unable to fulfill its reset provision, the consequences could be serious. Even if RJR's bonds trade back up to the $80 range, for example, that would still result in a 20 percent decline in their par value, or a loss to investors of about $1.2 billion.
''That's a lot of money,'' said Talton R. Embry, president of Magten Asset Management, which specializes in buying junk bonds. ''Someone may try to force them into bankruptcy or sue them.''
Despite problems like those with RJR, Mr. Embry is not ready to denounce resets. They may have failed miserably on their promise to protect investors from credit risk, he said, but they do force companies and their investors back to the table early, which could result in bondholders gaining a handsome slice of troubled companies' equity.
In the case of Hillsborough, for instance, investors were offered 10 percent of the company's equity, but that was not regarded as sufficient.
''There is a lever after 12 or 18 months where bondholders can renegotiate the deal,'' Mr. Embry said. ''That part of the promise has held up extraordinarily well.''

CORRECTION-DATE: March 17, 1990, Saturday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
A table in Business Day yesterday headed ''First-Generation Reset Bonds,'' about a type of bond devised by Drexel Burnham Lambert, gave an incorrect price for GACC Holding's bonds. They have recently been trading in the mid-$80 range per $100 of face value.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
U.S. Lessons For Soviet Reform

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
DESPITE Mikhail S. Gorbachev's high standing abroad and his unopposed election as the Soviet Union's first Executive President, his popularity appears to be sinking like a stone with his own people as a result of his failure to deliver on his economic promises.
Marshall D. Shulman, the senior director emeritus of the Harriman Institute of Columbia University, who hopes Mr. Gorbachev will succeed, has himself been shocked by the rising public anger with the Soviet leader. Mr. Shulman described a party with old Moscow friends at which the young man of the family, watching Mr. Gorbachev addressing the Congress of People's Deputies, hooted, ''Blah blah blah.''
And a taxi driver, who refused to accept rubles, which he described with a contemptuous epithet, also called Mr. Gorbachev's words ''blah blah blah.''
Apparently seeking to deflect criticism from himself, Mr. Gorbachev appears ready to throw Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov to the wolves. Mr. Gorbachev has permitted a leader of the radical opposition, Anatoly Sobchak, to bring charges of corruption against the Prime Minister over his purported illegal exportation of a sophisticated Soviet battle tank, the T-72. 
A more critical issue, though, is the economy. In accepting the Executive Presidency, Mr. Gorbachev vowed to move his nation more rapidly in the direction of a market economy.
But questions remain whether the leadership has the foggiest idea of how to convert from an economy overburdened with military expenditures to a more efficient, less inflationary civilian economy.
Attending an international economic seminar here, Henry S. Rowen, the United States Assistant Defense Secretary for international security affairs, estimated that Soviet military spending constitutes 20 to 30 percent of gross national product - four to five times the American military burden.
But Mr. Rowen and other Americans here with experience in converting military plants to civilian use after World War II, Korea and Vietnam have concluded that the Soviets are being naive and essentially wrongheaded about how to make such a conversion.
Soviet thinking is typified by that of Leonid Vid, deputy chairman of Gosplan, the state planning committee, who spoke at the seminar here. In an article in the weekly publication Ogonyok in May, Mr. Vid said the conversion of Soviet plants was taking place in various ways; he cited as a good example the Votkinsk plant in the Urals, which previously built the SS-20 medium-range missiles that were eliminated by a treaty with the United States.
The Votkinsk plant, Mr. Vid said, has started producing heat-resistant storage containers. He added: ''The trucks which used to carry missiles will now take tanks of cooled beer, juices and milk to consumers. Each container can hold 24,000 pints of chilled beer, enough to satisfy the thirst of a small town.''
But William J. Perry, chairman and chief executive of Technology Strategies and Alliances of Menlo Park, Calif., a consulting firm that advises military producers, told the Russians here that although the most obvious course for a military company with decreasing orders was to diversify into products for the commercial market, this could be a terrible mistake. In the United States, Mr. Perry said, most such attempts had been ''unsuccessful, some spectacularly so.''
He urged Soviet military companies planning to diversify to assess the qualities that had enabled them to succeed in the military field. In the United States, military contractors' growth had usually been determined by technology and ability to sell that technology to a small, select number of customers, and the profits of these companies had usually been based on costs incurred, not on ability to meet a market price in the face of competition.
These qualities, when applied to commercial markets, Mr. Perry said, ''generally led to failure, since the competitive factors in most commercial markets are quite different.'' Hence he warned that a military systems company should not try to make the enormous leap into consumer products, where success depends on meeting the needs of a large and unsophisticated market, unless it had thoroughly thought through and developed plans for entering the civilian economy.
The danger of the Soviet approach, described by Mr. Vid and others, is that it is likely to transfer the high-cost methods - or even the cost-be-damned methods - of the military into the civilian economy, thereby aggravating inflationary pressures and worsening marketing problems.
Central state planning cannot solve those problems. The preferred approach, made simple in the United States by a sensitive market structure, would be for managers to respond to market signals; as long as the Soviet system remains a command economy rather than a market economy, Soviet managers will have difficulty following the American example. Yet there are examples in the American experience that could be applied here.
Prime Minister Ryzhkov comes out of the planning system, as does Mr. Gorbachev. The great question is whether the Soviet Executive President can at last change direction, gather around him advisers who are prepared to cut loose from the failing system of command and control, and give the people something more than ''blah blah blah.''

HEADLINE: Commerce Secretary Issues Warning on Japan's Surplus

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 15

 BODY:
After two days of meetings with Japanese Government officials, trading companies and political leaders, the United States Secretary of Commerce, Robert A. Mosbacher, warned today that Japan's trade surpluses had ''achieved a semipermanent status.''
Mr. Mosbacher appreared to be using his second trip here as Commerce Secretary to maintain the momentum created in Japan after the hastily called meeting two weeks ago between President Bush and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
Mr. Kaifu's Cabinet has been working long hours this week, trying to meet a deadline in a few days for a report on the progress of the trade negotiations known as the ''Structural Impediments Initiative,'' a series of trade talks seeking fundamental changes in the workings of the Japanese and United States economies. 
 
Concessions Likely
Japan seems likely to make some concessions in coming weeks, including a strengthening of Government investigations into areas like price collusion and new regulations that will keep local shopkeepers from blocking new, large stores for a decade or more.
In a speech today Mr. Mosbacher warned about Japan's high prices and the barriers to competition in telecommunications, construction and other areas, and said Japan should accept change as inevitable.
Apparently by coincidence, Mr. Mosbacher's trip came at the same time as a visit by Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, an author of the 1988 trade bill that established procedures to force faster change in markets that the United States maintains are closed.
Mr. Mosbacher and Mr. Danforth have met separately with many of the same officials and business executives, and both said they had found a change in Japan's attitude.
 
Mature Discussion
''This time, discussions have been very frank and quite varied,'' Mr. Danforth said. ''It wasn't as if I was getting the same speech in every meeting. There were differences of opinions.''
Mr. Mosbacher's aides said much the same. ''It was a bit surprising to us,'' one aide said, ''but it indicates that the discussion is maturing.''
Mr. Mosbacher had little to offer Japan in the way of concrete changes in the American economy that would meet Japan's demand for a restoration of American competitiveness.
''Mr. Mosbacher spoke very well, but he did not have a lot more substantive progress to show since he was here last September,'' said an official of the Keidanren, the big-business organization here, after a meeting with the Commerce Secretary.
