HEADLINE: Tax Plan Spurs New Sugar Battle in Florida

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Feb. 16

 BODY:
After failing to get rid of Federal price supports for sugar, environmentalists in Florida are now battling it out with sugar cane growers over a proposed tax that would raise money to help restore the Everglades.
Environmental groups, attributing degradation of the Everglades to fertilizer-laden runoff from sugar farms, say the tax would allow the Government to buy sugar fields, yielding a double benefit: reducing pollution and using the land to restore the natural hydration cycles needed to preserve the imperiled marshlands of South Florida. 
 But the way they are proposing to pay for the land -- by raising about $350 million over five years from growers through an assessment of 2 cents per pound on all Florida raw sugar -- has set off a new round of acrimony in their long, bitter war with the sugar industry.
Supporters of the assessment are focusing on the Federal Government, seeing a window of opportunity in a Presidential election year. Trying to win public support for it, if not in Congress then through a ballot initiative, they have mounted an advertising campaign that puts political candidates and officeholders on the spot.
"Next time President Clinton and Senator Dole visit Florida," one television advertisement urges, "ask them what they've done to make Big Sugar pay to clean up our Everglades, so our taxpayers and our kids don't have to."
So far, Congress has proven reluctant to disregard the powerful sugar industry lobby, which gives millions to Republicans and Democrats alike.
Last week Mr. Dole, the Senate majority leader and a candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination, included in the Senate farm bill $200 million for the Everglades. But the tax proposal, sponsored by Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee who also is running for the Republican nomination, has foundered in the face of bipartisan opposition.
Environmentalists may soon be getting some high-level support: Administration officials say President Clinton is considering throwing his support behind a 1-cent assessment on the sugar growers.
The growers have responded to the campaign for the sugar tax with their own barrage of advertisements, warning of "environmental extremists" who want to kick farmers off their lands, causing the loss of thousands of jobs. They say it is absurd to tax them and then use the money to buy them out.
"We don't want to see our taxes raised or our lands seized," said Robert H. Buker Jr., a spokesman for the United Sugar Corporation.
Florida officials said last week that they would try to buy 32,000 acres from a sugar company and use the land for water storage, if they were given enough Federal aid.
The acquisition of agricultural and other lands has long been part of the strategy to restore the Everglades, but the officials say the acreage from Talisman Sugar Corporation, southeast of Lake Okeechobee, is the first major piece of contiguous property currently in sugar production that has come up for sale.
A coalition of environmental groups say that at least 130,000 acres of sugar fields, about one-fifth planted sugar acreage, are needed to help bring the wetlands back. They advocate that the land be bought as it becomes available, as in the Talisman case, or through compensated takeovers by the state.
But Federal and state money for the land purchases is hard to come by. And groups like the National Audubon Society and the Everglades Coalition say that taxpayers should not bear the burden of paying most of the restoration and cleanup costs.
"We don't suggest taking the whole sugar production out of business," said Eric Draper, vice president for policy for the National Audubon Society in Florida. "Let's just use some of the profits they make off the Everglades to help pay for some of their mess."
A main point of contention has been determining what is the growers' fair share of the cleanup cost, which is estimated at $700 million to $1 billion. The sugar companies say hat they have agreed to pay up to $322 million over 20 years and that that should be enough. Critics say the industry should be responsible for at least half the total cost.
The Senate farm bill passed last week lowered the guaranteed minimum price for sugar by 1 cent a pound but kept the guaranteed price. Growers say price supports and import quotas protect them from cheap sugar imports and insures a reasonable price to consumers.
Supporters of the assessment maintain that it takes back only a fraction of the benefits growers get each year from the Federal program that guarantees a minimum price for sugar. That price, propped up with limits on imports and domestic production, has been about twice the price paid on the world market and costs consumers an extra $1.4 million a year, according to a 1993 report by the General Accounting Office.
The environmental groups had hoped that without price supports more land from sugar fields would become available for the state to buy and return to wetlands.
Most elected officials in Florida have sided with the sugar growers on both the price support and the assessment issue. Sugar is the third-largest cash crop in Florida, after citrus and tomatoes, accounting for about 10 percent of the state's yearly agricultural revenue of more than $5 billion, state officials said.
In a letter to the Committee to Ensure Florida's Economic and Environmental Future, the umbrella group for the Everglades defenders, Gov. Lawton Chiles questioned the wisdom of the tax and said that "history would record us as fatally shortsighted if our actions caused the displacement of sugar (a relatively clean agricultural crop) with an environmentally more damaging land use."
The Governor also said that the $350 million it would raise "appears to be more money than necessary" for land acquisition.

HEADLINE: With Fare Up, Subway Use Drops Sharply

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

 BODY:
After years of working to make New York City's subways cleaner, safer and faster, the Transit Authority reported yesterday that subway ridership in 1995 reached its highest level in 21 years, but then began a sharp decline after the November fare increase.
There were nearly four million fewer riders in December 1995, the first full month after the price of a token increased 25 cents to $1.50, than in the previous December, a 4.3 percent decline. 
 The fare increase, however, had a more drastic effect on bus ridership, which fell off nearly 11 percent from one December to the next. Bus trips tend to be more discretionary, with only 30 percent of riders using buses to go to work.
The decline in subway ridership after the fare hike had been expected, and was similar to dropoffs that often occurred after previous increases. Transit officials said they were confident enough in the new popularity of the trains to predict that this dropoff, like previous ones, would be temporary.
 "When you increase the fare, you're going to lose fares, that's historical," said John Cunningham, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Transit Authority's parent agency. "We expect to recover the ridership, because that's also historical."
The ability of the subway system to draw thousands of new riders last year -- some of whom came from the bus system -- cheered subway advocates, who saw it as a promising new trend.
 "We've been hemorrhaging riders for so long, so it's great that the last two decades of reinvesting in the subways has reversed the longtime trend of losing riders," said Gene Russianoff, a lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a mass transit advocacy group. Riders interviewed yesterday agreed they had noticed significant improvements underground that they think are revitalizing the subway system and attracting new riders.
"When I was 12, the cars were a lot dirtier," said Chris Martinez, 16, a high school junior who lives in the South Bronx who has been riding the subways for four years. "There were more homeless people taking up the seats. The trains didn't run on schedule and there were roving gangs of kids. Today, the cars are slightly cleaner. I notice there are more riders and there's no graffiti."
Julia Gittens, 25, a resident of Lefferts Gardens in Brooklyn who works as a paralegal on Queens Boulevard, said she had noticed improvements in lighting and renovations on the platforms.
"They repair the light fixtures when the bulbs burn out, now," said Ms. Gittens, who has been riding for eight years. "In the past, they wouldn't replace them and the platforms would look dark and gloomy. Back then, I refused to ride the trains. Some of the cars are a little cleaner."
Ridership on the subways began a long decline in 1970, when there were 1.3 billion riders a year. The figures leveled off at a billion a year through the 1980's, dipping to 995 million in 1991. But that year, the cleaner cars and improved performance of the trains, the result of increased capital spending that began several years earlier, began to have an effect, producing a four-year ridership increase.
Historically, the flux in subway ridership has often reflected the strength of the city's economy. The more jobs available, the more people ride the subways. When the economy declines, ridership decreases. In 1990, when New York and the country were in a recession, ridership decreased by nearly 4 percent.
"Employment in New York City has always been a strong barometer of subway ridership,"said Harvey Poris, deputy budget director of the Transit Authority. "So many people who work in New York take the subway to work."
But from 1992 to 1995, employment increased only 1 percent while subway ridership increased 9.7 percent, with the biggest rise on weekends. Transit officials credit this surge to the new convenience and safety of the subways for riders making discretionary weekend trips. The transit system has also campaigned to attract tourists underground.
Some of those riders are even coming from the buses, which have traditionally been populated by riders fearful or disdainful of the subway. Transit officials said the city's clogged streets and slow surface speeds are prompting many to switch modes of transportation.
"The perception is that the subways are safer than they were and they are obviously quicker than buses," Mr. Poris said.
The bus system continues to be plagued with problems. More than 45 percent of the 3,600 buses in the fleet are outdated and break down often, causing long waits and occasional disruptions in service.
The fleet also faces stiff competition from the many illegal vans that run along major bus routes in the boroughs outside Manhattan, taking passengers away from the city's buses.
Buses were once the primary mode of transportation for city shoppers. But with the explosion of shopping malls in the suburbs and an increase in car registration in the city, buses became less attractive for many as people, particularly as speeds declined.
"You can walk east-west quicker than we can take you," said Alan F. Kiepper, the Transit Authority president.
The divergent fortunes of the subway and bus systems have led some critics to conclude that the Transit Authority has improved the trains while neglecting the buses.
"The T.A. has treated the buses like orphans," Mr. Russianoff said.
"There has been a bias toward subways. To be fair to them, it was because the subways were near collapse in the 1980's."

HEADLINE: P.A. Must Move To Build Rail Tunnel

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Priorities at the Port Authority" (editorial, Feb. 7) reminds the agency "that it was formed in the 1920's to build a rail freight tunnel under the Hudson, a job not yet done." 
 This would be the first new rail tunnel under the Hudson since 1910. It would reduce heavy truck traffic on overcrowded highways, improve safety, encourage economic development, make our air cleaner and link New York City, Long Island and New England into the national rail freight system.

HEADLINE: Clinton Points to Competition As Way of Curbing Inflation

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WILKES BARRE, Pa., Feb. 16

 BODY:
Wading deeper into the campaign debate over economic growth, President Clinton said today that "a lot of people" now believe that global competition can help hold down inflation, lessening the need for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.
In a speech at a fund-raising dinner in New York on Thursday night, Mr. Clinton offered a vigorous defense of Felix G. Rohatyn, the investment banker whom he had wanted to nominate as vice chairman of the central bank in an effort to help foster a debate with the more cautious monetary policies of its current chairman, Alan Greenspan. 
 Mr. Rohatyn withdrew his candidacy this week in the face of Republican vows to block his nomination, leading Mr. Clinton to denounce those threats on Thursday as "outrageous political treatment."
But because any comments by a President about interest rates and the Federal Reserve are so sensitive, and because the Republican Presidential candidates campaigning in New Hampshire have repeatedly harped on the need for greater economic growth, Mr. Clinton took the chance today to "clarify something" about his earlier remarks.
As he toured the scene of damage caused by floods last month in the Susquehanna River basin here, and pledged $10 million in additional Federal assistance, the President said Mr. Greenspan and the Fed had done "a very good job" in bringing interest rates down since 1993 and helping to foster growth.
"The point I was making last night is that there is now a debate, a serious debate in the country, about whether there is a maximum growth rate we can have over any period of years without inflation," Mr. Clinton told reporters traveling with him. "The conventional wisdom is that it was about 2.5 percent -- that's from 1970 to 1995, that's what we averaged."
But, he said, "there are a lot of people, including a lot of people -- Republican executives in the manufacturing sector -- who believe that global competition will keep down inflation, and that higher productivity, driven by technology and Americans working more effectively, will permit higher growth rates in the next 10 years than in the last 25."
Mr. Clinton added, "What I was trying to do with trying to have Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Rohatyn on the Fed was to have that discussion in a nonpolitical context."
The White House has already let it be known that Mr. Clinton intends to reappoint Mr. Greenspan.

HEADLINE: Stocks Off Third Day in Row as Blue Chips Retreat 48.05

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD 

 BODY:
Pulling back from their record highs for the third straight day, stock prices fell yesterday on investor concern about declines in bond prices and fears that this year's rally had pushed values too high.
In heavy trading, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 48.05 points, or nearly nine-tenths of a percent, to close at 5,503.32. Since the declines began on Wednesday, the Dow has lost 97.91 points, though for the week the total decline is only 38.30 points. 
 But the troubles of the Dow did not spread to the broader markets. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell only 3.34, to 647.98, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 0.17 point, to 1,090.71. The American Stock Exchange's market value index also rose, climbing 1.48, to 561.84.
On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 1,239 declining issues and 1,063 advances, a ratio of about 7 to 6. Trading volume on the floor of the Big Board was heavy at 445.6 million shares.
And, despite having its first three-day decline in two months, the Dow has still turned in handsome returns of late. For the month, the Dow is up 2 percent, while for the year, it has posted gains of 7.5 percent.
Traders and analysts said that the decline in the Dow was largely driven by the bond market, which fell sharply for the third consecutive session yesterday, weighed down by talk of selling by large funds and by concerns over the supply of securities.
The 30-year benchmark Treasury bond dropped more than a point, pushing its yield up to 6.24 percent. The yield was under 6 percent as recently as Jan. 19. Bonds fell despite a flurry of new economic data confirming that the economy is slowing down. Such data are usually viewed favorably among bond traders because they raise hopes that the Federal Reserve will soon push interest rates lower to try to stimulate the economy.
In the stock market, analysts said that the effect from the slide in bonds was amplified by investor concerns that the heady set of record-breaking trading days this year had pushed stock prices too high.
"People are pretty edgy about the sharp run-up we've seen," said Hugh A. Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation. "It only required a small excuse to get some profit taking started, and we've gotten that from the bond market."
In addition to investor concerns, traders and analysts said that the decline was also caused by the mathematical dictates of computer-driven program trading because of yesterday's "double witching" expiration of options and futures contracts.
These expiration dates always result in heavy volume as professional traders, in a flurry of purchases and sales, try to reposition their portfolios by heavily trading equities regardless of the price.
While institutional investors scooped up shares in many of the recent witching sessions, traders said that they stood back yesterday. In part, that had something to do with trader psychology: with the direction of the market uncertain, few professional traders wanted the anxiety of holding newly bought shares over the holiday weekend.
"There was not a great deal of institutional buying to offset the expiration because of the weakness in the bond market," said Jeffrey Tabak, managing partner of Miller Tabak Hirsch. "Nobody wanted to be a hero at the beginning of a three-day weekend."
Investors sold a variety of stocks, including a number of names well known to consumers. The big losers among the Dow industrials were Eastman Kodak, down 3, to 74 1/4, and Sears, Roebuck down 2, to 42 7/8. They were followed by Exxon, off 1 1/4, to 81 1/2, and Texaco, off 7/8, to 80 7/8.
Stocks in companies in basic-materials businesses also declined, a sign that investors may be worried about the economy. International Paper fell 1 1/8, to 37 1/2, while Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing slipped 1, to 66 1/2.
Shares in drug companies also came under pressure. Eli Lilly dropped 1 3/8, to 62 1/4; Pfizer fell 7/8, to 68, and Merck lost 7/8, to 68 3/4. The decline came as a Federal judge granted preliminary approval for a $408.9 million settlement of a lawsuit against drug makers that was brought by pharmacists.
Hewlett-Packard was among the big winners. The stock jumped 9, to 95 1/4, after the computer maker announced that earnings grew a greater-than-expected 31 percent in robust demand for personal computers. The company earned $790 million, or $1.50 a share. Analysts had expected Hewlett to earn $1.36, according to a survey by IBES International Inc.
That led the way for other computer stocks. I.B.M. rose 3/8, to 118, after an analyst with Soundview Financial Group said the computer company would do better than expected in 1996 as its sales growth picked up. Digital Equipment jumped 1 3/8, to 69 1/2. The company ended talks with Cirrus Logic on investing $335 million in Digital's plant in Hudson, Mass.
Airlines and other transportation stocks also showed strength. The Dow Jones transportation average rose 1.44 points, to 2,034.83, still below its high of 2,094.29 on Dec. 13. UAL, parent of United Airlines, was among the big winners. It rose 1 3/8, to 178.

Zoning Forbids Wide Variety And Low Price

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
EACH weekend, hungry hunter-gatherers venture forth from the city, climbing hills and crossing rivers, eventually returning in triumph with meat and vegetables. Plus a few humongous boxes of corn flakes or Pampers.
These urban nomads travel in Dodge Caravans and their journey is a lot easier than their ancestors', thanks to bridges and tunnels. But their foraging persists because in many areas, especially in minority and blue-collar neighborhoods, the local stores don't stock enough merchandise of reasonable price and quality. 
 Before the 35,000-square-foot Fairway store opened in West Harlem in November, Sylvia Murphy and her friends trekked to New Jersey to buy meat rather than push their luck in the local supermarket. Now many of them have joined customers from elsewhere in Manhattan, as well as New Jersey and Connecticut, in a sort of commercial mosaic inside the big orange store at 133d Street below the West Side Highway. But for how much longer is in question.
Acting on regulations they admit are outdated, Buildings Department officials contend that the store has run afoul of a 10,000-square-foot zoning limit for retail establishments. The store's owners say it is exempt as a wholesale center that also welcomes walk-in traffic. A meeting is set for next week to address the dispute, which could result in shrinking or even closing the store.
Mrs. Murphy is not happy.
"As soon as we get something in Harlem they find something wrong with it," she said, as her friends in the seniors' room at the Riverside Park Apartments, near West 135th Street, nodded in agreement. "Just because I live in Harlem, I don't want to feed my family garbage. I want the best, just like any other community."
SHE is not alone. The City Planning Commission estimates that New York City residents spend $3.1 billion a year outside of the five boroughs -- not including spending on food. The supermarket chains know this, which is why they built sprawling stores just over the George Washington Bridge and the Nassau County line.
These food megastores barely exist in the city because of 1974 zoning rules intended to keep manufacturing from being squeezed out of industrial areas. Cheap labor overseas or in union-free states lured the factories and eroded the local industrial base anyway, but the zoning laws stayed behind.
"This was probably the least successful public policy adopted in the history of the city," said Joe Rose, the chairman of the Planning Commission. "The result is all this underutilized land that is prohibited from being used for retail purposes, which the city's economy desperately needs."
That leaves officials at the Buildings Department in the awkward position of having to uphold antiquated regulations.
"We interpret and enforce," said Charles Sturcken, the chief of staff at the department. "This is something where zoning seems to be behind the times, to the detriment of the city."
The Mayor's retail initiative has provisions for zoning changes that would allow stores up to 200,000 square feet. Now undergoing an environmental review, it should come before the City Council in the fall.
The Mayor might cut through the red tape for the Fairway store, but at the risk of upsetting the large group of Hispanic store owners and their customers he has to woo to be re-elected. Many of them are still seething over the city's support for the big Pathmark supermarket in East Harlem.
NONE of that helps David Sneddon, an owner of the Fairway store. He thought he and his partners had complied with appropriate rules. He suspects they are victims of smaller supermarket owners who feel threatened by their arrival.
He doesn't know what the politicians are doing -- he's too busy working 12-hour days. But he said that if the zoning issue were not resolved he might follow the old habits of his customers and head to Westchester, where they had been looking for a site before opening their West Harlem store.
He admits that problems remain with parking and getting a traffic light near the store -- where cars roll off the highway and pause briefly by a stop sign. A few people have complained to local officials about the huge flashing sign atop the store, too. Some nights it looks like a navigational beacon for planes headed to La Guardia (or on a retaliatory strike by New Jersey food stores).
But residents of Riverside Park Apartments, a huge housing complex that makes the nearby store look like a corner bodega, say the lights don't really bother them. They'd be worried if the place went dark.
"We have more important issues in our community," Mrs. Murphy said. "The drugs. The schools. That's what they should be complaining about."

Radical Overhaul Proposed For Social Security System
A Federal advisory panel will soon recommend a radical change in Social Security, saying that billions of dollars of worker contributions should, for the first time, be invested in the stock market. The panel is also discussing whether some of the payroll tax revenue for Social Security should be diverted to individual accounts, so workers could invest it as they wish.
Such discussions would have been unthinkable just a few years ago, considering the extreme reluctance then of politicians to alter Social Security. [Page 1.]
 
 
Dow Average Falls 48 Points, Or 0.9%, for 3d Drop in a Row
Stocks fell on investor concern about declines in bond prices and fears that this year's rally had pushed values too high. In heavy trading, the Dow Jones average fell 48.05 points, or nine-tenths of a percent, to 5,503.32. Since its declines began Wednesday, the Dow has lost 97.91 points. Other stock measures managed to rise, however, and despite the recent drop, the Dow is still up 2 percent this month and 7.5 percent in 1996. [39.]
 
Treasury prices fell sharply, and the yield on the 30-year bond jumped to 6.24 percent, its highest level since November. [38.]
 
Mexico Regains Some Ground
The Mexican economy contracted sharply in the fourth quarter, but less so than in the third quarter, and Mexicans took that as good news. The economy in the latest quarter shrank 6.6 percent from the last quarter of 1994, while in the third quarter, it plunged 9.6 percent. But the peso has stabilized and the stock market has gained strength of late. [36.]
 
Canada Resolves Lumber Dispute
Washington and Ottawa reached an agreement to resolve a 13-year dispute over lumber trade. The agreement would significantly curb imports of softwood lumber from Canada, where producers can get it from provincial governments at below-market prices. [36.]
 
Factory Output Plunges
Output at factories, mines and utilities in January took its biggest drop in five years, and once again, bad weather was cited. [38.]
 
Clinton Pushes for Growth
President Clinton again broached the idea of the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates to produce faster growth. He said "a lot of people" now believe that global competition can help hold down inflation, with a less strict interest rate policy. [36.]
 
Prudential Discussing Settlement
Prudential Insurance is holding talks with state regulators to settle accusations that its agents misled customers in at least 28 states. But it denied a report that it was prepared to pay as much as $1 billion to settle the allegations from state regulators. They have accused Prudential of luring customers into replacing their policies at added cost. [37.]
 
Hewlett-Packard Beats Estimates
Hewlett-Packard earnings soared 31 percent in the latest quarter, far more than expected, to $790 million, and the company's stock jumped 10.5 percent. Analysts said the company's performance had been strong across all product lines, especially servers, which are computers shared by multiple users across a network, and printers. [37.]
 
Comsat's Profit Tumbles
Comsat's operating profit plunged by one-third in the latest quarter and the satellite company hired an investment banker to look at a possible restructuring. [37.]
 
Saudi Family Invests in Midtown
Just a month after Bear, Stearns agreed to buy an entire block in midtown Manhattan, a co-owner of the property, the al-Babtain family of Saudi Arabia, said it would buy the site. [47.]

HEADLINE: Region's Governors Draw Own Blueprint for Welfare

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

 BODY:
A single mother with two children getting by on a $577 monthly welfare check in New York City would, under Gov. George E. Pataki's new welfare plan, have her cash benefits reduced to $424 and be forced off the rolls within five years.
A woman in the same situation in New Jersey would continue to collect $424 a month, and her benefits would end in five years as well, under Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's new plan. And a single mother in Connecticut, which under Gov. John G. Rowland has already enacted the most stringent time limit on welfare benefits in the nation, has 21 months to find a job before her benefits of $533 a month expire. 
 The governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are not waiting for new Federal legislation to begin making sweeping changes in their welfare programs. They are among 40 governors moving ahead with ambitious plans that combine time limits with a new emphasis on finding entry-level jobs.
Those are two core ideas behind a bipartisan agreement the nation's governors reached last week at a meeting in Washington, an agreement they offered to help break the impasse between Congress and the White House on welfare reform as well as the Federal budget. States still have no idea how much Federal money they will receive for Medicaid and welfare and how much flexibility they will get to design their own social welfare programs.
The agreement, which would need approval from Congress and President Clinton, would break with 60 years of Federal guarantees that poor people will always be entitled to benefits. States would receive lump sums of Federal money, block grants, to create their own aid programs. The agreement would set a five-year lifetime limit on benefits, not including food stamps, but states could exempt up to 20 percent of welfare families from time limits and set stricter limits if they wanted. One of the few limits on states' flexibility would be a requirement that they maintain welfare spending for programs from cash assistance to job training and work programs at 75 percent of 1994 levels.
To help win support from Democratic governors for the proposal, the agreement also included $4 billion for child care and a $2 billion contingency fund to help states faced with a sharp increase in welfare cases resulting from a sudden downturn in the economy or a disaster.
The agreement gives the Republican governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut what they are looking for to reshape welfare programs throughout the region.
"If it were accepted by Congress and the President," said William Waldman, the New Jersey Commissioner of Social Services who helped design Mrs. Whitman's new welfare proposal, "this would be a perfect launching place for our program. What they agreed to gives us the flexibility to make all the changes in the program that are different from the current Federal entitlement."
But advocates for the poor and some Democratic state legislators worry that time limits are likely to be a fixture of welfare programs in the three states. That means, they say, that tens of thousands of families will ultimately lose their only source of income for shelter, food and clothing.
Maria Foscarinis, executive director of the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, said there would not be such cause for concern among advocates if there were some assurance that enough jobs would be available. "The danger is that people will be left both without assistance and without jobs," she said.
In addition, she and other advocates say, a new Federal framework poses the risks that states will ultimately have too much flexibility, and could further cut benefits or set new hurdles that will keep benefits from reaching deserving families.
Without new Federal welfare legislation, New Jersey and other states are required to seek Federal approval before making significant changes in welfare policy. For example, New Jersey obtained Federal approval three years ago to stop paying more money to women on welfare who had more children.
The New York State budget director, Patricia A. Woodworth, said the governors' Washington agreement would ease the path for Mr. Pataki's plan, if he could win approval from the reluctant Assembly, which is controlled by Democrats.
The most significant difference between New York and New Jersey is that Mr. Pataki wants to cut benefits while Mrs. Whitman is keeping levels the same. Mr. Pataki is also looking to limit welfare to individuals and childless couples to 60 days. Mrs. Whitman has proposed a five-year lifetime limit for both families and individuals.
Both governors are also recommending that welfare recipients who find jobs be allowed to keep more of their earnings, as an incentive to return to the workplace. And they both intend to support only those training programs that emphasize job placement.
"What we need to do is get people back to work," Ms. Woodworth said.
Around the region, advocates for the poor have focused on the time limits, saying that the goal is to force many women raising children alone to take jobs that do not exist. In New York, advocates are particularly concerned that Mr. Pataki's plan to cut benefits for families by a quarter will make it impossible for many families to pay rent, forcing them into shelters.
"We are setting up these women to fail," said Liz Kreuger, associate director of the Community Food Resource Center, a nonprofit organization in Manhattan. "And then we will penalize them by taking away their entire income support structure for themselves and their children and we will say that it was their fault. If you don't make a commitment to provide real jobs at real wages, then we are the ones guilty of terrible welfare fraud."
The region has recovered only a little more than a third of the 900,000 jobs that were lost between 1989 and 1992, according to John L. Wieting, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. In New York State last year, there were 72,000 new jobs created, including 25,000 in New York City. In New Jersey, 37,000 new jobs were created. And in Connecticut, the number of jobs continued to decline, with a net loss of 700 jobs.
State officials dismiss talk about the lack of jobs, insisting there are plenty of entry-level positions.
In Connecticut, Mr. Rowland won approval last year from the Legislature and the Federal Government to begin imposing a 21-month limit on benefits through Aid to Families With Dependent Children, the state and Federal program mostly for single parents. And the state is pushing direct job-placement programs over education.
"If there is any training, it is short-term," said Claudette Beaulieu, a spokeswoman for the Connecticut State Department of Social Services. "The shorter the better. We used to have people in community college programs for years."
Connecticut does offer one of the nation's most generous cash incentives to encourage families on welfare to find work. Welfare recipients are allowed to earn up to $1,049 a month and still keep some of their benefits. And the state just started a marketing campaign directed at businesses, encouraging them to hire welfare recipients and providing a toll-free telephone number for information on how they can go about it.
For single adults and childless couples, Connecticut has enacted much tougher time limits. Anyone who is classified by the state as "employable" is limited to six months of benefits. Mr. Rowland proposes in his new budget a two-month time limit.
Connecticut officials say that their tougher welfare standards have led to a reduction in the caseload to 21,800, from 24,800 last July. They also say that a rise to 17 percent from 12.7 percent of families on welfare who have found jobs in the last six months suggests that women on welfare are getting the message that they need to find work to support their families.
Of all Mr. Pataki's proposals, his plan to reduce the monthly welfare grant is causing the most immediate concern among advocates for the poor, who contend that the current level is too low for families struggling to pay high rental costs in the city.
Steven V. Banks, the coordinating attorney of the Homeless Family Rights Project of the Legal Aid Society of New York, said, "If the Governor's proposal is implemented, thousands of families will be evicted over the coming months and create a flood of homelessness."
In Westchester County, Mary E. Glass, the Commissioner for Social Services, who was Mr. Pataki's social services commissioner when he first took office but did not work on his new proposal, is also worried about the impact that the proposed cut in the monthly benefits will have on families already struggling to pay rents with $577 a month.
"I don't really have a problem with time limits," said Ms. Glass, who oversaw the implementation of Westchester County's workfare programs, one of the most ambitious programs of the kind in the state. "But we are concerned about the cutting of benefits because of our severe homeless problem. Seventy-five percent of the families receiving assistance pay more for rent than what we allow.
"We are fearful that could jump the homeless numbers to extraordinary levels. It is a very, very serious problem."

HEADLINE: Plan Would Have Social Security Put Some Money in Stock Market

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
A Federal advisory panel appointed by the Clinton Administration plans to recommend a radical change in policy for Social Security: investing billions of dollars of payroll contributions in the stock market.
The panel, whose proposed recommendations appear in a confidential draft of a report to be issued this spring, is also discussing whether payroll tax revenue for Social Security should be kept in one big pool, as it is now, or whether some should be diverted to individual accounts, so workers could invest it in stocks and bonds of their choosing. 
 Such discussions would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. Politicians have been extremely reluctant to change Social Security because any misstep could provoke explosive reactions from the program's 43 million beneficiaries.
But this year the issue has surfaced in political debates. It provoked a bitter exchange last month between two candidates for the Republican Presidential nomination, Steve Forbes and Senator Bob Dole. When Mr. Forbes suggested that a portion of younger workers' payroll taxes go into private retirement accounts, Mr. Dole ran television advertisements denouncing the idea as "a radical untested plan that would end Social Security as we know it." But since then, Mr. Dole himself has expressed interest in the idea.
Gene B. Sperling, deputy assistant to President Clinton for economic policy, said tonight that the Administration had opposed efforts to "privatize Social Security," but would review the recommendations.
Since the creation of Social Security in 1935, money paid into the program has been invested exclusively in interest-bearing Government securities, mainly long-term bonds. But the 13-member advisory panel says in its draft report that the United States could obtain a higher return on investment and increase retirement savings for the baby-boom generation by channeling some of the money into the stock market.
"Stocks have outperformed bonds by a significant margin over long periods of time," said Edward M. Gramlich, professor of economics and dean of the School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, who is chairman of the panel, the Advisory Council on Social Security.
The draft says that, while stock investments would entail "a slight increase" in risk for Social Security, the risk would be manageable.
The council, appointed in June 1994 by Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, includes business executives, union leaders and pension experts chosen to represent self-employed workers and consumers in general.
Panel members have significant disagreements on such questions as: How much Social Security revenue should be invested in stocks? Who would manage the investments? How many private investment options should be allowed?
At least 8 of the 13 panel members say the investments should be in mutual funds or another portfolio of securities linked to a broad gauge of market performance, like the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks.
"Very few investment managers can beat the index year after year," said Marc M. Twinney Jr., a council member and actuary who was pension director of the Ford Motor Company until he retired last year.
The Social Security trust fund now takes in more money in taxes and interest than it pays out in benefits. But Federal officials say the program will not be able to pay all the benefits earned by members of the baby-boom generation because, under the latest estimates, the trust fund will be depleted in 2030.
Robert M. Ball, a Democrat who was Commissioner of Social Security from 1962 to 1973 and is a member of the advisory council, said today: "Some of the trust fund money should be put into the stock market. I want to do it to get a better return for the Social Security system. Historically, long-term Government bonds have had a real return, after inflation, of 2.3 percent a year, compared with 6.3 percent for stocks."
Under the approach favored by Mr. Ball, up to 40 percent of the money in the Social Security trust fund would eventually be invested by the Government in a broad selection of stocks intended to mirror the overall performance of the market.
Some critics say Mr. Ball's proposal would concentrate too much power with the Government, giving Federal officials leverage over private companies. But Mr. Ball said he would prohibit the manipulation of investments for political purposes and would require the Government's money managers to purchase the same mix of securities as used in a standard index of the market.
Mr. Ball's proposal, supported by five other council members, would keep the level of Social Security benefits envisioned in current law. It would not change payroll taxes for workers, but would increase income taxes on benefits for some retirees. Other council members want to create an investment account for each person covered by Social Security.
Under the approach favored by Mr. Gramlich, the Government would require each worker to contribute a small amount each year beyond their current level of payroll taxes. "The accounts would be held by the Social Security system, but individuals would be free to choose whether to invest their accounts in stock index funds, bond index funds or some combination," he said. People would have perhaps 5 to 10 investment options, he added.
When a person retires, Mr. Gramlich said, money accumulated in the account would be paid out in the form of an annuity, supplementing regular Social Security benefits.
Mr. Gramlich said individual accounts would give people an enhanced "sense of ownership" in Social Security, increasing confidence in the program. "At present," he said, "the system seems like a black box to most workers."
The creation of such accounts would fundamentally change the nature of Social Security. Some benefits would still be guaranteed, but the remainder would depend on personal investment decisions and market performance. People making identical contributions could end up with very different benefits.
Economists disagree on how stock markets might be affected by the huge infusion of money. The financial services industry would presumably benefit, but banks, mutual funds and insurance companies have just begun to study the issue.
To improve the financial condition of Social Security, Mr. Gramlich would slightly scale back retirement benefits for high-wage workers and would gradually increase the age of eligibility for full benefits.
Still other council members want to give workers even more control over their retirement money. Under this approach, Social Security would pay a modest flat benefit, about half of the average benefit now paid to retirees, and 40 percent of payroll taxes would be diverted to "personal security accounts."
A panel member who favors this approach, Sylvester J. Schieber, said: "Our proposal would give people the widest choice of investment options. People could invest their Social Security money as they invest the money in their individual retirement accounts. Beyond the floor of protection provided by Social Security, we should let people participate fully in this economic miracle that we call America. It's paternalistic to assume that people cannot take action in their own self-interest."
Mr. Schieber is research director at Watson Wyatt Worldwide, a management consulting concern that specializes in employee benefits.
Edith U. Fierst, a lawyer who serves on the council, criticized Mr. Schieber's proposal, saying: "It could be disastrous for women, especially nonworking women, because they would have no entitlement to income from the personal savings accounts of their husbands. This would be a particular problem for women who divorce or outlive their husbands."
In its draft report, the council pleads for early action to revise and supplement Social Security. "Actions taken now to cut benefits or raise taxes can generate revenues right away, these revenues can be invested in equities right away and these investments can raise benefits for younger workers," it says. "The younger the worker, the more there is to be gained from early action."
The council supports the current practice of automatically increasing Social Security benefits to keep pace with inflation. It rejects any suggestion that retirees with large amounts of other income forgo their Social Security benefits. Such a "means test" would discourage savings as people approach retirement, it says.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE ROUNDUP;
Toward Bitter End in New Hampshire, Candidates' Favorite Issue Is Each Other

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 16

 BODY:
Rolling off their contentious televised debate, the Republican Presidential contenders took their quarrels over trade, taxes and negative commercials to the streets and airwaves of New Hampshire today, as their increasingly bitter contest entered its final weekend.
Steve Forbes, who just a week ago was dominating the Republican contest, seemed to be drifting off the screen. Polls showed Mr. Forbes trailing in fourth place, behind Bob Dole, Lamar Alexander and Patrick J. Buchanan, and Republican Party leaders and voters said he was becoming less of a factor, hurt by the same flat-tax plan that had helped him win attention in the first place. 
 At campaign stops, on talk-radio programs and in a last-minute deluge of commercials on television and local radio stations, the other leading candidates focused initially on issues, particularly the question of trade barriers. But as the day drew on and a blizzard overtook the state, that talk was drowned out by complaints about the way their opponents were playing the game.
Mr. Buchanan said that Senator Dole was running a "failing campaign," and that Mr. Dole "feels that for the third time he is going down. And it is not a pretty sight. And it's almost pitiable in many ways."
Mr. Dole turned his attention on Mr. Forbes, asserting that he was "trying to destroy me" with his advertising campaign and scoffing at Mr. Forbes's complaints about the attacks he had endured. "Forbes reminds me of the guy who shot his parents then pleaded for mercy, claiming he's an orphan," Mr. Dole said. "Here's a guy who goes out and spends $20 million on negative ads trying to destroy me."
For his part, Mr. Alexander, the former Tennessee governor, noted that Mr. Forbes had pulled his negative advertisements off the air, and said: "Senator Dole should follow Steve Forbes's example and take his negative ads off television."
The exchanges came as a variety of polls suggested the contest had evolved into a tight three-way race involving Mr. Dole, Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Alexander, with none of the candidates assembling a particularly large bloc of support.
The emerging dynamic that seems to be defining the final days of the campaign, party leaders and pollsters said, had positioned Mr. Buchanan with a solid if limited bloc of support from conservative Republicans, with the remaining candidates scrambling for the rest of the vote. Mr. Forbes no longer appears to be a significant factor in that dynamic.
Against that backdrop, Mr. Buchanan focused his attacks on Mr. Dole throughout the day. Party leaders and independent pollsters said it was unlikely that many of Mr. Dole's supporters would switch to Mr. Buchanan, though such attacks might serve to drive Mr. Dole's voters to either Mr. Alexander or Mr. Forbes, which would ultimately increase Mr. Buchanan's chances of victory.
With Mr. Forbes's position waning, he has exercised the same influence on the shape of the political debate he had in Iowa. There, his barrage of television commercials framed the contest around his flat-tax proposal.
Here, however, pollsters and political leaders say voters are wary of the idea, because it would eliminate the deduction of mortgage interest. "The biggest investment that most residents of New Hampshire have is their home," said John P. Stabile, the Republican state chairman.
And in the absence of the overriding issue of a flat tax, it has been Mr. Buchanan who has come the closest to setting the tone of the debate here, with his attacks on the free-trade agreements negotiated by the Clinton Administration.
Mr. Buchanan today said the trade deals "are killing the jobs of American women like nothing else." Both Mr. Dole and Mr. Alexander engaged the issue directly. "The problem is with an administration that is reluctant to stand up for the American worker, and Bob Dole will not be reluctant to stand up for the American worker," Mr. Dole said.
Mr. Alexander also defended his support of the trade agreements. "I will resist trade walls around the country," Mr. Alexander said. "I will resist protectionism. I think that is putting America last."
For his part, Mr. Forbes turned his criticism to his fellow Republicans in Washington, attacking the performance of Congressional leaders. "In business you can't cut your way to economic growth," Mr. Forbes said. He said the emphasis by Congressional Republicans on balancing the budget was "a cul-de-sac the Republicans got themselves into this year."
The debate Thursday night left none of the candidates with an obvious advantage, but instead set the tone for the disputes that were played out today across the state among the candidates. Thus, much of the day's discussion consisted of rancorous exchanges over what the candidates were saying about each other.
Mr. Buchanan seemed particularly barraged. He attempted at every turn to attack Mr. Dole in two radio interviews. But his efforts were derailed by questions about his past writings and his position on Larry Pratt, the Buchanan campaign co-chairman who was forced to step down this week after reports linking him to white supremacist and right-wing militia groups.
Mr. Buchanan said he was upset by Mr. Dole's advertisements calling him extremist.
"We've decided we've been tolerant and patient long enough," Mr. Buchanan told Jerry Williams of WRKO radio. Mr. Williams was sitting in a temporary studio set up in the Bedford hotel where most of the press is encamped covering the primary, speaking in front of an audience of 50 reporters. Mr. Buchanan was not there; he had called in, saying he did not have the time to show up in person because he was making his commercials responding to Mr. Dole's attacks on him.
"I'm working on an ad responding to Bob Dole's allegation that I am anti-woman," Mr. Buchanan said. "You know, my finance chairman is a woman, my campaign chairman is a woman, the architect my Louisiana triumph is a woman."

At the Toui Lo market, one of two Asian stores here in Storm Lake, Laotian women were shopping, picking over jumbo tiger shrimp laid out in cardboard boxes or selecting bags of rice off the shelves. At the Lamp Lighter motel, across the street, Sunil and Geeta Patel, a couple from India, checked in guests while Hispanic maids cleaned the rooms.
Meanwhile, at a restaurant next door to the motel, Patrick J. Buchanan spoke at a noontime rally this month and sought out a local newspaper reporter to denounce a local meat-packing plant for hiring what he said were illegal aliens. Then, he demanded that English be designated the United States' official language. 
 It is no coincidence that Mr. Buchanan chose this small farming and university town set amid rolling prairie in northwestern Iowa to make his nativist appeal. In the past 25 years, Storm Lake has undergone a startling metamorphosis as immigrants have flocked here to work in two packing plants.
In 1970, the town of 8,591 people had 22 minority residents -- mainly faculty members and students at Buena Vista University, including two young blacks who had been adopted by a white family. Today, town officials estimate that Storm Lake's population, now 8,769, is 10 percent minority, mainly recent immigrants from Mexico and Southeast Asia.
The transformation of Storm Lake, bringing with it cultural clashes and strains on government services, has not always been easy. And it demonstrates how small towns in the rural heartland are facing the same issues in absorbing immigrants that are confronted by places like New York, Miami and Los Angeles.
Signs in public buildings here are now often printed in Spanish and Lao as well as in English. Crime has increased, though there is a debate over whether that is attributable to the newcomers. The school system, where 24 percent of the students are members of minorities, has been spending an extra $100,000 a year for its English as a second language program, and has a difficult time finding bilingual teachers.
"They're taking over the place," said Gwen Ehlers, 45, from nearby Newell, who attended Mr. Buchanan's rally. "They have to broadcast school cancellations in three different languages. When you go to the clinic, their languages are posted all over. They're catering to them."
Norman Olberding from nearby Odebolt said, "I listen to Storm Lake radio every morning, and the first five minutes is nothing but crime news with a bunch of names you can't pronounce."
To be sure, there are many in town, like Rev. Duane C. Queen, pastor of Lakeside Presbyterian Church, who believe that the new arrivals have injected vitality into Storm Lake, teaching a culturally isolated community valuable lessons about different customs and religions as well as different foods.
"It's easy to be in a Caucasian community, wherever it may be, and say you have no prejudices," said Mr. Queen, whose church is near the 3,000-acre glacial lake that gives the town its name.
There have been smaller, though more tangible, gains from the immigrants. "Our soccer teams have improved markedly," Mayor Sandra Madsen said.
To many displeased with Storm Lake's makeover, the real villain is I.B.P., a food-processing company that opened a hog slaughterhouse in 1982, taking over an abandoned meat-packing plant. Unlike the previous operator, which had employed highly skilled, unionized butchers, I.B.P. uses low-skilled, lower paid, non-union workers. In Storm Lake and the surrounding areas, where unemployment rates consistently are under 3 percent, such workers are not easily found.
"It's not a pleasant job," said Dana Larsen, editor of The Pilot Tribune, the local newspaper. "It's all production line, lots of knife work. Cutting hogs is not the type of work I think a lot of people want to do."
To counteract the local labor shortage, I.B.P. has recruited employees in areas far from northwestern Iowa, including parts of Texas, where it has found Hispanic workers. The recruitment effort, plus word of mouth in Hispanic and Asian communities, has resulted in the influx of immigrants, although I.B.P. officials stress they check the relevant documents of job applicants and do not knowingly hire illegal aliens.
"Laotians like to work but don't have any skills or anything like that," said Khampradith Thongvanh, a refugee from Laos who came to Storm Lake in 1976, after Communist takeover in Laos. "But they are hard workers, and we have I.B.P. that hires anybody. It doesn't matter if they talk English or not. People start to know about the packing plant and start coming from California or Texas -- start to come here because it's cheap and easy to get a job."
Now, residents are warily eying a small group of Somalis who have taken up residence to work in a turkey slaughterhouse. As Muslims, the Somalis will not handle swine carcasses. Storm Lake residents are asking themselves whether the arrival of the group represents the advanced elements of yet another immigrant influx.
While I.B.P. officials emphasize how much they contribute to Storm Lake and the local economy in taxes and an annual $36 million payroll, some residents are not mollified. Several years ago, Spencer, a city north of here, refused to grant a zoning variance to another meat-packing company after citizens protested at public hearings that they did not want their town to become another Storm Lake.
"It was the worst thing they ever did when they let I.B.P. in," Mr. Olberding said. "They absolutely ruined this town."
Mr. Queen hears such talk and shakes his head. When he thinks of recent immigrants, he thinks of people like Mr. Thongvanh, who worked as a janitor when he first arrived here, is now an interpreter at the I.B.P. plant and has two sons attending the University of Iowa. In 1988, when he became a citizen, Mr. Thongvanh took the middle name of Barry, which friends say is in honor of his favorite singer, Barry Manilow.
"I just wish people would get to know these people they have such strong feelings about," Mr. Queen said.

Vaughn and Red Sox Agree on a Rich Deal

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
A contract dispute that had Mo Vaughn talking about playing in New York two years from now ended yesterday when the Boston Red Sox and their multitalented first baseman settled their economic differences and agreed to a three-year, $18.6 million contract.
The contract, which also includes an option for a fourth year, makes Vaughn the richest member of the Red Sox ever. The $6.2 million annual average value of the new deal exceeds the $5,380,250 average of the contract Roger Clemens signed in 1991. 
 But the average falls mere dollars short of catapulting Vaughn into the top 10 of all time. Lenny Dykstra of Philadelphia is 10th with an annual average of $6,225,000. Vaughn's contract calls for an annual salary of $6.1 million plus a $300,000 buyout of the option year (salary $6.75 million). Under the language for the option year, Vaughn can refuse the extra year if the Red Sox exercise the option and still get the buyout.
"It's a great relief," Vaughn said at the Red Sox's spring camp at Fort Myers, Fla. "I wanted this to be done months ago, but that's part of the process."
Because it had not been done, Vaughn was unhappy. The Red Sox, he thought, were not treating him right with what he viewed as their hard stand on a multiyear deal. And at a series of banquets in New York in recent weeks, he talked about how he would enjoy coming to New York to play when he became a free agent after the 1997 season.
Vaughn, who is from Norwalk, Conn., and went to college at Seton Hall in New Jersey, undoubtedly would become as popular here as he is in Boston, where he is involved in youth and community work. If his popularity in the Boston area was a factor in determining his value to the club, his standing was enhanced when he was named the American League most valuable player last season.
He batted .300 and reached career highs with 39 home runs and 126 runs batted in. The only low point in his 1995 p'rformance came in the first round of the playoffs when Cleveland Indians pitchers held him hitless in 14 times at bat.
Vaughn, 28, and the Red Sox had been scheduled to present their salary differences in an arbitration hearing Monday. Vaughn, who had a $2,775,000 salary last year, had submitted $6.1 million and the Red Sox $4.2 million. After a couple of days of grueling negotiations in Fort Myers between General Manager Dan Duquette and Tom Reich, Vaughn's agent, the two sides settled on th't $6.1 million as the cornerstone of the contract.
"The last three years he's been our team m.v.p.," Duquette said at a news conference. "So it's fitting that he should get the best and the most handsome contract."
In another signing, Chipper Jones and the Atlanta Braves agreed on a four-year, $8.25 million contract.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: PATRICK J. BUCHANAN;
Some See Clinton as Voctor in G.O.P. Debate: Buchanan, Beset by Many Critics, Still Unbowed

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 16

 BODY:
 Patrick J. Buchanan's toughest opponent in the Republican Presidential campaign here in New Hampshire may well be himself. Columns, comments and acquaintanceships, past and present, seem to be rising against him.
Even in his own element, talk radio, Mr. Buchanan today found himself fighting off longstanding accusations of racism, anti-Semitism and fascism. 
 "These are the cuss words of a dying establishment," he said during a radio interview here, trying to turn those accusations into proof that he was fearless in risking the anger of the powers that be with his tough talk on trade and domestic policy.
But the questions kept coming, as they have throughout his career as White House speechwriter, columnist, television commentator and two-time Republican Presidential candidate. Where his supporters see courageous politics and prose, critics have long found code words intended to excite a fear of foreigners, Jews, homosexuals and blacks.
Mr. Buchanan has a political gift for crystallizing complex policy muddles over issues like trade into sharp-edged debates. In doing so, though, he habitually uses his blazing rhetoric to develop us-against-them nationalist themes with which he questions not only his opponents' judgment but also their patriotism.
In a debate here on Thursday night, he turned a plain-spoken explanation of his trade position -- stiff import tariffs, for one thing, and American withdrawal from the World Trade Organization -- into an attack on Senator Bob Dole for having supported the North American Free Trade Agreement.
"I plead guilty, Bob, to wanting to protect American workers making 10 bucks an hour in South Carolina textile mills from having to compete with Mexicans making a buck an hour," he said. "That's just not fair. That is un-American."
The accusation that Mr. Buchanan harbors anti-Semitic sentiments has arisen intermittently over the years because of columns like one he wrote in 1977. In it, he called Hitler a racist but also described him as "an individual of great courage" with "an intuitive sense of the mushiness, the character flaws, the weakness masquerading as morality that was in the hearts of the statesmen who stood in his path."
On a radio show here this morning, the host, Dan Pierce, asked Mr. Buchanan, "Are you anti-Semitic?"
"Oh, for heaven's sakes!" he replied. "Listen, we have Jewish supporters," he said, and went on to list several by name. "We've got rabbis on the board of our campaign. We've had Jewish friends our whole lives."
"Pat Buchanan's writings and Pat Buchanan's broadcasts have been on the air for 25 years," he said. "Many, many of those editors that edited those columns were Jewish folks. Do you really think that they would put in their papers something they believed was like that? It's absurd."
Mr. Buchanan said he knew the motivation for such attacks against him. Without naming anyone, he said, "There is a terror down there in Washington, D.C., that Pat Buchanan will succeed."
The value he places on loyalty is a thread that has been woven throughout Mr. Buchanan's writing. He invoked it again today in explaining on radio why he had chosen not to dismiss outright Larry Pratt, who took a leave as a Buchanan campaign co-chairman on Thursday after the disclosure that in advancing his battle against gun control, he had associated with members of the white supremacist Aryan Nations and right-wing paramilitary groups.
Mr. Pratt, who himself has not been known to make racist or anti-Semitic remarks, said on Thursday that he loathed white supremacism. And today Mr. Buchanan said: "I don't dump people over the side the way they do in Washington and wipe my hands of him and say goodbye. He's got a right to defend himself. And when he gives me his word as a brother Christian, I take him at his word."
But no sooner had Mr. Buchanan addressed the question about Mr. Pratt than his campaign suffered another embarrassment: Today a county chairwoman of the Buchanan campaign in Florida acknowledged that she was also a leader of the National Association for the Advancement of White People.
Officials of the Buchanan organization accused the woman, Susan Lamb, of deceiving them, and severed their relationship with her.
In a telephone interview, Ms. Lamb denied that her group was racist. "The goal of the organization," she said, "is equal rights for all and special privileges for none." For instance, she said, it opposes government set-asides for minority contractors.
But since the campaign has asked her to resign, she said, "I will do so; I will do anything I can to help Pat Buchanan's campaign."
Mr. Buchanan is widely remembered for the us-against-them theme of his speech at the 1992 Republican National Convention, where he declared that "there is a religious war going on in this country for the soul of America" and called forth the image of soldiers quelling riots in Los Angeles: "As those boys took back the streets of Los Angeles, block by block, my friends, we must take back our cities, and take back our culture, and take back our country."
Mr. Buchanan has long seemed apprehensive about unfamiliar cultures. In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph of London during the 1992 campaign, he complained of having walked through downtown Washington one day when "these guys were sitting on the corner playing bongo drums."
"I mean, this is the town I grew up in," he said.
On the campaign trail now, he calls for making English the nation's official language and imposing a five-year moratorium on all immigration. In describing illegal immigrants, he can be particularly harsh. "I'll build that security fence, and we'll close it!" he shouted at a rally in Waterloo, Iowa, last month. "And we'll say, 'Listen, Jose, you're not coming in this time!' "
Mr. Buchanan has joined strong stands on social issues to an economic populism, connecting the two by portraying himself as the champion of the most vulnerable. "I want to represent in Washington those people who don't have representatives," he said in the debate here on Thursday night.
He said he offered "a conservatism of heart that speaks up for the forgotten Americans who have no voice in Washington, that speaks up for the right to life for the innocent unborn, whose silent screams often go unheard in this country."
"It is a new conservatism," he added, "that speaks up for the working men and women of America whose jobs are being sent overseas in trade deals."
His economic message has a strong nationalist strain. "We've got to put America and Americans first, that's what I'm saying," he said on a radio program here on Wednesday. "And many countries like Japan that we've defended have become rivals and competitors, and they've really attacked and successfully taken out American industries.
"Mr. Hashimoto in Japan, he's looking out for Japan first. The Prime Minister of China looks out for China first. What is wrong with an American President looking out for America first?"
While his campaign opponents describe him as protectionist, Mr. Buchanan dismisses such labels as out of date, arguing that his rivals have not yet realized that economic competition has supplanted the military tests of the cold war.
Mr. Buchanan himself was a passionate supporter of free trade just a few years ago. "I was a dedicated, devout free-trader," he acknowledged in an interview in December. But as the cold war ended, he said, he began to realize that "there's only one guy here that's practicing free trade; the rest of them are seeking national advantage."
It is typical of him that he argues his new position with the same ferocity that once characterized his arguments for the old. Why so little ambivalence? His 1988 memoir, "Right From the Beginning" (Little Brown), may offer a clue.
"The problem with the Buchanan Dinner Table Debating Forum was endemic," Mr. Buchanan wrote of the family discussions in which he engaged while growing up in Washington. "Every one of us was opinionated; and we were all taught not to back down. Whatever our positions lost in logic might be recovered with invective. If you never quit an argument, presumably you never lost."

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
Club Hopping Around Hip Austin

BYLINE: By SUSAN SPANO 

 BODY:
SEVERAL months ago, while I was reading "The Texas Monthly Guidebook to Austin" on a New York subway, a man nudged me and asked, "Are you really going there?" When I said yes, he told me he'd once lived in Austin, and he got so fired up describing its virtues that he almost missed his stop.
This was not the only testimonial I heard before I spent five days in Austin in early December. Home to both the state university and capital, Austin is considered something of a hip, progressive Lone Star anomaly. I have more than a few New York friends whose voices grow heartsick when they start reminiscing about their days in Austin -- cooling off in a big public swimming hole called Barton Springs, living cheaply, drinking Pearl beer and staying up late in clubs to hear musicians like Joe Ely, Lloyd Manes, Jerry Jeff Walker and Willie Nelson. 
 Of course, Austin has changed since the 70's. It boomed in the 1980's, went bust and then came back to life in the last few years when computer companies like Dell and I.B.M. settled in -- giving gifted young Austinites 9-to-5 jobs and the city the nickname: Silicon Prairie. The population has almost doubled from that of 1970, soaring to 512,000 in 1995; Austin's hippies are mostly grown-up yuppies now, and sprawling suburbs have hemmed in the fine old downtown.
At any rate, I could count on good company for the trip, because my friend Constance Ash wanted to come along; she used to hang out in Austin with her husband, Ned Sublette, and his band. While I checked out a few hotels, she'd stay with another friend of ours, Lissa Hattersley, a singer who recently moved back there after living in New York for 10 years. Once I got to town, I'd call yet another Austin connection of mine, Joe Holley, with a real Texas pedigree: born and bred in Waco, he used to write speeches for former Gov. Ann Richards.
Constance and I flew to Texas on T.W.A. (for $313 round trip, with a change of planes in St. Louis), then hopped into a white Buick Skylark we rented at Alamo in the Austin Airport (for a five-day rate of $133). The center of Austin still has the feeling of a small town, which is why we had no trouble finding our way to the Southard House, a bed-and-breakfast on the city's west side where I'd reserved a $75 room called Lady Esther for two nights. The room was on the second floor of a handsome pink frame house built in 1890, with a small private bath, carpeting, ceiling fan, two curtained windows, television and quilt-covered double bed (from which I'd later hear squirrels doing acrobatics in the rain gutters).
Right away we phoned Lissa, who drove to meet us from her apartment in the Hyde Park neighborhood, north of the university. The three of us went to Guero's Taco Bar on South Congress for Mexican food, passing over the Congress Avenue Bridge, home to Austin's famous bat colony. The bats had already flown to Mexico for the winter; their instincts were correct because a cold front had just passed through Austin, making us all thankful for our coats. At Guero's we found a table near a cardboard figure of President Clinton (who'd been to the restaurant himself recently), snacked on a basket of nachos dipped in limey green and hot red salsas, toasted our reunion with margaritas and then tore into our entrees -- mine was a bowl of queso flameado, consisting of green peppers and melted white cheese, which I spooned onto hot tortillas (for $12, including the margarita and tip).
Then we walked a bit on the Town Lake Hike and Bike Trail, a marvelous 8.5-mile path that lines the north and south sides of what Austinites call Town Lake, but is really a drowsy, winding loop of the Colorado River, impounded by a series of seven dams in the hill country to the west. The bare trees were filled with noisy grackles, but on a little tongue of land licking out into the river a young man with a fiddle sat on a rock, making sweeter sounds.
Afterward, we warmed up at Little City, a downtown coffee bar so minimalistically chic that it would fit right into SoHo in Manhattan, though I slipped outside to snap a picture of a sight that is pure Austin -- the State Capitol, which sits in dignity at the north end of Congress Avenue. Then it was on to the Continental Club, a hole-in-the-wall classic on South Congress, with a beery smell and portraits of Elvis and Gene Autry on the walls. A band called the Syndicate was playing polkas and it was happy hour so there was no cover charge (though two more margaritas, one each for Constance and me, and a beer for Lissa cost $11).
THAT first evening in Austin proved to be a pattern for those that followed. We'd rendezvous for dinner at restaurants like Mars on San Antonio Street (where a huge bowl of Thai noodles with vegetables, chicken or shrimp costs $6.95 to $10.95) or El Sol y La Luna on South Congress, with cozy booths, chili pepper lights, colorful paintings on the walls and a menu featuring Latin American specialties. I had a Shiner Bock beer and a delicious dish called enchiladas Zacatecanas and split a creamy flan with Constance (with my share of the bill coming to $10).
Then we'd check out some music. One night we landed at a club called Cedar Street ($2 cover) around midnight and stayed until 2, listening to a group called the Eight and a Half Souvenirs, with a sound Constance and Lissa described as Retro Jumped-Up R & B. The club was packed with chicly dressed University of Texas undergraduates who occasionally retired to the Cigar Room for a smoke, draping themselves on a couch and one another.
While in Austin I did a good deal of hotel-hopping too. It wasn't that I didn't like the easygoing Southard House, in a leafy, old-fashioned neighborhood called Clarksville, near the shops and cafes of West Sixth Street, the 500-year-old Treaty Oak on Baylor Street (poisoned by a saboteur in 1989 and then nursed back to life, thanks to treatment financed by Ross Perot), and the Whole Foods Market, a huge natural-foods emporium. I just wanted to find a nice room for less than $75 a night without moving out to a Super 8 or Motel 6 on I-35 north of town.
However, for my second two nights in town, I settled for another $75 room on the ninth floor of the the Radisson Hotel on Town Lake, with a picture window overlooking the Congress Avenue Bridge plus a king-size bed, coffee maker, ironing board, television and free parking. The hotel was modern and relatively likable, but distinguished above all for its downtown location, near a vintage guitar and amp store called Black Market Music on Howard Street, where I played a G chord on a Gibson Flying V2, and the trail around Town Lake. One numbingly cold morning I ran there, stopping to pay my respects at the statue of one of Austin's most venerated heroes -- the late guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughn.
I also wandered into the Driskill Hotel on East Sixth Street, built in Romanesque Revival style of native limestone by a cattle baron in 1886. Lyndon B. Johnson used to keep a suite at the grand old hotel, though I never dreamed of staying there -- in December a single cost $125, with special rates offered to Government employees and members of the American Automobile Association. I'm not a A.A.A. member, but at a phone booth just off the lobby I called my father and had him fax the hotel a copy of his A.A.A. card, which is how I managed to spend a night at the Driskill in a huge, fifth-floor room for just $69. Actually, the room showed signs of wear. There was a rip in the curtains, light scuff marks on the walls, and slightly frayed patches in the carpet -- so I wasn't sure I'd choose the hotel the next time I visited Austin. But I did vow to call A.A.A. when I got home, because any club that yields hotel discounts like the one I got at the Driskill is a club I want to join.
AUSTINITES like my friend Joe seemed proud of their city but hesitant to boast. So when I met with him or Lissa, I found myself enumerating its attractions like the handsome campus of the University of Texas; a lovely little museum in Hyde Park dedicated to the work of the German sculptor Elisabet Ney, who moved to Austin in the early 1890's and made the heroic statues of Stephen F. Austin and Sam Houston that guard the entrance to the State Capitol; and the glorious red granite capitol building itself, with a dome seven feet higher than the one above the Capitol in Washington. Dedicated in 1888, the edifice was completely renovated after fire struck its east wing in 1983, so that now its oak and mahogany wainscoting, terrazzo floors, and custom-made hinges and doorknobs veritably gleam. The Texas legislature (which convenes every other year) wasn't in session when I took the free half-hour tour, but I saw portraits of all my favorite, hard-driving Texas politicians, from the state's first female governor, Miriam (Ma) Ferguson, to the late Representative Barbara Jordan and Lyndon Johnson.
The museum in the 1857 General Land Office Building next to the capitol tells the story of the state's wild, distinctive past with displays of Santa Ana's silver spurs, taken by Texans at the Battle of San Jacinto in 1836, and the pen used by President Polk when he annexed the Texas Republic in 1845. And while taking a free tour of the beautiful Greek Revival Governor's Mansion on the southwest side of the capitol, I saw Stephen F. Austin's desk and heard more than a few jokes about Ima, the lamentably named daughter of Gov. James Hogg, who served from 1891 to 1895 -- told by the wry young guide in a U.T. letter jacket.
Joe drove me out to the hill country one bright, cold Sunday morning, telling stories all the way, like the one about how Ann Richards once made him put his head on her pillow in the Governor's Mansion so he could see the view of the State Capitol she woke up to every morning. He also taught me to how to properly pronounce the name of the river that ribbons through the gently rolling countryside, covered with winter wheat, juniper trees, and mesquite: Pedernales is how it's spelled, but Texans call it the perr-derr-NAH-lis, with the last two syllables as in in Alice.
We stopped first at L.B.J.'s cozy little boyhood home in Johnson City, about 50 miles east of Austin, where he grew up with three sisters and a brother named Sam Houston. From the visitors center in the Lyndon B. Johnson State Historical Park outside Stonewall we could see the rooftop of the L.B.J. Ranch, where Lady Bird still lives, but we passed up the two-hour bus tour because we wanted to get on to lunch at the Hill Top Cafe, a Cajun Greek roadhouse about 10 miles northwest of Fredericksburg. At the restaurant, owned by a musician who used to play with the Austin band called Asleep at the Wheel, I ordered roasted Greek chicken and a Shiner Bock on tap, but Joe made the best choice -- Texas-style boudin, also with a Shiner Bock, about $15 a person, including a tip.
We rolled back into Austin at sunset, when I reconnoitered with Constance and Lissa for a last drink at the woody bar in the Driskill Hotel. Constance had had a great time in Austin and had even taken to drinking martinis, so of course Lissa and I joined her. Perched on high bar stools, we compared lives and laughed too loudly. We probably would have started to sing, too, had someone brought Lissa a guitar.
 
The bottom line
While in Austin I spent an average of $116 a day, with $71 of that going toward accommodations.
Getting There
To reach Austin, I flew on T.W.A., (800) 221-2000, from New York for $313 round trip. At Alamo Rent a Car, (800) 354-2322, in the Austin Airport, I rented an economy class car at a five-day rate of $133; gas cost $4.
The city has a fleet of free trolleys, called the Congress 'Dillo, (512) 474-1200, that ply four downtown routes, but I wanted access to places farther afield, which is why I rented a car.

HEADLINE: Four Hands, One Bench, Still Married

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON 

DATELINE: SCARSDALE

 BODY:
MARRIED to each other for 47 years, Jean and Kenneth Wentworth have an unusually close relationship -- literally. They have shared the same piano bench since the beginning. As duo pianists, they also share a reverence for a special form of musical literature.
"Limited but distinguished" is how they refer to the repertory for two pianists at one piano. Mozart wrote two hours' worth of such music; Schubert, Debussy, Dvorak and the American Louis Moreau Gottschalk were other composers who favored the form. 
 "It's likely to be a connoisseur's art," Ms. Wentworth said recently in the couple's living room here, where a Steinway and a Yamaha nestle in a corner. The Wentworths practice separately on two pianos but meet on the Steinway bench as early as possible when preparing for a concert. Their next performances are tomorrow at 2 and 7 P.M. and Tuesday at 8 P.M. at the Good Shepherd Presbyterian Church, 152 West 66th Street, near Lincoln Center in Manhattan, where they will play the music of the 19th-century Austrian composer Carl Czerny with the Jupiter Symphony Orchestra. Anton Kuerti will be the guest conductor. The program includes an overture, a concerto and a symphony. Tickets range from $7 to $21.
Some composers have written deliberately for four hands, the couple said, while some works for four hands have been arranged from other forms of music. Publishers, for example, routinely arranged symphonies for four hands at the piano when music making was a popular family pastime. "The recording industry put that concept out of business," Ms. Wentworth said.
The couple talk about "traffic problems" at the piano, but this is better seen than described. Picture two bodies on a single bench and then imagine most virtuosic piano recitals. Cramped is not quite the word for two artists sharing a tight space. Accommodating, cooperating, collaborating might be better terms. By now, intuition and empathy mix in equal measure with handwritten notes on their sheet music. An asterisk reminds one to get his hands quickly out of the way; the word "squeeze" means, roughly, to make way for the other person.
"Four hands on a piano are less likely to be sailing all over the place," said Ms. Wentworth, who always plays on the upper keyboard. "In the Lisztian virtuoso sense, that is," said Mr. Wentworth, who plays on the bottom. Of course, they are not always confined to their own territory. His fingers may suddenly appear in the treble notes, and vice versa. During their recent practice of the Czerny concerto, three hands came tumbling down the keyboard, Ms. Wentworth's smaller one cupped beneath those of her husband.
"You have to get on in order to play four hands," said Ms. Wentworth, who exudes a quiet radiance. "Piano four hand presupposes friendship." Music for two pianists at two pianos, on the other hand, connotes a spirit of rivalry, she said.
The Wentworths met at the Juilliard School, when they studied with the same teacher. In the early 1960's, they went to live in India on Fulbright scholarships, and there began concentrating on the four-hand literature. "You were lucky to find one piano that worked," said Mr. Wentworth, who described taking a piano apart to fix it before one concert.
The couple also told of watching two grand pianos arrive in Calcutta, where they lived with their three children. "Six or seven men walked four miles with the piano on their heads," Mr. Wentworth said, recalling that the piano legs had been removed. "The men wound turbans on their heads and sat the pianos on them. It was the best way to move pianos -- for the pianos, that is."
Ms. Wentworth won the Walter W. Naumburg Award in 1954 and is known as a Debussy scholar. She is on sabbatical from Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers, where she has taught piano, music history and chamber music since 1972.
Mr. Wentworth taught music at Sarah Lawrence for nearly 40 years, retiring in 1993. He also ran a popular concert series called Summer Evenings at Sarah Lawrence. He now runs an artist-management business called Jonathan Wentworth Associates, which represents more than 40 conductors, pianists, jazz musicians and chamber groups. The company got started when Mr. Wentworth helped the Borodin Trio, an immigrant Russian group, obtain concert bookings in this country.
The Mount Vernon-based company is named for the couple's son Jonathan, who died of AIDS in 1994. Their daughter, Martha, works with her father at the management company, and their son David is an economist in Maryland. The Wentworths wear red-ribbon pins and raise money in their son's name for the Gay Men's Health Crisis.
Soon after his death, the couple were in a serious car accident in England, from which Ms. Wentworth is still recovering. Her whiplash injury did not keep her away from the piano for long, however. Besides this week's concerts, she will perform on March 3 in a free concert at Sarah Lawrence, to be presented at 4 P.M. in Reisinger Auditorium by members of the faculty. She will also give a solo recital of works by Debussy and Ravel on April 14 at 8 P.M., also in Reisinger Auditorium. Tickets for that concert are $10 and $8.
The Wentworths think of their playing as chamber music, perhaps of the most intimate kind. Their own working metaphor is the string quartet, which Mr. Wentworth calls "the high point of music making, the most pure."
Their four hands represent the four string parts -- Mr. Wentworth's hands acting as the cello and viola and his wife's as the two violins. "That's the closest we can come to that highest form of art," he said.

A STRUGGLE FOR POWER
The American Revolution.
By Theodore Draper.
544 pp. New York:
Times Books/Random House. $35.
FOR more than two centuries, partisans and historians have given differing interpretations of the American Revolution. We Americans, even those of us whose immigrant ancestors had no direct connection to the event, have every reason to take pride in it. The American Revolution courageously challenged the mightiest empire of the world and emerged victorious. It did so, moreover, without devouring its own children in a bloody reign of terror. And having won freedom, it successfully secured that freedom in a constitutional system that would ultimately prove liberating for all Americans. Thus, to understand the meaning of the Revolution is the first step in understanding the meaning of America itself. 
 "A Struggle for Power," by Theodore Draper, takes a giant step toward historical understanding. It should be read by every citizen. A work of prodigious research, lucid prose and penetrating analysis, it teaches us truths that have gone untaught in much of American historiography, where the struggle for liberty is generally depicted as taking place somewhere other than in our own will to power.
Not that others have entirely ignored the subject of power. The distinguished Harvard historian Bernard Bailyn dealt with it in his influential "Ideological Origins of the American Revolution." Wondering how grievances as slight as taxes of a few pennies (demanded in the Stamp Act of 1765) could have led the colonists to revolt, Mr. Bailyn focused on an opposition ideology, inspired by Whigs in Britain, that the colonists adopted to make their case, a perspective that rendered them almost paranoid in seeing power conspiring against liberty in every assertion of parliamentary sovereignty over the Colonies.
But for Mr. Draper the distinction between power and liberty that is made by Mr. Bailyn -- between domination on the one hand and self-determination on the other -- becomes obscured when the issue actually is who orders and who obeys. Moreover, power is not so much a matter of differing intellectual perspectives as an aspect of material factors like expanding geography and demography. Whereas Mr. Bailyn sought to show why America grew anxious about Britain, Mr. Draper shows why Britain became anxious about a young America growing by leaps and bounds. It was not the misimpressions of the alleged British misuse of power that led to the Revolution, he insists, but power itself -- power as appropriation, augmentation and exclusion, power as whatever it takes to prevail in political life.
Among the epigraphs to the text is one by Thucydides, to the effect that the Peloponnesian War broke out because of the growth of the power of Athens and the alarm it aroused. Another is cited by Horace Walpole: "To be a good historian, it is necessary to be without religion, without country, without profession and without party."
Both epigraphs make sense in view of Mr. Draper's background. The author of books on topics ranging from Communism and the cold war to black nationalism and the Iran-contra affair, Mr. Draper has always been concerned with the ways revolutionary ideals are betrayed and constitutional principles violated. After his own break with Communism in the 1930's, he resolved never to allow his thinking to be determined by ideological commitments or party affiliations. And in keeping with Thucydides, Mr. Draper is less interested in justifying the Revolution than in explaining it, examining ultimate causes and conditions that go deeper than immediate quarrels and grievances.
His narrative begins with the end of the French and Indian War in 1763, the moment at which the British, having eliminated the French menace in North America, asked the colonists to pay for their share of the war effort and for the upkeep of the imperial system in general. The colonists, now bold and recalcitrant, protested, and Britain withdrew the Stamp Act and other measures designed to raise revenue and regulate trade, including smuggling. Subsequent measures were enacted, and once again, in the face of colonial protests, Britain resorted to vacillation and revocation.
This infirmness of policy, Mr. Draper argues, revealed a deeper theoretical incoherence at the foundation of the empire. It has been said that the Colonies were founded in "a fit of absent-mindedness." But Mr. Draper makes clear that while the British mind was present at the creation of the empire, its premises defeated its purposes. The British policy, he astutely observes, asked that the colonists be self-supporting without realizing that such a policy made them less dependent on Britain.
And what of the shibboleth "No taxation without representation"? Colonial leaders themselves, Mr. Draper notes, were uninterested in representation, not only because it was geographically unfeasible but also because representation of the 13 Colonies in Parliament would still be insufficient to give them a significant voice. The real issue was where sovereignty resides, and Mr. Draper shows the colonists invoking John Locke to argue that the consent of the governed resided in the colonial assemblies. Yet even sovereignty, like representation and taxation, turned out to be more shadow than substance. "In the end, the argument over taxation was an argument over power," Mr. Draper writes. "The struggle to deprive Parliament of its power over taxation struck at the heart of British power in the Colonies and spilled over everything else."
Two prevailing interpretations of the Revolution current in American historiography scarcely make their appearance in Mr. Draper's text. Marxist-inclined social historians see a class struggle going on within a war for independence. Mr. Draper finds no evidence that the role of revolutionary leaders, many from the wealthy elites, was challenged from below. That is, the Revolution had little to do with poverty, the advent of democracy and the supposed radicalization of American society.
Nor did it involve republicanism, civic virtue and the cult of the small, ancient polis -- themes that have been pervasive in recent historiography and political philosophy. On the contrary, Mr. Draper says, the colonists remained loyal to the King until the eve of the Revolution, and colonial pamphlet literature hailed America's becoming a "rising empire." The Revolution was made not out of a desire to return to ancient virtue but, in Mr. Draper's words, "in behalf of the future."
To Mr. Draper it was not the Stamp Act but the Declaratory Act that "was the true casus belli of the American Revolution." The colonists agreed to the latter when the former was revoked. Under this act the colonists accepted, at least in theory, Parliament's right to make laws binding on them "in all cases whatsoever." Yet when Parliament then proceeded to pass such laws, the colonists had no choice but, as George III put it, to "submit or triumph." The colonists, in short, were content to remain British subjects as long as they were not subjected to British power.
Mr. Draper's thesis that the American Revolution represented a power struggle is refreshingly iconoclastic as well as original. But in concentrating on geographical and economic circumstances, and on political misperceptions and ironic outcomes, he seems unconcerned with the cultural sources that made America so vigilant and defiant. He does show us Adam Smith and Thomas Paine extolling a land of commercial enterprise; he notes as well that "the theoretical underpinning of colonial ideology" stemmed from Britain itself: "There was no Locke or 'Cato' in France or Spain to inspire its colonists and arm them with convenient arguments against its own rule." But contemporaries like Edmund Burke and John Adams, and later travelers to America like Alexis de Tocqueville and Max Weber, specifically cited religion, especially a "protesting" Protestant-Puritanism, as the key to America's spirit of insubordination -- and this religious dimension is missing in "A Struggle for Power."
Nevertheless, the book excels in its ambition to get to the bottom of a world-historical event that no party or country intended. The text ends with the outbreak of military skirmishes at Concord and Lexington in 1775, and thus it stops short of the Declaration of Independence, which was, after all, an afterthought, not to say a rationalization. America may continue to draw its ringing principles from the Declaration, but for the truths about the Revolution itself, especially the truths that reside in power, one must, as Mr. Draper understands, look earlier. It is for this reason that his brilliant analysis of ideas and events enables us to understand how America came to consciousness of itself and so took control of its own destiny, even if this drive to power came close to disobedience and usurpation.

They Only Look Dead
Why Progressives Will Dominate the Next Political Era.
By E. J. Dionne Jr.
352 pp. New York:
Simon & Schuster. $24.
The Republican capture of Congress has convinced many Democrats -- not least President Clinton -- that they can regain power only by adopting much of the conservative agenda. That this conventional wisdom is utterly mistaken is the thesis of E. J. Dionne Jr. in "They Only Look Dead: Why Progressives Will Dominate the Next Political Era." In Mr. Dionne's view, the present, like the late 19th and early 20th centuries, "combines social change with moral crisis, enormous economic opportunity with great economic dislocation and distress," and, now as then, the excesses of laissez-faire capitalism will generate a reaction in favor of progressive reform. His "central assertion is that the United States is on the verge of a second Progressive Era." 
 That his bold prediction cannot be dismissed as mere whistling past the graveyard of liberalism is a tribute to Mr. Dionne's thoroughness as a reporter and rigor as a scholar, qualities manifested in his 1991 book, "Why Americans Hate Politics." Mr. Dionne, a Washington Post columnist, makes a convincing case that the 1994 election was a repudiation of the Democratic Party, not an endorsement of Republican conservatism: the swing voters, in both 1992 and 1994, were "the Anxious Middle," made up largely of "white voters of moderate incomes" who defected from the Democrats without permanently joining the Republicans.
Why is the middle anxious? Mr. Dionne identifies four crises confronting the United States: "the economic crisis itself, a political crisis, a moral crisis and a crisis over how Americans view their country's role in the world." The first crisis is the cost of globalization and automation, enriching the few while endangering the living standards of the majority and increasing inequality. The second involves the abandonment, particularly by the left, of grandiose ideologies like socialism, creating a vacuum filled by particularist movements of "race, gender and culture" or "nationalism, religious fundamentalism and xenophobia." The third pits social conservatives against those who favor "new roles for women" and "a somewhat looser and more tolerant attitude toward sexuality." These economic, political and moral crises are joined by discord on foreign policy, with the division between nationalists and internationalists cutting across both parties.
The response of the political class to these four crises has been evasion and worse, Mr. Dionne writes; increasingly, politicians avoid substantive debate altogether in favor of vicious attack politics. Disgusted with gridlock, in 1992 the Anxious Middle ousted a Republican President and gave the Democrats complete control of the political branches of the Federal Government for the first time in 12 years, offering the Democrats, Mr. Dionne says, a chance to revitalize the progressive tradition -- and they blew it. He acknowledges the obstacles: the fiscal constraints imposed by the budget deficit and volatile capital markets, and Republican obstructionism in Congress. Nevertheless, he blames division and inertia among the Democrats for their failure to give the voters what they were demanding: radical but sensible reform in health care, welfare and campaign finance.
Part of the problem, Mr. Dionne argues, is the incoherence of the Democratic Party, now divided not simply into "New" and "Old" Democrats, but into five distinct groups: "Southern moderates and conservatives; suburban centrists; urban, labor-oriented white liberals; black and Hispanic members . . . (who are also mostly liberals); and a diverse group of Western and Midwestern Democrats from rural areas." On health care and welfare reform, Bill Clinton's attempt to implement his synthesis of neoliberalism and traditional liberalism required a unity that the Democrats lacked. And on the budget, Mr. Dionne reminds us, Mr. Clinton was only capable of "salvaging a one-vote victory." Nor did the Democrats pursue campaign finance reform -- "the precondition of all other serious reform" -- because too many Congressional Democrats were addicted to the corporate money that was to turn against them in 1994.
The Democrats' failure to reinvent the progressive tradition, Mr. Dionne says, provided the Republicans with an opportunity. "Moderate Republicans had hoped in the wake of the Reagan era to ease the party toward acceptance of a kind of Eisenhower conservatism, now exemplified by Colin Powell," he writes, but House Speaker Newt Gingrich and his allies rejected feel-good, pay-later economics, producing a more honest but far harsher and more radical conservatism, one that wants to roll back not just the Great Society but the New Deal too.
As Mr. Dionne sees it, "the new Republican philosophy looks backward to the late 19th century, seeking to revive the radical, unregulated capitalism of the Gilded Age." He quotes Mr. Gingrich asking a group of corporate executives to tell Congress what laws to write: "You tell us how to make this the best place on the planet to invest." But then, as Mr. Dionne notes, "Gingrich had never objected to the influence of money on politics as such," and so was "unembarrassed" when it was disclosed that lobbyists for interests that had been heavy campaign givers "were deeply involved in writing the party's deregulatory legislation."
Democrats should oppose, not emulate, the subordination of government to business, Mr. Dionne declares: "To the extent that Democrats have joined Republicans in delegitimizing government, they have prepared the way for their own crushing defeats." Nor does defending the need for sensible government mean political suicide, he says, because the current political upheaval should be seen "less as a revolt against big government than as a rebellion against bad government -- government that has proven ineffectual in grappling with the political, economic and moral crises that have shaken the country." What is more, Democrats have conservative divisions to exploit: "Many on the cultural right -- as well as many drawn to the far right -- are part of the Anxious Middle in fearing for their living standards and mistrusting the state and the market alike."
Mr. Dionne concludes with his own attempt to restate the progressive credo and the progressive project. "The Progressive's goal is not to strengthen government for government's sake, but to use government where possible to strengthen the institutions of civil society." Progressive welfare reform, he suggests, "would involve work requirements for welfare recipients, in exchange for a decent level of public support and the creation of work where private jobs were lacking." A progressive trade policy would recognize the need "to protect environmental and labor standards," to "level up," not "level down," wages.
"They Only Look Dead" is a luminously intelligent and quietly passionate polemic that deserves to alter the terms of American political debate. It is not without weaknesses. Mr. Dionne hardly discusses immigration and racial preferences, two areas where liberal policies have alienated the Anxious Middle. For that matter, his description of the Anxious Middle lacks nuance, blurring two groups of centrists, the communitarian radical center and the libertarian moderate middle.
Mr. Dionne is persuasive when he predicts that the new Social Darwinism of the Republican Party will produce a backlash by the Anxious Middle. But the Democrats may not be the beneficiaries; indeed, Mr. Dionne's account of their disunity suggests that more than a new party platform is needed. He does warn that if they falter and do not usher in "a new Progressive period . . . the calls for third and fourth parties will grow as the country seeks alternatives to Republican policies premised on the idea that government can almost never do good." But in developing his historical analogy, he neglects to mention that there were three rival forces at the turn of the century: conservatives, progressives and populists. We can only hope that today's Social Darwinists will be checked by the descendants of Theodore Roosevelt and not by the intellectual and political heirs of William Jennings Bryan.

WHEN TITANS CLASHED
How the Red Army Stopped Hitler.
By David M. Glantz and Jonathan M. House.
Illustrated. 414 pp. Lawrence:
University Press of Kansas. $29.95.
On the 50th anniversary of the Normandy invasion of 1944, an American news magazine featured a cover photograph of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower labeled as the man who defeated Hitler. But the Allied victory in World War II was surely not the achievement of a single man -- this was a "people's war" par excellence -- and if any one country could claim to have won it, if only by its share of the fighting, it was the Soviet Union. Eighty percent of the 13 million German military casualties between 1939 and 1945 fell or were captured in the East. Russian Army casualties, now conservatively estimated at 29 million, represented more than three-quarters of all Allied casualties in the war. And that is not counting millions of Soviet civilians who perished as a result of the Nazi occupation of their countries (equivalent to an invasion of the United States from the Atlantic Coast to beyond the Mississippi) or as a result of the Stalinist assault on nationalities assumed to be disloyal to the regime. Lend-lease and D-Day notwithstanding, victory over Germany was bought with Soviet blood. 
 Just how the Russians defeated Hitler's armies defies any straightforward explanation. It is a story of remarkable endurance that, until the recent opening of Soviet archives, had been mainly told from the German point of view. Operation Barbarossa, as the Germans called their invasion of Russia, caught the Soviet forces unprepared. Stalin's terror had deprived the army of half its officers; most of the survivors were too inexperienced or too afraid to reach independent judgments on the battlefield, and they simply followed outdated textbook methods. The army was in the middle of a major restructuring program, hastily trying to learn new tactics and rearm itself with mechanized forces when the Germans attacked in June 1941. In Byelorussia and the Ukraine the mass of the peasants were so alienated from the Soviet regime that many welcomed the invaders. In a matter of weeks Hitler's seemingly invincible armies swept through the panic-ridden Soviet defenses to the gates of Moscow and Leningrad before turning south to attack the strategic industrial city of Stalingrad. But there the Russians made their final stand, fighting for the city street by street, before slowly driving back the Germans to Berlin -- and in the process building up an army that overshadowed Europe for the next 40 years.
What was the key to this extraordinary reverse? In "When Titans Clashed" David M. Glantz, a former director of the United States Army's Foreign Military Studies Office at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., and Jonathan M. House, an associate professor at Gordon College in Georgia, offer a purely military explanation: the gradual emergence from 1942 of a "competent and trusted" officer corps that learned through war and was allowed to develop its own increasingly sophisticated tactics of "mechanized warfare on a massive scale." But this is not enough.
As a military history, "When Titans Clashed" is rather disappointing. It provides a detailed account of all the major battles, often calling time out to analyze the tactics, yet it seldom looks up from the battlefield itself. It is written in a dense and turgid prose interspersed with military jargon and technical terms. Sentences often break down into long lists of armies, corps and brigades. Even the most dramatic moments of the story are lost in the morass. Thus the account of the battle for Berlin begins: "At 0730 hours on 14 April 1945, after a 15- to 20-minute fire raid, reinforced rifle battalions from 1st Byelorussian Front and 1st Ukrainian Front's first-echelon rifle divisions began reconnaissance-in-force actions on main attack axes." It might do to start a lecture at West Point like this but it surely will not do at the climax of a book intended for the general reader.
Unlike John Erickson's superior two-volume history of the Soviet war against Germany, "The Road to Stalingrad" (1979) and "The Road to Berlin" (1983), this book pays very little attention to broader aspects of the Soviet campaign. There is surprisingly little, for example, on Stalin's tortuous relationship with the generals, or on the effect of his personality cult on the country's morale, although both crucial subjects have been opened up by the new archival evidence. The only place where Stalin really figures is before the June 1941 invasion, when (as has been shown by many other recent studies) he dismissed the reports of his own intelligence about the German buildup on his borders as British disinformation meant to draw Moscow into the war, and tried to appease Hitler by selling him cheap oil.
Nor is there much discussion of the Russian wartime economy, although the authors say that victory would not have been achieved without the huge increase that occurred in the production of weaponry between 1942 and 1944. This rearmament was an extraordinary achievement after the industrial catastrophe of 1941 -- more than 1,500 factories were hastily dismantled and taken east in a few months -- and it says a great deal about the planned economy: it was only good for wartime emergency.
But the unforgivable omission of "When Titans Clashed" is its failure to account for the sheer endurance of the Russian people. Mr. Glantz and Mr. House say that the Soviet Union won because of its almost endless capacity to mobilize new armies, gradually eroding the better German forces by sheer numbers and securing victory at enormous human cost. Yet they never stop to ask what lay behind this capacity: whether the totalitarian power of the state enabled it to call up limitless cannon fodder; whether the people's own patriotism kept them flooding into the army (it is significant that Soviet propaganda stressed loyalty to the motherland rather than the state, and that after a decade of war against religion the regime enlisted the support of the church in its military campaign); or whether it was the people's growing hatred of the German troops and SS units, which enslaved and terrorized Slavs as well as Jews.
It is telling that Mr. Glantz and Mr. House give no more than a sentence to the siege of Leningrad; it was not a battle, so it does not get discussed. Yet this epic story tells us much more about the Russian people, about their capacity to suffer and endure, and about the reasons for their victory, than all the military histories of the war. Let's hope the next one remembers that.

CHILDREN OF THE ALLEY
By Naguib Mahfouz.
Translated by Peter Theroux.
448 pp. New York: Doubleday. $24.95.
Naguib Mahfouz completed his masterwork, the Cairo Trilogy, in 1952, the year of the military coup that brought Gamal Abdel Nasser to power and put an end to centuries of foreign domination of Egypt. Set in the years between the two world wars, the novels quietly bring to mesmerizing life the intimate, hidden world of a middle-class Islamic Cairene family presided over by an autocratic patriarch. The entire family is in collision with the changing political and social forces of the world outside. Seven years elapsed before Mr. Mahfouz published another novel, during which time Egypt saw, along with land reform and heavy taxation of the rich, the emergence of the Nasser dictatorship. Then, in 1959, an allegorical novel, "Children of the Alley," appeared serially in a Cairo newspaper. 
 The book marked an abrupt stylistic and thematic departure from the earlier novels; Al Azhar, the ancient Islamic mosque and university in Egypt, judged it to be heretical and promptly banned it. Thereafter, Mr. Mahfouz returned to his subject of contemporary Egyptian life and its relation to eternal existential questions, going on to publish some 30-odd additional books without incident. "Children of the Alley" was all but forgotten by the world until l988, when he received the Nobel Prize in Literature (though it was the Cairo Trilogy that had earned him the prize, Muslim fundamentalists saw the award as a conspiracy by the West to discredit Islam). Mr. Mahfouz began receiving death threats, which became more frequent the following year, as the world level of Islamic outrage rose after the publication of Salman Rushdie's novel "The Satanic Verses." A year ago last October, in a puzzlingly clumsy assassination attempt, he was stabbed in the neck with a kitchen knife -- several Islamic militants were put on trial for it -- while on his way to the weekly literary gathering he had attended every Friday for decades.
"Children of the Alley" actually marks the second publication in English of the novel. The first was brought out in 1981, to little notice, by the American University in Cairo Press, under the title "Children of Gebelaawi." Gebelaawi (here Gabalawi) is the vain, forbidding, mercurial and unknowable ancestral patriarch for whom Gabalawi Alley is named. The novel comprises five chapters, all of them named for Gabalawi's descendants, four of whom bear qualified resemblances to biblical or koranic antecedents: Adham suggests Adam; Gabal, Moses; Rifaa, Jesus; and Qassem, Mohammed. The fifth character, Arafa, is less ancient and more ambiguous. If one views the book as a chronology (the narrator tells us that he has set down the stories of the alley's descendants "in the right order"), Arafa suggests not so much a prophet as modern man: cynical, faithless, anxious and uncertain of his identity, he holds the secret to more power than he is capable of handling -- he has learned to concoct lethal chemical cocktails.
The book opens with Gabalawi and his children all peacefully residing at the mansion he has built in an oasis in the middle of a barren desert. Palm trees flanked by bowers of henna and jasmine peek out over the high walls that enclose the mansion and its verdant garden. One day Gabalawi announces that he has chosen Adham, one of his younger sons, to manage his estate. Idris, the eldest, rises up in indignation at this insult, and Gabalawi banishes him. Adham performs dutifully in the estate office, just outside the mansion's main gate, until Idris surreptitiously arrives and tempts him to steal into a locked chamber off Gabalawi's bedroom, where the estate documents are kept, and learn the secrets of their inheritance. Adham, abetted by his wife, succumbs to his longing to peer into the Pandora's box, not realizing his brother's duplicity until it's too late: Gabalawi catches him out, and he too is banished to the desert. The couple go on to raise two sons, one of whom accidentally slays the other in an argument, and they spend their remaining days in misery. On his deathbed, however, Adham receives a promise from Gabalawi that Adham's children will inherit the estate. Their surviving son, having left his parents' home years earlier, returns with his wife, the daughter of Idris, and their children. From them are descended all the people of the alley.
For a time, with the income from the estate, the alley flourishes. Eventually, however, the mansion closes its gates to all but Gabalawi and his closest servants, and the last of his offspring becomes the overseer of the estate. But even he soon succumbs to greed and begins helping himself to estate funds, and before long only some gangsters and the overseer, who pays them for his protection, live in comfort and luxury. The rest, hopeless and powerless, live in appalling squalor and terror, governed by the truncheons of the gangsters. Gabal is the first of Gabalawi's descendants to receive his message that the residents of the alley have equal right to the estate, and he leads the first successful uprising against corruption and mob rule. A period of universal prosperity returns, but, sadly, as the narrator tells us at the end of Gabal's chapter, "Good examples would not be wasted on our alley were it not afflicted with forgetfulness." It is not long before the cycle of abuse resumes, interrupted only by the occasional interventions of one of Gabalawi's descendants.
It is possible to see why "Children of the Alley," narrowly read, might be held blasphemous according to the tenets of Islam. But it's equally possible to believe that Mr. Mahfouz, as he claims, did not intend to write a heretical book. He holds religion and the perversity of Gabalawi up to harsh light, but religion is only one element of a larger critique of an entrenched patriarchial authoritarianism that extends from the familial to the political. The book also makes for astonishing (and alarming) prophecy: Egypt today has a population of nearly 60 million people, living on 5 percent of the land. It receives lavish amounts of foreign aid and yet its per capita G.N.P. is $800 a year; wealth is consolidated in the hands of a few. "Most of our social occasions call for storytelling," the narrator tells us at the outset of the novel. "Whenever someone is depressed, suffering or humiliated, he points to the mansion at the top of the alley at the end opening out to the desert, and says sadly, 'That is our ancestor's house, we are all his children, and we have a right to his property. Why are we starving? What have we done?' "

Brave Little Books Conquer Italy

BYLINE: By Celestine Bohlen; Celestine Bohlen is the Rome bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: Rome

 BODY:
A mini-revolution has swept through Italy's book publishing industry in recent years, and it has even produced a small miracle: paperback sales are up and prices of all kinds of books are down, thanks to an explosion of little books costing, in many cases, less than a daily newspaper. Some say it began with Epicurus, the third-century B.C. Greek, a collection of whose aphorisms swept Italy in 1992, selling a million copies at a time when paperbacks on average sold 20,000 copies.
Known generically as mille lire books because most of them cost 1,000 lire (roughly 65 cents), the new arrivals -- some slim, some squat, but all small and cheap -- have made such a big noise on the Italian market that they now account for 25 percent of total paperback sales and are credited with an almost 30 percent drop in prices on all books, including textbooks, children's books and hardbacks. 
 Giuliano Vigini, editor of Editrice Bibliografica, the bible of Italian publishers, says that although the mille lire phenomenon has peaked, it has left its mark. "It was not just a revolution of prices, but of communication, a psychological revolution," he adds.
Small books at cheap prices -- typically reprints of literary classics whose copyrights expired long ago -- have popped up elsewhere: in Britain, Penguin celebrated its 60th year with 60 titles priced at 60 pence. The same publisher has an American line, at 95 cents. France and Spain have also seen small books cut a wide swath through their markets. But Italy is where the little book has had its biggest impact, and where it is still evolving, moving beyond predictable lists of classics toward a more daring world that offers new authors, wacky themes, useful dictionaries and academic treatises on subjects ranging from the history of Buddhism to Roman ruins.
Because books in Italian have few natural foreign markets, unlike books in English or French, the 1,000-lire book had a detonating effect. The drop in book prices -- which before were considerably higher than in the United States -- has forced major publishing houses to turn to new outlets and new promotion techniques, as well as to turn out cheaper books of their own.
But the main impact has been on readers, who, as it turns out, buy more books when they are cheaper. "People became accustomed to buying books and they continue to want more," says Mr. Vigini. "The more they consume, they more they want." A telling footnote has been the rush of sales in the south of Italy, which traditionally accounted for 13 percent of paperback sales nationwide, and now accounts for 37 percent of the 1,000-lire book sales.
Two small publishers can claim credit for the 1,000-lire book, which made its formal debut in 1992. The more revolutionary was Stampa Alternativa, a company with roots in the counterculture of the 1960's, which found in the 1990's that its recent line of elegant, expensive and eclectic art books -- adopted after books on marijuana growing and children's rights went out of vogue -- was also a losing proposition.
"We had decided to close shop," says Marcello Baraghini, publisher of Stampa Alternativa, who briefly worked as a shepherd while prosecutors took him to court for the marijuana book. "As a symbolic gesture, I thought I would put out a free book, as my swan song."
Instead, Stampa Alternativa came out with the little book of Epicurus' aphorisms, which, while not free, cost next to nothing -- 1,000 lire to be exact, 500 lire less than a newspaper. The book, which got a plug on a popular television program, became an overnight sensation. One man even wrote to Mr. Baraghini to say he had distributed a hundred copies at his wife's funeral.
From Epicurus, Stampa Alternativa went on to a book about a Samoan islander's trip to Europe (300,000 copies) and from there to a steady stream of offbeat mini-books -- pamphlets really -- on subjects ranging from graffiti found in Italian university bathrooms, to the messages left by Italian voters on invalidated ballots, to a book by children for children.
In that first year of the l,000-lire book craze, Stampa Alternativa -- which in 1992 saw its profits more than quadruple -- had only one rival, Newton Compton, a small publishing house founded in 1968 under a name that was meant to combine a fad for things English with an allusion to things scientific.
Newton Compton had been the first to experiment with super-economici -- supercheap -- books in 1988, when it reissued Freud's "Interpretation of Dreams" at a price equivalent to $3.50, and sold 350,000 copies. Within four years, Newton Compton had issued 200 titles at super-economici prices, selling a staggering 10 million copies.
"We too were surprised by the success," says Newton Compton's president, Vittorio Avanzini. The success was due not only to low prices but also to a distribution breakthrough. "We had to win over the indifference of the bookstores, which were concerned about their return on low-cost books, but we also rediscovered the newsstands and supermarkets," he says.
Newton Compton had an early fling with 900-lire books, none of which exceeded 100 pages. But in 1992, it too joined the mille lire stream, with, among other old favorites, Dante's "Divine Comedy," which for 1,000 lire could be had unabridged, printed in flea-sized print, jammed into 98 pages; it sold 750,000 copies. From there, Newton Compton moved through a list of classic titles, Italian and other, to a detective series, a science fiction series and an authoritative collection on Rome's historical sights.
With a series entitled "Il Sapere" ("Knowledge"), Newton Compton broke new ground, offering readers a tantalizing array of 200-page books, specially written for the 1,000-lire audience. These include a history of the Middle Ages, a dictionary of movie titles, a dictionary of difficult Italian words (for Italian speakers), a history of Futurism and one of Italian Fascism. Sales have been mixed, with a biography of Mussolini at the head of the list with 115,000 copies.
Sales aside, the "Il Sapere" series has had "an incredible resonance," according to Mr. Avanzini, who says several of his historical books are now required reading at universities. Academic authors, who forfeit copyright on the 1,000-lire books, feel compensated by seeing their works widely circulated. "They are thrilled because for the first time they get phone calls from all over Italy," he says.
Three years after it began, the boom in mille lire books is now subsiding, in large part because major Italian publishers, stung into action, have come up with their own cheap books. Mondadori, Italy's largest publishing house, now has its own 5,900-lire (about $3.70) series called Miti Mondadori, which has successfully intercepted the low-cost market, much to the dismay of Mr. Baraghini at Stampa Alternativa.
"Everybody has copied us, but nobody has picked up on the importance of content," he says, noting that he still publishes new works -- an average of two titles a month -- by young authors whose manuscripts arrive by the truckful. "Our books represent a defense of cultural freedom against a market tendency to consumerism. You could say we are the samizdat of the consumerist age."
Stampa Alternativa has already seen a turning of the tide, as its earnings drop back from their 1992 high. Ever on the lookout for fresh ideas, Mr. Baraghini has come up with a new product -- this time a book on hooking up to the Internet, which comes with a package of diskettes, sold in a box shaped like a one-liter milk container, now featured in museum displays as an example of Italian design.
One of the main legacies of the 1,000-lire book is the bolstering of Italy's paperback market, which was traditionally considered a corollary of the publishing industry. Total paperback sales, which came to about $120 million in 1991, reached $165 million in 1994. "This makes it the sector in the industry that has had the greatest percentage increase, bringing it to levels on a par with other countries," says Mr. Vigini, noting that paperback sales now account for 7.1 percent of book sales in Italy, compared with 9 percent in the United States.
In short, says Mr. Vigini, the 1,000-lire book has done its bit for history. "Nothing similar happened in the last 20 years," he says.

HEADLINE: The Ratings Game At the Cineplex

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL 

 BODY:
THE TIME: A RECENT SATURDAY afternoon. The place: the Cross County Multiplex, a 10-screen theater with all-weather carpeting and a video-game nook featuring Tekken 2. The theater happens to be in Yonkers but could just as easily be in Any Burb, U.S.A.
The scene: the time-honored quest of adolescents to buy tickets to an R-rated movie, unaccompanied by a parent or guardian. Sometimes you get in, sometimes you don't. 
 On this day, anxious youngsters were lined up for tickets to "12 Monkeys," an R-rated film in which Bruce Willis is glimpsed naked in a shower and later blows away a thug with a hand gun, and "Sudden Death," which features Jean-Claude Van Damme using a Super Soaker-type squirt gun filled with lighter fluid to torch an enemy. The fact that theaters and movie studios, in their wisdom, hav' decided that adolescents are not old enough to choose to see such scenes gave this crowd not a moment's pause.
"I don't think anybody our age wants to see anything rated under R," said Kevin, a tall, scrawny 16-year-old.
Rafael, a baby-faced boy of 11, added with a shrug, "They show the same things on TV." He and his 14-year-old sister, Jennifer, in braces, were part of a group of seven hoping to see "12 Monkeys." At the ticket window, the oldest members of the group, who were 14 and 15 and did not look a day older, requested the tickets. The clerk asked the ages of the younger children. Jennifer, pointing to heads, said truthfully, "12, 11 and 8." The c'erk sold them the tickets.
So it goes in multiplexes around the country: the ratings, issued with black-and-white clarity and Olympian authority by the Motion Picture Association of America, the trade organization of the major Hollywood studios, are enforced in real life with a great deal of wiggle room. Ratings, which do not have the force of law, are based on a voluntary industry agreement intended to avoid government regulation of film content.
Studios and directors regularly tangle with the Motion Picture Association in noisy controversies over ratings given to specific films. But in the malls of America, where real money is slid through ticket windows, or across the counters of video rental stores, what do the ratings mean in actual practice? Based on interviews with dozens of parents and teen-agers in the New York area and with leaders of national industry trade groups, it seems clear that despite the sanctimoniousness with which ratings are proferred, they do little to prevent young people from seeing inappropriate movies, for several reasons:
* To a teen-ager, an R is not so much a prohibition as a challenge; it rarely stops anyone with a desire to outwit the system.
* To many parents, the more cautionary ratings like R and PG-13 play little role in discouraging them from taking young children to adult-theme films, even those with graphic violence.
* In an era when adult entertainment is no longer confined to movie theaters but saturates the cultural landscape like the weather, young people turned away at the box office often need wait only a few months to rent the movie from a cooperative video store or catch it on cable.
 
How the System Works
Many Ratings, Much Indifference
Young people, of course, have always sneaked into the local Bijou, whether to catch a glimpse of Edward G. Robinson's blazing Tommy gun or the bikinied Bond girls of "Thunderball." But the issue of access to ultra-violent or ultra-salacious fare, from movies to pop music, has become far more important in recent years.
Implicit in discussions of ratings is the notion that society should shield children from images of deadly violence and casual sex because they are likely to breed antisocial behavior. It is an assumption endorsed by a majority of Americans in polls and a theme beloved by politicans from conservat've Republicans to President Clinton. It will undoubtedly be raised anew this campaign season, fueled by studies like one released this month by the cable television industry, which discovered, to the surprise of few, that violence saturates television. The broad telecommunications law just signed by the President requires television manufacturers to include a computer V-chip so parents can block objectionable programs.
MANY SOCIAL SCIENtists say there is a convincing body of evidence that repeated exposure of children to screen violence will encourage, if not cause, real-life violence. But Hollywood disputes this conclusion, no doubt because of the implied consequences. It has no desire to see government restrictions on film content.
"We're not talking about Newtonian laws here," said Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association. "It's very, very murky. None of the studies has been able to pinpoint a causal link between watching an action picture and becoming a murderer or a rapist the way you can track that your lungs will become blackened if you smoke cigarettes.
"People get frustrated because of what they think are violent streets and want a quick fix. You can darken every theater in America or cut the wires of every television set, and you'll do zero to restore the moral center."
There is no legal penalty incurred by teen-agers, parents or theater owners who ignore the ratings, which Mr. Valenti had a major hand in conceiving 27 years ago. Nonetheless, most theater owners say they support and enforce them.
In response to questions about the subject, National Amusements, the owner of the Yonkers multiplex, where unescorted minors seemed to have no trouble buying tickets to "12 Monkeys," the company said in a prepared statement, "Our employees are specifically instructed to comply with the rating system."
Mary Ann Grasso, executive director of the National Association of Theater Owners, a trade group that represents 65 percent of movie theaters in the United States, said, "I think you'll find in most cases theaters are very stringent in their enforcement of the restrictive ratings like R and NC-17."
That is not, however, what many teen-agers say. They report wide variations in the way the R rating is upheld: Theaters owned by image-conscious national chains, such as Cineplex Odeon and AMC Entertainment, are more restrictive, whereas smaller independent theaters are more lenient.
Lewis, a 14-year-old from Darien, Conn, who like many teen-agers refused to give his full name when talking about skirting the ratings, ticked off a list of his local theaters and their permeability: "State Cinema in Stamford almost always lets you in; the theater in the Stamford mall is pretty strict; Darien Playhouse lets you in."
(Managers for the State Cinema and Darien Playhouse insisted that they did their best to enforce the R rating and said that if unaccompanied minors got in, it was because they found adults in line to buy tickets for them.)
Teen-agers say that older ticket sellers tend to be tougher, but younger ones often look the oth'r way. Moreover, theaters seem to crack down selectively, depending on the content of individual R movies. For a "soft R" like "Four Weddings and a Funeral," which features a smattering of profanity, a theater might check identifications o'ly lightly. But it will turn tough for a "hard R" like Oliver Stone's "Natural Born Killers," one of the most violent movies of recent years.
Few teen-agers, of course, line up to see a movie like "Four Weddings." Instead, they swarm like bees to pictures with a high b'dy count and liberal nudity. "Broken Arrow," an R-rated picture that opened last weekend featuring decapitation by helicopter blade, fiery explosions and over-the-top slug-fests, is the latest must-see among teen-agers.
Because teen-agers are some of the most fanatic movie-goers, crucial to the success of many R-rated action films, one might assume that theaters have an economic stake in turning a blind eye.
"That's a popular notion," Ms. Grasso said, "but it isn't worth sacrificing the system for a couple of bucks."
Faced with a tough ticket clerk, teen-agers can often find adults to buy them tickets. And if all else fails, there is auditorium hopping. "You buy a ticket for 'Toy Story,' " explains Peter, 13, from Rowayton, Conn., "and walk back and pop into 'Showgirls.' "
Ms. Grasso did not dispute any of this. She even added one inconsistency of her own: Theater owners in the South tend to enforce the R rating more toughly than those in other regions. "I know, and I'm not going to lie, that kids get into R-rated films all the time," she said. "It's a rite of passage. When I was 14, that was my goal, and I think that's probably still the case."
When they so desire, theater owners are capable of rigidly controlling admission, as was demonstrated last year with the release of "Showgirls," a marathon of Las Vegas nudity, whose NC-17 rating meant that no one under 17 was allowed. Many multiplexes posted extra ushers at auditorium entrances to prevent movie-hopping. "We were very strict about checking ID's and told people before they got in line they would have to present ID's," said Marc Pascucci, a vice president of Sony Theaters, which manages about 850 screens nationwide.
 
How It Was
From the Code To NC-17
The National Association of Theater Owners tries to use educational campaigns to convince individual proprietors that it's in their interest to enforce ratings, reminding them of the troubled period before the current system began in 1968. Back then, a patchwork of local rating boards issued conflicting and often prudish restrictions, and owners were sometimes arrested for showing mopies considered indecent in Muncie, Ind., that played without incident in Minneapolis.
In the same era, the studios began to flout their own archaic Production Code, which decreed in straitjacketing detail how to portray sex and violence. Michelangelo Antonioni's "Blow-Up," the first studio film to feature nudity, was denied Production Code approval in 1966 although M.G.M. released it anyway.
Two years later, in part fearing a government crackdown, the M.P.A.A. and the theater owners organization developed the current system, which has evolved into one with five ratings: G (suitable for the youngest viewers), PG (may contain some material unfit for young children), PG-13, (some material may be unfit for pre-teen-agers), R (children under 17 must be escorted by an adult) and NC-17 (no one under 17 admitted). The NC-17 replaced the X rating in 1990 with the intent of removing the X's stigma of pornography, a goal that has been only partly successful.
The studios belonging to the M.P.A.A. may release only rated films, but independent companies may distribute films without ratings.
 
The Video Market
No Ushers For Home Viewing
With the rise of the videocassette industry in the 80's, video retailers also endorsed the ratings. "We take them very seriously," said Bob Finlayson, a spokesman for the Video Software Dealers Association, which represents more than 20,000 stores. His organization sends members a "Pledge to Parents" stating that the store will enforce R and NC-17 restrictions. Some stores ask parents to sign a permission form allowing their children to take out R movies.
But many teen-agers say video stores can be just as permissive as movie theaters. "If you look 10 they'll ask to see your parents, but if you're 13 or 14 they'll let you," said Brendan Mahoney, a 13-year-old from Darien who said he recently rented the R-rated "Johnny Mnemonic" on h's own.
The ratings debate has become immeasurably more complex in the age of video and cable television. Whereas movies shown in theaters were once the primary source of "mature" images, now children who have never been admitted to an R-rated movie have probably seen plenty on a VCR or on cable.
Margie Ryerson, a mother of two teen-age daughters in Orinda, Calif., recalled objecting when her oldest, then a sixth-grader, was invited to a slumber party where the entertainment was a video of "Pretty Woman."
"I thought no purpose was served in having my pre-adolescent daughter see a movie about a woman who's a hooker and her romantic involvement with someone," Ms. Ryerson said. Even more surprising, she said, was that out of ten 11- and 12-year-olds, her daughter was the only one who hadn't already seen "Pretty Woman."
 
The Parents
They Too Are Offenders
Sometimes parents t'emselves are the problem. A scene common to many movie houses unfolded recently at the Crown Sono Regent in South Norwalk, Conn.: as ticket sellers diligently turned away unescorted 15-year-olds from R movies, a stream of far younger children, many as young as 4 or 5, were led in by adults to the same movies.
According to a study done for the M.M.P.A., 75 percent of parents with children under 17 find the ratings useful. Yet a surprising number of parents say ratings play little ro'e in influencing what films they take children to.
In the popcorn line of the Crown Sono Regent, Angela Grant was waiting with her 6-year-old daughter, Morgan, to see the R-rated "Waiting to Exhale," in which four women discuss in frank detail the sexual ineptitude of men.
"I don't know what this movie's about," Ms. Grant said. "I'll cover her eyes, I guess, where she's not supposed to see."
Ms. Grant's boyfriend, Cleveland Keller, a self-described film buff, said that based on what he had gathered from television advertisements, he did not think the film was inappropriate for a 6-year-old. "I think the direction of the movie is done in great taste," he added.
Just about the only one who thought Angela was too young for "Waiting to Exhale" was her 15-year-old sister, Teka, who had already seen it. "But I'm not her mother," she said.
In the same multiplex, a couple escorting a girl of about 8 found their seats a few minutes into the wildly violent "From Dusk Till Dawn," just as George Clooney executed a lawman with a .44 and a liquor store burst into flames. Later, the rape and murder of a woman, glimpsed tied to a bed with blood spattering the walls, was played for sick humor.
Afterward, the couple with the young girl, Al and Stacey Johnson, did not seem disturbed that their daughter, Ashley, had seen such images. Ashley called the movie "stupid."
To Dr. Victor Strasburger, chief of adolescent medicine at the University of New Mexico Medical School in Albuquerque, exposing children to such films represents "a kind of electronic child abuse."
Dr. Strasburger, the author of the book "Getting Your Kids to Say No in the 90's When You Said Yes in the 60's," added: "I can't tell you how many time I've been tempted to walk up to a family in a movie theater and say: 'Here's 10 bucks. Get a babysitter.' "

HEADLINE: Signs of an Invigorated Luxury Market in Chicago

BYLINE: By ROBERT SHAROFF 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
The most exclusive block of downtown Chicago's most exclusive street, Lake Shore Drive, is acquiring some new luxury apartments.
The apartments are in two historic buildings, one of which was formerly occupied by the Mayfair Regent Hotel; the other was a rental. The Mayfair, at 181 East Lake Shore Drive, will become a condominium. 
 The rental building, next door at 199 East Lake Shore Drive, is being transformed by John Buck, a developer known primarily for large-scale civic and commercial projects, into the city's first new luxury co-op in many years.
These new developments, the first additions to the drive's stock of luxury housing since the decade began, are viewed as a sign that the lull in the downtown luxury market is ending.
"We had a very good year selling multimillion-dollar properties," Patricia Study, vice president of Rubloff Residential Properties, said of 1995. "The best year since 1985."
Both new projects are almost sold out, even though prices, from $1.25 million to $5 million -- are among the city's highest. Of the 29 apartments at the Mayfair, 21 are under contract. At Mr. Buck's project, 13 of the 14 units, each with 4,500 square feet of space, have been spoken for.
"That's a very high absorption rate at that price level," said James Kinney, president of Rubloff, whose offices on Michigan Avenue overlook East Lake Shore Drive. "Part of it is due to the fact that the high-end market is rebounding and part is because this is a once-in-a-lifetime deal. It's the last chance to get in on something there. This finishes the block. Nothing else will be developed there."
The block, which has been declared a historic district, is in the heart of the city's Gold Coast, a stone's throw from the fashionable Michigan Avenue shopping district. Nancy Reagan, the former First Lady, grew up on East Lake Shore Drive, the stepdaughter of Loyal Davis, a prominent surgeon. Current residents include Jay Pritzker, the billionaire financier, and Eppie Lederer, the advice columnist better known as Ann Landers.
The western end of the block is dominated by the venerable Drake Hotel. The rest is occupied by seven buildings, most of which are co-ops and the newest of which dates from 1929.
The Mayfair project is being developed by Bruce Abrams, whose company, LR Development, has a reputation for innovative residential-renovation projects. Three years ago, the company acquired the former Playboy Mansion -- home to Hugh Hefner in the 60's and 70's -- on nearby State Parkway and converted it into seven condominium units.
The Mayfair was built as an apartment hotel in 1924 and contained more than 200 rooms. Mr. Abrams has gutted the building and is selling apartments ranging from 3,700 to 8,600 square feet. "It will essentially be a modern building in a vintage shell with high-tech, high-efficiency mechanicals," he said. The company offers several floor plans and finishing packages, including duplexes, and buyers can also bring in their own architects. The base package offered by the company costs about $150 a square foot.
Mr. Buck's building was designed in 1915 by Benjamin Marshall, a top residential architect of the period whose name is synonymous with prewar elegance in Chicago. Mr. Buck is selling the existing apartments for $1.25 million each.
New co-ops are a rarity in Chicago. Mr. Buck declined to comment, but people in the real estate community say he opted for a co-op rather than a condominium because he was unable to buy the land underneath the building. He does, however, have an option to buy it from the owner, the Cohen Perlman family trust, at a later date.
Both Mr. Buck and Mr. Abrams plan to live in their respective buildings. Mr. Abrams has hired Gregory DeStefano, an architect at DeStefano & Partners, to design his own apartment.
What do luxury buyers want in a new apartment today? "The layouts are as open as you can get them and there is far more emphasis on family spaces like kitchens and children's playrooms," Mr. DeStefano said. "It's also less formal and less glitzy than the 80's." Another lifestyle change is the absence of servants' quarters. "Housekeeping has been outsourced today," Mr. DeStefano said. "People have day help."
Mr. DeStefano is also the architect for the Regent, a condominium project Mr. Abrams is developing on property he owns in back of the Mayfair that fronts on Walton Street. The Regent will have 17 units that will be somewhat smaller than the Mayfair's and will sell for $400,000 to $1.075 million. The Regent will be ready for occupancy in June 1997, the Mayfair by next January.
The two projects have dominated the high-end market this year at a time when it has been reviving. According to the Chicago Association of Realtors, sales activity on the Near North Side -- which includes the Gold Coast and Lake Shore Drive -- jumped significantly in 1995, as did prices.
"Back in the 80's before the recession, there were very few sales over a million dollars," said Joan Armstrong, a broker at Koenig & Strey. "That's not true anymore."
When real estate agents talk about the drive, however, they are really talking about a handful of vintage luxury buildings, most of which are co-ops. "Many of these buildings used to have waiting lists and then there was no assurance you'd get past the co-op board," Ms. Study said.
There has been almost no development -- high or low -- on the drive in the last decade. In the 70's and 80's, nearby Michigan Avenue started to come into its own as a luxury residential address with the construction of half a dozen high-rises. The clear winners on Michigan Avenue are 950, 900, Water Tower Place and Olympia Center. All are part of larger mixed-use developments that include stores, offices and hotels.
Still, if given a choice, most people opt for the drive. "When people come in to buy," Ms. Armstrong said, "the first thing they ask for is a view. And in Chicago, a view means one thing: Lake Michigan."
Richard Phelan, a lawyer who moved into Mr. Buck's co-op recently, said: "I feel like I've died and gone to heaven. We're right in the heart of everything: movies, restaurants, shopping. Also, I've paced it off and my office is exactly 1.1 miles from my apartment."
Mr. Phelan, who is 57, exemplifies a growing trend in the Chicago area that is helping a resurgence in the downtown luxury real estate market. After spending 20 years in the suburbs -- first in Evanston, then in Winnetka -- he decided to move back into the city.
"My wife died and I remarried and my kids are all out of the house," he said. "I just decided it was time to move on."
He is not the only one. "The whole suburban-flight issue is being reversed with older couples," Mr. Kinney said. "We find a lot of people moving back because they like all the amenities."

HEADLINE: Habitats/East Side, West Side?;
A Newlywed Solution

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
SOME people are dog people. Some people are cat people. Some people are East Side people. Some are West Side people.
Kathryn McCormack, 26, is a West Side person. Her new husband, Christopher McCormack, also 26, used to be an East Side person. 
 "I tried to keep our horizons open," said Mrs. McCormack, an economist who works as a researcher in a securities firm. "But he lived on the East Side and I hated going there. I hated everything about it. I hated the restaurants, I hated the stores."
"She was a real trouper about it, though," interrupted Mr. McCormack, who specializes in mortgage-backed securities, worried, perhaps, that his wife of two months sounded too vehement. "We looked all over."
First, Mr. McCormack went on a treasure hunt; he called various banks -- Apple Bank, Citibank and Chemical were three -- asking for their lists of foreclosure sales. "Just open up the Yellow Pages and pick a bank," he explained.
"We didn't want to be the typical couple spending $1,500 a month for rent," he continued. They looked at apartments that other couples had paid $150,000 to $175,000 for in the height of the market, and now had a child and wanted to move but couldn't sell for anywhere near that amount. "Some of these people were up to lose $50,000," he said. "I didn't want that to be us."
They found a spacious one bedroom in a doorman building on Gramercy Park. The apartment was "dark, dark, dark," but it had potential, he said. The price was, incredibly, $40,000.
The couple bid $35,000; another couple bid less, but they offered all cash, and the other couple got it.
"It was our first big mistake," Mr. McCormack said. "We went right to Citibank and paid them $150 and were pre-approved for a mortgage." The pre-approval gave the couple a three-month window to find a place; after that, they said, they'd pay another $150 to extend it.
In the meantime, the couple widened their search to include, as they delicately put it, "places in need of repair." One was on York Avenue. "I don't know if you could call it a wreck," Mrs. McCormack said, dubiously. "I mean, there were people living in it." She paused. "Sort of."
One Sunday, they saw the advertisement they'd been waiting for: "West End Avenue; needs to be completely redone; partial river views. Asking $120,000."
The ad did not lie; you can glimpse the Hudson from the double window in the master bedroom -- and, judging from the photograph, the one-bedroom apartment, near the corner of 91st Street, certainly did need to be completely redone. Huge slabs of paint hung off the water-damaged ceilings in all the rooms.
The McCormacks bought the apartment from a 101-year-old woman. Young as they are, the couple were tough negotiators, and worked with Richard Grossman, vice president of Heron Ltd. They paid $93,500.
They put about $6,000 worth of work into it -- plastering and repainting and a new $2,500 kitchen with cabinets from one of the huge home improvement chains, and, to their surprise, the apartment was appraised for $167,000.
"We don't want to sell it or anything," said the effervescent Mr. McCormack, who pointed out that the apartment's monthly costs -- $715 for maintenance and $529 for mortgage payments are still less than the cost of the renting the same apartment in today's heated rental market. "But it's nice to know we made a good investment."
"And," she said, in her shy, but determined fashion, "we did get to live on the West Side after all."

HEADLINE: CHINA: OPPORTUNITY ... OR TRAP?;
Tricks of the Peanut Butter Trade

BYLINE: By Seth Faison; Seth Faison is The Times's Shanghai bureau chief.

 BODY:
Less than 100 yards from the peanut butter factory he has traveled across China to see, Michael McCune is stuck. His car has come to a halt in a narrow, muddy alley lined with old wooden shacks that look as if they've been there for centuries. McCune, a hulking 25-year-old American with a John Travolta dimple on his chin, cranes his neck to look for the factory gate. But the passageway is barely 10 feet wide and his view is blocked by a cart that has stopped to unload its wares -- an extensive collection of broken machine parts -- one by one. Hard to tell how long this chore will take; time moves slowly in rural China.
McCune is cheerful on this chilly January morning, despite his inability to find any caffeine, and climbs out of the car to look around. As a consultant, McCune often ventures through China's hinterlands in search of information that will help American companies sell their products, and he has a favorite game for passing time: he tries to buy a can of Coke. 
 In this dusty brown town called Hong An, 500 miles inland from Shanghai in Hubei Province, his chances don't seem very promising. Glancing up and down the tiny lane, McCune sees one shack offering slabs of raw beef that hang on hooks in the open air. Another proffers unwashed cabbage and carrots on a dilapidated table. A third has a simple glass counter displaying an assortment of crackers, cheap-looking candy and two rows of bottled drinks.
McCune steps through the doorless entry of the candy shack and sets his gaze on the young woman behind the counter, who is wearing a filthy smock. He smiles a broad smile and raises his eyebrows expectantly.
"Do you have Coke?" he asks. The woman does not answer and stares back blankly. It's hard to tell whether she cannot understand McCune's accent or cannot believe that a foreigner -- "big nose" in local parlance -- can even speak Chinese.
"Do you have Coke?" McCune asks again. Silence still. A second woman, wearing a pea green Mao jacket and combing her waist-length hair, steps forward.
"No," she says firmly. "We have Pepsi."
Western goods seem to be seeping into even the most rural parts of China, as though floating on an inevitable tide of modernization. But the process is far from effortless. Even if Coke is outselling Pepsi in China, both have to fight hard to carve paths into the vast and forbidding territory of the Chinese market.
Western businessmen have been salivating at the notion of access to China's masses for more than 100 years. The phrase "If everybody bought one . . . " has been as infectious as it is far-fetched. Even if someone could magically create a product that all 1.2 billion Chinese consumers wanted to buy, how could every Chinese possibly afford it?
Poverty infests the tumbledown villages dotting the countryside, where most ordinary people still live. And between urban corners where commerce has begun to thrive, connecting roads and distribution networks are still so primitive that the overall market remains badly fragmented. Most consumer goods are made and sold locally -- there are about 400 brands of cigarettes, most of them sold only where they are manufactured -- and logistical obstacles make it difficult to market anything nationwide.
Yet, as Pepsi knows, it can be done. It just isn't easy. Pepsi had to set up an intricate, connect-the-dots route to get its soda from a bottling plant in Shanghai to that candy shack, alternating between inefficient state-owned truckers and unreliable local start-ups. As McCune will tell you, it is essential to figure out not only what will sell here but also how to get it somewhere it can be sold.
WHEN MCCUNE CAME TO CHINA IN early 1993, he worked in the commercial section of the United States Consulate in Shanghai and recognized an opportunity. He heard one American executive after another complain about the bureaucratic headaches and practical difficulties of getting their goods to market and saw the need for a business to address those problems head-on. Late the following year he and two like-minded young Americans set up a consulting company in Shanghai called China Link.
"Everybody's dying concern is distribution," says Ira Bloom, one of McCune's partners. "As soon as we say 'distribution,' everyone is willing to talk to us."
China Link, founded on a shoestring, is small: it has only eight steady clients and grossed a just-scraping-by $120,000 last year. But McCune and his partners have already had some success: one client has carved a huge portion of the Shanghai ice cream market away from Unilever, the British-Dutch consumer products giant. Another client, a major American food products company (which has requested anonymity), has hired them to research market conditions and investment possibilities. Coke is not a client; McCune does his recreational research on the company, he says, because it's his favorite drink.
Over the past five years the number of consultants on business in China has grown almost as fast as the economy. China Link is a rarity in that it is specifically geared to advise on how to bring consumer products to market, and that seems to be a business in which demand can only increase.
Markets are changing so fast, and are still so poorly coordinated, that the only way to get reliable market research is to constantly canvass stores, distributors and factories in person. Which is what McCune does, sometimes on a specific assignment from a client, sometimes just to keep abreast of market trends. China Link's brochure points out that it can also help clients obtain licenses and customs clearance, yet its primary focus is on figuring out how to deliver goods and get them prominently positioned on a store shelf. That's the idea, anyway. Reality can be a little more slapdash.
As Bloom, 27, sits in the China Link office, explaining the business to me, McCune busts in with a large tub of ice cream in each arm.
"What's going on?" Bloom asks.
"Gotta put these in our fridge for now," McCune says over his shoulder as he heads to the kitchen.
It turns out that the ice-cream-making client, the Taiwanese-owned Fuller Foodstuffs Company, shut down production in Shanghai for a few days to clean its machinery but forgot to warn regular customers, including a restaurant that depends on a daily supply. Bloom and McCune arranged to buy ice cream elsewhere and deliver it themselves, so the restaurant wouldn't be tempted to switch suppliers.
Common sense and flexibility are essential in any business, but a remarkable number of American executives lose their heads when they come to China, both seduced and daunted by the wonder of being in what the Chinese like to call the Middle Kingdom. The more banquets with senior officials, McCune calculates, the less cost-efficient you are.
"It's the market you have to keep your eyes on," McCune says. "Rather than send a team to Beijing and set up a fancy office, you'd usually be better off sending a couple of young guys to figure out how to sell."
"Young guys" often figure in McCune's recipe for what an American company needs in China. Part of it may be Generation X hubris, a belief that young men like himself can always do it better. But part of it is the recognition that working in China -- where the unexpected delay or unannounced tax man always lurks around a corner -- does not demand brainy analysis or finesse; it requires hustle and common sense.
Sometimes that means a "guerrilla visit" to a store, which entails McCune's ignoring the store manager, who would sit him down for tea and an hour of meaningless chitchat, and talking instead to clerks and customers about what is selling and why.
McCune looks as comfortable as a regular customer as he breezes into the Shanghai Number Two Foodstuffs Store, a poorly lighted supermarket in downtown Shanghai. As a 6-foot-5 white guy who towers over most shoppers, he can't fail to turn some heads.
Narrow aisles are packed with haphazardly arranged domestic and imported goods, many with the dull colors of cheap packaging, though a few have flashy, eye-catching blues and reds. Pringles chips are clearly visible on one shelf, Quaker Oats oatmeal can be seen on the next. McCune starts quizzing a clerk about jam sales. The clerk seems surprised that anyone would ask her opinion on anything and ignores a sizable crowd of customers to talk to McCune.
McCune scribbles notes as the clerk explains why a particular brand -- made by one of McCune's clients -- is getting so much less shelf space than a competitor. "The other brand has more flavors available," she says.
McCune is irritated that so few of his client's available flavors are making it from the factory to the store. "What the manufacturer is telling the distributor is obviously not getting to the retailer," he says.
Passing another counter, McCune sees bottles of Coke and Pepsi next to one another. He cannot resist asking about them.
"Coke is selling much better than Pepsi," the clerk volunteers. "Pepsi is a little bit sweeter, and Chinese don't like things too sweet. I think Pepsi must sell better than Coke in America, right?"
A FEW MONTHS AGO, MCCUNE FOUND Happy Word peanut butter on the shelf of a Shanghai supermarket; store clerks and distributors told him it is one of China's best-selling brands. McCune dialed the Hong An telephone number printed on the label and invited himself for a visit. His major American client wants to know about peanut butter.
Venturing far from Shanghai to research successful Chinese companies to see if they are prospective investments or competitors with secrets to reveal can often be a wild goose chase. A common way for American companies to invest in China is through a joint venture in which a local and foreign partner share ownership and management. Here lie the main obstacles of working in China: though stubborn bureaucrats and sleazy businessmen get in the way, what makes the day so long is old habits, poverty, a simple lack of information and sorting through disorganization.
But every such journey into rural China is full of the unexpected and is thus an education in itself. During the drive to the peanut butter factory in Hong An, McCune looks out past the rutted single-lane road that winds through vast patches of brown, untended land. Along the roadside are stacks of hay as enormous as sleeping elephants. A pack of about 50 poorly dressed young men stand in the early-morning darkness at the intersection of a dirt road, apparently hoping to be hired as day laborers by an unknown employer who has yet to make an appearance.
In Hong An, McCune finally gets past the stalled cart in the muddy lane and reaches the peanut butter factory. The first signs are not good. Passing a collection of unpainted old buildings so dark they almost look abandoned, McCune enters a meeting room with a bare concrete floor, a wooden table and, inexplicably, a rusting sink in the corner. All the lights are out.
"Blackout," says the factory director, Li Nengsheng, as if he loses electricity every other day. Yet as he realizes how bad that must sound to a potential investor, Li adds: "We don't have any electricity problems. This happens very rarely."
"And no heat?" McCune asks.
"We don't need heat," Li says, holding out his hands as if to enjoy the warmth in the air. It's about 45 degrees.
Li, 38, has more the air of a bureaucrat than a businessman. He wears a black leather jacket over his maroon sweater, white shirt and tie, and the tight collar on his blue long underwear peeks conspicuously above his shirt collar.
McCune has a long list of questions. Li answers some -- the factory has 307 employees, pays most of them less than $100 a month, grossed about $6 million last year -- and ignores others.
Before long it is clear that the Happy Word peanut butter factory is not a place McCune would recommend as a partner. It has a dilapidated plant, is not particularly sanitary and, like even the most successful state-owned companies, is burdened with the cost of housing and educating its employees and retirees and their families. But it is Li's success in distributing from his rural base to several Chinese cities that piques McCune's interest. Although Li is evasive about details, McCune learns that the factory has salesmen in every major Chinese city.
It is time for lunch and -- whether he is meeting with a potential partner or competitor -- simple politeness requires that McCune accept the invitation. He is asked to wait in the meeting room while the meal is prepared. One of Li's assistants, Zheng Taizong, whose navy blue pants have a Chicago Bulls logo printed on the seat, sidles up to ask a question that seems to have been nagging at him: "Do you think China should be capitalist or Communist?"
McCune thinks for a long while, hesitates, then finally says: "That's not the issue. China's problem is that it's still run on a system of men, not law. It's not a problem of socialism or capitalism. If you ask me, of course, I prefer capitalism, but that's not the most important thing for China now."
Zheng nods thoughtfully. Which system does he prefer?
"Socialism. I still think we should take care of the unemployed and the elderly."
After a momentary silence Zheng leaves the room. Whether McCune likes it or not, his presence represents an advocacy of market economics and capitalism. These days most Chinese managers do not want to talk ideology; those who do often sing about the benefits of capitalism to a visiting foreign businessman and about the wisdom of socialism to a visiting Communist Party chief. But Zheng's comment is a reminder that the once-dominant issue of ideology, while it seems to have disappeared among entrepreneurs in Shanghai, still lurks within the party structure that stretches from the top in Beijing down to the state-run peanut butter factory in Hong An. That doesn't make cooperation impossible, but does effectively limit it: Li and Zheng want foreign investment, but they are not going to be on the same wavelength as any foreign partner.
The wait for lunch in the unheated meeting room becomes a long one. McCune is relieved when Li finally shows him to a simple room with folding chairs and a small wooden table where some vegetable dishes are served.
"I hope we don't get crickets," McCune mumbles in English as he takes a seat.
Something equally unexpected, it turns out, is on its way. A short cook in a white smock carries out a steaming plate of stew, a meat dish with spinach and potatoes in it, and McCune looks at it carefully.
With a proud smile, Li asks, "Do you like dog?"
McCune freezes, his chopsticks in midair. It takes a moment before he regains his composure and politely tries the dish, which tastes a bit tough, not unlike scrawny beef.
When the cook re-enters, carrying another vegetable dish, McCune cannot resist asking how fresh the meat is.
"We just killed it 15 minutes ago," the cook says cheerfully. "Went out to market, brought the dog back and killed it."
Lunch was delayed, McCune now realizes, so that the cooks could obtain, slaughter and prepare the dog as a special treat for him. He is silent. As if on cue, a dog suddenly howls in the distance, too far away to tell if it, too, is being sold at market.
Li looks over between mouthfuls. "You're a little sensitive about eating dog, eh?"
"It makes me think about my own dog waiting at home in Shanghai," McCune says, slightly embarrassed.
MCCUNE AND BLOOM LIVE AND WORK on one floor of a three-story house in an old section of Shanghai where their dog, Foster, is better known among the neighbors than any human; their house is like one you'd find on a college campus. Late Sunday morning a dozen mostly American, mostly businessman friends gather for brunch, followed by a game of touch football.
Bloom cooks eggs and French toast while McCune and the others watch a videotape of "Seinfeld" sent from New York, where their other partner, Jason Foster, 25, handles the American side of the business.
For McCune and Bloom, China is not just another posting, as it is for many American executives who endure two or three years here before moving on to a more comfortable setting; it is a proving ground. China has become something of an obsession for them, a puzzle that never runs out of new pieces.
But first things first. McCune and Bloom are hoping to make their first million by the turn of the century. China Link appears to be ready to ride the wave of American consumer goods sales that is likely to grow steadily for years, but McCune recognizes that the environment is still deeply unpredictable.
"Maybe we'll do great, and after 10 years I'll go back home and start a new career," he says on the way to Hong An. "Maybe this will all flop."
Later, talking to Bloom in Shanghai, he seems more sanguine about China Link's prospects: "We're either going to get rich or we're going to get bought out." The three partners expect to plow all their profits back into the company for the next few years.
McCune grew up in Oakland, Calif., wanting to be a space-shuttle engineer. At the University of Michigan, however, he found classes in Chinese studies more intriguing than physics. After that the path was clear. He arrived in Shanghai -- looking for an adventure, ready for a career -- and landed his job at the consulate on his second day here. It was perfect training.
"I remember, some guy came in, laid out his plans and asked me what I thought," McCune says. "I said, 'Based on all the knowledge I have after exactly two days in China, it sounds great.' But after listening to 10 of those guys, I had an idea of what they needed. After listening to 100, I had a very good idea."
He says that he is fortunate to have found two American partners with a similar vision and that they work unusually well together, even if their day-to-day decision making amounts to a continuous argument.
Bloom was handling distribution for an American leather-goods company in Shanghai when he met McCune; Foster was the project manager for a medical provider in Beijing. "We balance each other out," Bloom says. "Mike is the most visionary and most marketable. Jason is the workhorse. I'm the nuts-and-bolts guy."
Most marketable, indeed. McCune is an unrepentant schmoozer. He sometimes seems unable to stop talking and has the confidence to start a conversation with a stranger about virtually anything. It helps that he speaks what the Chinese like to call "a mouthful of fluent Chinese," itself a cause for wonderment among most Chinese people he meets.
In Hong An, McCune notices a young woman with long, straight hair standing nearby.
Within a couple of minutes, McCune ascertains that her name is Shi Yaqiong and that she is 18, works for the local Agricultural Machine Bureau, spends a half-hour commuting each way, is bored with her job, does not drink alcohol, likes movies, lives with her parents and never goes to discos.
McCune can't resist asking his favorite question.
"Do they have Coke in this town?"
 
Michael McCune's Five Rules for Doing Business in China
 
1. Think small - focus on one region at a time.
China is more like Europe than like the United States - each of its many provinces has different tastes and ways of doing things. Would it make sense to start selling in England, Greece and Germany all at the same time? China's tastes are too varied, and the cost of doing business nationwide is too high.
 
2. Skip the manager, talk to the clerk.
Before meeting with senior officials or executives, know what their underlings are telling them. Store managers will give you the party line; clerks will tell you how the business works.
 
3. Study the side streets.
American executives often get a thrill from seeing upscale stores filled with Chinese consumers. But most Chinese still shop in small stores in back alleys. McCune urges visiting C.E.O.'s to get out of the motorcade and walk down a market street. Sometimes it's dirty, sometimes it smells. "People say, 'Take time to smell the roses,' "McCune jokes. "I say, 'Take time to smell the night soil.' "
 
4. Get the goods to market.
It's not hard to build a factory or to create market demand for a product. "But if you don't connect the two," McCune says, "it's all for naught." A well-known American company making consumer products in southern China planned a major expansion northward last year before it figured out how to transport the goods. When company officials suddenly realized that no one could deliver what they were manufacturing they had to abandon most the expansion, at a significant loss.
 
5. Above all, be flexible.
What works in Baltimore or Bombay may not work in Beijing. In fact, it almost certainly will not. "The people who succeed in China are the ones who create a system that fits the need, not the ones who like to install a system that operated well somewhere else," McCune says. "There are no rules for what works. And there's no guarantee that how it worked 10 years ago or 2 years ago is how it works today. It changes daily."

HEADLINE: CHINA: APPEASE ... OR CONTAIN?;
Speak Softly, Carry a Veiled Threat

BYLINE: By Fareed Zakaria; Fareed Zakaria is the managing editor of Foreign Affairs. This is his first article for the Magazine.

 BODY:
In Somerset Maugham's novel about novelists, "Cakes and Ale," one of the characters belittles Henry James for having "turned his back on one of the great events of the world's history, the rise of the United States, in order to report tittle-tattle at tea parties in English country houses." Today, as we talk about peace plans in Bosnia, elections in Haiti and hostages in Chechnya, there is a danger of similarly neglecting the defining international political event of this era -- the rise of China to world power.
Great powers are not made every day. The list that most would agree on today -- the United States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany, Japan and China -- would have been nearly the same 100 years ago. (Austria-Hungary is the dropout exception.) China is the new giant on the block. Depending on how you count, China has either the ninth- or the second-largest economy in the world and is growing by about 10 percent annually. Its military budget is the world's fourth-largest and is growing robustly as well. It is home to one of the dominant civilizations of the world, with a diaspora spreading across East Asia and beyond. And in a world with post-modern powers like Germany and Japan -- which could act abroad but don't because of self-doubt -- China is a thoroughly traditional great power. 
 Nicholas Kristof has called China's compound of liberalizing economics and repressive politics "Market Leninism." The phrase captures the two sides of China, but also the two sides of the debate in America about China. Those enamored of the "market" see China's growing economy as a historic opportunity. In the eyes of many businessmen and some scholars, the prize is so rich that everything else should be subordinated to it. Those transfixed by China's "Leninism," in contrast, see a brutal dictatorship that systematically oppresses its people, bullies its neighbors and blithely sells weapons around the world. For these people, China's growing economy is not an opportunity but a danger.
From this starting point, it seems clear that Washington faces a choice between appeasing and containing China. It does not -- yet. If Beijing were basically friendly, we could accommodate its rising influence, as Britain did with America. If it were intrinsically hostile, we could take on the enormous costs of countering its worldwide influence and working to overthrow it, as we did with Hitler's Germany and the Soviet Union. But China lies somewhere between those extremes, and Washington will have to live with it there for a while. As China's future becomes clearer, so should American policy.
Appeasement has had a bad rap since Neville Chamberlain handed over a chunk of Czechoslovakia to Adolf Hitler in 1938. But much of everyday diplomacy is appeasement. It is the accommodation (a nicer word) to realities that you cannot fundamentally change. In the late 19th century the British foreign office even used the word "appeasement" to describe favorably its policy toward the rising power across the Atlantic Ocean.
Negotiations, even one-sided ones, are often an effective way to manage international problems. War is, after all, the most expensive solution. Making this kind of calculation, the Truman and Eisenhower Administrations reluctantly accepted the reality of Soviet domination in Eastern Europe, opting for containment rather than "rollback." The problem with appeasement, however, is that it is sometimes futile and counterproductive, feeding the aggressor's appetite while lulling its neighbors into a false sense of security. Chamberlain's mistake was to apply a policy that worked with the United States to Nazi Germany.
What about China today? Certainly the regime in Beijing has characteristics that make it a difficult partner. The best analogy, though, is not to the Third Reich but to the Second. Like Germany in the late 19th century, China is also growing rapidly but uncertainly into a global system in which it feels it deserves more attention and honor. China's military is a powerful political player, as was the Prussian officer corps. Like Wilhelmine Germany, the Chinese regime is trying to hold onto political power even as it unleashes forces in society that make its control increasingly shaky.
Regimes in transition often make policy erratically, use nationalism as a unifying device and look for support from groups like the military, which then acquire even greater influence. This combination of hubris and insecurity can be difficult to negotiate with. And once Deng Xiaoping dies, China will have no more Bismarck-like statesman with the skill and credibility to keep the balancing act going.
If appeasement won't work, why not containment? It would not work either. The containment of a great power is impossible without sustained support from several important countries. The prospect of such support against China is nonexistent today. The smaller states of East Asia have decided, at least for now, to live with China's hegemony and hope that it is benign. South Korea is too nervous about its worse half and about Japan to take on such a task. Japan is still too jittery about its regional role to try anything so ambitious. Vietnam would be our only taker. That would be like having tried to contain the Soviet Union with Belgium as our only ally.
More important, however, containment is premature. China is simply not Hitler's Germany or Stalin's Soviet Union. It is not a revolutionary, messianic state with an aggressive dictator firmly in power who is bent on spreading his power and ideology abroad. In its foreign relations, China has done little more than rattle its saber in some regional disputes, and -- more worrying -- sell arms and nuclear technology to rogue regimes. The country is clearly in a transitional phase, deciding how to orient itself in the world. Premature containment would help China make that decision.
In coming years, China's ambitions are bound to expand. Additionally, Beijing treats its people with a repressive callousness, which we rightly abhor. This is a recipe for ceaseless argument and conflict with the United States. To avoid sparking crisis after crisis, Washington should ask itself what Chinese actions would threaten its core interests and values. It should warn Beijing -- usually in private but sometimes publicly -- that if these lines are crossed, normal relations would become impossible. By crossing them, China would make strikingly clear to its neighbors that a policy of containment has become necessary and feasible.
Such a policy would aim to create defensive alliances and provide military aid to East Asian states to secure their sovereignty and independence. It would also halt the integration of China in various international institutions and seek to limit Beijing's economic and political influence worldwide. The goal should not be to "defeat" China, as it was with the Soviet Union, but to get Beijing to respect the borders, treaties and norms that make up the current international arrangements.
What Chinese actions would trigger containment? First and foremost, those that threaten the stability of East Asia. This is not simply for balance-of-power reasons. The "Asian miracle" is about politics as well as economics. Economic growth has been followed by political reform in most East Asian countries. If China were to upset the regional balance of power, this enormous economic, political and moral progress would be jeopardized.
We should oppose Chinese attempts to gain influence by destabilizing the status quo in the South China Sea, Korea, Vietnam and Taiwan. On Taiwan, the United States should try to perpetuate the uneasy balance, which has allowed both China and Taiwan to prosper. Washington should make plain to both sides that it would actively oppose attempts to change the status quo unilaterally, whether by invasion or declarations of independence. A Chinese invasion of Taiwan would be utterly self-defeating; much of the investment in mainland China comes from Taiwan. A regime that would do this could not be rationally negotiated with.
If regional aggression would trigger containment, we should also be clear that actions short of this, while earning our public displeasure, would not. Once we have drawn a line in the sand, we must observe both sides of the line. Human rights are important, but we cannot construct a post-cold-war grand strategy around the problems of neglected orphans, brave dissidents and cheap labor. The greatest danger is that the United States will adopt the rhetoric of containment and the reality of appeasement, drawing the line so tightly around China that we continually denounce Beijing without being willing to pay the price to oppose its policies.
Any policy toward China will be costly because it is a great power. We can choose to ignore brutalities in Liberia, but China is one of the most important countries in the world, and the most populous. Its abuse of human rights is qualitatively different, affecting the norms and standards that international society observes (or at least pays lip service to). Thus, the moral cost of doing little in the face of China's repression is high. But it pales beside the staggering economic and political costs of challenging a great power. It took 40 years, a worldwide alliance and trillions of dollars to contain and transform the Soviet regime.
Besides, it might not even be necessary; here again realism and idealism meet. Responding to individual human rights abuses is noble but futile. What causes these abuses is a system of government; when that system changes, only then do the abuses lessen irreversibly. And the regime in Beijing will change. It has no ideology that captivates the world, no legitimacy to secure its rule at home. Nowhere in history has a country grown as fast as China without political and social upheaval. This is the strongest reason to adopt a policy of watching and waiting. In 10 years -- perhaps fewer -- there will be a different regime in Beijing.
Great powers are like divas; they enter and exit the stage with great tumult. While the rise of great powers has usually led to terrible wars, there are other examples. The rises of Britain and the United States took place with less global conflict (though the Central Americans and South Asians may not have noticed the calm). And the rise of Germany and Japan after 1945, albeit inside an American security cocoon, suggest another hopeful trend. These happier stories are admittedly fewer in number. But American policy must try, with sticks and carrots, to help Beijing and its neighbors resist the terrible pull of history and make China a secure and responsible great power, deserving of the respect that it will command. That is a prize worthy of a realistic American foreign policy. All else will prove to be tittle-tattle.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Long Island;
New Limit on Assessment Appeals Protested

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

 BODY:
AS demands for property tax-reform grow more heated on Long Island, an amendment to the real-property tax law that took effect Jan. 1 will make it even more difficult for overassessed property owners to get relief.
As a result of the new amendment to the tax law, homeowners and commercial property owners who win an assessment reduction in a small-claims court or State Supreme Court will be barred for three years from filing for an additional reduction unless a major change to value -- such as a fire -- occurs. The moratorium also applies to pretrial settlements. 
 On the flip side, assessors also are barred for three years from increasing assessments unless major improvements or other changes affecting value occur. The law applies to all taxing jurisdictions except New York City.
Bernard Hyman, a tax-appeals lawyer at the Certilman Balin Adler & Hyman law firm in East Meadow, said the measure would have a particularly devasting effect on Long Island.
"This effects Long Island particularly because the tax rates here are so high and because assessing procedures in upstate areas are more up-to-date," he said. "Anybody whose property is in a community where values are declining is going to get hurt immediately by the law because they would be entitled to a further reduction, but won't be allowed to protest."
Property owners who feel they are overassessed initially file a protest with their local board of assessment review. The grievance period in Nassau County was in January. In Suffolk County, it will be from May 1 to May 21.
If relief is denied at that level, owners of owner-occupied one-, two- and three-family houses can elect to file petitions in a Small Claims Assessment Review Court. The filing fee is $25 and owners can represent themselves, though they often turn to tax consultants who charge a percentage of the savings.
All other property owners must take their cases to State Supreme Court, which is a far more costly and time-consuming procedure.
But nowtaking an appeal to small-claims court has a major drawback: The rule still prevails in that court that homeowners can receive no more than a 25 percent reduction in any one year, even if they can show that a house is overassessed by much more.
In some areas of Nassau County, which has not revalued properties since 1938, houses are overassessed by 50 percent or more, according to a recent study by the Nassau Citizens Budget Committee. The same inequities occur in some parts of Suffolk County.
State Senator Joseph Holland, a Rockland County Republican who co-sponsored the new amendment with Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester County Democrat, said the law's intent was to stabilize the tax base.
"What we are hoping to do with the legislation is get a fair settlement and leave it there so we can get some kind of stabilization," said Patrick Kehoe, Senator Holland's counsel.
Under the new amendment, tax appeals brought in State Supreme Court must be settled or brought to trial within two years and eight months. The previous limit was four years, which meant that if a petitioner prevailed taxing jurisdictions immediately faced paying a four-year accumulation of refunds plus interest.
These large settlements "often caused horrendous problems for school districts," Senator Holland said. He added that the law was not intended to hurt homeowners. "I had not heard it would have much impact on homeowners," he said. "The 25 percent limit hadn't come to my attention."
I N the past, homeowners who did not get sufficient relief knew they could file again the following year and get another reduction said Paul M. Henry, president of Tax Reduction Services, a Greenport company that files tax protests on behalf of homeowners.
"Now that right has been taken away by the State Legislature, and that's unconscionable," he said. "And if a hearings officer makes a bad decision, this law means we are stuck with it for three years."
James Pardo, who with his wife, Karen, owns a three-bedroom ranch in Glen Cove, said he was lucky that the law was not in effect when he first protested his taxes. Represented by Mr. Henry's Tax Reduction Services in small claims court, the Pardos have had their assessment reduced twice since 1992. Another petition, filed last year, is still pending.
In 1992, the house was assessed for $385,000. The Pardos won a 20 percent reduction to $308,000. In 1994, they filed another petition and the assessment was further reduced to $250,000. The petition still pending asks for additional relief based on a $230,000 appraisal.
"If I hadn't been allowed to refile in 1994 I would have been paying taxes on a house which was assessed for much more than it is actually worth," Mr. Pardo said. "What they are doing now is taking your legal rights away."
Lawyers say the law also will hurt Long Island's economic recovery and will result in even more clogged court calendars because commercial property owners will no longer be as willing to settle cases.
Commercial values fall when income is reduced, and loss of a tenant is grounds for appealing an assessment. Lowered taxes allow the owner to reduce rents and attract new tenants.
"Commercial owners have to remain competitive, and they now will have to get 100 percent of the tax relief they are entitled to," said Laureen L. Harris, chairwoman of the Nassau County Bar Association committee on tax appeals. "Usually, you can compromise and settle out of court because you can go back, but that flexibility is now removed by this law."
Lawyers say that they will continue to file cases as before. "Right now, we are taking the position that this law is unconstitutional," said Mr. Hyman, the East Meadow lawyer. "If the county makes a motion to dismiss, we will appeal and get our day in court."
The Association of Assessment Consultants, an 18-member trade group of companies that, like Tax Reduction Services, represents homeowners in assessment cases, already is preparing a court challenge to the new law.
"This is a due-process issue," said David G.Gabor, a Garden City lawyer who represents the association. "If a municipality places a value on a property, the homeowner must have a right to address that, and the three-year moratorium breaches that right."
E QUAL protection is another constitutional issue, said Donald Leistman, a partner of the Koeppel Martone Leistman & Herman law firm in Mineola. "It gives some the right to review their assessments in a given year, and not others," he said. "This is a bad bill all around."
But Abe Seldin, the chairman of Nassau County's Board of Assessors, said that although he had some concern that out-of-court settlements on commercial properties would now be more difficult to negotiate, "the general thrust of this law is a good one because it eliminates the constant repetition of filing."
In Nassau, 53,439 protests to assessments were filed in 1993, 76,820 were filed in 1994 and about 66,000 were last year.
Mrs. Harris, the tax-appeals committee chairwoman, pointed to what she described as another problem. Under the new law, municipalities now have the option of refunding tax overpayments through credits against future tax payments.
In upstate communities, tax refunds come out of the school district's budget. On Long Island, the 10 Suffolk towns and Nassau County are responsible for paying refunds. The new law now allows them to shift that burden to the school districts. "It will pit municipalities against school districts," Mrs. Harris said.
Senator Holland said that an amendment already has been proposed that would exempt Long Island school districts from that provision of the new law.

HEADLINE: ON THE MAP;
Honoring a President, the Jersey City Way

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY 

 BODY:
At Lincoln Park in Jersey City, there is an astounding bronze statue of the 16th President, born on Feb. 12, 1809, and fatally shot on April 14, 1865, five days after the Civil War officially ended.
In contrast to the idealized Lincoln in Washington, chiseled by Daniel Chester French with an almost regal bearing and enshrined in grand portico, Jersey City's version is of a mere mortal, and a troubled one at that. This Abraham sits slouching, arms dangling between his knees, his gaze downcast. When it rains, the drops stream down his cheeks. 
 In some ways, the nature of the statue is a reflection of the city itself: troubled by rising taxes and falling property values, high unemployment, and neighborhoods scarred by drugs and violence. It is also a city divided: corporations and young artists and professionals to the east versus the more traditional neighborhoods, industrial sites and blighted areas to the west.
 Dennis Doran, 49, a real estate investor who grew up in this widely diverse city of a quarter-million people, is a member of the Lincoln Association, an institution that dates back six score and 11 years. He spoke before a ceremony at the statue last week.
Q.What's Lincoln's connection to Jersey City?
A.Nothing specific, really; it's just that he was revered by people here. A group of civic leaders and businessmen were appalled by his death, and they resolved to meet every year on his birthday. They began doing that in 1866, and apparently have never missed a year all the way along. So they claim to be the oldest association honoring Lincoln in that manner in the country.
Q.When was the statue erected?
A.The statue was sculpted in 1929 and put up there in 1930. It's called "Seated Lincoln," and it's by James Earle Fraser. He did a lot of public sculptures, but he is most renowned for designing the buffalo nickel.
Q.Can you compare this one to the one in Washington?
A.It's not a very dynamic depiction. The one in Washington is very magisterial. The interesting thing about Lincoln is that he embodies so many different qualities. I mean, he is a very dynamic leader, but he's also a very thoughtful and contemplative guy. It's certainly a more human depiction. I think he looks kind of sad, doesn't he?
Q.About what?
A.Oh, God knows. It was such a blood bath to go through the Civil War. It was a great burden on anybody to be the leader there. And I think it was largely his leadership that brought us through that in one piece, because it very easily could have gone awry.
Q.Why has the association persisted?
A.He's a very inspiring man, a very pivotal figure. Even though he has no direct connection with the people of Jersey City, I think he's inspired the people here.
Q.Is the association's goal simply to preserve his memory?
A.One of the things we've tried to do is stop this trend of reducing everything to the lowest common denominator. Lincoln's Birthday was a big deal, and Washington's Birthday, and then it was all blobbed into Presidents' Day. Well, there are a lot of Presidents, and they're not all equal. So that's been a policy here, to try to restore Lincoln's Birthday to the prominence it once held. And to try to stop the silly caricatures of Lincoln -- you know, you get the white sale in the department store and they have Lincoln wearing all these funny costumes. It's degrading to the guy. And we have written letters and we have been on record regarding the Legislature passing resolutions and things like that. And we bring that to people's attention to keep that stuff to a minimum and to keep him up there on a pedestal. STEVE STRUNSKY

HEADLINE: Coping With the Aftershocks of a Sponsor's Default

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
THAT Friday night five years ago when a van rolled to the curb and half a dozen process servers bearing stacks of 200-page legal papers climbed out still grips the minds of people at the Acropolis, a 16-building co-op near the towers of the Triborough Bridge in Astoria, Queens.
Making their way home from work that crisp March evening, residents of the five-story walkups ringing a slim courtyard on Ditmars Boulevard had no notion that for years those legal papers would hang over their heads, their bank accounts and their sense of security. 
 The Bank of Tokyo, holder of the underlying $25.6-million mortgage on their 617-unit complex, had filed to foreclose -- without warning.
Robert Bass, president of the co-op board, remembers the night the van came, and the nights that followed. "They rang your bell, constantly coming back," Mr. Bass said. "They wanted to make sure they served everybody. My phone was ringing off the wall. People panicked. They thought they would lose their life savings, and be dispossessed on top of it."
They were not alone.
There is no central registry for all the buildings -- and, more poignantly, all the people -- whose financial health was shaken when the bottom dropped out of parts of the co-op market after the boom of the 80's. It was a time when promises went unkept, renters balked at paying for neglected apartments and shareholders stopped paying maintenance; a time when sponsors defaulted and disappeared -- some after pocketing proceeds -- and when banks foreclosed and some buildings even deconverted, leaving residents owing loans and owning nothing.
Now, six years after cracks in the financial underpinnings of many co-op conversions first surfaced,"the vast majority of troubled co-ops have resolved their problems," said Gary Connor, chief of enforcement in the New York State Attorney General's real estate financing bureau. But the financial condition of many co-ops remains, at best, guarded, Mr. Connor said, and new cases regularly arise.
Great pains would be suffered before the Acropolis struggled back to its feet, and its workout would serve as a model for dozens of other troubled co-ops. But residents of 101 Lincoln Road, a 6-story building in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, would never recover: Their co-op has deconverted to a rental building, and savings have been lost.
"In the end, I still owe $60,000 for nothing," said Martin McMichael, former president of the co-op board. "I don't have anything."
The Attorney General's office does not maintain records on the financial difficulties of co-ops. But between 1980 and 1994 in New York State, 11,688 buildings containing 830,833 apartments were either built as, or converted into, co-ops or condominiums.
"We have historically stated that about 10 percent of offering plans that came through from 1980 to the present have shown some type of sponsor-related financial problem or default," Mr. Connor said. That percentage holds true for the 1,850 members of the Council of New York Cooperatives, which only tracks information on its own members.
One of the hardest hit communities during the co-op market collapse was Queens, where Borough President Claire Shulman created a task force to help co-ops work their way out of trouble. Buildings containing about 80,000 apartments were converted in Queens, Mrs. Shulman said, "of which about 20,000 got into some kind of difficulty."
Although there have been few conversions in recent years (31 across the state in 1994 compared with 1,361 in 1987, the peak year), there has been a strengthening in the market for individual apartments -- mostly larger, more expensive units but, in recent months, trickling down to studio and one-bedroom sales, said Alan J. Rogers, managing director of Douglas Elliman, a major brokerage company in Manhattan.
The slight upturn notwithstanding, thousands of co-op owners -- unable to sell or even refinance their individual mortgages -- are still hoping to dig out of the financial hole while not quite comprehending how they got knocked over the edge.
What hit them was a one-two punch to a market that was already out of shape at the opening bell -- a market bloated by overvalued properties purchased with mortgages granted to speculating sponsors by high-risk-taking lenders. The big blows were the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which stifled incentives for outside investors to buy apartments, and the confidence-chilling stock market crash of 1987.
"Looking back," said Michael Finder, a lawyer who has represented numerous co-ops as they struggle for recovery, "it's amazing that everybody had such a myopic view of the economics of New York City in believing that the bubble would expand throughout all the boroughs. There was heavy speculation in neighborhoods where the economy could not possibly support the expectation of expanding gentrification."
There have been earlier co-op waves this century, but they were "user-initiated, rather than by sponsors," said Herbert Marcuse, an urban history professor at Columbia University.
IN the 20's and 30's, "there was a strong ideologically driven move toward cooperative living," the professor said, "and it succeeded. There were a number of buildings converted and others that were built in New York City." But even the best intentions could not survive the Great Depression.
After World War II, another series of co-op conversions and construction, including efforts to build single-family homes in groups, took hold, primarily by people seeking to hold down operating and construction costs.
The most recent co-op wave, Professor Marcuse said, "is a far cry from the original spirit of the cooperative movement, motivated by the financial consequences for the participants rather than any wish to live convivially or communally."
For many owners of rental buildings during the co-op wave of the 80's, the conversions represented a chance to realize the market value of individual apartments in buildings whose earning capacity had long been restricted by the rent-regulation system.
Conversion sponsors obtained bank financing and bought at prices based on the expectation of gradual sales of vacant apartments. But when the market collapsed, the sales never occurred, and the buildings were burdened with excessive debt, sometimes leading to default.
"It was horrendous because the conversions had less to do with the true value of buildings, but rather what the sponsor thought was the maximum value all the apartments could achieve on selling all the apartments," said Stuart Saft, chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives.
Many sponsors, in their conversion plans, would add a wraparound mortgage to the underlying mortgage, creating additional capital for themselves and adding debt to the resident-shareholders who purchased the individual apartments. Tenants, sometimes, did not have the power to block the wraparound or, often, did not raise objections because they were more interested in buying apartments at low insider prices and then selling for a quick profit.
BEFORE 1986, a sponsor could expect to sell blocks of his unsold apartments to other investors -- a syndicate of doctors, for example -- who saw short-term tax benefits and long-term value in eventual sales to outsiders. But the 1986 Tax Reform Act eliminated most of those deductions, and, in time, a significant portion of the market.
The following a year, 1987, the stock market crashed, with the Dow Jones average dropping from 2,722 in August to 1,739 in October -- and by 508 points on Black Monday, Oct. 19, alone. "Wall Street, the banks, law firms began making a lot of layoffs," Mr. Finder said, "not just white-collar workers earning $200,000, but support staff, a lot of middle-class folks making $35,000. The ones who buy apartments in Queens."
Sponsors started applying for, and getting, end loans -- the mortgages for individual apartments -- against the value of their unsold apartments. Often, the sponsor got a loan based on an estimate of one-third of what the apartment's price would be when it was someday sold to an outsider, even though the apartment was still occupied by a rent-regulated tenant. The rent the sponsor received would be significantly less than the maintenance and debt service the sponsor had to pay.
"Each step the banks took was stranger than the last," Mr. Saft said. "They lent far more against the building than the building was worth and they lent far more against the apartment than the apartments were worth. All they saw was short-term dollars."
By 1989, because of the contraction in New York's economy, sales plummeted. Out of their pockets, sponsors had to pay the shortfall in maintenance on the apartments they held, and also the debt service on their end loans, and on the mortgages for the buildings themselves. They began to default.
It was on the evening of March 22, 1991, that the van from the Bank of Tokyo pulled up to the Acropolis in the heart of a thriving commercial district near the el in Astoria -- a complex built in 1927 on a foundation of bricks fashioned from the ballast of trading ships. "This place is what New York is all about," said Donald Novitt, the lawyer for the co-op corporation, "a regular United Nations, salt-of-the-earth working people."
A group headed by Marsar Realty was the sponsor at the time of conversion in August 1988. It looked like a good deal. "People lined up in the rain to purchase," Mr. Novitt said.
But "the co-op was doomed from the start," said Mr. Bass, the board president, "unless it could restructure the mortgage." The original loan was for $25.6 million. At the time of the final workout the property would be appraised at $12 million.
During the first year after conversion, Mr. Bass said, "many operating costs were absorbed by the sponsor" -- a tactic used to keep the initial maintenance low to attract buyers -- "and these hidden costs would come back to be billed to the shareholders."
Hidden costs often constituted one of several time bombs written into offering plans that potential buyers either failed to notice or chose to ignore because they were more interested in low apartment prices than riskier elements in the conversion, according to real-estate lawyers.
In some cases, sponsors sold the apartments but retained building amenities, like the garage or the commercial space, siphoning off revenues that would have subsidized the property. Some plans included "dancing interest," adjustable mortgages with low start-up rates followed by walloping increases.
"In 1989," Mr. Bass said, "we woke up one morning and found ourselves with a $100 maintenance increase and the possibility of another $100 in six months."
Marsar had retained 65 percent of the units and, therefore, controlled the board, a common situation that often left resident shareholders cut off from vital information. "Too late," Mr. Bass said, "we started finding out that we were millions of dollars in arrears to the bank and to many vendors. He had stopped paying."
AFTER months of negotiations, a deal was struck in which the sponsor agreed to auction his units and relinquish control of the board. Meanwhile, negotiations to restructure the mortgage were under way with the bank.
The auction, held in October 1990, "did not go the way we hoped," Mr. Novitt said. "Over 400 units were sold, but 350 went to one individual, Daniel Weinberger, for $1 each, and those had rent-regulated tenants." For his first two months, Mr. Weinberger didn't pay maintenance, Mr. Novitt said, "and we sued him." Mr. Weinberger filed a countersuit. The Bank of Tokyo wanted out, and the van arrived.
The Acropolis had one distinct advantage -- political clout. City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, who represents Astoria, had once been the lawyer for the tenants' association. And Borough President Shulman was not sitting idly by while, she said, "we were getting frantic calls from young couples who had invested their last nickel in their first real estate deal."
And so a workout process began that has served as a model for dozens of co-ops. Mrs. Shulman and Mr. Vallone called a meeting and "told all the parties that there will be no talk of bankruptcy, that an amicable resolution had to be reached," Mr. Novitt said.
Thirty meetings and 20 months later, the workout was in place: For $100,000, Mr. Weinberger transferred his 350 units to a holding company formed by the Bank of Tokyo. The bank reduced the mortgage from $25.6 million to $17.6 million, leading to a 17 percent maintenance decrease. The bank benefited because its shortfall between maintenance and rents on the individual apartments it owned narrowed.
But in October 1994, there was a glitch. The bank tried to sell the mortgage, at a discount, to a private investor. The co-op balked, and Mrs. Shulman called another meeting at which, Mr. Novitt said, "Peter Vallone went ballistic on the Bank of Tokyo."
The parties appealed to the Community Preservation Corporation, a consortium of 57 banks and insurance companies that finances housing. "What we did, and it worked beautifully in this instance," said Michel D. Lappin, the corporation president, "is purchase the underlying debt at a price that eliminated any operating deficits from the management of the building so that even if there was never another unit sold it could still pay for its normal operations. Then we organized some of our member banks to do the end loans on new sales."
Since the Acropolis, Mr. Lappin said, that formula has been applied to about 5,000 units in 25 projects, with 21 more projects currently in the pipeline.
Under the final workout, with the property reappraised at $12 million, the underlying loan was reduced from $17.6 million to $9.5 million, with a mortgage granted by the Community Preservation Corporation paying off the bank. The bank was able to write off $14 million in losses.
With political figures urging it on, the State of New York Mortgage Agency agreed, in a record three months, to insure the underlying loan. And when the deal closed last April, all of the apartments were transferred to the co-op. "Now we were in control of our destiny," Mr. Bass said.
EIGHT apartments have been sold since. "Units that went for $1 at the auction are now selling for $25,000 to $40,000," Mr. Bass said. "For the first time ever, the co-op is operating in the black. And people are breathing easier."
There would be no such help for the people at 101 Lincoln Road in Flatbush.
The sponsor for the 82-unit building was Aaron Ziegelman, a converter who, by 1989, had taken over 140 buildings, including two around the block from 101 Lincoln Road.
The residents of 101 Lincoln were "West Indian, African, hard-working middle-class people," said Mr. McMichael, who became president of the board after Mr. Ziegelman defaulted. The building later deconverted with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation taking title.
"A lot of these people left, simply went back home," said Mr. McMichael, "because they figured, 'I'm not going to let the American government take what little I have left.' "To the underlying $1.45-million mortgage, granted by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddy Mac, Mr. Ziegelman had added a $2 million wraparound. Twenty apartments were sold, three to insiders.
Mr. Ziegelman rehabilitated the sold apartments, but those occupied by rent-regulated tenants remained in dire disrepair. "We did everything to fight the plan," said Joan Ann Charles, the lawyer for the tenants, "but we were told by the Attorney General's office that the sponsor's only duty was to disclose the defects in his offering plan; they had no power to make him fix the defects."
Retaining 75 percent of the units, Mr. Ziegelman controlled the board. "He set up this dummy board," said Mr. McMichael. "Most of us were not clear on the laws, the rules on running a co-op. He was like a ghost. We tried to get him to call meetings. You could never reach him by phone."
Soon, rent-regulated tenants stopped paying. "Some people couldn't shower because their walls were falling down," Mr. McMichael said. "They had legitimate reasons not to pay."
Two months after conversion, Mr. Ziegelman stopped paying maintenance on his 62 apartments. But it would be a year before the shareholders found out. Robert Hartman, a lawyer hired to represent the shareholders after Mr. Ziegelman defaulted, said a company controlled by the sponsor was the building's managing agent. "If an independent agent had been there, perhaps some alarm bells would have gone off," Mr. Hartman said.
When Mr. Ziegelman sold someone an apartment "he would say, 'You can go to the bank or we will do the end loan for you,' " Mr. McMichael said. "Nothing wrong with that; it's American enterprise." Then Mr. Ziegelman would sell the loan to a bank.
"From those who got their own loan, he got the $60,000, $100,000, whatever the price of the apartment, right there," Mr. McMichael said. But when Mr. Ziegelman financed the end loan, he would receive a small down payment from the buyer and a promissory note for the balance of the loan. Then, when he sold those end loans to a bank, even at a discount, "he still made another $20,000, $30,000," Mr. McMichael said. "All he was interested in was getting the money and running."
Mr. Ziegelman sees it differently. "All I know is I lost all my money there," he said in a brief telephone interview. "When the trouble arose, the buyers defaulted because of the problems in the building. When the rents collected were less than the maintenance and the whole thing collapsed, that's the problem. No one accused me of doing anything that was improper. It was like a chain reaction."
In March 1992, with Freddy Mac about to foreclose and auction off the property, the co-op filed for bankruptcy. Mr. Ziegelman also defaulted on the two neighboring buildings.
Most of the following year was spent searching for a "white knight" -- someone willing to invest in the unsold apartments while negotiations continued with Freddy Mac to restructure the mortgage. A parallel plan, Mr. Hartman said, was to transfer the shareholders from 101 Lincoln Road and those from one or both of the neighboring co-ops into one building, creating at least one viable co-op and two rentals. Neither plan materialized.
And in early 1993, Freddy Mac had the bankruptcy stay on foreclosure lifted, with ownership reverting to the F.D.I.C., and the building eventually deconverting into a rental.
"It was so much stress," said Mr. McMichael. "I was a newlywed. We just didn't know whether we were going to have a home from one week to the next. I was 21 years old, looking at $60,000 of debt. In the end, I still owe $60,000 for nothing.
"I'm trying to build a new life and constantly looking over my shoulder."
The injustice is real and unnecessary, said Mr. Lappin of the Community Preservation Corporation. "It's inherently unfair for the individual," he said. "The community loses good and affordable home ownership. And it's incumbent on all of us -- government and the banking community -- to change all of that, because there are solid solutions to avert such a bad outcome."

HEADLINE: Bill Linder And His City Of Hope

BYLINE: By BARBARA STEWART 

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
KENDELE BASKERVILLE, 20, in a navy-blue security-guard uniform, is a New Community man. He got his job through the New Community Corporation. He works in a supermarket run as a partnership between Pathmark and New Community in Newark's beleaguered Central Ward. He is getting a high school diploma with the help of New Community staff members. His uniform is made by New Community's fashion institute, its green NCC logo -- on fleets of vans, the front of the monthly newsletter, apartment buildings and restaurant menus -- symbolizing hope and new beginnings.
For Mr. Baskerville -- an eighth-grade dropout, a father at 13, a thief who has done jail time -- and tens of thousands of other poor or troubled people here, New Community has become an island in the bleak Central Ward landscape that was nearly flattened in five days of deadly rioting, arson and looting in 1967. 
 Today the Central Ward is still poor, with deteriorating housing and high rates of crime and disease. But out of the wreckage of the old city came the outline of another: the vision of a tough parish priest, Msgr. William J. Linder, who saw something palliative, something better: a new community.
And the corporation he established is just that: a new community that began with the big talk and far-fetched daydreams of poor people and a parish priest in a Catholic church basement in the mid-60's. Like farmers raising a neighbor's barn, people in impoverished areas throughout the country are uniting, applying for loans and grants, and supervising the building or renovation of their own development. In the 1960's, when New Community began, there were only a handful of these neighborhood-based developments. Now there are roughly 2,000, ranging from a few renovated houses to major complexes with thousands of apartments and stores.
"Typically they start with people meeting on a stoop," said Paul S. Grogan, president of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, which supports such neighborhood redevelopment projects. Banks and foundations, not Federal agencies, lend most of the money.
New Community was one of the first, biggest, most successful -- and most urgently needed. In achieving its goals, Monsignor Linder sidestepped or ran over politicians who opposed his work or bureaucrats who tried to slow him down. When Federal housing officials were slow to issue a permit for a new homeless shelter, he broke ground anyway. When they complained, he called Jack Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, for support. When Newark refused to issue the shelter a certificate of occupancy, he put up a Christmas tree, called reporters and asked Mayor Sharpe James if he wanted to be Scrooge or Santa Claus.
High-handed? Perhaps. But few have criticized the scope or the quality of New Community's achievements. It has 3,000 apartments and town houses in 18 complexes. Its day-care centers care for 700 children, including the homeless, children of battered women and babies with AIDS. Its services have been sought for running a day-care program for the headquarters employees of Blue Cross-Blue Shield of New Jersey. It runs housing for the elderly and for homeless families. It has a full-care nursing home, a medical clinic, job-training and job-placement programs. It has 102 security guards, headed by a retired captain of the New Jersey State Police. In a neighborhood without banks, it established a credit union and installed automated teller machines. It has parks with sculptures and restaurants offering everything from doughnuts to Cajun dinners with wine and live jazz.
And after years of attending to Newark's needs, New Community is starting to expand its housing and social programs outside the Central Ward and Essex County.
As urban poverty worsens and an increasing number of children are supported on welfare, the self-help nature of New Community, replicated many times and unencumbered by the conflicts and bureaucracy that can strangle government programs, appears to be an answer.
In the years he has led the building of New Community, Monsignor Linder has acquired opposition, jealousy and praise, not to mention a $356,000 MacArthur Award for extraordinary accomplishment.
"He's had the tenacity and wisdom to stay with the people and attain their full support for good works," Senator Bill Bradley said in an interview. "He's very tough with any level of government or private sector. Everyone knows him as a man of great integrity. It's the old story -- a man of truth makes those who don't speak truth back down."
 
A CITY BOY
Learning the Ropes
Monsignor Linder -- who introduces himself as Bill -- is a short, pudgy-faced, unprepossessing-looking man of 59. He is short, his neck is encircled by a black clerical collar, his white hair wavy. "His hair used to be jet black," said Joseph Chaneyfield, one of New Community's founders. "That's not age. We did that to him."
Monsignor Linder has lived in the Central Ward for 33 years, since he was a young assistant priest at Queen of Angels, his first parish. He became a priest to help people, but it took him a while to learn how.
"In the 60's he wasn't the expert he was now," said former Gov. Thomas H. Kean. "He had immense good will but he didn't know much" about urban renewal.
"I thought he was a very naive suburbanite," said Mary Smith, founder of Babyland, whose child-care centers are an integral part of New Community. "He had preconceived ideas of what we were like."
Actually, he grew up in Jersey City, not the suburbs. His father was a gas company supervisor, a behind-the-scenes volunteer for state politicians. Dinner-table talk was of local and state politics -- who was efficient, who was corrupt. "I went to the Hudson County university of politics," he said.
Political savvy would come in handy. When New Community was only an architect's model and Babyland had its first 26 children, a Short Hills pediatrician volunteered to examine them. Monsignor Linder regularly gave messages and requests to the doctor to give to another patient's father, Assemblyman Tom Kean.
Before entering Immaculate Heart Seminary near Ramsey, Monsignor Linder studied engineering at Seton Hall University. "Engineering can be kind of remote," he said. "A parish priest can work with people on a different level."
He continued to read and take courses in urban studies, architecture and city planning. "I've always liked cities," he said, in a profound understatement.
Some of his first parishioners became his lifelong partners in New Community. Mrs. Smith and Joe Chaneyfield belonged to Queen of Angels, to which he was assigned in 1963. Mrs. Smith's husband had lost his job and with four young children, she could not get outside work. They fell behind on their rent and had to move into the sprawling Scudder public housing project.
From the day they moved in, the Smiths had to walk up to their 12th-floor apartment, because the broken elevator was never fixed. Nor was there hot water. Upset as she was raising children in such a place, it was at Scudder that Mrs. Smith learned to lead. She organized other tenants and was elected president of the tenants' association. She got to know her neighbors' problems -- no jobs, no day care, the ever-present danger of fire.
Most of all, she discovered what she already knew from her own experience -- mothers could not get jobs without access to day care and would not take jobs without being sure their children were safe and well cared for. At the time, day care centers were rare, especially for the poor. Eventually, with help from women organized in suburban churches, who also understood the demands of child rearing and who formed a group called Operation Housewife to support her, Mrs. Smith opened the first Babyland.
Joseph Chaneyfield was a burly factory worker who went on to become president of a union representing maintenance workers.
"Those laborers were tough, but Joe could rally people in a minute," Monsignor Linder said. Mr. Chaneyfield's power was to be crucial in establishing New Community. After the 1967 riots -- though Monsignor Linder took over when truck drivers refused to enter the Central Ward, delivering bread, milk and Spam to families huddled at home -- many black leaders opposed the white priest.
"They'd say, 'You do the work, he gets the credit,' " he continued. "Well, when you're talking about the monsignor, you're talking about Joe Chaneyfield. New Community is about all of us."
 
GETTING ATTENTION
'It's Faith'
After Sunday Mass, Father Linder, then the new assistant priest, mixed with people in the church basement, trying out ways of drawing attention to the needs of the Central Ward, ways that were usually blunt, loud and liable to upset church and political leaders.
"We won't sell our souls," he said. "You have to say what you think." As a young priest sparring with church hierarchy or a venerable monsignor criticizing the the mayor, he speaks out.
Mr. Chaneyfield, 68, sitting at his regular table in the New Community's World of Foods cafeteria near the Pathmark, recalls with glee one of the many times Monsignor Linder said what he thought, with vigor.
The story centered on the Archbishop of Newark, Thomas Boland, who in the mid-60's moved from Newark into a large gated-and-guarded house in the Llewellyn Park section of West Orange. Many people raised their eyebrows at a church leader deserting Newark for luxury. But Father Linder was the only one to get a hold of an aerial map and plot to invade his boss's home.
"It was a beautiful, nice, sunshiny day," Mr. Chaneyfield says. He and Father Linder and 40 others slipped past the security guards and raised pickets and voices out on the Archbishop's lawn. The protest made the front page of The Star-Ledger. Shortly after, the Archbishop moved back to Newark. But for a time, Father Linder was refused a parish assignment.
Years later the subsequent Archbishop, Peter Gerety, made a point of touring Newark with Father Linder and, after getting calls and letters from members of Queen of Angels and his later parish, St. Rose of Lima, elevating him to monsignor.
It was after the riots that Father Linder saw the limitation of protests, the necessity of creating concrete things: a safe, secure city with roomy, private houses, day care, and jobs with good pay and benefits. The necessity of creating the impossible, without money or power. He recruited neighborhood backers to commit themselves for 20 years -- the first New Community board of directors.
"People used to call us crazy," Mr. Chaneyfield said. "Some black ministers laughed at us: 'You think the state is going to give you, black boy, and a German priest not even head of a parish money?' Well, I've lived to see it."
"There's the religious element," Monsignor Linder said, explaining why he never doubted New Community would happen. "It's faith. Not belief, but faith meaning trust. If God's behind it it's going to happen."
 
MAKING IT HAPPEN
Seed Money and Moxie
"The genius of Bill Linder is 'start small.' Do something tangible, very modest, and build on that," said Mr. Grogan of LISC. "It's the paradox of small steps." Newark was devastated physically, economically but also psychologically. People don't ever see victories. With small concrete victories you build the morale of the city. You rebuild hope. Sources of support -- private companies -- say, 'Boy, this can really happen.' "
With $13,000 in seed money from the state, Monsignor Linder hired experts and arranged field trips to teach future residents to design their houses. He bought two acres of largely vacant land with $100,000 raised with the help of state Jaycees.
When a corporate president wanted to donate $40,000, Monsignor Linder asked for -- and received -- a $200,000 loan and the assistance of the company's top lawyer and engineer. Six years later, people moved into the 120 terraced low-rise apartments surrounding a central playground in 1975.
They had designed these apartments themselves. Since then, seven other housing complexes have been built or renovated. Much of the money comes from selling tax credits the organization earns by building low-income housing. The profitable new Pathmark, which opened in 1990 -- the first supermarket to open in the Central Ward in 20 years -- is jointly owned by the supermarket company and New Community. Before, residents had to take the bus three miles to buy groceries at a supermarket or pay much higher prices for lower quality and meager selection at local bodegas.
As New Community grows, Newark politicians become increasingly uneasy. The burned-out neighborhood is becoming a political force. A word from Monsignor Linder or other New Community leaders has packed City Council chambers and could swing votes. Many city politicians viewed Gayle Chaneyfield, a recently elected Councilwoman (and Mr. Chaneyfield's daughter), as the New Community's first candidate. Ms. Chaneyfield said New Community has long been "a Switzerland, not involved with city politics." When she decided to run -- a decision not influenced by anybody at New Community, she said -- she was roundly supported by members of the group. Other candidates used that support "as a weapon," she said, and went on: "I'm being supported by a nonprofit that's done so much. Only in Newark would that be an albatross around my neck."
Slamming New Community has become "a banner for local politicians," she said. The fear is that New Community is too big and independent, "a giant willing to crush the City of Newark," she said. "They're a thorn in the side of the city government because they remind the government this is the job they should be doing, the services they should be providing."
Nor does Monsignor Linder bother to placate skittish city leaders.
"The city's pretty ineffective," he said, in a typical comment. "I question their competency. The Mayor clashes with us. He calls us arrogant. Very well. Leave us alone. There's certain things we need from the city. We want them to cooperate with us."
Mr. James denies that there is tension. When the city recently threatened to shut off water to New Community until it received past-due payments of $2.6 million, it was simply treating residents like all others. "We're glad you have housing," he said. "Now you got to pay your water bills." Monsignor Linder denied owing that much and eventually New Community settled by paying a fraction.
"I'm proud of him," Mr. James said, of Monsignor Linder. "I hug and embrace them for the great good they've done the city. The James administration has been a partnership with them and we're proud of that. Sometimes they tend to forget that. Some people say we're scared of New Community. But government is here to stay -- elected by the people, keepers of the treasure."
Hearing of this, Monsignor Linder snorted. "I wish," he said.
Scholars of urban development who have been watching are impressed -- they only wonder if New Community could be duplicated in places that don't have a Monsignor Linder.
"Not a lot of places that are severely distressed blossom like that," said Nicholas Lehman, an urban development scholar and author of books on the subject. "It has a huge range of activities and a lot of stuff -- buildings, programs, schools, stores. It has risen to the level where you can say the essential character of the neighborhood has changed. But its success if not easily replicable. The real model is that Linder's a genius. And there aren't that many Monsignor Linders in the world."

HEADLINE: LOOKING AHEAD;
Three Plans Later, How a Region Has (and Hasn't) Changed

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
When the Regional Plan Association introduced its third long-range plan for the metropolitan area last week, it sparked a debate among officials and civic leaders in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut about just how many of the goals were realistic. As the debate continues, it is likely to center on how successful the states were in adopting recommendations that the research group put forth in two previous reports, published in 1929 and in 1968.
In both instances, government officials in New Jersey and elsewhere seized on the most straightforward recommendations. In particular, they paid close attention to suggestions for expanding transportation networks and preserving open space. But all three states were slower to take the association's advice on more complex, sensitive issues like social policy, taxation and urban revitalization. Addressing problems in these areas would require a well-coordinated joint effort on the part of government, business, civic groups and the housing, education and health care sectors. 
 Bill Shore, a senior fellow at the Regional Plan Association who has spent 35 years there, said the 1929 report had the greatest impact on transportation planning. Since city residents were starting their exodus to the suburbs when it was published, it provided a blueprint for the three states to build an interconnected network of highways, bridges and tunnels. It also recommended a tristate railway system that never came to fruition because of the Depression. (The idea has not gone away, though -- a similar goal is included in the new plan.)
For New Jersey, the 1929 plan recommended major highways in areas where the Garden State Parkway, Route 287 and a number of other roads were later built. But it is unclear whether their construction was a direct result of the plan.
"Certainly there was an enormous amount of highway construction during the Depression," said James W. Hughes, dean of the Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. "But New Jersey had already built a skeletal framework in the 1920's, before the regional plan came out."
The first report also recommended local planning and zoning standards to prevent congestion and sprawl, many of which were adopted by New Jersey's municipalities between the 1920's and the 1960's. By the late 60's, most municipalities had also developed master plans similar to what was recommended in the 1929 report.
While the 1929 plan was the work of a small group of powerful business executives, including the uncle of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 1968 plan drew on discussions at hundreds of community meetings and input from civic leaders in the three states. Mr. Hughes of Rutgers said that plan focused more on social issues than economic and transportation concerns because it was produced in an era of social activism.
"There was a real revolt against physical plans because of the tenor of the times," he said. "In that era, there was much more of a concern that citizen groups be included in the planning process."
Acknowledging that New Jersey residents had moved far beyond the business hubs of Newark and Trenton, the 1968 plan suggested focusing on a number of smaller cities that could be developed as "metropolitan centers" where offices, shops, colleges, hospitals and theaters would be concentrated.
"Where offices, shopping, health facilities and colleges scatter, cultural institutions may not be established at all," the plan warned, "and all the activities will be lower quality than could have been supported if they were grouped."
The plan pointed to Bergen County as an example of such sprawl, and suggested that New Jersey focus its efforts on cities like New Brunswick, Hackensack and Morristown. Mr. Shore of the Regional Plan Association, who wrote the 1968 plan, said that New Brunswick benefited the most from its recommendations. Shortly after the plan was published, he said, Johnson & Johnson built its headquarters there.
"It's not all we conceived of, but it's certainly better than what would have happened in New Brunswick without our plan," Mr. Shore said.
On the other hand, he said, efforts to revitalize downtown Paterson failed. And there were disappointments in other cities.
"We won a lot of battles, but we lost the war," he said. "We couldn't carry out most of these plans on the local level without strong, ongoing local support."
While most urban renewal plans for New Jersey did not come to pass, Mr. Shore said the 1968 plan did inspire the state to preserve several areas as parklands. Based on specific recommendations, he said, New Jersey created Wawayanda State Park in Sussex County, Round Valley Recreation Area in Hunterdon County, Spruce Run Recreation Area in Hunterdon County and Island Beach State Park in Ocean County. It also made the public beach at Sandy Hook part of the Gateway National Recreation Area, the first national park in an urban area, he said.

As Small Airports Struggle, Local Governments Start Investing

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: LAKEWOOD

 BODY:
Like many small private airports in New Jersey, Lakewood Airport has been scraping by for years, making do with a taxiway that's pockmarked and gravelly, a beacon that hasn't worked for eight years and runway lights that flicker at 25 watts.
But this month the airport got a new, inexperienced owner with big plans to make substantial improvements: Lakewood Township itself. 
 "The airport has been here a long time, it provides a service to residents and businesss, and it's a community resource that shouldn't go by the wayside," said Gregory C. Fehrenbach, the township manager.
Lakewood is not alone in its thinking. Around the state, a growing number of municipalities are interested in buying privately owned airports within their borders, or are in the process of buying them. In each case, the goals are similar: to lift the local economy, to prevent airport land from being gobbled up by developers and to help relieve air-traffic congestion in the region.
Some people are wary of the trend. They say the transfer of airports from private to public hands goes against the current push to privatize, and could be construed as a government bailout for struggling airport owners.
"When a municipality takes something like that over, they're very bad at running things and managing things that privatization should manage," said Samuel Perelli, chairman of the United Taxpayers of New Jersey, a private advocacy group. "Here we are with school systems that we're trying to privatize, services in these schools, and now we're going in the opposite direction with the airports."
But others say the involvement of municipalities is beneficial to all parties.
In the last five years, air traffic in the state has increased about 10 percent, even though there are fewer places to land. New Jersey has lost eight airports in the last decade, 58 since 1952. And 35 of the state's 51 airports open for public use are in private hands -- one of the highest ratios in the country -- and many are struggling to stay afloat, said John S. Penn, executive director of the New Jersey Division of Aeronautics.
There is nothing to stop airport owners from selling their properties to the highest bidder, like a real estate developer. But to preserve the number of "reliever" airports that could siphon smaller planes from major airports, the Federal Aviation Administration has offered to put up 90 percent of the money to help a public entity acquire a private airport, with the remaining 10 percent paid by the municipality, the state or even the current owner. The money, which would help pay for repairs, safety improvements and maintenance, would come not from additional taxes but from a reallocation of existing Federal transportation funds, Mr. Penn said.
In Lakewood's case, the owners, a group of private investors, were interested in selling because the 192-acre airport wasn't generating much profit. In stepped the township, which determined that it could easily afford to lose the $40,000 the private owners pay in property taxes. It plans to allow commercial development on 30 acres on airport property, and the State Department of Transportation and the the private owners will pay Lakewood's 10 percent of the $8.9 million purchase price.
Now the municipality is looking for a management company to operate the airport, a renovated version of which Mayor Jerome Greenberg hopes will include a restaurant as well as improved services for the flight school students and charter passengers who pass through the trailerlike terminal.
"The airport is definitely underutilized, so this is a major economic development tool and a terrific investment," said Mr. Fehrenbach, who manages a township that was once a winter resort but now counts on industrial parks to spur its revival. "It's sort of like buying a $8.9 million zero-coupon with no money down."
Other communities are in early stages of airport takeovers. On Tuesday, Lincoln Park introduced an ordinance to spend $5,000 on a study of a possible purchase. In West Milford, the economic development committee has recommended that the township spend $10,000 for a similar study for Greenwood Lake Airport, whose current owners, the Lembo family, want to sell.
And in Somerset County, Hillsborough Township is evaluating a study on buying Kupper Airport, whose owners are in bankruptcy. The 100-acre airport could serve as an anchor of the township's corporate zone.
There has not been much opposition to these plans, other than objections raised by people who didn't like the airports in the first place because of noise and traffic.
Still, airport owners are cautious. These are, after all, tough times in a business saddled with increasing equipment, insurance and fuel costs, and tighter regulatory requirements.
"As a path of last resort, it's great when the state says, 'We will guarantee the sale,' " said Bob Bogan, president of Aero New Jersey, which represents the state's airport owners. "But we are concerned that the state will direct all their attention to the acquisition of airports versus devoting a substantial amount of their money toward safety projects at existing airports."
But owners and aviation officials say the municipalities seem the best option to save the airports. "I can't see any more airports being built," said Mr. Penn. "If you don't preserve what you've got, you're going to end up with the same thing that happened with the railroads."

HEADLINE: IN BRIEF;
More Buses, not Trains, For Route 9 Corridor

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
After two years of intense debate, New Jersey Transit last week scuttled plans to extend commuter rail service to Freehold and Lakewood, choosing to provide more bus service and more road improvements along the Route 9 corridor. The reasons, officials said, were money and local opposition.
Increased bus service, like connections between Route 9 and the Garden State Parkway near Exit 123 in Sayreville, would cost $67 million. Rail service from Lakewood to Monmouth Junction would run $260 million, and $129 million from Lakewood to Red Bank. Meanwhile, the projected number of daily bus riders would hit 20,000 by 2010; the number of train riders would reach only 7,400. 
 Lakewood residents had hoped commuter rail would spur economic development in their township. But residents of South Brunswick, Monroe Township and Jamesburg were vociferously opposed, saying rail service would be too expensive and too close to homes.
Rail advocates said they were disappointed, especially in light of last week's study by the Regional Plan Association concluding that the New York metropolitan region faces major economic decline if mass transit links are not developed fully. DAVID W. CHEN

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Toyota RAV4;
A Cute Brute Rocks to an MTV Beat

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
A FRIEND'S daughter bounded into their kitchen and asked which family vehicle she could have for the day: the luxury sedan, the sport utility vehicle, or, heaven forbid, the mini-van.
"Yes!" she exclaimed, rejoicing, as her mother tossed over the keys to their hulking Ford Explorer. 
 Sport utilities like the Explorer are increasingly the vehicles of choice among young drivers. But until recently, young adults without a trust fund could afford few of these vehicles. Along with the basic Jeep Wrangler, the Geo Tracker, sold by Chevrolet, and its twin, the Suzuki Sidekick, had the market pretty much to themselves.
More auto makers have recognized that low-priced sport utilities -- by that, I mean those under $20,000 -- represent a golden opportunity to lure first-time buyers to their folds, so more offerings are on the way. These include a revised Kia Sportage, coming later this year; a new Wrangler for 1997; a Honda Civic-based model called the CR-V, which is being displayed at auto shows, and possible car-based offerings from Pontiac and Ford in the more distant future.
Setting the standard by which all will be measured is the Toyota RAV4, short for "recreational active vehicle with four-wheel drive," which began arriving in American showrooms last month. (And, logic be damned, the two-wheel-drive version is not called the RAV2.)
Since its introduction in Japan and in Europe in 1994, Toyota's small sport utility has enjoyed substantial sales success. In fact, a shortage of assembly capacity delayed the RAV4's American debut. Toyota is virtually guaranteed a similarly strong response in the United States, where the market seems ready for a vehicle like the RAV4.
 In the grocery store checkout line, a cherubic-faced baby bundled in a blue snowsuit smiled at me. I couldn't resist pinching his pudgy cheek. Outside, as I walked toward the pint-sized RAV4, I felt the same urge. It's so darn cute. Too cute, some guys who saw it said, derisively calling it a "chick mobile" -- a car only a young woman would drive. But once behind the wheel, even the macho men were generally won over.
Indeed, the RAV4 attracted considerable interest from women, especially young ones, during my test drive. (Geo Tracker owners are 59 percent female and mostly under 30, according to Chevrolet.)
At a trendy music and video superstore, three women in their early 20's stared so intently at the RAV4 that they nearly walked smack into their GMC Jimmy. Another woman, driving a Toyota Land Cruiser, stopped us in the supermarket parking lot to ask what we were driving.
Compared with the Jimmy and the Land Cruiser, the RAV4 is puny. I was especially struck by its diminutive size as I searched for the four-door test model hidden by much larger vehicles in the mall parking lot. And the two-door version is 16 inches shorter.
The four-door RAV4's wheelbase, at 94.9 inches, is shorter than that of the Geo Tracker/Suzuki Sidekick, and closer to that of the Jeep Wrangler. In overall length, the RAV4, at 162 inches, is a few inches longer than the Tracker/Sidekick and the Kia Sportage. But the RAV4 is shorter than the Jeep Cherokee, at 167 inches.
The RAV4's petite size and smooth lines, a stark contrast to its boxy competitors, give it a friendly look. Adding to its baby-cute appearance is body cladding of high-strength plastic that surrounds the RAV4's bottom like a diaper -- from the front bumper, around the sides and across its back end -- to guard against stone chips. The RAV4 carries its spare tire on its rear door, which is hinged and opens like a regular car door, making loading a snap.
The RAV4 comes in a variety of youthful colors with hip names like "purple storm," "confetti blue metallic" and "Sequoia green metallic." The tested model was "Prussian red pearl," a.k.a. maroon.
Because it is car-based -- many of its components came from the parts bins for defunct All-Trac versions of the Camry and Celica -- the RAV4 is a cinch to board. The low step-up makes it easy for children to climb in and out, which isn't the case for most sport utilities.
Once seated, the driver and passengers sit tall, an attribute that sport utility fans, particularly women, say they like, since they feel they have a greater command of the road. The front seats are adjustable buckets that fitted every size person who sat behind the wheel. I could comfortably adjust the seat close enough to the pedals for my short frame, while tall, lanky types with long torsos noted that they had ample headroom. The split rear seat is a bench for three passengers, or it can be reclined backward or folded forward for added cargo space.
The RAV4's cuteness doesn't extend to the functional interior. The materials are durable, from the patterned fabric seats to the matte-finished plastic, and one can imagine hosing down the inside after a day at the beach or on the trail.
The instrument panel and center dash are logically laid out, for the most part. My sole complaint was that the speedometer, often used in light of my recent history of speeding tickets, is far to the left of the instrument panel, and its numbers are small and hard to read. The less-used tachometer, with large numbers, is directly in the driver's line of vision through the steering wheel.
Storage is generous throughout. The front doors have small pockets suitable for compact disks. The door to the cargo bay has briefcase-size pouches. The area behind the back seat is big enough for a couple of large suitcases and some duffel bags.
Where the RAV4 excels in its class is in its ride and drive performance. Unlike most of its competitors, which are generally built on the chassis of rear-drive trucks, the RAV4 begins with the front-wheel drive and many components of a car. That results in nimble handling, responsive steering, good stability even at top highway speeds, and a ride as comfortable as most small sedans'. But the interior suffers from excessive road noise, which reverberates through the cabin.
The RAV4 would make a great beach buggy, and with four-wheel drive it could probably handle less challenging off-road trails. But it will clearly be used mainly around town, and it is ideally suited for that.
The RAV4's two-liter four-cylinder is a modified version of the Camry's base engine. With 120 horsepower, the RAV4 provides peppy performance with good fuel economy: 22 miles a gallon in town, 27 on the highway. The tested model came with the standard five-speed manual transmission; a four-speed automatic is optional, but only on the four-door, and I highly recommend the stick shift for maximum fun.
Four-wheel anti-lock brakes are optional. Other safety features include dual air bags.
Also optional is full-time four-wheel drive, which will raise the price by about $1,000 while providing light off-road capability, though the RAV4's front-wheel drive should be adequate for most drivers. Prices start at $15,345 for a two-door with two-wheel drive. The price of the test vehicle, a four-door with four-wheel drive, totaled $21,128 with destination charges, a hefty sum for first-time buyers.
Yes, the RAV4 makes a lot of noise. But what the heck -- we just cranked up the stereo, which is what young RAV4 owners are likely to do as well.
"It's noisy," my 7-year-old daughter said from the back seat. "But it's fun." I smiled in agreement.
After all, isn't that the point?
 
INSIDE TRACK: Awesome, totally.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: William J. Nasgovitz;
Heartland Value Fund

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY MIDDLETON 

 BODY:
WITH the stock market soaring to yet more record highs, perhaps no one has a tougher time than a money manager who likes to buy shares that are cheap.
Undaunted by the prospect is William J. Nasgovitz, who has guided the Heartland Value fund to an impressive record for more than 10 years. He says values can still be found in the stock market, though he is covering his bases by letting his cash position rise to nearly four times its normal level of less than 5 percent of assets. 
 The fund, which specializes in small companies, closed to new investors in July after assets ballooned to more than $1 billion. So if you want the benefit of Mr. Nasgovitz's expertise, you will have to try his other fund, Heartland Small Cap Contrarian, begun last April.
Discovering stocks before Wall Street finds them is Mr. Nasgovitz's goal. Employing the classic financial analysis of Benjamin Graham, he seeks companies with certain attributes. In particular, he looks for companies with a ratio of debt to capital of no more than 25 percent and with low share prices relative to their earnings, cash flow and book value.
Exactly who owns the stock also carries great weight. He prefers companies in which the top executives and directors have big holdings and in which other institutions have a small stake.
 The strategy has led Mr. Nasgovitz to very small companies. The stocks in Heartland Value have a median market capitalization of $63 million, and those in the new fund average $46 million, while the median is $574 million for small-company funds, Morningstar says.
Though the funds are similar, his small-cap fund can take short positions, or bets that stock prices will decline, with up to 25 percent of its assets. It now has a short position equivalent to 18 percent of its $106 million in assets.
"Small stocks have been known to go to ridiculous valuations on both extremes," Mr. Nasgovitz said, "so we're short about a dozen of Wall Street's most overvalued, overloved, overowned high-fliers." An example is Molten Metal Products, a pollution cleanup company with a market cap of nearly $800 million and no earnings.
 But Mr. Nasgovitz really likes to spot tomorrow's winners. Here are two favorites in Heartland Value, which has 19 percent in cash, and one in the new fund, with just 2 percent cash:
 
 
 
Caught on the Rebound
 "I like Gehl Company, based in West Bend, Wis., which is north of here about 30 miles," Mr. Nasgovitz said in a phone interview from his Milwaukee office. Gehl, a maker of agricultural and construction equipment, nearly went out of business a few years ago after its management took on debt and tried to expand too rapidly, Mr. Nasgovitz said. But more recently, with another member of the Gehl family at the helm, earnings have strengthened.
 "Somebody is going to discover this company," Mr. Nasgovitz said, "either in the public stock market or a strategic buyer."
Mr. Nasgovitz says he will keep buying the stock at less than $9, which is only about 7.5 times his profit expectation of $1.20 a share this year.
 
 
 
Victory from Defeat?
 Right Choice Managed Care Inc. of St. Louis has two strikes against it. Its market is limited to Missouri, and all of its voting stock is owned by Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Missouri.
The control by Blue Cross is seen as an impediment to a takeover, yet the company's market is too small for economies of scale in an era of nationwide managed care, causing the stock to sell at a discount, Mr. Nasgovitz said.
 The stock closed at $16.125 on Friday, for a market capitalization of about $300 million, or $200 for each 1.5 million members. The industry average is about $1,000 a member, Mr. Nasgovitz said.
 One-state companies are doomed, he said, and competitive pressures will force Blue Cross "either to become more active in the acquisition market, or to sell off Right Choice."
 
 
 
Careful Shopping
 Retailers are profoundly out of favor, and that makes them attractive to value investors. "You can generally find something that's in its own private bear market, so retailing is at the top of our list," Mr. Nasgovitz said, adding that Small-Cap Contrarian owns 10 retailing stocks.
 One of his top retailing picks is Fred's Inc. of Memphis, with 200 discount stores in the Southeast. The stock has tumbled to $7.125 a share from a high near $20 in the summer of 1993. A new management team led by a one-time Wal-Mart executive has adopted an "everyday low-price" strategy, said Mr. Nasgovitz, who says earnings could reach 50 cents a share -- well ahead of Wall Street expectations -- in this fiscal year.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Can Retirees' Safety Net Be Saved?

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
SOCIAL SECURITY is going bankrupt -- again.
But don't sell off the family Wedgwood or apply for Swedish citizenship just yet. In 1983, the Social Security cupboard was nearly bare. This time around, the economic and political crisis is coming in slow motion: the system's income from payroll taxes is expected to exceed pension outlays until 2013. 
 Thereafter, however, the relentless growth of pensioners will eat into Social Security's accumulated claims against the Treasury, forcing Washington to raise taxes or slash spending on other programs. And, for the first time in the 60-year history of Social Security, some of its friends are asking for fundamental change before the system cracks under the weight of promises that would be inconceivably expensive to honor.
"We are damning our children to a very grim future if we continue to hide our heads in the sand," said Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska.
Impressed by the need to increase national savings to pay for the graying of the baby boomers, many pension specialists want to tie Federal benefits more closely to individual efforts to build nest eggs. Indeed, inspired by the vogue for market-based solutions to social problems -- particularly the experience of several Latin American countries, notably Chile, that have privatized their pension systems -- some are calling for the dismantling of Social Security.
"Business as usual is no longer sufficient to provide retirement security for future generations," said Michael Tanner, director of the Social Security privatization project at the libertarian Cato Institute.
Even defenders of the New Deal faith are entertaining changes that would have been denounced as heresy a few years ago. Robert M. Ball, a former Commissioner of Social Security and a main negotiator for Congressional Democrats in the 1983 fix, wants to invest a chunk of the system's revenues on Wall Street.
"Why should the trust fund earn just one-third as much as common stocks?" Mr. Ball asked.
Thirteen years ago, Democrats and Republicans gritted their teeth and put in place a series of modest benefits cuts and tax increases intended to finance the pension and disability portions of Social Security for another 75 years. But new estimates, based on revised labor force and demographic data, suggest that the current payroll tax rate of 12.4 percent (employer and employee combined) is two percentage points shy of the amount needed to meet the 75-year target.
To put it another way: if nothing is done before 2022, promised benefits for retirees will have to be cut by a third to keep a positive balance in the Social Security trust fund.
Lawrence White, an economist at the Stern School of Business at New York University, sees the issue in more alarming terms. The Government is implicitly relying on a huge cash surplus from Social Security to keep the overall budget deficit under $200 billion today and to balance it in 2002. But this projected surplus peaks in 2005, at $120 billion, and falls to zero in 2013. So just a decade from now, Mr. White notes, Washington will face fiscal pressures from the deteriorating net cash flow from Social Security. And after 2013, the ink turns red.
"It's a chain-letter scheme with socially redeeming features," Mr. White said. "But it's still a chain letter."
Barry Bosworth, an economist at the centrist Brookings Institution, elaborates: America has failed, he suggests, to accumulate the capital to make it possible for a relatively small work force to sustain a decent living standard while supporting parents and grandparents. But rather than saving more to create this capital, Americans -- young and old -- have been saving less. Between World War II and 1980, households and businesses set aside about 8 percent of income, while Government deficits drained off a bit less than 1 percent. Since 1980, private saving has slipped to about 6 percent, while budget deficits have cut net savings to just 3 percent.
There is nothing very new in the view that Social Security's woes follow from demographic imbalance and are aggravated by a spend-now, pay-later mind set. What is new, or at least suddenly respectable to assert, is that the system's failings follow from a failure to ask individuals to bear more responsibility for their own retirement.
As it is, Congress shuffles the Social Security pot in ways the public is only dimly aware of. Intergenerational transfers -- the chain-letter aspect -- are the most obvious. A single worker born in 1930, with average earnings, can expect to get back about 90 percent of the total payroll tax paid, plus interest, while the same kind of worker born in 1950 will end up with just 55 percent.
But that is only the beginning of the wide range of payouts, determined by Government policy, that often provide a bigger return to those who have paid in less. Under the current formula, a single low-income worker born in 1930 can expect to get back about 120 percent of his or her contribution, while a married couple with just one low-income worker born in that year can expect to reap 235 percent. Meanwhile, a single worker born in 1930 who has had maximum taxable earnings can expect just 70 percent.
Then there is the issue of the return on trust fund investments. Social Security's claims against future Government revenue -- I.O.U.'s the agency holds in the form of Treasury bonds, which now exceed $500 billion -- have historically earned just 2.3 percent after adjusting for inflation. Had this money been broadly invested in common stocks over the last half-century, the return would have been close to 7 percent.
While bills to revamp Social Security have been introduced, no one expects Washington to touch the issue before the election this year. Hence the clearest sense of the plausible range of options is coming from private sources, notably the Cato Institute and the specialists on the Social Security Administration's advisory council, whose chairman is Edward M. Gramlich, an economist at the University of Michigan.

Keep the Faith
An obvious approach is to buttress the finances of the existing system. Increasing the payroll tax anytime soon is probably a nonstarter. But Mr. Ball, along with 5 other members of the 13-member advisory council, argues that there is a way to eliminate the shortfall of two percentage points without asking for much public sacrifice.
He assumes that revisions in the way inflation is computed by the Department of Labor will trim the growth of indexed benefits by half a percentage point a year, clipping off roughly a third of the projected 75-year deficit. Another third would be closed by taxing Social Security benefits in sync with private pensions, and then directing that all the revenues -- including those that now go for medical benefits -- be used for pension and disability payments.
Most of the rest of the needed money would come from Mr. Ball's single concession to the new political order -- investing three-eighths of future payroll tax revenues in a Government-run stock mutual fund whose return would mirror that of the market as a whole. This, he reckons, would raise the expected return to the trust fund to 3.8 percent, from 2.3 percent.
Sylvester Schieber, vice president of the Watson Wyatt pension consulting firm and a member of the Social Security advisory council, calls this approach "a trim, a tuck and a prayer." More specifically, he points out that much of the revenue Mr. Ball would direct to pensions would come from money currently shoring up Medicare, a social program with awesome financial problems of its own. Mr. Schieber also notes that the stock market may not perform as well in the future as it has in the past.
A final catch, which Mr. Ball readily acknowledges, is that the plan would probably not keep Social Security solvent past mid-century. He anticipates a need to increase the payroll tax in the distant future.
 
Full Privatization
Those who rejoice in thinking the unthinkable ponder a radical break from the "defined benefit" Social Security system run by Washington to a private, but mandatory, "defined contribution" system that would operate like I.R.A.'s and 401(k) plans.
Investments, presumably made largely through mutual funds, would be regulated. "You couldn't buy derivatives on the Singapore market," Mr. Tanner of the Cato Institute explained. And you probably could not withdraw money as a lump sum upon retirement. But in contrast to the current system, which pays a fixed monthly amount, each worker's benefit would be determined by how much that person invested, and how well. Bare-bones subsistence for retirees who would otherwise be destitute would be financed through Government revenues.
The pluses are plain. Americans would be obliged to save for their own retirement, presumably benefiting from the higher returns historically available from private investment. What's more, the system could never be in deficit and could never become a vehicle for buying political support from the elderly with the taxes of the young.
But the minuses are clear, too. Serious poverty among the aged, almost eliminated by the progressive distribution of Social Security, might reappear. And middle-income Americans would be at greater risk. "Relatively few of the 122 million contributors would have any idea how to invest their money," Mr. Ball said. Moreover, there is no assurance that the private market would convert the savings into annuities indexed to keep up with inflation.
Surely the most difficult issue, though, is how to cope during a transition from the current pay-as-you-go public system. Going cold turkey -- writing off the unfinanced promises to older workers and current retirees -- is not an option. (Younger workers are actually paying in enough to finance their promised amounts.)
Mr. Tanner would require Uncle Sam to assume a substantial portion of the $3 trillion to $4 trillion (yes, trillion) in unfinanced benefits, with older people getting more than the young. And he would raise the money from unspecified Government savings or, as a last resort, from new taxes.
 
A Public-Private Hybrid
Mr. Schieber and four other members of the advisory council favor a compromise between radical privatization and Mr. Ball's plan for muddling through.
Workers under 55 at the program's inception would be given a rebate of half of the 10 percent payroll tax now earmarked for pensions. (Disability payments account for roughly 2 percent of the tax.) But they would be obliged to invest the money through "personal security accounts," which would function like I.R.A.'s. Most of it would presumably end up in mutual funds.
Workers and retirees over 55 would be "grandfathered," receiving currently promised benefits for the rest of their lives. But Mr. Schieber envisions a two-tier payment for everyone younger.
The first tier would be a basic benefit, roughly $360 a month in 1995 purchasing power. The retirement age with this benefit would rise to 68 by 2017, as now scheduled. Then the eligibility age would rise with average life expectancy. The second tier's size would depend on an individual's savings, investment decisions and retirement age. Computer models suggest that with modest wage growth and a 4 percent return on investment after inflation, personal security accounts would finance retirement benefits for today's young workers that exceed those promised under current law.
As with full privatization, raising money to finance the change from pay-as-you-go to a fully paid retirement system would be a problem. Indeed, "the transition could be ugly," Mr. Gramlich said.
Mr. Schieber would make the cost of the transition visible and amortize it over a very long period. He would sell Government bonds to replace payroll revenues lost by the Social Security trust fund in the switch to personal security accounts. And he would cover the interest and pay off the principal with a 1 percent national sales tax -- dubbed a "liberty tax" -- over 70 years.
The relatively high expected return on private investments would make it possible to deliver roughly the same benefit to low-income workers as the current system promises, with less money diverted from the payroll taxes of high-income people.
Still, some of the cautions that apply to full privatization apply here, too. Individuals might make bad investments with the substantial sums in their personal security accounts. But Mr. Schieber responds that the "risks are no greater than the political risks" to which benefits are now subjected.
Patching the current system with the relatively modest changes suggested by Mr. Ball may seem the path of least resistance. But the need to compromise to secure the agreement of a Republican-controlled Congress may lead to more radical measures.
In 1983, Congress had to act because the payroll tax was inadequate to cover pension outlays in the immediate future. This time around, Social Security is rolling in cash and nothing will force action for a decade if Washington chooses to sit on its hands. And that, suggests Mr. Tanner, means conservative Republicans will not be under pressure to accept reforms they dislike.
By the same token, time is not on the side of those who favor minimal change. The longer Washington waits to make a patch, the more it will have to raise taxes or cut benefits -- and the harder it will be to sell. Hence, those who defend Social Security may be forced to accept partial privatization as the price of sustaining benefits.
Besides, there is a small but influential group in Congress who have staked their careers on restoring fiscal prudence and intergenerational equity. They will not quietly accept changes that do not assure the higher savings rates needed to pay for the retirement of baby boomers.
"Perhaps Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich can afford to wait for a real fix," said Senator Kerrey, who was co-chairman of the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform. "But most Americans can't."

New Orleans Gala With Egyptian Theme Helps Black Colleges

BYLINE: By LYNNE AMES 

DATELINE: IRVINGTON

 BODY:
IT was a glittering evening, and not just figuratively speaking. Many partygoers arrived in gold lame; those not draped in shimmering stuff had touches of gold encircling their throats, nestled in their hair, dangling from their ears. In the ballroom, light from gilded wall sconces shown on walls and ceilings adorned with intricate gold-leaf designs.
The event was a costume ball billed as "An Egyptian Masquerade: Mardi Gras Comes to Westchester," and it was held at Villa Lewaro, the 35-room Italianate mansion here that once belonged to Madame C. J. Walker, the first self-made famale millionaire in America. 
 Villa Lewaro, a vast white stucco edifice, is now the home of Harold E. Doley Jr., president of the Doley Securities investment firm, and his wife, Helena, a guidance counselor at the Cottage School in Pleasantville. The Doleys are from New Orleans, and, they s'id, they wanted to bring a taste of Mardi Gras up North.
They also wanted to help a cause in which they deeply believe. The gala, sponsored by the Tri-State Friends Committee of the United Negro College Fund, drew 225 guests who paid $125 to $2,000 each and raised $50,000 to benefit four historically black colleges: Bowie State University in Bowie, Md., Clark Atlanta University in Atlanta, Shaw University in Raleigh, N.C., and Xavier University of Louisianain New Orleans.
Also at the benefit, Michael R. Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg Financial Markets, was honored for his donation of $2.6 million worth of computers to United Negro College Fund member schools. Mr. Doley, who has served as United States Ambassador to the African Development Bank in the Ivory Coast among other government positions, is an alumnus of Xavier; he said it is crucial to support such institutions.
"These colleges are very, very important," he said. "They provide tremendops educational opportunities for large numbers of African-Americans. Being a transplanted New Orleans native, I thought it would be wonderful to do a Mardi Gras-style party here in Westchester to benefit these institutions. Helena and I are very epcited that the house, with its incredible history and special meaning for African-Americans, is being used for fund-raising events."
One guest observed that the soiree was very much in the spirit of Madame Walker herself. Born in 1867 in De'ta, La., to two former slaves, she went on to found a line of beauty-care products that earned her more than $1 million. In 1916, already a fixture on the New York social and philanthropic scene, she commissioned the building of Villa Lewaro, which she used until her death to entertain notables from the arts, politics and business.
The Mardi Gras ball held last weekend also drew its share of high achievers. Toni Cox-Burns, a fund-raising consultant from White Plains, said with a laugh, "I'd say we have the black elite from the county and beyond, but that might sound elitist, so let's just say there are lots of movers and shakers here."
Guests began arriving at 7 o'clock, gingerly stepping out of cars to protect delicate costumes. Men appeared as pharaohs draped in white robes and wearing gold-tone headpieces and breastplates; more than one woman was Cleopatra. Mrs. Doley was wearing an iridescent gold skirt and top, which left her midriff exposed a la ancient Egypt, and on her head and arms were gold sequined snakes.
Ira Moss, the 6-foot-7 president of a chemical company in Washington, towered over the crowd in white-and-gold-embroidered pharaoh robes; his wife, Darlene, was resplendent in gold-pleated skirt, multicolored jeweled collar and a two-foot-high headdress. An almost identical Egyptian queen outfit was worn by Shirley Hinton, who works for International Business Machines. Ms. Hinton had rented hers from the Elephant's Trunk in Mount Kisco; Ms. Moss's was rented from a costume company in Washington. "Who would have thought that the two of us, coming from two different states, would end up in the same costume," Mrs. Hinton said. "Oh well, at least I was at the party first."
Lois T. Bronz, a Democratic County Legislator from Greenburgh, was wearing a costume she had made of dazzling blue-and-silver cloth and a huge headpiece she had constructed for the county's Caribbean Festival last fall. Mrs. Bronz, 68, grew up in New Orleans where she was one of 10 children and, she recalled, her mother "made Mardi Gras costumes out of flour sacks for us -- we always had a costume for Mardi Gras."
She spoke, too, of her years attending Xavier University. "I was the first member of my family to graduate from college. I always knew I'd go. The nuns at the Catholic high school I attended identified me as having college potential. I won a scholarship to pay for my education. I knew I was among pace setters, and I felt a sense of responsibility to do something with my education, a sense of commitment that I think has stayed with me all these years."
Logan Delany also talked about the significance of a college education. Mr. Delany, a 46-year-old financier who lives in Irvington, is the grand-nephew of Sarah Delany and her late sister Bessie, the centenarian sisters from Mount Vernon who gained worldwide fame in the last five years. A Harvard graduate, he said that historically black colleges play "a tremendously important" role in American education.
"These schools tend to be underfunded and underrecognized," he said. "Look at the historical role of these colleges: until a generation ago, blacks had virtually no choice of where to go. Just about all of the black leadership came out of these historically black colleges. When I went to Harvard, my freshman year 1966, only 2 percent of the class was black."
In a lighter vein, Mr. Delany said he loves parties and proclaimed this one a major success. Although he was not wearing a costume, his tuxedo lapel was adorned with a pin depicting Nefertiti, and he said he thought the Mardi Gras theme and New Orleans cuisine were "fabulous."
In this he was not alone. People oohed and ahhed as they sampled seafood gumbo flown from Dookey Chase Restaurant in New Orleans. They also had high praise for the lavish buffet catered by J. E.'s Restaurant in Newark, returning for second and third helpings of shrimp creole, crawfish etoufe, sausage jumbalaya, ham with raisin sauce, short ribs, turkey with cornbread stuffing, peach cobbler and coconut cake. And phey admired the tiger lilies and gold papier-mache Egyptian-style decorations provided by Felicia C. Sneed, a petite, silver-haired woman who for many years has run a bridal and party business in East Orange, N.J.
"Mr. and Mrs. Doley are among the nicest hosts and hostesses I've ever worked with," Mrs. Sneed said. "People in their position could allocate a lot of the decisions and the work about a party, but they didn't -- they got right into it and were involved every step of the way."
Judie Beville also had praise for the Doleys and the event. A 1976 graduate of Clark Atlanta University who is a special events coordinator in Valhalla, she said she thought the party struck just the right note. "It's fun; it's glamorous, and it's quite original for this part of the country," she said as Karen Lopes and the Katts, who had played rhythm and blues and rock and roll most of the night, began "When the Saints Go Marching In."
"It also helps an extremely meaningful cause," she added. "I went to a historically black college, and it was one of the best experiences of my life. It has kept me connected spiritually to the African-American culture and people. Yet it excluded no one. We had black professors, and we had white professors, and everyone was caring and friendly. The professors adhered to the highest academic standards, and they expected us as students to do the same. They expected a lot from us, and they got it."

HEADLINE: Where Students Teach Students

BYLINE: By BARBARA HALL 

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
THERE will be a need for about two million qualified teachers in the United States over the next decade, according to the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future, a nonprofit research group based at Teachers College of Columbia University.
At least one Westchester high school is showing active concern about the projections. The Lincoln High School of Economics and Finance, a magnet school here, has taken the unusual step of guiding high schoolers into the teaching profession. 
 Little about Lincoln is usual: passages from Ravel's "Bolero," for example, are often played at the school, which operates a school within a school called the Early Childhood Center, where young children are taught by high schoolers under the supervision of faculty members.
The center was established in September 1987. At first it offered instruction only to high school seniors. Today all high school grades can take advance courses, including ones on early-childhood development.
This year, there are 160 prekindergarten, kindergarten and first-grade children in the program. They are local youngsters chosen by lottery. (Coordinators confirm that there is a long waitilg list.)
About 220 Yonkers high school students are involved in classes in the Early Childhood Education wing at Lincoln High School. In addition to advanced prep courses with children in the lab school, the high schoolers can take education-related courses at the Pleasantville campus of Pace University.
Kathleen Ryan, by all accounts the prime mover of the program, said: "Pace has been very, very good to us. College is a whole new world for our students. It proves to them that, yes, they can succeed in the college environment. We give them a head start. We say, 'Let's open up a few doors here.' "
She added that 90 percent of her students are accepted by colleges.
The Lincoln effort received support with recruiting from New Teachers, a nationwide network based in Belmont, Mass. One goal is to encourage precollege teaching as practiced at the Yonkers magnet school.
Roseanne Bacon, a former teacher who for a year and a half has directed the precollege effort, praised Ms. Ryan. "She has always been terrific," Ms. Bacon said.
The program's overall mission, Ms. Bacon said, "is to improve the awareness of today's students to the possibilities, the joys, of teaching as a profession." "Although Yonkers is an urban area, it has a suburban flavor to it," she continued. "They are doing an excellent job of bringing diverse groups together. They're providing meaningful experiences. After all, teaching isn't fun all the time. We've identified 400 precollegiate programs in the country. Only 29 are teaching magnets within the school. Yonkers's teaching magnet is very unusual." James Wilson, a junior, is one of the minority of boys in the Early Childhood program. "I want to be a teacher for the little kids," he said. "I get satisfaction when they remember something I've taught them. At first I was scared to do it. It was difficult. Now, when they get active, I know what to do."
A dance class, perhaps, reveals the program at its liveliest. In a large room walled with mirrors and framed by ballet barres, 16 kindergarten and prekindergarten children were high-stepping to music, with help from high school students under the watchful eye of Judy Rubin.
In one exercise, the troupe mimicked elephants, giraffes, tigers, then monkeys, against a background of drumbeat and chant.
"I'm the rookie this year," Mrs. Rubin said. "It's so exciting to see my students with the little ones. They really get in there and work." Her group, she said, will give a recital in the spring.
One of her high school students, Paulina Vallejos, said she was having the time of her life. "It's a good feeling you get to see the expressions on their faces," she said. "I'm a lady to them. I'm some authority for them to look up to." For special occasions, she added, the children make their own costumes. "They come up with really interesting designs," she said. Asked what she remembers most, Ms. Vallejos said: "There was this one little boy who said to me: 'I remember you from last year. You taught me that dance.' He actually remembered. I thought, 'Wow, he must have liked it a lot.' "
Ms. Vallejos said she wants to major in elementary education at New Rochelle College next year.
Quanda Meakers also chose to teach the youngsters in dance.
"It's just that I like little kids," she said. "I love their innocence."
Another of her dance classmates, Yocaira Gonzalez, a senior, said that years of baby-sitting influenced her involvement in the program. "I'm leaning toward becoming a teacher more and more as I teach here," she said. "The children look pp to you. I think teaching is an instinctive thing."
Ms. Gonzalez is one of the Lincoln students taking courses at Pace. "The professors didn't know we were high school students until we told them ourselves," she said. "You get confidence from this." Wilfa Almonte, a junior and dance-class participant, added accolades of her own.
"Dance brings the children out," she said. "They get happy, emotional. As for me, Lincoln is fun, a family. The teacher is like my second mother. I treasure this school."

HEADLINE: Don't Give Me Fahrenheit; Tell Me How It Feels

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
I spent most of my childhood just north of Oshkosh, Wis., a city we saw as a center of cosmopolitan sophistication, in a town called Neenah, where winter was winter. Deep snows and sub-zero temperatures were a routine part of life. And when the weatherman reported that it was 20 or 30 degrees below zero, we suited up like astronauts and put on ski masks like bank robbers -- no skin exposed, period.
Yet today, when a winter worthy of the name arrives, the coldness numbers are way off my childhood charts. In the New York area, there are reports of 20 degrees or so below zero, while from the Midwest and Plains states come declarations of 50, 60, even 90 degrees below zero. Is this America or Antarctica? 
 The temperatures haven't dropped because of global cooling or global warming. The reason, of course, is the rise of the "wind-chill factor," an inflationary number that is used so often these days that the actual temperature is just an afterthought. How did the wind-chill factor come to upstage mercury itself?
The notion that the wind can make the cold feel colder is merely common sense.
But the idea for a wind-chill index was first proposed in 1939 by Paul Siple, an Antarctic explorer. In 1945, after watching water freeze in plastic containers, he and a colleague, P. F. Passel, published an empirical formula for calculating the heat loss due to wind chill, using measurements of air temperature and wind speed.
The formula states, for example, that at a temperature of 20 degrees Fahrenheit and a wind speed of 20 miles an hour, the wind-chill reading is 9 degrees below. At zero degrees and a wind speed of 25 miles an hour, the wind-chill becomes 45 below.
Even though the formula has been around since the end of World War II, the wind-chill factor did not enter the vernacular until 15 years ago. The explanation, it seems, is a combination of meteorology and the media.
The National Weather Service began reporting wind-chill numbers in the mid-1970's, after the agency received inquiries. But things really took off in the 1980's as weather announcers became fixtures on television screens across the country.
"Wind-chill caught the public's imagination, and the notion was spread by the rising popularity of television weather reports," said Michael Glantz, head of the environmental and societal impacts group at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. "And wind-chill is a very appealing concept to people. Temperature just exists, but the wind-chill tells you something that weather does. How it makes you feel."
So reporting the wind-chill factor was justified in the name of weather relevancy. In addition, as more television weather people were trained in meteorology, they felt more confident in not merely reporting the weather but interpreting it, amplifying it. They understood the wind-chill formula, and they began doing the calculations themselves.
Besides, as Todd Miner, a meteorologist at Penn State University, noted, the wind-chill version "is more dramatic."
Some meteorologists have questioned just how accurately the Siple wind-chill index captures the combined cooling impact of wind and cold on humans. "It's a leap to go from water in cylinders to how quickly your skin cools," said Thomas Schlatter, a meteorologist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Using only temperature and wind speed, the Siple index is simply understood, but it leaves out factors like sunlight, activity and clothing. Other formulas have been proposed. In 1971, R. J. Steadman devised a formula for heat loss for what he memorably described as "an average clothed mobile human."
The Steadman formula results in more moderate wind-chill ratings than the Siple index, according to a recent issue of Weatherwise magazine. At a temperature of 20 degrees and wind speed of 20 miles an hour, the Steadman wind-chill is 5 degrees, roughly 15 degrees higher than the Siple index.
Some meteorologists believe that the Steadman approach is more accurate. Still, the Siple index seems assured of remaining the wind-chill standard, at least until Mr. Steadman finds a cooler name to quantify how that "average clothed mobile human" feels.
Shrewd phrasing is required for any aspiring weather term. "Wind-chill" is so bluntly descriptive that one feels colder just hearing it. Meanwhile, its ungainly hot-weather counterpart -- "apparent temperature," the combined effect of heat and humidity -- has not caught on. Small wonder.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD: America's Burden;
At Hour of Triumph, Democracy Recedes As the Global Ideal

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
THROUGHOUT the world's longest experiment with democratic government, America has always thought of itself as morally obliged to export its way of life. What the White Man's Burden was to Kipling's generation of Englishmen, the promotion of democracy has been to four generations of Americans -- the foreign policy equivalent of apple pie. Ever since Woodrow Wilson vowed to make the world safe for democracy, most Presidents have rhetorically endorsed this goal.
But now, less than a decade after democracy's greatest leap forward, the idea that America must promote it everywhere has lost some of its charm. Funds for encouraging elections overseas are drying up as the Clinton Administration struggles simply to secure peace in Bosnia, the Middle East and elsewhere. In part this reflects the reluctance of Americans to send their dollars abroad. But it also hints at a deeper change -- a new sense that Americans doubt that every country in the world would be better off if only it had more democracy. 
 Of course Washington's actions have often been inconsistent with its lofty words. Some American actions ignored democracy altogether and simply made a corner of the world safe for United Fruit. And when, during the cold war, Presidents from John F. Kennedy to Ronald Reagan proselytized for democracy, they did so selectively, and primarily to stop Communism.
Later, when the Soviet Union collapsed, the global triumph of democracy seemed for a while not only inevitable, but a laudable end in itself, a development that would, incidentally, enhance American national economic and security interests.
But is this true? A debate is now raging.
To some extent, recent Administrations have had little choice but to embrace efforts to advance democracy abroad. Surprised by the democratic wave from Chile to South Africa after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Bush Administration went so far as to suggest that promoting democracy was a goal of its war to liberate Kuwait (which never was, and isn't now, democratic). Not to be outdone, President Clinton in 1993 created new posts in the State Department and National Security Council for the purpose of spreading democracy, and set up a committee to consolidate financing for such activities. He also proposed a 60 percent increase in funds for the National Endowment for Democracy, the foundation Congress created in the Reagan years to pay for fostering elections overseas, among other things.
Recently, however, supporters of such pro-democracy programs have found themselves lobbying to preserve the Endowment's $35 million budget and prevent Congress from cutting the more than $725 million that the Administration estimates that it has spent on democracy-related programs in fiscal 1995.
It seems unlikely that Congress will abandon direct promotion of democracy altogether. But many policy makers and private analysts now say they are less sanguine about democracy's prospects, more sober about the difficulty of promoting it and more skeptical about whether its triumph in several strategic countries would enhance American interests.
Mr. Clinton, too, has gradually de-emphasized the goal he once championed, says Thomas Carothers, a former State Department lawyer and senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "With the single exception of Haiti," Mr. Carothers recently wrote in The Washington Quarterly, "Clinton has not, relative to Bush, substantially increased the U.S. emphasis on democracy promotion in any country or region." Mr. Carothers, incidentally, thinks this is a sensible step toward realism.
What explains this unease? First, the democratic trend that seemed inevitable after Communism's fall has slowed, and in several regions has been reversed. Consider Yugoslavia, where elections meant only the end of the pluralism and tolerance that Americans take for granted as essentials of democracy. Or Poland and the Czech Republic, where voters disenchanted with slipshod administrations have elected former Communists to run their countries better. Or Russia, where the rise of ethnic, religious, and nationalist passions has led Washington to back Boris Yeltsin, the best of a bad lot of would-be czars-through-election.
Fareed Zakaria, managing editor of the bi-monthly, Foreign Affairs, argues that while there are more signs of "democratization" -- especially elections -- there are fewer democracies. "Serbia held elections, reasonably fair elections," Mr. Zakaria writes in a forthcoming essay. "And the Serbs chose Milosevic, a xenophobic dictator." In this argument, elections are just one attribute of democracy; effective democracy implies a system in which elections help a society govern itself fairly and well. Mr. Zakaria argues that America might do better by promoting civic values like free speech, separation of church and state and property rights.
All too often, such elections have produced not "democracy" as Americans understand it, but what Ken Jowitt, a political scientist at the University of California at Berkeley, calls "Potemkin" or "mimic democracies" with few of the civic virtues found in the handful of "liberal-capitalist-democratic" states. Ironically, he says, efforts to promote democracy may have weakened the power of the state. And now, as a result, democracy is not nearly as important as stability.
 
 
 
Not for Everyone
 Most analysts agree that democracy building has traditionally been ignored in Arab states, , where the United States has vital national interests. Whatever praise the Administration has had for political liberalization in Jordan and Yemen, and for the recent Palestinian elections (which legitimized the autocratic rule of Yasir Arafat), officials remain wary of democratization as a general rule for the region. The worry is that anti-American, militantly Islamic regimes might replace the durably autocratic but pro-American governments of Egypt, Saudi Arabia and many gulf states.
So Washington did not protest when in 1992 the military cancelled an election in Algeria that would have brought the anti-Western Islamic Salvation Front to power. And the State Department was quiet last month when Britain began deporting a leading Saudi dissident, Mohammed al-Massari, whom the United States suspected of links to terrorist groups. "Saudi Arabia is the only place where U.S. officials have flatly told me that human rights and democracy are not an American concern," said Neil Hicks, Mideast coordinator of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, a private group based in New York.
Moreover, critics say, promoting democracy may not advance, or be consistent with, other American goals. Presidents Bush and Clinton both sacrificed concerns for human rights and democracy to protect America's profitable trade relations with China. In Latin America, the United States has found, alas, that autocratic regimes often suppress the drug trade more effectively than the region's elected leaders. Only in Africa, argues Mr. Carothers, has advancing democracy been a key element of American policy. But, he adds, only in Africa does the United States have no "significant economic or national security interests."
Penn Kemble, deputy director of the United States Information Agency, and Brian Atwood, director of the Agency for International Development, both say that the cost of promoting democracy is worth it. But, Mr. Kemble admits: "We're a little sadder, a little wiser now. We now know we need patience and perseverance to change a country's political culture. Changing Russia's will take at least a generation."
Even the suggestion that Russia might become democratic in a generation seems optimistic given its history and current behavior. But in American democracy, patience is not a virtue. The Administrations that will deal with Russia can last, by law, no more than eight years.

HEADLINE: More People Grow Food In Cities, Report Says

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 16

 BODY:
From the garbage dumps of Calcutta to the rooftops of Mexico City and dirt strips along roads in Jakarta and Nairobi, millions of people are farming the world's cities, feeding their families and supplying markets with vegetables, fruit, fish and even meat, a study has found.
Urban agriculture is a rapidly growing industry, providing a significant amount of the world's food, according to the study, published this week by the United Nations Development Program. City farmers are also increasing their share of world horticulture and animal feed production. 
 "In China, the cities produce 90 percent and more of the vegetables consumed," said Jac Smit, president of the Urban Agriculture Network in Washington, which researched and wrote the report for the United Nations. "In Africa, we came to the conclusion that 20 percent of the nutritional requirement was produced in the towns and cities."
The ability to farm, however small the plot, can contribute significantly to family health, the study reports.
In Kampala, Uganda, the survey found, children in families who grew some food crops were as healthy as the children of wealthy city families and far healthier than children of urban families without agricultural plots.
On the Philippine island of Negros, malnutrition among urban as well as rural children dropped to 25 percent in 1991 from 40 percent in 1988, the study found, in large part because more food was available closer to home at a lower price.
The report, based on field studies in 18 countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, also discovered that urban agriculture and aquaculture were playing a role in recycling uncollected waste, including sewage, in a number of cities.
But the use of urban waste and the lethal levels of air pollution in many cities in the developing world raised questions about the safety of the food grown there, Mr. Smit, an agricultural scientist and city planner, said in an interview today.
Cholera outbreaks have occurred in Lima, Peru, and in Santiago, Chile, because of contaminated vegetables, he said. However, he added that the outbreaks happened because food was not cooked and because the cities either lacked regulations for food production or the guidelines were simply not followed.
"The technology of producing safe food is well known and widely dispersed in the scientific community but not in the press, so the regular citizen does not know about it," Mr. Smit said.
The United States Department of Agriculture, the Governments of Japan and China, the European Union and the World Health Organization, among others, have all produced guidelines for growing food in urban centers, he said.
"The global upshot is that whether you go to Kinshasa, Zaire, or Moscow, or Shanghai, where urban agriculture is a major part of the diet, we don't hear of health outbreaks related to this," said Mr. Smit, who is now doing a survey on food safety for the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Three years of ad hoc farming in the Bosnian city of Sarajevo have not produced health problems, he added.
Urban agriculture has a long history, the United Nations report says. It is also not limited to cities in poor countries. Not all urban areas are defined the same way -- some, for example, might include large greenbelt or farming areas -- and cities in industrial nations are also food producers, the study found.
"Urban farmers also include wealthy producers of specialty crops for expensive restaurants," the report said, not just women growing vegetables on small plots in underdeveloped countries.
The new report, "Urban Agriculture: Food, Jobs and Sustainable Cities," was produced for Habitat II, an international conference on urban life scheduled to take place in Istanbul in June.

HEADLINE: AN ECONOMIC BASKET CASE;
In North Korea the Threat is Total Collapse

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
JUST two years ago, the Clinton Administration's biggest fear about North Korea was its determination to develop nuclear weapons -- a determination that could have led to war with the South. That worry was allayed after North Korea promised not to pursue atomic weaponry, in exchange for help with more benign nuclear power plants. But now, the United States has a different worry -- that North Korea is in so much trouble economically that it could fall apart. Rather than eliminate a threat, a sudden collapse could touch off internal chaos, a flood of refugees and -- if things got truly desperate -- war with the South.
South Korea, even more than the United States, is eager to avoid a sudden collapse of the North Korean regime. It is not just the threat of another war. South Korea's leaders are just as concerned that the North could fall the way East Germany did and, despite their stated commitment to reunification, they are extremely reluctant to make any real moves in that direction as long as the North remains an economic basket case. 
 In recent months, a wealth of anecdotal evidence -- severe food and energy shortages, an increase in defectors, a dramatic scaling back of annual military ground exercises -- suggests a country in economic crisis and a leadership struggling to cope with it.
One difficulty the United States faces in figuring out what to do in response is that North Korea is the black hole of Asia -- an isolated, rigid, Stalinist regime whose policies, capabilities and intentions are nearly impossible for the outside world to divine.
Another is that for years, American intelligence agencies have focused hard on North Korea's 1.2 million man army and its nuclear weapons program. The satellites and other secret intelligence gathering told America a lot about where the tanks were pointing and whether their engines were running, but little about whether peasants had enough to eat or whether the leadership was secure. So it is hard now to know just what to make of the anecdotal reports now emerging, and even harder to know how to react to them.
"For a long time there was little attention paid to such things," said Toby Gati, the State Department's most senior intelligence official. "If it was not an indication of war, there was no way to put it into the charts. The main focus of our analysis was and continues to be whether and under what conditions the North would invade the South. This is still crucial because of our troops. But a country is more than a tank, and now we have to have more than a one-dimensional look."
 
 
 
Floods and Oxcarts
 The task of analyzing the country's economy has become more crucial following floods last summer that wiped out entire villages and a large percentage of the country's food stocks and new harvest. This aggravated an economic crisis created after the Soviet Union collapsed and North Korea lost its patron and after China decided a year ago to stop selling the North grain on credit.
When the North Korean regime, whose guiding principle is self-reliance, turned to the outside world for help, the United States concluded that the economic problems were severe enough to warrant $2 million in food aid. Since North Korea remains subject to a 46-year-old economic embargo , the pledge of emergency aid was a diplomatic overture as much as it was a humanitarian response -- designed to show that the United States had no interest in seeing North Korea fall apart.
Last November, the secretive North even allowed the United Nations' World Food Program to open an office in the capital, Pyongyang; its presence has provided rare snapshots of everyday life.
Earlier this month, for example, Trevor Page, the program's director, visited Hwanghae, a prosperous town by North Korean standards and the fifth-largest in the country, where, according to his report, conditions were "appalling." Children from one to 16 years of age met in unheated classrooms where temperatures were about 5 degrees below zero. Most of the children were coughing and sneezing. School feeding rations had been cut in half.
There were no cars on the streets, only a steady stream of oxcarts and bicycles -- a sign of a fuel shortage. Groups of peasants were furtively selling firewood, clothing, cigarettes, matches and ballpoint pens on an illegal black market, which, according to an internal World Food Program report, "the Government is now tolerating because the public rationing system has broken down for lack of food."
In another report after a World Food Program visit to North Pyongan province last month, people interviewed said they were eating only two meals a day and stretching rice by turning it into porridge. The agency also has reported that the police are not arresting peasants who come into Pyongyang from the countryside with nothing to do but wander around in search of food. "Is there famine in the Biblical sense?" asked Mr. Page in a telephone interview from Pyongyang. "Clearly not. But the North Korean winter is hard and long and people are cold and the people are hungry and desperately short of food."
Another sign of discontent is that more North Koreans are fleeing overland into China and defecting to the South. Although American intelligence analysts look with skepticism on the stories told by defectors in staged press conferences in South Korea, the sheer number of the reports, particularly from soldiers who have defected, means they are now taken more seriously. Some defectors, for example, claim that hungry soldiers are deserting, robbing peasants, and being treated in hospitals for malnutrition.
Most interesting to the Pentagon is the fact that although North Korea's annual Air Force exercises are at about the same level as last year, its ground exercises are dramatically smaller. That, military analysts say, could mean that the Army does not have enough fuel to exercise.
Still, there is no agreement inside or outside the Administration about the extent to which shortages have affected morale or military readiness, whether the country is going to collapse or whether a collapse would prompt the North to invade the South.
"When you combine the failure of the economic system, the absence of political legitimacy and the lack of international backing, common sense tells you this is a country falling apart from within," said Stanley Roth, until recently the chief Asian analyst at the National Security Council. "But it's almost impossible to project when you have such little data."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Left, Right, Left: The Primaries Turn Politicians Around

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: GOFFSTOWN, N.H.

 BODY:
A NEW Bob Dole showed up in this state last week. Not the one who shuttles on corporate jets from his condominium in the Watergate to his condominium in Bal Harbour, Fla. This Bob Dole was heading for the eastern front in the class war, marching shoulder to shoulder with the working stiff.
Senator Dole's transformation, however momentary, can be traced to Monday night, when he just barely managed to win the Iowa caucuses. Frightened by Patrick J. Buchanan, who placed a close second and is a threat as Tuesday's primary here approaches, Mr. Dole echoed his rival's blue-collar lament. "Corporate profits are setting records -- and so are corporate layoffs," he asserted in his first speech after arriving in New Hampshire. 
 The shift is striking in the case of Mr. Dole, a highly experienced politician with a voluminous and generally consistent public record. But he is hardly alone. President Clinton is famous as a flip-flopper, as was his predecessor, George Bush.
 
 
 
In the System
 These changes of heart are easy to dismiss as mere political pandering. But they represent something more than disingenuousness. For the pressures that push politicians off their preferred places on the ideological spectrum are locked into the electoral system. Voters demand loyalty to an ever-shifting set of regional interests and popular notions even as they cry out for consistency.
Mr. Clinton, who has sent confusing signals on foreign policy, taxes, even his basic view of the role of the Federal Government ("The era of big government is over," he declared just two years after proposing a top-down reorganization of the entire national health-care system), leads in the early Presidential polls. These days, a consistent politician is often a losing politician.
Senator Phil Gramm of Texas is a classic case. No matter the occasion -- even at an anti-gay rally in Des Moines the other day -- he would dwell on the same economic message about spending cuts and budget-balancing that he has championed for all his years in Congress. Last week, his poor showing in Iowa forced him out of the race.
Mr. Dole himself learned the risks of consistency while being accused of inconsistency in the New Hampshire primary eight years ago. When he refused to sign a pledge not to raise taxes, he was labeled "Senator Straddle" in a particularly damaging campaign commercial by Mr. Bush. This time, Mr. Dole signed the pledge on the day he announced his candidacy.
The competing impulses to please and to stand firm are only ratcheted up in the glare of the primaries. Under the current system, candidates find themselves tailoring their messages to small, often narrow, constituencies. From Iowa, where religious conservatives are pivotal in the caucuses, candidates headed to this state, where anti-tax fervor and trade issues are center stage.
"This is the silly season and that's why you have to go back to people's records," said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform. "Things that are said in the heat of battle are terrible ways to judge people."
Indeed, hot issues emerge on which candidates are forced to take positions. Often, candidates believe that they have no choice but to respond to their competition -- and often to narrow issues that seem crucial in New Hampshire but fall flat when the race moves to Delaware the following week.
 
 
 
Scared by a Bear
 Stanley Greenberg, who was Mr. Clinton's pollster in the 1992 primaries, recalled that his candidate stopped pushing his middle-class tax cut after New Hampshire because a rival, former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, relentlessly attacked him for it. "The candidates who get the high ground, who are able to set the agenda, will have an impact on what aspect of your perspective that you'll emphasize," Mr. Greenberg said. "Tsongas was successful in characterizing the middle class tax cut as pandering." Mr. Tsongas even had a "pander bear" that he toted to news conferences.
The Republican contenders spent much of last year's run-up to the 1996 campaign taking on big government. But the rise of Steve Forbes, the publishing magnate who built his candidacy around the flat tax, led the candidates in a debate several weeks ago to emphasize how their politics could spur economic growth. Now that Mr. Forbes has taken a dive in the polls here, his issues have also been sidelined. In their debate in Manchester last week, candidates took up the issue of trade.
"What you would like is for candidates to take consistent positions and demonstrate real leadership on them," said Richard G. Niemi, a political scientist at the University of Rochester. "But these days, I don't know if that's possible. Maybe the system is too demanding of these guys -- to be in front of the public every day and have your every word analyzed, you don't even have the time to think."
Hasty turns to the left or right can backfire when the nominees play to a broader electorate in November. "It does really contribute to the cynicism of the voters," said Senator John McCain of Arizona, who was chairman of Mr. Gramm's campaign.
 
 
 
Tilting Right
 Mr. Dole's decision to criticize corporations may be inevitable given the state of the Republican primary race. For most of last year, the majority leader considered Mr. Gramm his biggest threat. So he tried to tack to his right on social issues. And, worried that he was overshadowed by Speaker Newt Gingrich, he did his best to identify himself with House Republicans -- at least until voters began souring on them.
Mr. Dole is no more fickle than many of his rivals. Mr. Buchanan, who attacked Mr. Dole in the debate Thursday for "pirating my ideas and parroting my rhetoric," has shifted here and there, too. Four years ago, when he took on Mr. Bush in the primary here -- at a time when workers were suffering -- Mr. Buchanan abruptly abandoned his long-held support of free trade.
"It is a foreign policy of inertia and nostalgia," he said of his former free-trade advocacy. "Lord help me, I used to be one of them." In an interview, Mr. Buchanan explained his reversal by saying that "the political cause of my lifetime -- anti-Communism, the cold war -- it's over," and that it was time to "start looking out for No. 1."
And while Mr. Dole was borrowing from Mr. Buchanan last week, Mr. Buchanan was borrowing one of Mr. Forbes set lines when he declared: "We come here to New Hampshire now with our crusade to put America and Americans first really brimming with hope, growth and opportunity."
Nor should former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee get off the hook. Mr. Alexander, who served as Secretary of Education, has more recently called for abolishing the Education Department. In New Hampshire, he took up a new cause the other day, against "environmental extremists."
Gov. John M. Engler of Michigan, a popular Republican who has not endorsed a primary candidate, said that in his own races he tries not to become preoccupied with figuring out just what the voters want.
"Voters can be very demanding -- they can be very arbitrary as well," Mr. Engler said. "They can be very unrealistic in their expectations. Sometimes you get so wrapped up in trying to appeal to a subset of the electorate, that you can miss the winning message."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK;
In Contracts, Red Sox Choose Not to Follow The Indians' Example

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
If Mo Vaughn and John Valentin played for the Cleveland Indians, their employer would not have approached their salary arbitration hearings with economic trepidation. That's because if Vaughn and Valentin played for the Indians, they would have been signed for 1996 a couple of years ago and the team would not have faced any arbitration hearings.
But they play for the Boston Red Sox so they entered this arbitration season unsigned. 
 Vaughn finally reached agreement with the Red Sox Friday on a three-year, $18.6 million contract, 72 hours before his scheduled hearing. Valentin would like to join his teammate on the multiyear list, but the Red Sox haven't been real interested so they are scheduled to see an arbitrator Tuesday.
Unlike the Indians, who by now might have revolutionized baseball's salary scale if anybody had been watching, Boston does not believe in signing its good young players to multiyear contracts early in their careers.
"Dan prefers the shorter term, in a broad sense, for now," Mike Port, the Red Sox assistant general manager, said of General Manager Dan Duquette. "Flexibility is important for the Red Sox. That may change, but for now, that's it."
The absence of flexibility, if that's what multiyear contracts produce, has not hampered the Indians. Four years ago they began signing their promising young players to long-term deals, figuring they would save money through the players' arbitration years. Now, not only have they saved money, but they also have constructed an outstanding team with a nucleus of players who could wear the same uniform for years, if not their entire careers.
The Indians have not waited for a player to be four years into his major league career and two years away from free agency, as Vaughn is, to enroll him in their program. Kenny Lofton, Jim Thome and Charles Nagy each had played basically one season in the major leagues when the Indians signed them to contracts covering three to five years. Just this off season they wrapped up Manny Ramirez and Julian Tavarez for five years after they had spent less than two years in the majors. When Albert Belle signed for four years, he had played two and two-thirds seasons; Carlos Baerga played for three years, then signed for seven.
"The Indians signed them on a long-term basis to stabilize their costs," Duquette said. "But they also were going into a new stadium and they knew they were going to have an increase in revenue. Other clubs who aren't going into new stadiums don't have the dependability of their revenue base."
Others point out, however, that signing good players early saves larger expenditures in subsequent seasons.
"You have to give credit to John Hart," one agent said of the Indians' general manager. "He is a master at premature long-term contracts." Then, using Ramirez as an example, he added: "He might lose money in the long run, but he couldn't resist the guarantee of that contract. It's a great deal for the Indians. They're going to save $7, 8, 9 million over the life of the contract."
But Port, former general manager of the California Angels, talked about players falling short of expectation or suffering injury. "You don't mind paying for performance," he said. "It's paying for nonperformance that you don't like."
Certainly, the practice involves some risk, and not even the Indians have batted 1.000. But in creating the new economics, they have established a model for others to follow.
Other teams cautiously have begun to follow the leader. Before the 1994 season, California signed Tim Salmon (with 1 year and 45 days of major league service) to a four-year contract and Gary DiSarcina (2 years, 94 days) to a three-year deal, and the Dodgers signed Eric Karros (2 years, 36 days) and Mike Piazza (1 year, 34 days) to three-year contracts. Last April, Toronto signed Pat Hentgen (2 years, 24 days) to a three-year deal with an option for a fourth year.
On Friday, Chipper Jones, after his first year in the majors, agreed to a four-year deal with Atlanta.
The Red Sox could have acted similarly with Vaughn and Valentin after the 1993 or 94 season. It's not as if the players had not displayed their talents. In 1993, Vaughn hit .297, slugged 29 home runs and drove in 101 runs while Valentin batted .278 and drove in 66 runs. The next season Vaughn batted .310 and, with the strike-shortened schedule, hit 26 home runs and knocked in 82 runs while Valentin hit .301 with 49 r.b.i.
If the Red Sox had signed them after either of those seasons -- Duquette said he considered but rejected a two-year deal for Valentin in 1994 -- Vaughn and Valentin would not have been able to capitalize on their monster performances last season: .300, 39 home runs, 126 r.b.i. for the overpowering first baseman, .298, 27 home runs, 102 r.b.i. for the blossoming shortstop.
The Red Sox, like the Indians, would have saved millions of dollars, an achievement akin to winning a division championship in these times of supposedly scarce money.
 
 
 
Leiter Ready to Earn His Pay
 After an injury-plagued career in which shoulder and elbow ailments limited him to 13 major league games in a four-season span, Al Leiter had reason to look forward to the winter after a healthy and effective season.
"I thought I would have enjoyed this free agency thing, but it was hands down the hardest decision I made in my life," Leiter said. "Considering the past relationships in the Toronto organization -- the fans, the city -- it was extremely difficult to leave that. The day of the signing I felt elated and joy and yet saddened and upset."
Slightly less than six weeks after his 30th birthday, the left-handed pitcher became one of baseball's off-season celebrities by signing a three-year, $8.6 million contract with Florida. The contract grabbed everyone's attention because the Marlins committed nearly $3 million a year to a pitcher who seemingly had spent more time on the disabled list than on the mound and whose career record was one game over .500 -- 33-32.
Yet Pat Gillick, the Baltimore Orioles' general manager, who traded for Leiter when he operated the Blue Jays, validated the signing by acknowledging that he, too, offered Leiter that kind of deal. Forget the past, Gillick and others pronounced; Leiter had a future.
"As an arbitration player, clubs look at your past three years," Leiter said. "My past three years were the accumulation of disabled list time and didn't amount to a whole lot. When you become a free agent, that's all thrown out the window. Scouts see that this guy's on the verge. He helped the club win a championship, and each year he's gotten stronger and healthier. I look at my situation almost like a high school or college draft pick. You give this kid a big bonus because you think he's going be a star in the big leagues."
Pitching for a team in rapid decline, Leiter had only an 11-11 record last season, but his performance exceeded those numbers. He had the eighth lowest earned run average in the American League, 3.64, and he was sixth best in opponents' batting average (.238), batting average with runners in scoring position (.220) and hits per nine innings (7.97). He led the league in walks with 108, but the Blue Jays undermined him by averaging only 3.84 runs a game when he pitched, the most meager run support for any A.L. starter.
"The scouts have been saying how nasty my stuff was," Leiter said. "To say Al Leiter is one of the top left-handers in the American League for stuff is nice to hear."
Leiter, once the most promising young pitcher in the Yankees' organization, obviously chose the right season to display his talents. In its aftermath, he emerged with such a lucrative contract that it was used as a prime example of the owners' returning to their wild-spending ways.
But, countering that characterization, Leiter said, "If these people are right, and I certainly plan to prove them right, it will turn out to be a good deal. I don't see any reason why I can't be among the top pitchers in the league if I go out and do what I'm capable of doing. I don't see it falling off; I see it getting better."
 
 
 
Who's Tuning In?
 The National Basketball Association is such the rage that the owners awarded Commissioner David Stern almost as much money as Michael Jordan makes. But people in baseball raise an intriguing and legitimate question:
If the N.B.A. is so far ahead of baseball in popularity among fans, why did its recent All-Star Game, with Jordan present for the first time in three years, draw an 11.7 television rating and baseball's All-Star Game, at the nadir of that sport's popularity last July with season attendance down by more than 20 percent, get a 13.9 rating?
 
 
 
Knoblauch Wins in Arbitration
 Arbitrators continued to be the players' favorite friends yesterday. Minnesota Twins second baseman Chuck Knoblauch became the latest player to win his salary arbitration case when Anthony Sinicropi, who heard the case Friday, awarded him his request for $4.67 million. The Twins argued for a $3.75 million salary for Knoblauch, who batted .333 and made $2,987,500 last year.
The outcome left the players with a 7-2 advantage in arbitration hearings with two cases scheduled for this week: Arthur Rhodes of Baltimore tomorrow and John Valentin of Boston on Tuesday. The last year the players prevailed in the majority of cases was 1990, when they had a 14-10 margin. In the first 20 years of salary arbitration, the players had a winning record only four other times.

HEADLINE: An Endowment Turns a Big Land Gift to Texas Into a Bonanza

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
Forty-thousand acres of rugged West Texas ranch land have been donated to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department in what officials say is by far the largest land gift to the state.
But the property, 62 square miles of canyons, bluffs and woodland plateaus, has another feature that caught the attention of state and local officials: a private endowment to maintain the property and offset the loss of local taxes. 
 Known as the Mesquite Ranch, the tract was donated last month by the Richard King Mellon Foundation, which operates a land conservation program and has made similar bequests of Civil War battlefields, wildlife habitats, and community open spaces in 25 states since 1988.
The ranch, located in Presidio County just north of the United States-Mexico border in the Chinati Mountains, is almost 50 times the size of Central Park and will become the second-largest component in the state's park system.
But it was the endowment, established by the previous owners, Heiner and Philippa Friedrich of Houston, that made the gift even more attractive.
The money will be used to maintain the property and to offset the loss of approximately $7,600 in property tax revenue to the county and local school districts.
For a major acquisition like the Mesquite Ranch to come with an endowment is "a new phenomenon nationwide," said Barry Tindall, director of public policy at the National Recreation and Park Association in Arlington, Va.
Usually only established parks receive financing from non-government sources, Mr. Tindall said, citing Central Park as an example. The Central Park Conservancy has raised more than $100 million since 1980 and is credited with doubling the number of park employees, supporting several education programs, and financing numerous restorations and improvements.
Some land gifts have been turned down because governments do not want to be saddled with the operating costs.
In Peoria, Ill., a conservationist's proposed gift of a 2,000-acre wildlife preserve was rejected by state officials who said they could not afford to make up an annual operating deficit of $300,000.
Andrew Sansom, the executive director of Texas Parks and Wildlife, said that the endowment accompanying the tract "signals a threshold change in how we go about land acquisition."
"At a time when states are giving local governments more and more responsibilities, we shouldn't be damaging their ability to pay for services," Mr. Sansom said.
"Our department has become increasingly business-like in terms of its operations," Mr. Sansom said. "Even though a gift like the Mellon Foundation's is one of the most spectacular things we can do for the state and for the future, it's a liability. To consider its operating impact prior to the time it's acquired is fundamental."
"Though this might be a new concept for us right now, in the future a pre-existing endowment could be a condition of acquisition," Mr. Sansom said.
Judge Jake Brisbin of Presidio County said that those involved in the gift "took the time to understand the tax implications on Presidio County."
"Border counties are the state's poorest," he said. "Add issues like high unemployment and illegal immigration, and our ability to provide even basic services is jeopardized." Though a higher tourism profile for Presidio County will be welcome, he added, "the last thing we need is a smaller tax base."

Gas-Loving, Go-Go Americans

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
"Small Is Beautiful," the classic little book on the economics of the 1970's by E. F. Schumacher, offered a central warning: energy was the most vulnerable resource. "If energy fails, everything fails," he warned. Yet Americans have already forgotten that era of fuel rationing, long gas lines and compact, fuel-efficient cars.
Today Americans are consuming gas at ever higher levels as they embrace sport utility vehicles that give them the air of desert warriors at the shopping mall. They zip past recently raised speed limits in glorified trucks hardly known for fuel economy. 
 But half the oil consumed in America is imported, up sharply from the 1970's, and a large amount comes from Saudi Arabia and other less stable nations. Few political leaders or experts, however, are worried: revolutions in oil-producing countries have led to much higher oil prices but have not disrupted the supply. A few experts do believe that a reckoning is inevitable and that Amreicans are woefully unprepared. AGIS SALPUKAS

HEADLINE: The Top Colleges Are Reporting Record Numbers of Applications

 BODY:
The nation's prestigious colleges are being flooded with record numbers of applications as high school seniors increasingly worry about getting into the top tier, admissions officers say.
Admissions officers from the Ivy League schools, Georgetown, Tufts, Stanford and other colleges are reporting that the number of applications has risen by at least 50 percent in the last decade, while the number of high school graduates has risen only in the last year as the children of the baby boom generation reach college age. 
 "The toughness this year is in the sheer number -- we can't take everybody," said Fred Hargadon, the dean of admissions at Princeton.
Top high school students appear to be sending out more applications than ever -- more than 10, instead of the 4 or 5 common a decade ago. Admissions officers said the increase was mostly likely driven by the same fears that have generated record numbers of students seeking early acceptance.
"There are definitely students who, if they would have applied 10 years ago or 5 years ago or even 3 years ago, would have had a better chance of getting in to the top tier," said Stephen Singer, director of college counseling at the Horace Mann School in the Bronx.
David Cuttino, dean of admissions at Tufts, said its increase of 8,500 applications from last year to 11,500 this year was unprecedented.
Admissions officers and high school guidance counselors suggested a variety of reasons for the increase: stepped-up recruitment by colleges seeking diversity; S.A.T. scores that were revised upward last April, giving students false hope; electronic applications forms on computer disks; and an increase in the number of 18-year-olds in the population. But the most common explanation is that students are worried about their prospects after graduation from college.
"The state of the economy and job market is probably scaring some people into focusing on recognized institutions," said Wayne Becraft, the executive director of the 8,400-member American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers.
Charles Deacon, the dean of admissions at Georgetown, also agreed that students today are more concerned about their economic well-being after graduation.
"Whereas 15 years ago a college degree kind of insured your success, right now it doesn't guarantee anything," said Mr. Deacon, who has seen the number of applications grow from 6,500 in 1991 to more than 10,000 this year at Georgetown.
Students are focusing on the application process earlier and becoming more competitive, counselors said.
"There's more anxiety, more concern," said Daphne Rhodes, who runs a college-counseling service in New Jersey, "with students worrying, 'Have I done the best to prepare myself? Am I going to present myself well? What kind of classes do I need to take? What should I be doing outside class?' "
At Harvard, which received a record 18,000 applications this year, more students are including props with their written applications to get attention. The dean of admissions, William Fitzsimmons, cited everything from videotapes to all the papers a student ever wrote to Harvard logos made of chocolate.
Jon S. Katzman, president of the Princeton Review, the nation's largest S.A.T. preparation program and the publisher of a guide to colleges, said students now think in terms of getting into any good school, rather than getting into their first choice.
"Ten years ago, students were stressed because they wanted to be the winner," Mr. Katzman said. "Now, they're stressed because they don't want to be the loser."

HEADLINE: Edmund G. Brown Is Dead at 90; He Led California in Boom Years

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD 

DATELINE: BEVERLY HILLS, Calif., Feb. 17

 BODY:
Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, the former Governor of California who fathered the state's modern economic boom with expansive government programs to build freeways, vast water systems and public universities open to all at low cost, died on Friday at his home here. He was 90.
Mr. Brown died of a heart attack, but had been ill for some time, said a granddaughter, Kathleen Kelly. 
 The burly and ebullient Mr. Brown, a Democrat, served two terms as Governor, from 1959 until 1967, turning back a challenge from former Vice President Richard M. Nixon in 1962. But a growing conservative mood and divisiveness within his own party over student unrest and the Vietnam War led to his defeat by a conservative Republican, Ronald Reagan, in 1966. The election effectively ended nearly a quarter of a century of public service for Mr. Brown and inaugurated a national political career for the former actor.
Mr. Brown's death comes as California is struggling to recover from a post-cold-war recession that has resulted in the paring back of many social programs he helped create.
As Governor, Mr. Brown symbolized better times in California, times that the historian Kevin Starr described as "an exhilarating period in which California assembled itself as the cutting edge of the American experiment."
Prof. Bruce E. Cain, associate director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California at Berkeley, said of Mr. Brown: "He was part of an era when growth was considered a good thing, when we could afford public services that would encourage people to come to California, to add to the tax base. Everything then had a golden aura to it."
In addition, Mr. Brown left a considerable personal political legacy. His only son, Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., also served two terms as Governor of California and ran for President in 1976, 1980 and 1992. But the younger Mr. Brown's philosophy of diminished expectations seemed directly at odds with his father's.
Mr. Brown's youngest child, Kathleen Brown, was the Treasurer of California and ran unsuccessfully for Governor in 1994 against the Republican incumbent, Pete Wilson.
As Governor, Mr. Brown epitomized an era when the American public seemed to have had a greater trust in its leaders to do the right thing, and in the capacity of government to shape the future. He came into office when the California economy was slumping after the Korean War, but the state's population was growing relentlessly.
He called for more, not less, government spending -- for transportation, parks, schools and reclamation projects. Two decades of unparalleled growth and prosperity followed.
Mr. Brown, a Roman Catholic, was a gregarious, plain-spoken man known for his advocacy of progressive and populist causes in general and for his strong opposition to the death penalty in particular. In the late 1950's, some Democrats thought he might make a good Presidential candidate, but his political career ended with his loss to Mr. Reagan in 1966.
Despite that defeat, Mr. Brown remained active, both as a lawyer and an author, producing two books that were sharply critical of Mr. Reagan's performance as Governor. In another book, he condemned the death penalty as barbaric.
Mr. Brown agonized and equivocated over the death penalty when he was Governor. He ruled on 59 last-ditch appeals from condemned convicts, commuting the sentences of 23 but allowing 36 to go to the gas chamber.
One who was executed was Caryl Chessman, the "red light bandit" who had robbed and sexually assaulted women on lonely mountain roads. With self-taught legal skills, Mr. Chessman staved off execution for more than a dozen years. Governor Brown at first stayed the execution several times, but finally let it proceed in 1960.
Mr. Brown, however, ultimately grew to loathe capital punishment. "The naked, simple fact is that the death penalty has been a gross failure," he wrote. "Beyond its horror and incivility, it has neither protected the innocent nor deterred the wicked." He said he felt it was punishment primarily inflicted on "the weak, the poor, the ignorant."
As Governor, Mr. Brown oversaw the creation of a state commission on fair employment practices and the passage of two fair-housing laws, pushed the development of expanded water supplies for Southern California and worked for the creation of jobs outside the military industry.
Under his administration the state produced its Master Plan for Higher Education, a landmark document that plotted the expansion of California's college system. During his eight years as Governor, the University of California added three new campuses and the state college system added six.
He also increased benefits for the unemployed, the blind and the elderly. And in this quintessential automobile state he was instrumental in the construction of 1,000 miles of freeways.
Edmund Gerald Brown was born in San Francisco on April 21, 1905, the son of Edmund Joseph and Ida Schuckman Brown. He was one of four children born to a businessman father who had moved to California in the wake of the gold rush -- not to mine gold, but to mine Californians' yearning for cigars, photo arcades, nickelodeons and shooting galleries. The elder Mr. Brown was Catholic, his wife Protestant, and their son's early years were filled with their spirited discussions about religion.
Eddie Brown went to a Catholic school, and it was there, as a 12-year-old orator at a World War I Liberty Bond rally, that he ended his speech with Patrick Henry's "Give me liberty or give me death." Classmates began calling him Patrick Henry Brown. The shortened name Pat stuck through the rest of his academic and political careers.
At Lowell High School, Pat Brown gave ample evidence of what was to come, running for 11 student offices and winning each time. But he lacked the money to attend college, so he went to work in his father's cigar store after high school and studied law at night. In 1927 he received a law degree from the San Francisco College of Law.
Although he was identified with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party for most of his life, Mr. Brown started his political career as a Republican, losing a campaign for a seat in the State Assembly in 1928. Four years later he changed to the Democratic Party, but his political fortunes did not immediately improve; in 1939 he ran unsuccessfully for District Attorney of San Francisco.
In 1940 he worked hard for the re-election of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Mr. Brown served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention that year; it was a role he continued to fill until the 1960's.
In 1943, Mr. Brown was elected District Attorney in San Francisco. He held that post until 1950, when he became Attorney General of California. He made his reputation in that post by investigating the scandal-ridden State Liquor Administration.
In 1958 he ran for governor against William F. Knowland, a right-wing Republican who had resigned from the United States Senate to make the race. Mr. Brown won by more than a million votes out of nearly five million cast.
Governor Brown once described his politics as "liberal and responsible" and as "reasonable, rational and realistic." He was very much a part of the bipartisan era of California politics, and shared the philosophy of one of his progressive Republican predecessors, Earl Warren, later Chief Justice of the United States.
"One had a suspicion Earl Warren was happy to see Pat Brown as Governor," said Mr. Starr, the historian, who is now the state librarian of California.
The high point of Mr. Brown's first term was probably the enactment in 1960 of the Master Plan for Higher Education, the cornerstone for the three-tiered system of more than 100 public colleges in California.
He also oversaw the beginning of the State Water Project, a huge system of dams and aqueducts that to this day provides irrigation for Southern California and makes the state's agricultural production the largest in the nation.
In 1962, after a bitter election campaign, Mr. Brown defeated Mr. Nixon by nearly 300,000 votes out of the more than 5.6 million cast. The defeat led Mr. Nixon to blurt his famous remark to reporters, "You won't have Dick Nixon to kick around anymore."
In 1966 Mr. Brown was upset in his bid for a third term by Mr. Reagan, then a political novice, who won by more than 900,000 votes out of six million cast.
Mr. Brown's loss came at a time of tumultuous civil unrest. The Watts section of Los Angeles still simmered after the racial riots there in 1965, and opposition to the Vietnam War was growing, particularly among young people. Some political analysts ascribed the defeat to a white backlash vote coupled with mounting voter concern over antiwar demonstrations at Berkeley and other campuses.
Many voters thought that the Governor had been too slow to move against the students and that Mr. Reagan, a hard-line conservative, would be better able to deal with them. Mr. Starr said Mr. Brown once told him that his political demise was rooted in his handling of the Chessman execution. In one of his last acts as Governor, he spared the lives of four condemned murderers.
Although he often seemed bumbling in public appearances, Mr. Brown was regarded by many Californians, Republicans as well as Democrats, as both a builder and a decent man.
"He was a builder, one of the governors responsible for laying the foundation that allowed California to take off the way it did," said Steven A. Merksamer, who was chief of staff to former Gov. George Deukmejian, a Republican.
Mr. Brown was honored by a special session of the State Legislature in 1992. But because of his failing health, he rarely appeared in public after that.
Mr. Brown is survived by his wife, the former Bernice Layne, whom he married in 1930. Besides his son, Edmund Jr., and daughter Kathleen, he is survived by two other daughters, Barbara Brown Casey and Cynthia Brown Kelly.

HEADLINE: THE POLITICAL TERRAIN;
Where the Government Is Kept at Arm's Length

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 17

 BODY:
When Congress approved the Goals 2000 education program two years ago, most state governments were delighted.
The program, setting national standards to improve the public schools, had been developed by the Bush Administration in conjunction with the nation's governors and embraced by President Clinton. It meant millions of new Federal dollars for strapped local school boards. 
 But New Hampshire so far has declined to apply for the $9 million in Federal grants to which it is entitled. Communities here, Gov. Stephen Merrill explains, simply do not need more money with Federal strings attached. That despite the fact that one-fifth of New Hampshire's schools do not meet the state's own minimum standards, and the state has no public kindergartens.
Outsiders who pay attention to New Hampshire only every four years, for the Presidential primaries, tend to think that such quirky principles are as outmoded as the giant textile mills that dominated the state's economy in the 19th century.
But Jere Daniell, a historian at Dartmouth College who specializes in the history and the mores of New England, argues that New Hampshire is now actually in the vanguard of American politics.
"The most powerful political force in America today is decentralization," Professor Daniell said, "and this is by far the most decentralized state."
In this respect, he added, "New Hampshire is the most radical state in the Union."
Indeed, New Hampshire residents prefer an arm's length relationship not just with Washington but also with Concord, their state capital. This is the only state besides Alaska without a general income or sales tax.
Money for schools, welfare and other services is raised mostly through local property taxes. In most instances, the authority to make final governmental decisions lies not with the State Legislature or even municipal councils but with town meetings.
The antipathy to Federal and state taxes is nothing new. Before the Revolutionary War, according to the Almanac of American Politics, New Hampshirites made fortunes poaching in the king's forests and smuggling to avoid taxes.
For the last 20 years or so, the opposition to taxes has been a decisive factor in Republican Presidential primaries here. Ronald Reagan, who won in 1980, favored an across-the-board tax cut, and his main opponent, George Bush, did not. Mr. Bush learned his lesson. Eight years later, he defeated Senator Bob Dole after signing a pledge not to raise taxes while Mr. Dole refused to do so.
So it should have been no surprise when taxes became the hot issue in this year's race. Last month, Steve Forbes caught fire with his proposal for a low, flat Federal income tax. Other Republican candidates have responded with tax-cut proposals of their own.
Since the 1960's, liberal Massachusetts to the south has attracted a larger share of high-technology businesses. Liberal Vermont to the west has become more of a center for tourism. But New Hampshire, with its low taxes and fewer state services, has prospered in a way that has outstripped its neighbors.
Since 1960, the population of New Hampshire, now about 1.2 million, has doubled, the fastest growth of any state in the Northeast. The poverty rate, 7.7 percent in 1994, is about half the national rate. The crime rate is the third-lowest in the nation, behind those of West Virginia and North Dakota. S.A.T. scores are high. The infant mortality rate is low. Per capita income is well above the national average. The unemployment rate, 3.2 percent at the end of last year, is well below the nationwide rate of 5.6 percent.
But New Hampshirites do not see these as particularly good times. Perhaps the reason is that, prosperous though the state is, its economy has not fully rebounded to where it was in the late 1980's.
It is unclear what the implications of this will be in the primary election on Tuesday -- whether, say, the voters will respond more to Mr. Forbes's flat tax or to Senator Dole's concentration on balancing the budget or to Patrick J. Buchanan's advocacy of trade restrictions.
But New Hampshire being New Hampshire, the economy will almost certainly be the decisive issue. In Iowa, conservative Christians controlled many of the caucuses, and issues like abortion and family values were central. In New Hampshire, according to Linda Fowler, a professor of government at Dartmouth who conducts public opinion polls, conservative Christians make up only about 10 percent of likely voters in the Republican primary.
One New Hampshirite, former Senator Warren B. Rudman, said Washington political analysts often incorrectly associated the state's voters with Meldrim Thomson Jr., the outspoken Governor of the 1970's who made news when he wanted to arm the National Guard with nuclear weapons, and with the archconservative Manchester Union Leader, the state's largest newspaper, which once described Martin Luther King Jr. as a tool of Communists.
Actually, Mr. Rudman said, the typical Republican voter in New Hampshire, though very conservative on economic issues, is quite moderate on social matters.
But there may not really be a typical Republican voter in New Hampshire, beyond the fact that almost all voters here are white, given a statewide black population that is only about 0.5 percent of the total.
Most of the state's people live within 50 miles of the Massachusetts line. Nashua, the second-largest city, with a population of 80,000, is basically an exurb of Boston, filled with young families attracted by the lower taxes and the less expensive real estate in New Hampshire. The largest city, Manchester, about 20 minutes north of Nashua on the turnpike, is a commercial center. The voters in this area tend to be less conservative on social issues than the rural voters who live north of Concord.
In the end, the outcome on Tuesday may turn on independent voters, who are allowed to vote in party primaries. They make up about 30 percent of the general electorate, compared with the 38 percent who are registered Republicans and the 31 percent who are registered Democrats.
The problem is that no one knows how many independents will vote in the Republican primary. If the proportion is only 15 percent or so of all the primary's voters, look for Mr. Dole and Mr. Buchanan to come out ahead. But if the proportion is up to 25 or 30 percent, then Mr. Forbes and Lamar Alexander can be expected to do well.

HEADLINE: Spacecraft Is Off on 3-Year Voyage to Asteroid

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Feb. 17

 BODY:
The space agency launched a spacecraft today on a three-year voyage to an asteroid that may contain clues to the birth of the solar system.
An unmanned Delta rocket blasted off at 3:43 P.M. with the craft, bound for the asteroid Eros, one of the largest asteroids orbiting the sun relatively close to Earth. The probe is expected to reach Eros in February 1999, after a journey of 1.3 billion miles, and become the first spacecraft to orbit an asteroid. 
 "We'll get the first really good close-up look at an asteroid," said a project scientist, Andrew Cheng of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.
The spacecraft, called Near, for the project's name, Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous, is to circle Eros for nearly a year, flying as close as 10 miles to its rocky surface. Eros, a potato-shaped asteroid, is estimated to be 25 miles long, 9 miles wide and 9 miles deep, and may contain materials dating to the origin of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago.
The next two months will be critical as the spacecraft hurtles farther from Earth and as its five science instruments are activated in stages. After that, it will be a matter of "keeping our noses to the grindstone and making sure we bring back the goods," Dr. Cheng said.
Early signals from the spacecraft indicate that it is on course and working well. The spacecraft is also expected to fly within 750 miles of another asteroid, Mathilde, in 1997, and then head back toward Earth to use its gravity to help put it on the same orbital plane as Eros.
Once at Eros, Near will measure the mass, density and composition of that asteroid and, the space agency hopes, provide a better understanding of how Earth and the other planets were formed. Scientists say they are not certain whether Eros is a fragment of a ruptured former planet or a primitive celestial body that never evolved.
The findings should also contribute to the study of how to keep asteroids from crashing into Earth and help determine whether it is feasible to send astronauts to an asteroid, a goal some scientists have espoused.
At $122 million, the spacecraft is one of the least expensive deep-space probes ever flown and is the first in a series of low-cost efforts in NASA's push for faster, cheaper and better designs in financially tight times.
"This is really an exciting and defining event for space science," said the agency's space science chief, Wesley Huntress Jr.
NASA's economizing effort limits the cost for spacecraft to $150 million and development time to three years. Johns Hopkins came in under on both counts. The total mission cost for Near is $223 million, including the cost of launching and four years of operations.
The program is to continue with the launching of a spacecraft every year or so, Mr. Huntress said, with the next one being the Mars Pathfinder, which is scheduled for takeoff to Mars in December.
The craft launch today was supposed to have been launched on Friday, but it was delayed by problems with the rocket-tracking system at Cape the Canaveral Air Station.

HEADLINE: Clinton Backing Vast Effort To Restore Florida Swamps

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
President Clinton has decided to endorse a huge project to protect the Everglades by spending hundreds of millions of dollars to take farmland out of production and restore a more natural flow of fresh water across Florida's swampy southern half, according to senior Administration officials.
Environmentalists have been urging such a project for years over intense opposition from the region's sugar cane growers. It would be one of the biggest ecological restoration efforts ever undertaken, the Administration officials said. 
 Over the next 10 to 20 years, its effects would be felt across a region bursting with some of the nation's fastest growing metropolitan areas, where tourism and agriculture vie in an economy that has grown at the expense of an aquatic ecosystem unlike any other on the planet.
The plan is expected to be announced by Vice President Al Gore on Monday at Everglades National Park, which contains the most pristine remnants of the vast marsh of saw grass that was largely drained earlier in the century, either to be turned into farmland or to supply cities with water and protect them from floods.
The Everglades restoration project has been in planning for three years, during continuous debate over its effects on agriculture, urban water supplies and the environment. This is the first time that the White House has given the enormous project its blessing or declared that the sugar industry must help pay for it, as environmentalists have been demanding for years.
The proposed expansion of existing efforts to reverse the Everglades' decline would be financed in part by fees imposed on the region's sugar industry, Administration officials said. For years, environmentalists, who blame sugar growers for much of the harm to the Everglades, have been campaigning to impose a two-cent tax on every pound of sugar produced in the Everglades region. The Administration is expected to endorse a one-cent tax, although other options have also been discussed.
Many elements of the Administration's plan, including any new fees on the sugar industry, would have to be approved by Congress, where the prospects for action this year are uncertain. But Administration officials noted that restoring the Everglades is a popular cause in the Florida Congressional delegation, and said they had high hopes of winning approval.
Administration officials called the new plan one of the most significant environmental efforts of the Clinton Presidency, surpassing in scope even the famous plan for managing the spotted owl habitat of the Pacific Northwest forests.
It calls for the Federal Government to spend an additional $500 million or more during the next several years, on top of the $100 million or so that Federal agencies already spend each year to protect the Everglades. The additional spending is a much bigger expansion than the Senate recently approved in passing a new farm bill, and it represents something of a bidding war, just before the Florida Presidential primaries, between the Administration and top Republicans, including Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas.
The White House decision to push ahead attests to the political potency that the Administration attributes to environmental issues, and to the importance of Florida in the Presidential campaign.
Environmental groups are welcoming the Clinton Administration's approach.
"We are talking about a lot of money, we are talking about a lot of land, and we are talking about ecosystem restoration on a scale we have never seen before anywhere in the world," said Ron Tipton, who is in charge of the Everglades project at the World Wildlife Fund.
In effect, the plan would try to erase much of the human signature that has been etched with levees, canals and pumping stations on the central and southern Florida landscape in the past half century.
"This is the replumbing of South Florida," said one senior Administration official.
At the core of the plan is what scientists call an urgent need to restore the natural hydrologic patterns before the Everglades disappear entirely.
In the past, water flowed south from the headwaters of the Kissimmee River to Lake Okeechobee, where it overflowed seasonally, spilling over the lake's southern shores and drifting in a broad, grassy sheet down the ever-so-subtle slope to Florida Bay.
Now, that terrain is crisscrossed by a thousand miles of canals and levees, some of which divert the system's water directly out to the Atlantic tides.
While it is impossible to bring about a complete return to the natural water cycles of a hundred years ago, with their extensive floods, studies have shown how to imitate some of the natural rhythms of the water flow, without which the vestiges of the Everglades would likely continue to dwindle.
According to specialists involved in the planning, it requires two things: an engineering project on the scale of the one that took decades to drain the land at mid-century, and the purchase of a huge swath of land, on the order of 100,000 acres, mostly at the southern end of the Everglades Agricultural Area below Lake Okeechobee.
"That land would be the heart being restored to the Everglades," said one senior Administration official.
The plan was worked out in the last month by a task force under Vice President Gore along with such high-level Administration officials as Carol M. Browner, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency; Alice M. Rivlin, Director of the Office of Management and Budget; Kathleen A. McGinty, Director of the White House Council on Environmental Quality; and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, as well as Florida State officials.
It would go well beyond the provisions of a landmark settlement on water quality reached between sugar companies and the state and Federal governments in 1993 and ratified by the Florida Legislature in the Everglades Forever Act of 1994. That called for a program of land acquisition and water treatment costing an estimated $700 million, including as much as $312 million contributed by the sugar companies, which over the years have been accused of polluting Everglades waters with fertilizer-laden runoff.
The companies have said that is all they are willing to spend. But the Administration is now seeking hundreds of millions of dollars more.
Administration officials called the new fees an attempt to recapture from the sugar industry "a fair share" of the perennial subsidies that have enabled it to take root in Florida.
Like other elements of the Administration's proposal, any new Federal fees on sugar would have to be approved by Congress, either in the farm bill now being debated or in separate legislation. The cost of the project is likely to be shared by Florida as well.
Despite opposition from farmers -- whose activities in the drained areas also include growing vegetables and raising cattle -- restoring the Everglades enjoys broad support in Florida, partly because the demise of the ecosystem has harmed offshore waters like Florida Bay, where fishing and tourism are major industries.
The White House's plan calls for a great deal of further scientific research into how the complex and delicate Everglades functions as an ecosystem. Questions of water flow, biological diversity, invasions by foreign species, and water monitoring need to be better understood before all the decisions can be made about how much land to buy, and where.
But some engineering work that is already under way on on the drawing boards will be accelerated under the plan, Administration officials said.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: PARTY ISSUES;
MANY REPUBLICANS FEAR PARTY RIFTS MAY COST ELECTION

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 17

 BODY:
Many prominent Republicans say they fear that the rancor in the Presidential contest has so magnified tensions among social and economic conservatives that the party risks unraveling much like the Democrats did in their failed efforts to win the Presidency in most of the 1970's and 1980's.
Buoyed by their takeover of Congress in 1994, Republicans had expected the party to rally on the Presidential level and win back the White House. Instead, many said they were worried that the emergence of Patrick J. Buchanan as an energetic competitor for the nomination, and the relative weakness of the front-runner, Senator Bob Dole, have brought to the forefront divisions that for years the party tried to play down. 
 Indeed, many leading Republicans -- conservatives and moderates alike -- who had criticized Democrats and the media for making too much of the party's rifts are now acknowledging publicly that they are very real. They complain that Mr. Buchanan's rise has given a louder voice to issues that have been anathema to the party, like protectionism, and to groups of voters like religious conservatives.
Despite such concerns, some Republicans say they are hopeful that the party's troubles are not permanent and may be driven by the heat of the campaign -- particularly in the early part of the race in Iowa and New Hampshire where the candidates feel obliged to attack early and often to prove their conservative credentials. They held out the possibility that a candidate would be nominated who can patch up the differences.
"We seem to be tearing ourselves apart," said Steven Merksamer, a lawyer and Republican consultant in Sacramento who is an adviser to the Dole campaign. "At some point, the leadership of our party has to step in and say, enough is enough, or we're going to be relegated to a very bad fate on Election Day."
Referring to President Reagan's rule that Republican candidates should never attack one another, Frank J. Fahrenkopf, the party's national chairman from 1983 to 1989, said: "They all seem to have forgotten Ronald Reagan's 11th Commandment. With the incessant negative attacks, they're down a slippery slope right now."
Even Gov. John M. Engler of Michigan, one of the party's most popular figures, said he was concerned that long-shot candidates like Morry Taylor, a tire manufacturer, had not allowed the major contenders to get their messages across at debates and other events. "They are not serious candidates," said Mr. Engler, who is staying neutral in the Republican primaries. "They are just taking up space."
Lamenting the "just staggering" volatility in the Republican field only three days before the nation's first primary in this state, Mr. Engler predicted that for the first time in years, whoever wins the primary here might not win the nomination. "We still have the history that you have to win New Hampshire," he said. "But this may well be the year that that goes by the boards."
Unlike the Democrats, who are known for divisive primary battles, Republicans usually have far less infighting and nominate a candidate who is favored by the political establishment. But now, Republicans seem to be behaving more like Democrats, with the intramural jabbing of the insurgent Mr. Buchanan reminiscent of Jesse Jackson's effort to take on Democratic leaders when he ran in 1984 and 1988.
"Now the Republicans have many of the same troubles the Democrats have had for years," William Kristol, a leading conservative who is publisher of The Weekly Standard, said. "There is a splintered field with candidates who represent mobilized blocks of the party who have no incentive to unite or compromise." He added, "Every Republican I've talked to is pretty morose."
Another telling sign of the unease appeared on Friday on the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal, an influential voice of economic conservatism. A lead editorial under the headline "McGovern Republicans" opened with this lament: "Standing at the edge of a potential 40-year reign in American politics, the Republican Party now finds itself pondering a detour into the political wilderness." Warning that the party could transform itself "into the mirror image of the Democrats," a party where "the only people who can be nominated are people who can't win."
The editorial was written before the candidates' forum here on Thursday night, which was marked by personal attacks and gave Republicans even more grist for their disenchantment.
His seven opponents were so combative that Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana scolded them over the unusually negative tenor of the campaign.
"This campaign has already so demeaned the political process in this country," Mr. Lugar said, "that Americans wonder what kind of a party we have and what kind of people aspire to the Presidency."
In an optimistic note, Mr. Fahrenkopf said, "We're a party that's been able to heal." He added: "If we have a nominee by the end of March, it does give us five or six months prior to the convention to mend the fences."
But others say the strains would not be so easily repaired. They complain that the public face of the Republican Party as the party that vowed to remake Congress and return power to the people has been replaced by the picture of Presidential candidates slashing one another. In fact, any mention of the Congress, and the House Republicans' vaunted Contract with America, is nowhere to be found in the dialogue among the candidates. Mr. Dole, for one, said recently that the Republican Congress needs to get moving and pass new laws.
Mr. Buchanan, a former commentator who finished second in the Iowa caucuses and is rising in the polls here, is viewed as contributing most to the unease, not only for his political beliefs but because of his history of inflammatory remarks that are anathema to many Republicans. Polls show that Mr. Buchanan has particularly high negative ratings even in his own party.
After Mr. Buchanan's controversial address at the Republican Convention in 1992, many Republicans tried to distance themselves from him. But his showing in Iowa raised Mr. Buchanan's profile in the party, and in American politics, and it is now the highest it has ever been.
Even some of the most conservative groups are in an uproar over Mr. Buchanan's ascension. "It's one thing to be very conservative, which I am, and another thing to be a little kooky," said the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, chairman of the Traditional Values Coalition. He expressed concern about Mr. Buchanan's "relationship with blacks and Asians and with Israel."
Mr. Sheldon said he had favored Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, who withdrew last week, and now will probably back Alan Keyes, a former State Department official.
The division between economic and social conservatives has become increasingly stark -- and more complex -- in recent months and is at the root of the problems the party now faces. Economic conservatives are most concerned about pushing proposals to spur the economy like cutting taxes and spending. But even differences have broken out among that wing of the party over the importance of balancing versus encouraging growth through proposals like a flat tax. Social conservatives contend that the central themes of the party should be issues like opposition to abortion.
Many well-known Republicans said that they viewed Mr. Dole as a leader who could help pull the party together. But they expressed surprise about his political weakness -- and questioned whether other contenders, like former Gov. Lamar Alexander, the third-place finisher in Iowa, would have the stature or the ability to pull the party together.
Some of these Republicans blame the candidacy of Steve Forbes, the publishing magnate, for dumping millions of dollars into negative television commercials. They also say his moderate views on social issues like abortion and gays in the military are at odds with many Republicans.
Richard Brookhiser, a senior editor at the National Review, a conservative magazine, said he was troubled about the state of the party given the Republican successes in 1994. "You have to be concerned if people are taking a winning formula and junking it," he said of the Republican candidates. The magazine had backed Mr. Gramm but cannot support Mr. Buchanan, he said, because of his "protectionist kick" or Mr. Alexander because "we are not really sure what he stands for."
"At the end of the day," Mr. Brookhiser added, "Dole may seem to be the best of the lot, but it isn't anything that makes you enthusiastic."
Several Republicans said the discordant state of the Republican field reminds them of the Democrats in 1984. They argue that Mr. Buchanan is not popular enough in the party to win the nomination, but, as Mr. Jackson did to Walter F. Mondale in 1984, he could stay in the race and try to pull the party to his positions -- and leave the nominee damaged in the general election.
Some Republicans said the only option for the party was to let the primaries play out and see what happens. "What can be done about it?" Mr. Kristol asked. "It's too late in the day to draft Colin Powell."

HEADLINE: Clinton Urged To Cite Mexico For Drug Flow

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Armed with a flood of intelligence showing that Mexico has become a huge conduit for cocaine, methamphetamines, marijuana and heroin sold in the United States, Federal narcotics officials are urging the Clinton Administration to drop Mexico from a list of countries making progress against drug trafficking.
If the Administration takes such a drastic step against Mexico -- and the odds are still against it though a final decision has not been made -- it would almost certainly be accompanied by a waiver that would allow Mexico to continue receiving aid. 
 But the effect would be to brand Mexico as a narco-state like Colombia, Bolivia and Peru.
The Administration has been willing to use certification as a weapon against drug-producing countries. Some officials credit last year's decertification of Colombia, albeit with a waiver that allowed aid to continue, as a pivotal step that prodded the Government to arrest several top figures in the Cali cocaine cartel.
"We've used certification before in the case of Colombia where we knocked the legs from underneath the Cali cartel, and it is under review now in the case of Mexico," a White House official said today.
The dynamics of the discussion over Mexico, and an equally sharp debate about how to deal with Colombia this year, are shaped by a provision of the Foreign Assistance Act that requires the President to announce by March 1 each year which nations will be officially listed, or certified, as cooperating in fighting drugs. Those determined to be failing to make such efforts can be decertified, but can get a "vital national interest" waiver.
Colombia continues to be part of the certification battle. If the Administration determines that Colombia is no longer cooperating and decertifies it, some officials say the move could be a final blow to President Ernesto Samper, who this week was formally charged with financing his presidential campaign with more than $3 million in Cali cartel funds.
Moreover, decertification would open the possibility of trade sanctions against legitimate Colombian industries like flowers, coffee and sugar.
In the case of Mexico, denying certification would anger the Mexican Government. Mexican officials in Washington said they refused to recognize the legitimacy of the certification process and viewed it as an unjustified intrusion into Mexico's internal affairs.
But certifying Mexico as making progress on drug enforcement seems likely to create political repercussions for the Clinton Administration at the start of the Presidential election campaign.
Lawmakers in both parties have criticized Mexico's efforts as inadequate. Some, like Senators Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican, and Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, have sponsored legislation urging the Administration to decertify Mexico.
At the same time, a growing number of Federal narcotics officials express frustration over what they view as a preoccupation by American policymakers with economic stabilization and trade issues, while they play down the enormous surge of Mexican drug trafficking and its toll in crime, misery and corruption on both sides of the border.
Narcotics officials have issued a stream of reports detailing the growth of the Mexican drug cartels.
At first, the reports say, the Colombian organizations hired Mexican smuggling gangs to ferry drugs across the border for delivery to Colombian distributors in the United States. But in recent years, the trade has undergone a transformation.
Increasingly, Colombians pay the Mexican rings not with cash but with drugs, usually a pound of cocaine for each pound brought across the border. As a result, the Mexicans have turned into large-scale dealers, acquiring their own distribution territories in the United States. A few Mexican traffickers have grown into multibillon-dollar dealers with extensive contacts in the Government and the police, law officials say.
Some Federal drug enforcement experts fear that Mexico may be only a few years away from a point of no return when drug cartels have so deeply penetrated the country's criminal justice and political systems that anti-drug and anti-corruption efforts have little chance of success.
These officials are pressing for a tougher approach now, arguing that a conditional decertification would send a necessary rebuke southward, in effect demanding more aggressive steps against drug trafficking.
But using the annual certification as a weapon against Mexico is colliding with longstanding American foreign policy goals. Some State Department officials oppose stripping Mexico of its certification on grounds that it would undercut the relationship between the Administration and the Government of President Ernesto Zedillo, who longtime drug enforcement officials say is seriously committed to battling his country's traffickers.
Moreover, traditional architects of American policy in the State Department contend that the central objective of American policy in Mexico rests on strengthening the Mexican economy. This was also the rationale behind the emphasis on the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Administration's decision last year to sidestep Congress in arranging a $20 billion rescue package to help keep Mexico from defaulting on its obligations.
Denying certification, these officials have argued, could only weaken the Government of Mr. Zedillo when he has demonstrated progress against the drug trafficking elite. Administration officials said President Clinton, in meetings with Mr. Zedillo in Washington in October, expressed the Administration's desire for tangible steps against narcotics trafficking.
Those discussions, in which the Mexican President is said by officials to have voiced his own concerns over drug trafficking as a national security issue, have been followed by closer cooperation between American and Mexican drug enforcement units on the Southwest border and by concrete actions, like last month's arrest of Juan Garcia Abrego, the Mexican drug lord on the F.B.I.'s most wanted list.

FILTERS (I)
Offensive Yes, Indecent No
Reviewing the telecommunications law signed recently by President Clinton, a Federal district judge in Philadelphia upheld the ban on "patently offensive" material that might be transmitted over computer networks in a manner accessible to minors. But Judge Ronald L. Buckwalter temporarily blocked enforcement of the ban on transmission of "indecent" material, agreeing with civil liberties groups, which had sued, that the provision was unconstitutionally vague. A swift judicial review is planned.
Earlier in the week, the on-line service Compuserve said it would restore access to 200 sex-related computer data bases that it had recently blocked and would provide subscribers with software that could be used to filter material. The company said it had decided that censorship should begin at home and not with the government. The change puts Compuserve, which is owned by H & R Block, on the same footing as its rivals America Online and Prodigy. 

FILTERS (II)
Weighed and Found Wanting
Trying to head off Government-imposed ratings and at the same time respond to growing complaints about the sexual and violent content of some programming, the four major television networks want to develop a self-imposed rating system similar to what the film industry employs. Fox said it was close to adopting the ratings regardless of whether the other networks went along. The industry ratings might then become the basis on which viewers could block certain types of programming, using the V-chip that the new telecommunications law requires all new television sets to carry. Network officials hope to have the ratings system in place before they meet with President Clinton later in the month.
(Table gives the current ratings for motion pictures)
 
POLITICS AND THE ECONOMY
Republicans Just Say No
The White House wanted the New York investment banker Felix G. Rohatyn to become vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Mr. Rohatyn wanted it even more, campaigning vigorously for the post. But Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee made clear they would not approve the nomination, and the Administration backed off. The Clinton team complained that the Republicans were playing political games; the Republicans responded that Mr. Rohatyn, a managing director at Lazard Freres, was too far outside the economic mainstream and too unconcerned about inflation. The name-calling came amid a spate of fresh data that showed the economy was slowing somewhat sharply and that inflationary pressure was virtually nonexistent.

BREAKUPS
Dial to Split in 2
After 17 acquisitions since 1981, John W. Teets, head of the Dial Corporation, announced that the company would divide in two, with one company providing travel services and the other offering consumer products. The travel services include Travelers Express money orders, a cruise line and a majority stake in Greyhound Lines of Canada. The consumer products include Dial soap, Breck shampoo, Armour Star canned meats, Purex detergents and Brillo scouring pads. The plan fell short with investors, as Dial's stock dropped xx, to xxx, on Friday.

LIABILITIES
Dow Corning Wins a Round
In a victory that could help Dow Corning emerge from bankruptcy protection and may also provide more money to plaintiffs in breast-implant cases, a Michigan jury ruled that 30 insurance companies must provide the company with about $400 million in liability coverage. Dow Corning, a joint venture of Dow Chemical and Corning Inc., sought protection from creditors in May, saying it was overwhelmed with health claims related to implants. The company previously settled with other insurers to receive about $1 billion of coverage.
 
THE NEW YORK ECONOMY
A Call for Billions
A major planning group said billions of dollars of improvements were needed in transportation, education and other areas to avoid long-term decline in the New York metropolitan area. The Regional Plan Association said the problem had shifted from managing growth to "finding growth" and warned that if the commitment was not made to make improvements, "We're going to be left behind."

AIDS
Seeking Industry Cooperation
Federal health officials released a blueprint for encouraging development of an AIDS vaccine, hoping to revive corporate interest in the project. The number of companies involved in trying to develop a vaccine has declined in recent years. The blueprint will spell out in advance the specific scientific guideposts that must be met to propel a vaccine along the licensing path.
 
COMPUTERS
Sour Taste at Apple
For the first time, Apple Computer suspended payment of a quarterly dividend and said it did not foresee one in the near future. The announcement was widely viewed as the first step by the new chairman and chief executive, Gilbert F. Amelio, in turning around the ailing computer maker. Apple also disclosed details of Mr. Amelio's compensation: he will receive a minimum salary and bonus of $2.5 million annually and could get as much as $10 million a year.

Frank J. Biondi Jr., ousted last month from Viacom by its chairman, Sumner M. Redstone, has been invited by Edgar Bronfman Jr. to lead the team running MCA, people involved in the discussions said. All the principals in the talks have declined to comment, but those in the know say Mr. Biondi was offered the post of chief executive at MCA. The president of MCA, Ron Meyer, who was recruited by Mr. Bronfman from Creative Artists, is generally viewed as long on Hollywood skills but on less familiar ground in corporate finance.

HEADLINE: The Training's for a Real Job (Cooking)

BYLINE: By KAREN BERMAN 

 BODY:
THINGS had gotten bad for Alston Duncan. A single parent with a young son, he was laid off from his job as a cook in a nursing home and after searching in vain for another job that would enable him to have child care, he wound up on welfare, a client of the Aid to Families With Dependent Children program.
"I had to take care of my son," the New Haven resident said simply. 
 Then he heard a radio announcement, an advertisement for Connecticut Hospitality Careers training. "I went down there," he said, completed a 12-week course and got a job at Splash, a Westport restaurant. This time, when the waterfront restaurant laid off most of its kitchen staff (the summer rush was over), Mr. Duncan was one of two cooks chosen to stay on.
"It helped me a lot," Mr. Duncan said of his training. "A lot of things I do at Splash I learned at school."
Connecticut Hospitality Careers has been training students like Mr. Duncan for the past five years, and with the state's new 21-month limit on A.F.D.C., the program is likely to become increasingly popular.
According to Tad Graham-Handley, vice president and chief operating officer of the Connecticut Culinary Institute, which runs the program, an average of 87 percent of enrollees graduate and get jobs. And, he said, the demand for food service workers, both cooks and bakers, is expected to increase well into the next century.
"With welfare reform, people are looking for programs they can complete in a relatively short period of time," said Julie Watson, assistant director of the Meriden-Middlesex Regional Workforce Development Board, one of nine public/private agencies in the state that administer funds for training programs.
"A lot of the fields that people might go into with the amount of training we offer are flat," said Ms. Watson, whose agency uses Federal Job Training Partnership Act moneys to underwrite training programs. "We're funding this program because the data show growth in the food service field."
The regional boards contract with vocational schools and training services, like the Farmington-based Connecticut Culinary Institute, to run their programs. So far, seven of the boards have made contracts with the culinary institute at a cost of $35,000 per 12-week class of 10 students. Some 500 students have completed the program since its inception.
"This program works," said Mr. Graham-Handley. "The payback period on this program is very short for the taxpayer." Students often have jobs lined up even before they graduate.
"They really get a lot of support in a lot of different ways," said Julie Barrett, manager of contract training for the program.
"We're taught all the basics," said Tony Pina. "Theory and practice go hand in hand." As he spoke, displayed trays of muffins and apple tarts, the result of an early-morning baking session.
Classes are conducted in various locations -- Hamden, Hartford, New London, Torrington, Middletown, Norwalk and Waterbury. Mr. Graham-Handley and his staff have found that church kitchens make good teaching areas. The congregations, which represent a spectrum of faiths, are happy to do their part to help, he said, and they usually offer their kitchens free of charge. Connecticut Hospitality Careers reimburses its hosts for utilities. All the enrollees are poor and at least 65 percent suffer from other "barriers to employment," the Federal training bureaucracy's term for those who did not complete high school, are deficient in basic skills, have received welfare, are disabled or have a history of substance abuse or incarceration. About half of the students are on some form of welfare.
Enrollees vary in background and skill level. Some are simply victims of the sluggish economy while others are beset by a variety of problems. Some have experience in food service while others have only cooked at home.
Diane Lambert, for example, had worked in a meat business for 24 years when she was laid off in 1991. After an unsuccessful search for a comparable job, she decided to change directions because, as she put it, with a family to care for, "most of the time I was in the kitchen anyway." "I figured I might as well make a career of it." Weeks before graduation Ms. Lambert landed a job at the Hometown Buffet in Hamden and soon was promoted to head its pantry department.
"Every day you have to learn something new," she said. "You have to keep your mind open."
The students start by learning basic knife techniques and sanitation procedures and move on to sauces, stocks, spices, roasting, braising, breads, pastry, presentation and other kitchen basics. Field trips to restaurants and food purveyors supplement their classwork.
Within a few weeks they are helping to manage inventory and taking turns cooking entire meals, which are eaten and critiqued by the group. One day the menu might consist of sauteed halibut with citrus beurre blanc served with new potatoes, asparagus and baby carrots. The next day it might be cream of broccoli soup, New York strip steak, broiled potatoes and cheesecake with raspberry sauce.
Basic math skills and knowledge of measures and equivalents are polished. By the end of the course, all the students are sprouting French culinary terms. The curriculum, however, covers more than recipes.
"The cooking is extremely important here but at least as important is professionalism," said Mr. Graham-Handley. Students review job-seeking skills, going through mock interviews, preparing resumes and cover letters, and contacting prospective employers.
On-the-job skills emphasize punctuality and team work.
"We have all these key words: control, discipline and respect," explained Ms. Barrett, a former head chef.
At the center of these lessons is the chef-instructor. "The chef-instructors are part Mother Teresa, part George Patton and part Escoffier," said Mr. Graham-Handley, a former executive chef.
At a recent session conducted in Hamden, Gary Roberts was in charge as eight students carried out eight assignments. The chef fielded questions about everything from kiwi Bavarian to the next day's assignments.
"I wouldn't trade this job for anything in the world," said Mr. Roberts.
"Chef Roberts helps out and he makes sure you remember," said Michael Cohens of New Haven, in the midst of biscuit making. "When the test comes you can't say, 'I don't remember.' " Mr. Cohens explained that although he had never been very good at taking exams, in this course he has scored high on every test.
The hospitality program is required to follow its students' progress for 90 days, after which, said Mr. Graham-Handley, most graduates "are on their way and don't require follow-up."
Ms. Barrett, however, sometimes keeps in touch with her graduates long after the required time period. "If there's an individual who has special needs, we continue to follow up," she said.
Graduates find jobs in various places from restaurants to hospitals to nursing homes. Some 30 graduates now work at the Foxwoods High Stakes Bingo and Casino in Ledyard.
The program does not claim to turn out seasoned chefs in 12 weeks. "It will take years for the students to perfect their skills," said Ms. Barrett. The class exposes them to the techniques they will use and to the protocols of the workplace, she explained.
Tony McFadden had started as a dishwasher and worked his way up to salad and grill cook at several New Haven restaurants. He credited his new job at Sports Haven in New Haven to the comprehensive training he received from Connecticut Hospitality Careers. "I never made soups in my life. I learned soups, sauces and baking. Now I've got the hands-on experience."

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: Robert J. Sternberg;
Intelligence in All Its Interactive Aspects

BYLINE: By MELINDA TUHUS 

 BODY:
ROBERT J. STERNBERG, 46, who is IBM Professor of Psychology and Education Psychology at Yale University, got his undergraduate degree at Yale, his Ph.D. at Stanford, then returned to Yale, where he has been ever since.
In 1988 he published "The Triarch ic Mind," which discusses three kinds of intelligence: analytical, practical and creative. (His latest book, "Successful Intelligence," is due out this year.) 
 Recently, he has challenged the conclusions in "The Bell Curve," Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray's 1994 book about race and intelligence. Nor is he an admirer of standard methods of intelligence testing -- the Scholastic Aptitude Test developed by the Educational Testing Service, for example.
Dr. Sternberg discussed his views in a recent interview in his office at Yale. Following are excerpts from that conversation.
Q. What is intelligence?
A. I call it mental self-management, the manner in which we order and make sense of the events around us or within us.
Q. How did you get interested in this field?
A. I had a negative experience as an undergraduate; I wanted to major in psychology, but I got a C in the intro course. I wasn't good at memorizing, and that's what the course required. So I switched to math. And fortunately, I did even worse. So I switched back to psychology, and, in the upper level courses and in my whole career since, I've never had to memorize anything.
It got me thinking: the system means that you miss a lot of good kids, conversely we get people who are not necessarily the right ones.
Q. What is the triarchic theory?
A. According to the theory, there are three principal aspects of intelligence: analytical -- the ability to analyze, judge, evaluate, compare and contrast; creative -- the ability to create, design, invent, originate, imagine, and practical -- the ability to use, apply, implement, put into practice. Although each can be looked at individually, they are best understood in interaction, since most tasks require a combination of skills.
Q. Does your theory complement or contradict Howard Gardner's theory of seven intelligences?
A. His theory specifies domains of talent: linguistic, logical/mathematical, spatial, musical, bodily/kinesthetic, interpersonal and intrapersonal. It suggests fields of human endeavor. In contrast, the triarchic theory specifies uses of human knowledge for analytical, creative or practical purposes. The two theories are compatible, and in fact, we collaborated to create a program called Practical Intelligence for Schools.
Q. What did you learn?
A. That analytical, creative and practical intelligences can all be developed. People who are successful are those who figure out their strengths and then find ways of capitalizing on them. In the areas they are not good at, they learn enough to get by. The critical thing is to figure out what you have to offer and then make the most of it. But that's not how schools teach at all.
Q. You are said to advocate "intelligent use of intelligence tests." What do you mean by that?
A. We need to expand the kinds of abilities we measure. The kind of test I use measures analytical ability but also creative and practical abilities.
We have both multiple choice and essay and we find that people who do well on one often are not the same people who do well on the other. We also have verbal, quantitative and figural -- geometric with no words or numbers -- to measure each of the kinds of intelligence.
Q. What did your tests reveal?
A. People who are high creative and high practical were a much more diverse group. The high analytical were mostly white and high income or middle class. The former group had not been seen by their schools as particularly smart. The system is set up to benefit one kind of person, but when you get out in the world it's the creative and practical skills that matter a whole lot more.
Q. Have you put this finding into practice in your research work?
A. We ran a summer program at Yale and recruited high school students nominated by their schools in each of the three areas of intelligence, as well as "high balanced" and "low balanced," meaning they were high or low in all three areas. They all took an advanced placement course in psychology at Yale. But there were different classes based on the different kinds of intelligence. What we found, not surprisingly, is that if you're put in a course that matches your ability, you do better. The only group that preferred the memory course was the "low balanced" group.
Q. For a country that has a history of valuing practical skills, how did we get to this point of focusing on and rewarding just one kind of intelligence, which is not very practical?
A. The system perpetuates itself. For example, people who work at E.T.S. are high-S.A.T. types. People who do well in the system stay, and those who don't do well leave or are kicked out.
Q. You worked at E.T.S. in the summer of 1970. How have tests changed since then?
A. The testing industry is a dinosaur. The first Wechsler adult intelligence scale test came out in 1939, before the Univac computer. In the computer industry if you don't innovate quickly you are dead. But if you don't have competition you don't have to innovate, and that's what's happened with the testing industry.
Q. Another of your areas of research is gifted individuals. What is the problem there?
A. Gifted education is always the first thing to be cut, because people say these kids can get by without special programs. Why we blow off our gifted kids I don't understand.
The biggest problem we have as a society is that today we have to be super-competitive. In global educational competition we don't do well. Our economy is a mess, our political system's a mess. If we don't get with the program we are not going to be competitive.
Q. Do you see a connection between your work and the recently popular notion of "emotional I.Q."?
A. The regulation of emotions is part of translating intelligence into success. Practical and creative intelligence are very important in both interpersonal and international relations.
Q. You're a prolific author. Do you attribute that mainly to analytical intelligence, or do the creative and practical play a significant role?
A. It's an interplay. First you need to have ideas -- that's the creative part. Then you have to know which are good ideas -- that's analytical. The practical is knowing how to reach a given audience and to write something people will want to read.
Q. About Herrnstein and Murray's "Bell Curve," how would you summarize your critique of their book?
A. There is nothing new in their book. Their book is intellectually dishonest. One thing they do is equate correlation with causation, even though they say they don't do that.
One example of that is when they point out that African Americans consistently score 15 points lower on S.A.T.'s than whites, and conclude from that that race is a causal variable. They discuss in detail only one of seven studies on the genetic versus environmental origins of the differences. The other six do not support a genetic interpretation, and the one they do discuss is equivocal.
Their own data do not show that the difference in I.Q. scores is genetic: when they controlled for I.Q. differences, they found telling environmental differences in which blacks were much more likely to be in poverty, to have low birth-weight babies.
Q. Your books don't get the kind of media play as "The Bell Curve." Though often negative, the publicity itself gave their theory more credibility. How do you respond to that?
A. There is pressure to be outrageous. My work is not outrageous enough.
Q. So how do you get the word out?
A. Well, I wrote an introductory psychology textbook that came out last January, called "In Search of the Human Mind." It sold over 40,000 copies in its first edition, which I'm told is very good for a book of that type.
And of course I hope this new book, "Successful Intelligence," will get more publicity. It's about what works in real life, not about what you write on tests.

HEADLINE: Plan for Lilco Encounters A New Obstaclte

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
DAYS after gaining conditional support from Suffolk Republican leaders for Gov. George E. Pataki's plan to cut electric rates 12 percent, the Long Island Power Authority has lost support in Nassau County.
The setback, which involves a tax problem, illustrated the one-step-forward-one-step-back aspects of a complex plan that continues to receive mixed receptions. 
 Nassau County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, one of the plan's earliest supporters, said he was withdrawing his backing in protest over the authority's proposed solution for a $500 million tax liability that Suffolk faces for overassessing the Shoreham nuclear power plant.
Leaders of the authority and the Suffolk Republicans tentatively agreed this month on a so-called split rate, in which Suffolk would receive 1 percent less in rate reductions than Nassau over 30 years, to make up for the overassessments.
The agreement was the basis for Suffolk's tentative support of the plan for a partial public takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company.
Mr. Gulotta insisted that any refund be made in one payment and be used to lower electric rates immediately. He said the 30-year term was too long and unfair to Nassau residents, who received none of the benefits but paid higher electric rates because of the excess taxes on the defunct plant. The assessment on the $5.5 billion plant, the subject of a suit by Lilco, produced hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes for Suffolk, the Town of Brookhaven and the Shoreham-Wading River School District from the mid-70's to 1992.
In 1992 the utility sold the completed but unopened plant to the authority for $1 under a plan to shut it forever because of safety concerns. The Brookhaven assessors set the property-tax rates.
Since 1992 the authority has made payments in lieu of taxes equal to what Lilco would have paid, and it, too, is eligible for refunds.
The question of how much, if anything, Suffolk should pay has been a troubling obstacle for the plan, and that problem led to the rift with Nassau. Last year Suffolk embraced an earlier plan from the authority for a complete takeover, largely because it would have forgiven the tax liability.
Under the new authority plan, which Mr. Pataki endorsed in December, Lilco would sell its generators and gas business to separate companies. The authority would sell up to $4.5 billion in tax-exempt bonds to buy the transmission and distribution system and refinance Lilco debt, much of it related to Shoreham.
On Feb. 28 leaders of the authority are to ask their 15-member board to authorize talks with Lilco. Even opponents of the plan said they expected that the trustees would approve the move. Mr. Pataki appointed the chairman, James F. Gill, and eight trustees.
Mr. Gill seemed to have achieved a breakthrough when Suffolk County Executive Robert J. Gaffney and other top Suffolk Republicans endorsed the authority's efforts. Mr. Gaffney had been noncommittal.
Some politicians said they believed that the plan was doomed without Suffolk's support. But Nassau support, which officials had assumed, is equally critical.
The qualified endorsement in Suffolk followed a meeting on Feb. 9 among Mr. Gill; other leaders of the authority; Mr. Gaffney; the Presiding Officer of the County Legislator, Donald R. Blydenburgh, Republican of Smithtown, and the county's Republican leader, John Powell of Brookhaven.
Mr. Gaffney said after the meeting that he supported the concept and process in the authority plan. He said the plan was best understood as a concept, because it was being formulated and did not have final costs.
A leading critic and a member of the power authority, Richard M. Kessel, said lowering the status of the plan to concept or idea showed that the initiative was in disarray. Mr. Kessel said the plan was dead, because there is no public support to break up Lilco, among other reasons.
Officials from the authority have had other private meetings to promote the plan. Mr. Gill addressed the board of the Long Island Association last week in an effort to reverse or soften the business group's earlier rejection of the plan.
Mr. Gaffney and Mr. Gill said after their meeting on Feb. 9 that they had made progress toward resolving the tax case, in which Lilco is seeking $500 million for overassessments from 1984 to 1992. Such an award would compel major borrowing to avoid immediate sharp property-tax increases in Suffolk and Brookhaven. The blow would fall hardest on Brookhaven, a Republican stronghold where Mr. Gaffney and Mr. Powell live.
Mr. Gaffney said the county had agreed to allow the authority to seek a negotiated settlement as part of its negotiations with Lilco. "Suffolk County is embracing efforts of Lipa to affect a plan leading to a settlement of the tax case," he said.
Mr. Gaffney and Mr. Blydenburgh said they would support a settlement that would reduce electric rates less in Suffolk than in Nassau. Mr. Gaffney said he would give final support only if the size and term of the split rate were set to the county's satisfaction.
Suffolk Democrats denounced the proposal for a split rate. "We're one region," the minority leader of the County Legislature, Maxine S. Postal, Democrat of Amityville, said. "What happens to some of us affects all of us. Suffolk spent a lot of money to stop Shoreham from opening. Nassau never spent a penny."
Democrats said the law that created the authority specified that the tax claim would be forgiven in the event of a takeover. Mr. Gill said forgiveness was possible only for the years before 1987, the year that the law that created the authority took effect.
Mr. Gill said that a split-rate solution would be "rough justice," but that it was "the most painless, gentle way."
"It's a question of how do you settle a lawsuit," he said.
The case is before Justice Thomas M. Stark of State Supreme Court in Riverhead, who presided over a case involving taxes on Shoreham covering from 1976 to 1983. Justice Stark set the award for Lilco in that case at $81 million, including interest. The Appellate Division of State Supreme Court later upheld that decision.
Potentially more difficult issues lie ahead as the authority nears the opening of formal talks with Lilco on the plan. Lilco has said that it is ready to cooperate in any plan that would lower electric rates, but that it has to agree with the authority on a long list of financial questions that would lead to its dismantling as a Long Island utility.
In an action notable for its timing, the State Public Service Commission ordered Lilco last week to show why the utility should not take steps to refund more than $100 million to its customers. The steps would include a prompt refund, through lower rates, of the $81 million that Suffolk paid Lilco last month for overassessing Shoreham from 1976 to 1983.
The P.S.C. action, which appeared to place Lilco in a pincer between the state regulators and the power authority, was the first by the commission to address Long Island electric rates since a new chairman who was named by Mr. Pataki, John F. O'Mara, took office.
Noting that Lilco rates were "a persistent source of customer displeasure and an obstacle to the economic well-being of Long Island," the commission ordered a thorough review "to examine the rates, charges, rules and regulations of the Long Island Lighting Company for electric service."
It gave Lilco 25 days to answer a series of questions.
The interest in immediate rate relief appears to modify a policy aimed at paying off Shoreham-related debt to keep future rates stable. "Lipa's pending proposal to acquire Lilco and sell off portions of its operations," the P.S.C. said, "is designed to address long-term rate and structural issues."
The statement recognizes that if the plan succeeded all Lilco debts would be settled and the issue of how the customers would pay off the costs related to Shoreham would be moot. In addition, the P.S.C. would no longer set rates.
In its initial response Lilco said it "shared the commission's concern about lowering electric rates" and would cooperate to find "new ways to lower rates and to maintain the programs and plans already in place to provide long-term rate relief."
But by the time the utility makes a formal response it may be involved in separate talks with the power authority to set a price for its assets.
Authority leaders would then seek a final vote from the trustees on the plan. Approval would also be needed from Mr. Pataki; Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, Democrat of Manhattan, and the majority leader of the State Senate, Joseph L. Bruno, Republican of Rensselaer.

HEADLINE: Son Takes the Reins From His Father

BYLINE: By JANE JULIANELLI 

 BODY:
NOT many sons have overpowered their father in the family business. But not many men are dynamos like Michael Smith of J. Richard Smith Advertising in Melville.
At 34, Mr. Smith is running JRS singlehandedly, three years after he became president. Last May his father, Jerry Smith, formally retired. 
 The change of leadership from one generation to another is characteristic of many Long Island companies, as Long Island's population and businesses age. While the elevation of Michael Smith is indicative of this trend, the step is also different because, in this case, a son won total control.
"Michael and I sat down and we decided that I would retire," said Jerry Smith, 62, who built the business over 32 years into the largest independent advertising agency on the Island and second to Greenstone & Roberts, a public company. It was a decision Mr. Smith described as "torture."
"Financially, the deal was O.K.," he said. "Mentally and physically, it was not."
JRS, with over $40 million in gross billings last year, handles 40 accounts, including Seaman's Furniture, Dale Carnegie and Associates and the Chyron Corporation, with 60 percent of its account base on Long Island.
In their offices on Broad Hollow Road in Melville, JRS employs 35 people in production, copy and design, broadcast production, marketing, media and administration. Using the latest computer equipment, the company plans campaigns and writes, designs and executes ads for print and television.
"When you meet Michael you understand more clearly that Michael has to work within his own framework and his own thought process," Mr. Smith said of his son. "And I felt that, the last couple of years."
Jerry Smith now goes to the 6,500-square-foot office complex of JRS on Broad Hollow Road to consult with Michael when Michael needs him.
"I used to come in in the morning just to sit in an office," said Mr. Smith, "because after 30 years doing something, not to do it, is very, very difficult.
Mr. Smith said he had made his decision to retire for the good of the business, and not because he had reached a certain age. It is a philosophy that strikes a concordant note throughout the Smith family.
Rhonda Gastman, Jerry Smith's daughter, has a similar philosophy. "My father felt that Michael can take the business a lot further than he could take it," said Mrs. Gastman, 38. "Michael is more opinionated, bolder, maybe more argumentative."
Mrs. Gastman started in the business at 14. She worked at JRS until last year, starting as a paste-up artist and working up to assistant art director and production manager.
She met her husband, Wayne Gastman, when both were working at JRS and Michael was in high school.
In 1983 Michael, fresh out of Bentley College in Waltham, Mass., joined his father, sister and brother-in-law in the firm.
"Eventually the business was going to go over to the two of them," Jerry Smith said. "This was my dream. I wanted my son and my son-in-law working together and living happily ever after."
While both worked as vice presidents, it became obvious that it was not going to work, Mr. Smith said. "I didn't know how to handle it. It took several years but the culmination was that Wayne left the company. It's still a sore spot. It still hurts."
"Wayne has a more mellow style than Michael," said Mrs. Gastman about her husband, who is now a vice president at Packaging Trends Corporation in Hauppauge, "and I think he and Michael had different business philosophies. When you have a mixture of family members with different styles, you don't want it to escalate to where it damages the family. The family core is everything. My husband said, 'This is your dad's business. I never want to hurt it.' "
Jerry Smith said it had taught him that everything you plan doesn't always work out. "I have always considered my daughter and my son as equals," said Mr. Smith, "and yet I am not portraying or delivering them as equals. She does not have the business, my son has the business. It is a very difficult thing for me."
The way things are with Michael at the helm, are the way things should be, the family says. Michael's mother, Sandy Smith, who works at JRS three days a week on accounts payable, payroll and taxes, feels her son is good for the business.
"Michael would like to do everything in-house," said Mrs. Smith, 60. "He would like to have every machine possible. He still asks his father for advice but Michael is very into computers which my husband is not. Neither am I. I do computer work, but very little. I'm always afraid I'm going to press a button and everything will disappear."
Jerry Smith believes that the next generation, which includes Michael, is stronger in technology and more intuitively geared toward computerization, accounting and marketing, whereas his generation dealt with people and put the emphasis on management and personal relations.
"This advertising business is an entirely different business now than when I started," Mr. Smith said. "The retail companies that we were doing everything for now have their own in-house advertising department. So if we did not change with the times we'd be out of business. With the advent of the Macintosh, they can basically do newspaper ads, mailers and so on. And most of them are.
"A lot of them are going back and fragmenting some of the business back to the advertising agencies. And there's a good blend now. And that's where Michael has put the agency, to be able to blend with other companies."
One of the companies is Seaman's Furniture, which has an in-house advertising agency. But JRS does the creative work for Seaman's television and radio advertising.
"There's a great tie-in and it works very well for their company and our company," said Mr. Smith. "And that's where business is at today."
Dr. Harold Lazarus, former dean of the Frank Zarb School of Business at Hofstra University and currently professor of business there, cautioned about generalizing about a son's taking over a business from his father.
"The impact on the business depends upon the relative managerial effectiveness of the son," he said. "The business might improve significantly were the son to be more, rather than less, effective than the father.
"Some fathers retain their position as C.E.O. and president not because it was in the best interest of the others but because one hates to give up one's baby. And that's the father's baby. He feels a loss of mission, power, prestige."
A son, he added, can be "highly aggressive and push out the father and still be a superb manager."
The Smiths, father and son, do not always agree on issues affecting the company or Long Island. "Everything is very saturated right now," said Jerry Smith. "There's too much of everything. I think the economy has leveled and I don't think it is going to get much better. I think a lot of people want to leave Long Island."
Michael Smith disagreed. "I see the 90's as a resurrection of the late 50's and 60's on Long Island," he said. "I see more opportunity here today on Long Island specifically than any other time. I think the quality of people, the highly motivated, highly educated work force, the environment of Long Island, offers everybody a unique opportunity."
Michael Smith, a burly man with a boyish face and curly brown hair, worked in shirtsleeves and seemed most comfortable talking from behind his desk, surrounded by computers and other tools of his trade. On a tray where his business cards were kept was a stack of fortune-cookie fortunes.
" 'Get your mind set in the path and it should follow,' " Mr. Smith read a fortune, "and, I certainly believe if you develop the end result in your mind it's very easy to achieve."
When asked the difference between his and his father's business philosophy, Michael Smith had a lot to say about the benefit of the old way, although it is not his way.
"The company was built around a retail environment which by the way is culturally a great strength for us," Mr. Smith said. "That experience of looking at yesterday's numbers and what it achieved has become so prominent in advertising throughout all the industries today. That culture, created over the years, is an intrinsic strength in this organization.
"We are developing the strategy for our clients today,integrating them with their sales, distribution, own marketing and administrative efforts. We used to be geared around an all-or-nothing deal. No longer."
When he first joined the company, he was an account executive, handling the Newmark & Lewis account. JRS contends that its implementation of the "Dick Lewis is watching" campaign helped the retailer grow. In two years JRS sales increased by 35 percent to 40 percent, he said.
"We took that account from a $2 million a year account doing $60 million in business, when I first came on board, to $300 million in business, spending $18 million a year in advertising by the time the relationship ended."
Mr. Smith said that one of the most important changes he feels he made was to selectively choose the clients JRS does business with. He will not handle a cigarette company, for example, although, in contrast to his father, he would take a fur account.
For her 50th birthday Jerry Smith gave his wife a mink coat. "About a year later Jerry became a vegetarian," Mrs. Smith said. "Now I have this beautiful coat. What am I going to do with it? So we gave it away to charity because it got him very upset. Now I agree with him. I don't like fur anymore."
Mr. Smith was born in Brooklyn, where he grew up with his parents in the home of his Russian-Jewish grandparents. His father, George, installed awnings and chauffeured limousines. His mother, Estelle, died of cancer when he was 21.
From his father, Mr. Smith said, he got his work ethic. "My father used to say to me, the only way you can make money easily is rob a bank, and you're not going to do that so you might as well work hard."
Mr. Smith met his wife, Sandy, 44 years ago, on New Year's Eve as the ball dropped in Times Square. "We dated a few times and then I went into the Navy for 47 months.We fell in love through letters."
Mr. Smith was working as an appliance and furniture salesman when he decided to leave Brooklyn because he loved the open spaces and beauty of Long Island. He said that when he first started the business around 1964, he and his wife worked all the time.
"Sandy did everything at the beginning and took care of the two kids too," Mr. Smith said. "We started the business in the basement of our home in Islip Terrace," said Mrs. Smith.
In 1969 they moved to Northport, where they live today. "At that time the business was called Jerome Erwin Advertising," Mr. Smith said. "I started out with my brother-in-law, working with programs for local chambers of commerce. "There was a lot of traveling. We would go to different parts of the country and stay there all week. It was very good money. But when my 7-year-old daughter Rhonda came to me and said, 'Daddy, I don't really know you,' I said it was time to make a change. 'Why are the other daddies home and you're not home?' she asked. It's tough to explain to a kid."
When they split up the business, Mr. Smith saw a vacuum on Long Island for a full service advertising agency and said that that was when he really started JRS rolling, around 1968. He opened offices in a 1200 square foot space on Walt Whitman Road with a secretary, an art director and some artists. He specialized in retail accounts. His first large account was Harrow's.
"We grew with Harrow's," Mr. Smith said. "The smaller companies were growing too. They were growing with Long Island. In the late 60's Long Island really boomed. I've always said I was pretty lucky.
"People said, how did you start a business? I said, well, I really could have put a map of Long Island under my feet, blindfolded myself and dropped a dart and wherever it landed I could have started a business.
"It was only like a year and a half of really lean times when I bought the house," Mr. Smith said. "I probably never really should have bought the house the way business was. But I had confidence in myself, and in Long Island, and it was a good move.
"Probably the leanest, toughest time was when the creative director who was working for the company took the three major accounts we had," said Mr. Smith. "I always said to myself, trust everybody until they prove you wrong. He lost all those accounts after a year. And something very interesting, we got them all back, Newmark & Lewis, Playworld and Harrow's.
When Jerry Smith took an early retirement last year, as he put it, he felt he still had a lot of gas in his tank and he wanted to do something with his time. So he asked himself why did he really stay on Long Island.
"What do I like about Long Island? I like the parks and beaches a lot," he said. So he took a volunteer position as director of development for the Long Island Region of the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.
Mr. Smith is also a board member of the Long Island chapter of the American Arbitration Association, of the Long Island Association, the American Cancer Society and the Breast Cancer Coalition of Long Island.
Michael Smith grew up in the business. At 12, he was making stats in the stat room. He came into the business for good at 21 after he chose a conservative New England business school education at Bentley because it contrasted with his freewheeling life during his high school years.
"I kind of went through teenage years being a rebel," Mr. Smith said of growing up in Northport and attending Northport High School where he met his wife, Randee. "After that I felt I needed to be brought back into a conservative realm, and that's why I chose Bentley College."
Mr. Smith lives with his wife and three children in Smithtown. Although he went right into the family business after college, he said he probably shouldn't have. "It took me until I was 30 years old to realize that I probably didn't know much."
He is co-founder of the 22-member Advertising Agency Council after being on the board of the Long Island Advertising Club for three years, and is a member of Young Presidents Organization.
Jerry Smith said he stays in Long Island now primarily because of the family. "I spend a lot of time enjoying my grandchildren: Rhonda and Wayne's children, Brian Matthew, 13, Evan Blake, 9, and Michael and his wife Randee's children, they have twin girls, Jessica and Danielle, 9 1/ 2, and Zackary, 5 1/2," Mr. Smith said.
When asked did he think his son Michael was priming any of them to be the next generation running JRS, Mr. Smith said he'd love to see it, but he did not think so. "I think it's a little premature for that," said Mr. Smith. "What I see is that most businesses fail in the second generation, forget the third. Because you just can't take a child and say, here's the business. Go run it and do it successfully. Some can and some can't."
In other words, he went on, "if Michael was not Michael, I don't think I would have worked something out where he would take the business over if I didn't think he could run it successfully. And that's the main thing, to keep the business going."
However, Mr. Smith said that his son-in-law's leaving the business was one of the lowest points of his life because his dream was for both son and son-in-law to work hand-in-hand.
When asked what do most parents who have a family business do in that situation to make things fair for both the children, Mr. Smith answered, "I don't know. I know that the most important thing is to keep the business going the best way you can. The best thing for the business was Michael, to have Michael run it. Michael wants to be top man. The best thing for me was to have Wayne and Michael in the business, but it wasnot to be."

HEADLINE: How Trinity Aims to Stay Competitive

BYLINE: By GITTA MORRIS 

 BODY:
FOR Edwin Robles, a 37-year-old Hartford police officer, the boarded-up, decaying Victorian brick house in the Frog Hollow neighborhood is a dream come true. "It's appealing to me because I like antique structures," he said. "It's part of Hartford's old past. And I want to be part of something good in the area."
What's good is Mr. Robles' opportunity to buy the house, completely renovated, as a small part of a $175 million program sparked by Trinity College, Hartford Hospital, the new Connecticut Children's Medical Center and the Institute of Living. With additional support from city, state and Federal government as well as private sources, the impoverished neighborhoods that ring the college are already assuming an attitude of hope and renewal. 
 While the need to revitalize neighborhoods like Frog Hollow, Behind the Rocks and Charter Oaks has been discussed for years, it took a new man in town to set a plan in motion. He is Evan S. Dobelle, president of Trinity College since April, who recalls, "I took one look at the campus and the city that looms in the distance, and saw the opportunity. That's one of the reasons I chose Trinity, and they chose me."
Now, plans and the money to implement them focus on the construction of three public schools, early childhood and family resource centers, a boys' and girls' club, and low-cost mortgage money for people to buy the rehabilitated houses. Also, the neighborhood is being rewired and each house will be connected to the Internet by the Southern New England Telephone Company, with Connecticut Public Television, which is on the Trinity campus, the primary information resource.
When people ask him how a project of this scope was kept secret until a few weeks ago, Mr. Dobelle laughs. "It was easy," he said. "Nobody believed it."
He is adamant that the endeavor will not condescend to the neighborhood by simply training residents for minimum wage jobs, or force them out by gentrifying the area. "This is not a situation where I lure my faculty to live in a neighborhood," he stressed. "I hope my faculty will want to be here, but not at the expense of people who have tried to survive for years and have a right to live next to museums, technology centers and schools."
The Southside Institutions Neighborhood Alliance is the umbrella organization under which the plan is being developed. Its members -- Trinity and the three hospitals -- and Connecticut Public Television have among them some 7,500 jobs. "Our interest is to make a difference in people's lives," Mr. Dobelle said, "for them to be able perhaps to become a radiologist or a stenographer, to become qualified for an entry level job at Trinity or the other institutions in the neighborhood."
There is only one caveat. In order to get subsidized housing, as well as health care, after-school care and ultimately jobs, occupants must make a commitment to keeping their children in school.
Mr. Dobelle has a reputation of championing change wherever he goes. As mayor of Pittsfield, Mass., as chief of protocol for the Carter White House and Assistant Secretary of State with the rank of ambassador, as president of Middlesex Community College in Lowell, Mass., and as president and chancellor of the City College of San Francisco, he has lowered taxes and built schools, libraries and campuses.
Upon coming to Trinity, his first step was to approach his future partners with his proposal. They all agreed it would be a good thing. If there were skeptics who said they'd heard it all before, Mr. Dobelle remained undaunted. "What I've learned in life is, if you have an idea that has a degree of workability and a degree of self-interest, and you're relentless about it, it usually can have results," he said.
He is candid about Trinity's self-interest in the project. "I was recruited basically because the board understood that for Trinity to remain a viable institution, it had to be more competitive," he explained. "A significant number of students who do not apply to Trinity, or who are accepted but decide to go to schools like Williams, Bowdoin or Hamilton," give the college's neighborhodd as their reason.
"We're taking a neighborhood which is a debit and making it an asset," Mr. Dobelle said.
About the $175 million, Mr. Dobelle said: "It's a lot of money to spend in a city that too many people have walked away from. I can't imagine there has been more money spent in a concentrated area in Connecticut in a decade except for Foxwoods Casino."
In round figures, about $60 million for the new schools' construction will come from city and state bonds. Another $25 million is earmarked for the technology center. In addition, $75 million in new mortgage and home renovation subsidies will be available through the Federal National Mortgage Association, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development is loaning $15 million. The four institutions are contributing another $10 million.
Mr. Dobelle hopes that eventually the private sector will take over and says banks, private corporations and manufacturers of health related products and technology have been calling with interest in the project.
"It's a true neighborhood partnership," said the executive director of SINA, Jose Perez, a former Assistant Secretary of Economic Affairs for Massachusetts and a community developer. "We're working with local contractors through the neighborhood organization, Hartford Areas Rally Together, which will also hire workers from the neighborhood when possible. We've also met with the security chiefs of the four institutions and we're trying to work out a partnership of community policing."
Crime, particularly gang-related violence, had grown to epidemic proportions in the area. Two years ago, however, United States Attorney Christopher Droney put together a task force of Hartford police, state police and Federal agents and, applying the anti-racketeering laws known by their acronym RICO, went after the gangs.
"Since then we've indicted about 50 members of the Los Solidos gang and convicted about 35 of them," he said. "The gangs are not dominating the neighborhood now."
Mr. Droney noted that the second part of the job is to address some of the root causes of the problem. "The Trinity proposal goes a long way toward doing that," he said, "to really make the neighborhood a better place to live and work. And, I think, going hand in hand with the crime prevention and enforcement that we're doing, it will make a significant long-term benefit."
David Martinez, a postal employee who lives in Frog Hollow, agrees. "At one time there was a gun fatality a day," he said. "There was rampant drug selling. Now I hear gang members say, 'It doesn't pay to get arrested. You're talking about prison.' Before, I would never let my kids go out on the street and play. Now they can walk the streets on their own."
With the poor neighborhood schools, and because the Martinezes believe in the value of education, two of their three children are in private school. Long active in block watches and other neighborhood improvement groups, he and his wife, Meri, a teacher's aide, look forward to seeing the Trinity initiative, and new schools, become reality.
"You know the old adage, it takes a village to raise a child," Mr. Martinez said. "The key point I would make, if I were selling this neighborhood, is that this is becoming a village again."
Work is beginning on rehabilitating and financing eight vacant houses in the neighborhood. Some buildings to be torn down will not be replaced, thereby leaving space for little parks and community gardens. More than $2.2 million is slated for street and building facade improvements, lighting and fencing.
The next stage is the design of the schools, to be built in an abandoned bus yard. They include a kindergarten through grade six Montessori school that will replace one in a different part of town. Because it will be an interdistrict magnet school, with children coming from both Hartford and surrounding towns, it will receive state funding.
A middle school and a Science and Math Resource High School also will be built on the site.
The high school will be unusual in that students will not enroll there, but instead be sent from other schools to work on special projects for as few as two days a week, or as much as several months a year. Trinity faculty and students will be involved and in the summer, the college will open its campus to students attending science and math camps at the school.
The Health and Technology Center, to be staffed by the hospitals, will include a science museum in which children can participate, as well as research labs.
Mr. Dobelle also talks of developing an artery of cafes and art galleries along the west side of the campus, where a high iron fence separates the college from its neighbors. The fine arts department already runs the student-operated storefront Zion Gallery there. A few doors down the street, Timothy's, a small restaurant, was about to close its doors after 22 years, but Trinity has guaranteed its mortgage to assure its survival. "In the last year and a half the city has made big strides cleaning up," said Timothy Otte, the restaurant's owner. "The neighborhood is getting better. The people have a lot of hope."
Mr. Dobelle is optimistic that everything can be in place by the fall of 1998. "I am not naive enough to think there won't be a glitch somewhere along the way," he said, "but we'll overcome it. We're doing something that will help us survive, that's very unique and might be replicated in other parts of the country. What we have fixed on is safety and schools and home ownership. Without them, America is kidding itself that it's going to turn the cities around."

Community Groups Protect the Arts From Extinction in Schools

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
When he was in junior high school on the Lower East Side, Jose Garcia's days were studded with classes in voice, band, art and music appreciation, a creative cornucopia that eventually led him to a stage career. Today, at age 32, he spends one morning a week at a Brooklyn elementary school where there are no such classes.
For the last 18 months, Mr. Garcia, a performer affiliated with the Gowanus Arts Exchange, has brought the Brooklyn New School a series of eight-week workshops that combine theater, dance and music. Professionals like Mr. Garcia, and arts groups like the Gowanus Arts Exchange, are rays of light in city schools where fiscal belt-tightening has all but eclipsed arts instruction. 
 Some groups are solely dedicated to teaching arts in the schools: Arts Connection dispatches professional artists to teach in 100 schools citywide, mostly paid by private dollars. Museums and orchestras have increasingly reached out into the classroom. So have several small groups like the Gowanus Arts Exchange, even as public funds for the arts are drying up.
The arts groups have stepped up their work because the choir teachers and band directors that were once a staple of public education in New York are now a rarity. The trend began with the fiscal crunch of the mid-70's and has snowballed in the last several years. The number of arts teachers has dropped sharply. In 1985, there were 1,851 full-time licensed arts teachers serving a student population of 937,000 in kindergarten through high school, according to the Board of Education. In 1995, the number of teachers had declined to 1,414 while the number of students had risen to 1,054,000.
At the Brooklyn New School one recent morning, as the sun streamed through the windows, Mr. Garcia and another Gowanus performer, Jennifer Fleming, led a small cadre of fifth and sixth graders in exercises designed to build discipline. "Focus," Mr. Garcia commanded, striking a pair of claves. "You don't focus, you miss the universe."
At each strike of the wood blocks, the six boys and six girls were instructed to strike a pose and freeze. On the first beat, they held their arms akimbo, then curled up their bodies on the second beat, like a tulip that has closed.
Later, the students were asked to write about photos clipped from a magazine. One made up a ditty about Spam, another wrote a moving tribute to labor unions. To Mr. Garcia and Ms. Fleming, the exercises unleash creativity, but they also teach things like confidence and thinking ahead.
"I want to go back to the beginning when the arts were for everybody," Mr. Garcia said. "It's a privilege now and it shouldn't be a privilege."
Anna Allanbrook, a third-grade teacher at the school, said that for most of the students, these sessions are their only exposure to the arts. So she regrets that economic reality forces schools to choose between math supplies and theater classes.
The Gowanus Arts Exchange raises its own funds -- a mix of private and state and city dollars -- to dispatch artists into the Brooklyn New School and two other Brooklyn schools. Some of the students start taking after-school classes at the arts exchange, but to the executive director, Marya Warshaw, what counts most is the cultivation of their interest in the arts.
"When you get families involved through their children, that is a really powerful force," Ms. Warshaw said. "They are going to advocate for our survival as well, in a way that they wouldn't if their kids were not involved." SOMINI SENGUPTA

For years, the industrial area along Woodhaven Boulevard south of Metropolitan Avenue was desolate with abandoned warehouses and a vacant lot owned by the city. But a recent effort by the city's Economic Development Corporation and the borough president's office to develop it into a commercial shopping strip has met with opposition from the community.
Under the plan, a Home Depot and a shopping center with a supermarket and small neighborhood stores would fill these vacant spaces. But so far, the opposition to the project is so strong that the Borough President, Claire Shulman, has put together a task force to study the situation. 
 Residents in the area say that although they would be happy to see the empty warehouses put to use, they were not prepared to have their routines disturbed by the increased traffic the combination of these developments would bring.
But there appears little they can do to stop Home Depot, which plans construction of a 130,000-square-foot store in the spring. The store's site is zoned for light manufacturing, which allows Home Depot to build without undergoing the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, Jesse Masyr, a lawyer for Home Depot, said. And because the store is classified as a hardware store, it does not require approval of a special zoning variance by the City Council.
The shopping center, however, may be a different story. Part of the proposed site, a narrow strip of Long Island Rail Road right of way, is owned by the city and is subject to the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure. If purchased from the city, that strip would be restricted to parking only.
To address the parking issue, both Home Depot and Forest City Ratner, a Brooklyn-based company that is a contender to develop the shopping center, are planning to build their own parking lots that will accommodate 700 cars each.
Dan Andrews, the spokesman for Ms. Shulman, said no decision will be made until the task force meets later this month.
During a recent meeting of the Forest Hills Civic Association that was also attended by local politicians and representatives of Forest City Ratner, most of the objections arose from the combined environmental impact of Home Depot and the shopping center.
One after another, residents voiced concerns that the two projects would worsen the existing traffic problem during rush hours. They say it would lower not only their quality of life but also their property values.
"I chose to live in this community because of the lack of commercialization," said Jan Swiatocha, who lives near the proposed shopping center.
The City Council Minority Leader, Thomas V. Ognibene, whose district runs through central Queens, has threatened to use his power in the City Council to block the shopping center over the parking issue. "This project doesn't stand a chance at the City Council," he said. JANE H. LII

HEADLINE: Plan for Luxury Mall In Syosset Advances

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW 

 BODY:
DESPITE some concerns, plans for a one-million-square-foot shopping mall in Syosset, aimed largely at affluent shoppers, are moving forward.
The builder and owner, the Taubman Company of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., has said it plans to apply for a permit to build the center, to be called the Mall at Oyster Bay, on 40 acres zoned for light industry. 
 The land, formerly the site of the Cerro Wire and Cable Company factory, is bordered by the Long Island Expressway, the Long Island Rail Road, Robbins Lane and land owned by the Town of Oyster Bay.
The Chicago Tribune Company owns the parcel. Last year it formed a partnership with Taubman to develop the site, which has been unused for years and has a large industrial building, several smaller structures and a water tower on the property.
Plans for the mall, scheduled to open in the fall of the year 2000, call for a three-level enclosed mall with three anchors and 130 to 150 smaller stores. The center would have 5,000 parking spaces.
The senior vice president for development at Taubman, Tony Ness, said no anchors had made commitments but his company has been meeting with Bloomingdale's, Lord & Taylor, Neiman-Marcus, Nordstrom and Saks Fifth Avenue.
The center would be fashion oriented, Mr. Ness said, aimed at an affluent part of the population, but it would also try to attract a broader customer base. The tenants, he added, would include Madison Avenue and other designer names like those at the Americana Shopping Center in Manhasset.
"Market studies have shown that there is a demand for upper-end merchandise that is not available on the Island," Mr. Ness said. "Many affluent North Shore customers are now shopping in Manhattan or from catalogues."
The average household income in the area around the site is $92,000, compared to the national average of $44,000, according to a study that Taubman commissioned.
"This area," Mr. Ness said, "has a local affluent base to support such a center with regional access, being near the parkways to draw people from throughout Long Island. Research tells us that 88 percent of the money generated by the center would be new business, and only 12 percent would come from existing local malls.
"There is now nothing on the Island that presents the upscale fashion format we have proposed. Roosevelt Field, while a very successful shopping center, is aimed at the middle market. With its major anchor stores being J. C. Penney, Stern's and Macy's, it has had to complement them with specialty stores that are budget oriented or moderately priced, so customers find a cohesive group of stores. It doesn't offer choices to the more affluent customers like we wish to offer."
Some retail analysts agreed that a luxury mall would be a welcome addition. Steven B. Greenberg, president of the Greenberg Group in Hewlett, real-estate advisers to retailers, said there was a market and demand for such retailing. The only true luxury shopping on Long Island, he said, is at the Americana, which has been extremely successful in leasing and re-leasing stores.
A study by his concern, Mr. Greenberg said, found that the first place affluent shoppers went to was Manhasset, because it has the stores they are looking for and is convenient. The second most frequent destination was Manhattan.
"Long Island is fairly saturated with off-price retail at this moment," Mr. Greenberg said, "and is about to go through another wave of bankruptcies. Be that as it may, the one sector of retail that is still glowing is upscale retail. Gucci sales have been tremendous, Saks Fifth Avenue had a good year, and most stores in the Americana shopping center are doing very well. The affluent North Shore customer is somewhat insulated from today's economy."
A recent survey by the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics confirms that residents of the New York metropolitan region, including Long Island, spend more than shoppers elsewhere. The average annual spending in the region per household was put at $36,111, compared to $31,750 nationally. New Yorkers spent $5,378 on food, compared to $4,410; $13,388 on housing, compared to $10,106; $2,367 on clothing and services, compared to $1,644, and $484 on personal care, compared to $396.
Opponents of the mall proposal contend that the area is saturated with shopping centers and that the proposed mall would hurt local businesses and neighboring shopping centers.
Supervisor Lewis J. Yevoli of the Town of Oyster Bay said marketing studies had found that there was nothing new that any new mall could offer that could not be found in other malls on Long Island.
"That sums up the entire point," Mr. Yevoli said. "This proposal reflects a terrible story throughout Long Island, where no thought is given to planning, and entire downtown areas dry up."
The problem has two facets, said Ira Rubin, president of the Syosset Homeowners Against Pollution of the Environment, a group of more than 1,000 residents from Syosset, Jericho, Woodbury and Plainview. The first concern, Mr. Rubin said, is that the mall would destroy local businesses. He cited a recently renovated Gap clothing store in the nearby Plainview Shopping Center, saying: "If a Gap goes into the new mall, the Gap in Plainview won't be able to survive, and we'll be left with a lot of empty stores."
The second aspect, he said, is that nearby malls would lose customers. The Broadway Mall in Hicksville is two and a half miles southwest of the proposed site, and the Walt Whitman Mall in Huntington is six miles east.
"Roosevelt Field just opened a Bloomingdale's and is building a Nordstrom," Mr. Rubin said. "Walt Whitman wants to add two major department stores and a number of specialty stores. Nassau and Suffolk Counties have both declining populations and aging populations. Where is the logic to this plan?"
The proposed mall is not the proper use of that land, added Judy Jacobs, a Nassau County Legislator and president of the South Woodbury Taxpayers Association. "We have a responsibility to the community," Ms. Jacobs said. "We've already seen development along Jericho Turnpike create a ghost land in the local community. What this mall will do to local stores and neighboring malls will be devastating. You cannot inundate an area and expect everyone to survive."
Mr. Ness said that although such concerns were often voiced when new shopping centers arrive, the effects are usually the opposite of what is feared.
"What has happened in other communities where we've built similar centers," he said, "is that by bringing a critical mass of retail into the area and bringing in new customers it becomes a benefit to the entire retail community, not only within the shopping center."
Last month representatives from Taubman met civic groups and community leaders to discuss their proposal. The next meeting is to be at the end of this month.
Traffic and other safety concerns overshadow economics for a large group of residents. "More than half the traffic into the mall will go through the intersection of the Long Island Expressway and South Oyster Bay Road, which is very close to the public library," Gene Herman of Woodbury said. "This will add thousands of cars every hour and will therefore greatly impact on safety. We are also concerned about the effect these noxious fumes from the cars will have on the air quality in this area."
The enormous amount of traffic generated by a mall of this kind would spill over onto local roads that were not meant to handle such traffic, said Mrs. Jacobs.
"The best use of the property," she said, "would be a user-friendly company like an Olympus or a Canon, that would occupy the land for office use, come in the morning and leave at night, leaving the weekends quiet."
Several residential areas are at the intersection of Robbins Lane and the north service road of the Long Island Expressway.
"From East Birchwood," Mr. Yevoli said, "there are times during commuter rush hours that it's now almost impossible to get in and out of the development. And that's without any additional traffic. There are other areas like 500 acres of Grumman property that are just crying out for development."
The 11 Parent-Teacher Associations in the Syosset School District have voted to oppose a regional mall at Cerro Wire. The president of the Syosset Council of P.T.A.'s, Susan Sariego, said: "We have grave concerns over the dramatic effect this would have on the health and welfare of the children in this community. Because of its close proximity to two elementary schools and the public library, it would be a very detrimental project."
Mr. Ness said that many studies had examined traffic and that Taubman was continuing to look at the subject. Taubman, he added, plans to make road improvements that would make intersections safer. One advantage of the location, Mr. Ness said, is that 90 percent of the traffic would never use the local streets.
But some residents have not been convinced. "Unless it's in your immediate backyard," Mr. Rubin said, "most people don't pay attention to these proposed projects. They don't worry about it, until usually it's too late."

HEADLINE: China: Jerry-built ... or built to last?;
Boom-at-a-Glance

All the World's a Market
Since China began its economic reform, its gross domestic product (G.D.P.), measured yuan, has grown nearly tenfold, from 447 billion yuan in 1980 to 4.4 trillion yuan in 1994. In U.S. dollars, the G.D.P. rose from $298 billion in 1980 to $508 billion in 1994. It is an economy that has far outstripped the competition. Here, a few significant G.D.P. growth rates (in percentages):
 
In 1994, China's trade surplus was $5.2 billion. One of its best customers is the United States, whose trade deficit with China is fast becoming a rival of its better-known deficit with Japan.
 
In 1994, foreign investors poured $81.4 billion into China, up from $2.9 billion in 1984; American investors spent $6 billion up from $165 million. The United States was the second-largest foreign investor in 1994, behind Hong Kong/Macao ($48.7 billion) and ahead of Taiwan ($5.4 billion) and Japan ($4.4 billion). The five American companies whose joint ventures yielded the highest gross sales (in millions of dollars, and with rank among all joint ventures):
 
Chrysler $497 (4th)
Motorola $310 (6th)
Procter & Gamble $234 (14th)
United Technologies $184 (33rd)
Coca-Cola $119 (59th)
 
In 1993, only 0.1 percent of Chinese owned automobiles, a total of 1.2 million; about 70 percent were imports. (Bicycles, meanwhile, number upward of 450 million.) "China is such a potentially huge market that if 1 percent of Chinese people could afford cars, that would be 12 million," says Michael G. Meyerand, a spokesman for General Motors. "That's roughly our market size in Europe."
 
Big Economy, Tiny Budgets
 
The national average household income was $685 in 1994. Per-capita income has risen about 20 percent over the past two years, and average income should reach $4,000 by 2020, compared with $35,000 in the United States (both measured in 1995 dollars).
 
The average income of:
 A businessperson is $581 a year.
 A factory worker: $420.
 An agricultural worker: $213
 
A worker for a company that is partly foreign-owned earns at least 200 percent the salary of a comparable worker at a Government-run company, but Government jobs also provide insurance and subsidized housing.
 
Before 1979, 100 percent of agricultural workers had medical insurance: now only 20 percent do.
 
How does a Chinese household spend its money?
 
AVERAGE MONTHLY EXPENSES FOR A CHINESE FAMILY
 Food $22
 Savings $11
 Clothing $6
 Children's Education $5
 Rent and Utilities $4
 Nonfood Goods $4
 Medical care $2
 Entertainment $1
 
Below, the percentages of families who own certain consumer goods, from a survey of 3,500 households.
 Color television 40%
 Refrigerator 25%
 VCR 12%
 Telephone 9%
 Computer 2%
 
(A 29-inch foreign-made color television costs about $1,200. The paucity of telephone lines, not the cost of the phone itself, accounts for the sacarcity of ownership.)

HEADLINE: Inside 'City Hall'

BYLINE: By Joyce Purnick

 BODY:
"City Hall," the new film starring Al Pacino as a popular, populist Mayor, is a wholly realistic portrait of gritty city politics. But it is friction. Here are a few examples of who's really who and what's really what.
 HIZZONER
 
FILM: Mayor John Pappas (played by Al Pacino) is a dramatic, compassionate, overwrought politician who wants to be effective and talks about New York City's greatness: "It was a palace! It can be a palace again!"
 
FACT: The closest to the emotive Pappas is Mario M. Cuomo, the silver-tongued former Governor. Not that it's hard to imagine Edward I. Koch or Fiorello H. La Guardia being as headstrong as Pappas. Or Rudolph W. Guiliani, who has also been known to be willful on occasion.
 But a mayor's embracing the coffin of a murdered black child, mesmerizing the congregation, as in the film? Racial tentions are such in New York City that at the 1989 funeral of Yusuf K. Hawkins, a black teen-ager killed by a white gang in Bensonhurst, Mr. Koch and Mr. Cuomo were heckled. Two years later, the death of a 7-year-old black child, struck in Crown Heights by a car driven by a Hasidic Jew, touched off searing racial unrest. Mayor David N. Dinkins did speak at the boy's funeral, but that did not stop rioting.
 THE BOSSES
 
FILM: Frank Anselmo (Danny Aiello) is a Brooklyn political boss who is close to both the Mayor and the local Mafia don. He's a powerful figure who wants goodies for Brooklyn in exchange for supporting BankExchange, a mayoral development project. Everything moves along until Anselmo gets his political allies to pressure a judge into freeing a drug dealer, a nephew of the don. Back on the streets, the dealer kills an innocent child.
 
FACT: Anselmo is an obvious mix of Meade H. Esposito, the late gruff Brooklyn Democratic leader, and Donald R. Manes, the late Democratic leader and Borough President of Queens. Esposito, last of the old-time "bosses," died in 1993 at age 86, five years after his conviction on influence-peddling and bribery charges. Manes committed suicide in 1986 as his role in a bribery and extortion scheme began to surface. In their day, both Esposito and Manes could, like Anselmo, twist political arms and had the ear of the Mayor.
 The film's BankExchange is in reality the Citicorp building in Long Island City, Queens.
 THE DEPUTY MAYOR
 
FILM: The protagonist of "City Hall" is not the Mayor but his Deputy Mayor, Kevin Calhoun (John Cusack). He is a young Louisianan who gets to the bottom of a mystery.
 
 FACT: Never has City Hall seen a Deputy Mayor like Kevin Calhoun. Deputy Mayors tend not to come from parts south - other than southern Brooklyn. Nor do they play detective (unless they are investigating the reason for overtime in the Sanitation Department). Mainly, they run the $32 billion city government.
 Nor is hero a word that comes to mind to describe deputy mayors. Workaholic is more like it. But Ken Lipper, Mr. Koch's Deputy Mayor for economic development, has always though very highly of his tenure. He wrote the first screenplay for the film and was a co-producer.
 THE SETTING
 
FILM: Many scenes show City Hall and Gracie Mansion.
 
FACT: The exteriors of Gracie Mansion are the real thing, but interiors were filmed in a private home in New Jersey. The Mayor's offices are not really the Mayor's. They are the offices of the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, decorated to look like the Mayor's. For security reasons, Mr. Guiliani would not allow filming in his offices.
 For the nitpickers: The metal detector in the City Hall rotunda is not seen in the film. Reporters do not wear suits and ties to mayoral news conferences. Deputy mayors do not often run off to Buffalo (in a train!) to pursue mystery clues, or drive their own cars (they have chauffeurs).
 And not in recent memory has a Mayor of New York been blessed with the dark, thick locks that sit atop Al Pacino's ever-furrowed brow.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Astoria, Queens;
Where the Piano Meets the Bouzouki

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER

 BODY:
UMBRELLAS were the only concession to wind and rain on a recent Saturday afternoon along Astoria's Steinway Street, where a seemingly unending expanse of small shops and eating places of every description fairly bristled with shoppers undeterred by the weather.
With its brightly colored canopies and double-parked cars, Steinway Street is only one of several main thoroughfares in Astoria, a Greek-American stronghold in northwestern Queens known for its shopping, about 200 restaurants, night life, affordability and good subway connection to Manhattan. 
 The Steinway Piano Company, an economic bulwark since the company moved here from Manhattan in the 1880's, still provides jobs for craftsmen at its factory on 19th Avenue in Astoria's main industrial area.
But the humble bouzouki, not the Steinway grand, is the instrument that best sets to music a neighborhood where Greek is heard as often as English along Ditmars Boulevard, another commercial hub.
For Greeks, Greek-Americans and lovers of Greek cuisine and culture from throughout the metropolitan area, Astoria is a siren song and the place to be. "They all come to Astoria for the food and the entertainment," said George Delis, the district manager of Community Board 1.
Among the restaurants are Elias Corner, serving Greek seafood; Minore, a Greek nightclub with live bouzouki music and serving traditional Greek cuisine; Bank Restaurant, serving Italian and Croation food, and the Taj Mahal, with Indian cusine.
Yet in a working-class setting that has been home to many immigrants in its history, new waves of ethnicity are pouring forth. Around Broadway, near Astoria's ever-open-to-interpretation border with Long Island City, recent immigrants from Bangladesh, the Philippines, Ireland, Colombia, India and China lead the transformation.
Americans of Italian, German, Irish and Polish extraction have been at home in Astoria for decades, and a Hispanic and African-American presence has been growing.
Above 31st Street, the N line subway lumbers along elevated tracks through the middle of town to the last stop on Ditmars Boulevard. The ride back to midtown Manhattan takes less than half an hour. Rows of two- and three-story, red-brick, attached and semidetached houses stretching off on both sides are typical of the two-family housing that predominates.
A DECADE ago, some developers thought that the subway, coupled with Astoria's work-ethic stability and the allure lent by the Greek presence, made this plain-hewn community ripe for gentrification. Except for the huge Shore Towers condominium, it never happened, and Astoria churned on with a vitality and momentum of its own.
"Astoria keeps moving," said Gregory Fiasconaro, a broker at G.M. Dynasty Realty at 35-04 30th Avenue. "It's so close to the city it's like the step-brother."
Even some who left are coming back.
"A few years ago a lot of Greeks started moving out to Flushing and Bayside," said Angelo Langdakis, a broker at Owners Club Realty at 31st Street and Ditmars Boulevard, recounting an exodus others said reached out to towns like Port Washington and Glen Cove on Long Island. "But they still hung around this area because of all the big stores and restaurants and night life. Driving back and forth was difficult, so many of them moved back."
A shrewd buyer can cover annual taxes, averaging about $2,000, and most of the mortgage by renting the upstairs and basement of a two-family house, according to Mr. Langdakis.
"With today's interest rates, someone putting down a 10 percent payment can almost live for free by renting the second floor and the basement," he said.
Basement rentals are illegal but extremely common, brokers and others said. "Ninety-nine percent of the houses have finished, rentable basements," Mr. Langdakis said.
But the upstairs apartments, often rented out by owners living on the ground floor, are at the core of Astoria's active rental market.
A new development, Estates at Hallett's Cove, is offering 107 two-family units for $229,000. David G. Hughes, the marketing director for the Seavey Organization, a partner in the development, said the houses were tailored for buyers in the $40,000 to $68,000 annual income range. The development is on 21st Street between 33d and 34th Avenues.
Shore Towers, a five-year-old, 23-story, 405-unit condominium on Shore Boulevard overlooking the East River, advertises "affordable luxury on the Queens coast" with views of Manhattan and East River bridges. A two-bedroom apartment sells for $125,000. The monthly common charge is $242.
STREET crime, people in Astoria say, is less a problem than in many parts of the city. "A lot of people want to live here right now" said Charles Sciberras, an associate salesman at Crest Haven Realty at 28-17 Astoria Boulevard. "The market is very tight. There's a pent-up demand for houses and we sell them as quick as we get them if the price is right."
Astoria Park, near the Triborough Bridge crossing over Hell Gate, has 62 acres of playing fields, tennis courts, green spaces and the largest outdoor pool in the city.
A major city-owned housing project on Shore Boulevard, Astoria Houses, has about 8,000 residents. The Ravenswood Houses, another city project with about 10,000 residents, is just beyond Astoria on 35th Avenue near 21st Street.
The American Museum of the Moving Image, which opened in 1988, celebrates Astoria's long association with films and video. Its enlarged exhibit, "Behind the Screens," opens on April 20.
The museum, at 35th Avenue and 36th Street, is next to Kaufman Astoria Studios, a major East Coast film and video production center. The studio is the historic successor to the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation, which opened a studio here in 1920 to produce silent movies for Paramount Pictures. Stars from Rudolph Valentino and Gloria Swanson to Robert DiNiro and Meryl Streep have worked there.
The Isamu Noguchi Garden Museum at 32-37 Vernon Boulevard is named for the internationally known sculptor, whose studio was at the museum site. He died in 1988. Galleries and the outdoor garden display over 250 of his works. The museum reopens to visitors on April 3 after its annual winter closing.
GERMANS settled in Astoria during the latter half of the 19th century, followed by the Irish. Italians came after World War I. Greeks followed after World War II. The Greek populations surged after a change in immigration laws in 1962 opened the doors to southern Europeans. Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches and four synagogues witness the tides of immigration.
St. Demetrios, a 69-year-old cathedral on 31st Street and 30th Drive, the largest Greek Orthodox church in the nation.
There are 20 elementary schools and five junior high and intermediary schools in Astoria, which is in school district 30.
At I.S. 126, a visual- and performing-arts magnet school at 31-51 21st Street, Spanish and Bengali are the most frequent native tongues of students who speak limited English. The school, built in 1925, has about 1,000 students in grades six through eight.
Many Astoria students attend the newly built Long Island City High School, where the principal, William C. Bassell, said an interdisciplinary program in technology, humanities and the arts would begin in September. About 80 percent of the school's 2,600 students are from Astoria.
The building opened in September, making it the newest public high school in the city. It has a 1,400-seat theater and a pool.
In June 1994, 68 percent of the class that started four years earlier graduated within four years. Of these, about 76 percent went on to two- or four-year colleges. About 25 percent of students in the class of 1994 took the Scholastic Assessment Test. Average scores of 302 in verbal skills and 389 in mathematics were below the citywide average.
The William Cullen Bryant High School, the other zoned high school for Astoria, has an enrollment of 3,500. In a recent survey, about 78 percent of graduates went on to higher education. There is one parochial high school in Astoria -- the Roman Catholic St. John's Preparatory School -- and one Lutheran and five Catholic elementary schools. There is also a pre-kindergarten to grade 12 St. Demetrios school.
Astoria bore the Indian name Sintsinck, meaning "a stony place," when the first settler, William Hallett, arrived in the 1650's. Hallets Cove on Hell Gate is named after the family. During the Revolutionary War, British artillery batteries set up where the Astoria Houses now stand aimed over Hell Gate at Colonials holding Manhattan.
The area owes its current name, but little else, to the fur merchant John Jacob Astor. Despite protests, village leaders adopted the name when the village was incorporated in 1839 to attract investment from Astor in what was then a well-to-do retreat for New York merchants. But flattery, in this case, got Astoria nowhere.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Feb. 18 about living in Astoria, Queens, misstated the number of public schools in the neighborhood. There are six elementary schools and three intermediate schools in Astoria. The article also misstated the street on the western border of the Astoria Houses. It is First Street, not Shore Boulevard.

ANCIENT GREECE REDUX: Athens Square at 30th Street and 30th Avenue, a small city park with an amphitheater that recalls those of ancient Greece, is soon to get some finishing touches. Three 23-foot-high, white-granite columns costing a total of $250,000, weighing 14 tons each and fashioned after the Doric columns of Delphi are expected to arrive soon from Rhode Island, where they were crafted from Georgia stone. Once erected, they will add to an unusual Hellenic park whose creation was given early support in 1983 by City Council President Peter F. Vallone. Mr. Vallone's $100 contribution initiated a local fund-raising drive that has since raised $300,000 from the Astoria community for the park, the columns, and what George Delis, the Athens Square Committee vice president, called the only full-bodied statute of Socrates in the country. The bronze statue was erected in 1993. "Athens Square is a beautiful place for the performing arts," said Mr. Delis He said a second season of free musical performances was planned for the summer following an unveiling of the new columns in the spring.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
Survey Finds Travel Tax Rarely Goes to Tourism

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
EVERYONE knows that travel is taxing, but a good indication of how taxing can be gleaned from the recent report, "Travel Taxes in America's Top Destinations," a survey conducted for the Travel and Tourism Government Affairs Council in 50 cities from Anaheim, Calif., to West Palm Beach, Fla. The cities are those with the largest number of hotel rooms.
The survey made no attempt to extrapolate the figures beyond the 50 cities, and not every city responded to every portion of the survey. But those that did respond reported collecting billions of dollars in taxes, of which only a fraction was earmarked for travel and tourism. 
 The 43 cities that responded to the survey question about restaurant taxes collected $3.1 billion in 1995 -- of which only $47.9 million, or 1.6 percent, went to travel and tourism. The 43 cities that answered that part of the survey about hotel taxes (not all of them the same 43 that answered the restaurant question) collected $1.8 billion last year, of which $637.3 million, or 34 percent, went to travel and tourism.
The report was researched by William Evans with assistance from Arleyne Udo. Mr. Evans is director of economic studies for the Travel Industry Association of America, a Washington trade group. The yearlong project was paid for by the Travel and Tourism Government Affairs Council, an affiliate of the Travel Industry Association. The information was obtained by mail and by telephone interviews with convention and visitor bureaus, state travel offices and state and local tax bureaus.
But the report does not include taxes on air travel, including the $6 tax for international departures and the 10 percent tax on domestic air fares -- both of which lapsed last Dec. 31 and presumably will not be restored until Congress and the President agree on a budget bill for this year.
Nevertheless, the report describes Federal fees on air travel and excise taxes on gasoline as "the best example of truly 'dedicated' user fees where the traveler enjoys many benefits (e.g., efficient and safe road and air travel) for having paid those particular taxes and fees."
The report does not object to the fact that state and local taxes, which make up the greatest share of taxes paid by the traveler, usually wind up in the general fund. But it strongly protests the use for general purposes of additional taxes and fees charged to the traveler, including taxes on hotels, restaurant meals and car rentals, which are rarely earmarked for tourism promotion, visitor information centers and other programs that directly benefit the traveler.
"Too many states and cities have used this scheme," the report declares, "to raise new revenue from visitors who are not voters to pay for programs unrelated to travel."
Most of the report consists of a city-by-city breakdown of taxes, and many of its findings are surprising.
For example, Columbus, Ohio, had the highest room tax in 1995 of the cities surveyed, 15.75 percent. Seattle was runner-up with 15.2 percent, followed by Anaheim, Houston and San Antonio, each with 15 percent. Las Vegas had the lowest hotel tax, 8 percent, followed by Portland, Ore., at 9 percent.
But because Portland has no sales tax, and therefore no tax on restaurant meals, its total tax on food (none) and lodging (9 percent) was the lowest of any of the 50 cities. Boston was next lowest with a combined 14.7 percent.
By contrast, San Antonio's 24.7 percent combined hotel and restaurant tax edged out Chicago (24.65 percent) as the nation's highest, with Seattle (23.4 percent) and Washington (23 percent) runners-up. But when car rental taxes are added, Chicago (with an 18 percent tax, plus $2.75 surcharge per rental) was in a tax class by itself.
Tax data on rental cars were not specific enough to provide accurate information for the report, but the take from such taxes obviously runs into the millions. The Florida Division of Tourism's entire $15.1 million budget last year was financed by a portion of that state's $2.05-a-day surtax on rentals, and all 50 cities in the survey impose a base tax on car rentals averaging 8.24 percent. In addition, 31 cities tack on additional taxes for cars rented off airport property, while 18 impose additional surcharges -- often to pay for athletic stadiums.
 

CORRECTION-DATE: March 10, 1996, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
The Correspondent's Report column on the Travel Advisory page on Feb. 18 about taxes at tourist destinations referred incorrectly to a tax in San Antonio and misstated the combined total of two taxes there. The city has a sales tax, which applies to restaurants; it does not have a restaurant tax as such. The sales and lodging taxes total 22.75 percent, not 24.7.

HEADLINE: In America;
An Exercise in Futility

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

DATELINE: PORTSMOUTH, N.H.

 BODY:
None of the campaigns are working. Millions are being spent on inane and annoying ads, and the candidates are dutifully tramping through the snow and the bitter cold, proffering one false promise after another (like compulsive salesmen who couldn't stop peddling their discredited wares, even if they wanted to), all for naught.
Tomorrow's G.O.P. primary vote will be an exercise in futility. It won't matter who wins. No one from this group of flim-flam artists and charm school dropouts can satisfy the growing hunger among American voters for a President who will honestly and aggressively address the economic difficulties that are steadily eroding the quality of life for working men and women. 
 Arielle Silver, a politically conservative young woman who works for a computer software company, discussed the Republican candidates as she folded clothing on a snowy afternoon at the Wash 'N Clean laundromat in the Plaza 800 shopping center.
"I can't stand it," she said. "They're like a bunch of little kids quibbling. They are not professional and they look awful. I think it's giving a big opening to Clinton."
Ms. Silver was laid off a year ago and spent eight months searching for another full-time job in the computer industry. In the interim, she said, she worked at temporary jobs "that were almost full time." Employers would limit her hours to 37 1/2 per week, thus escaping the obligation to pay health and other benefits.
In Ms. Silver's view, the workaday world has become increasingly cutthroat and "scary." The candidates, she said, should knock off the "negative" nonsense and deal squarely with the problems of underemployment and economic insecurity.
Her sentiments were echoed in interview after interview.
"I know so many people who have lost jobs, good jobs, since the mid-80's," said David Lavoie, a 31-year-old jeweler. "And yet the candidates have not addressed these economic issues the way they should. They have not been responsible. I could vote for a Republican, but right now I'm leaning toward Clinton."
Al Miller, who runs a hardware store in nearby Newbury, Mass., said, "Ask them what they're going to do with Social Security and Medicaid. I'm going to retire in five years. Tell them I'll shoot anybody that touches Social Security."
The problem for the Republican Party at the moment is as follows: There is a cosmic disconnect between what the voters want and what the party of the corporate interests can give them. The voters have experienced the reality of the so-called Republican revolution of 1994 and much of it frightened them.
The party's inherent problems are exacerbated by its miserable field of candidates. Bob Dole's cranky wit is not playing well. And it's difficult to imagine working-class voters going hog-wild over a zillionaire whose tax plan undermines the single biggest investment of most working men and women -- their home. And Americans are not about to rally en masse behind a Presidential candidate who has to spend most of his time hiding the hooded sheets in his campaign.
It's ironic that a year into the Republican revolution the concerns of working men and women have been most eloquently expressed by Senator Edward Kennedy, an unabashed liberal who has long been written off by the smart set.
"Americans are working more and earning less," said Mr. Kennedy earlier this month. "They worry -- about losing their jobs, losing their health insurance, affording their children's education, caring for their parents in old age, and somehow still saving for some semblance of security in their own retirement."
Since 1973, said Mr. Kennedy, real family income "has fallen for 60 percent of all Americans, even as the income of the wealthiest 5 percent increased by nearly a third, and income for the top 1 percent almost doubled."
He zeroed in on the central hypocrisy of the Republican Party's message. It makes no sense, he said, "to preach hope, growth and opportunity while touting policies that bring growth only to the richest, deny hope to the poorest and restrict opportunity for the vast majority."
Voters riddled with economic anxiety will find no solace in tomorrow's election. Each vote that they cast will be against their own interests, as they are in search of answers that conservative Republicans are philosophically unable to provide.

HEADLINE: Innovation, Hence Survival, at Apple

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 18

 BODY:
If Apple Computer's new chairman and chief executive, Gilbert F. Amelio, has a grand vision for remaking the personal computer company as it approaches its third decade, he has not yet disclosed it.
Meeting with journalists on Friday for the first time as the company's chief, Mr. Amelio offered a clear and concise message: Apple's problems are not life-threatening and can be corrected without slashing the work force or merging with another company. 
 "We have ourselves in a little trouble right now," he acknowledged. "The troubles are fixable. I've been down this road before."
But he left unanswered deeper questions about the fate of the quixotic company, which once offered the revolutionary idea of a computer on every desktop and the nonbusiness slogan "the journey is the reward."
"Apple has to combine innovation with accountability, and it hasn't been innovating fast enough in recent years because its executives haven't been accountable," said Richard Shaffer, editor of The Technologic Partners Computerletter, an industry publication. "It's one thing to have vision; it's another thing to get the vision out the door."
Indeed, even Apple's most loyal customers are beginning to ask whether the company can set itself apart from the field that has been imitating it for almost two decades.
Mr. Amelio, who owns five Macintosh computers himself, has apparently been moving cautiously but directly in his first 10 days at Apple's helm. David Nagle, the executive who heads Apple's product development, said Mr. Amelio had been touring the company, visiting teams and scoring points with the staff with his understanding of the technical issues the company confronts.
In the spotlight on Friday, Mr. Amelio seemed most concerned with diffusing an atmosphere of panic and disorder at Apple. His answers to questions were not always extensive, but they were direct.
He rejected outright the suggestion that as an Apple board member for 15 months -- while he was chairman and chief executive of National Semiconductor -- he shared the blame for the recent turmoil, saying he was still learning about the company as it encountered its profound troubles.
He also deftly deflected a suggestion that his compensation package, which includes a salary and bonus totaling $2.5 million, was unseemly at a company facing a financial meltdown. His salary was dictated simply by what the market would bear, he replied.
The problems Apple faced, he suggested, involved a little "housecleaning" and might mean moving some people around within the company rather than the wholesale layoff of thousands.
Mr. Amelio's most immediate problem has to be to find a way to stop the brain drain. If Apple is to remain an innovator, it must be able to keep the people who have for so long been willing to "bleed in six colors," a reference to the company's colorful bitten-apple logo.
Innovation is clearly the company's life-or-death challenge today. Once an innovator in personal computing, Apple has found it increasingly difficult to differentiate itself.
The creator of the hand-held computing market, Apple has yet to renew its commitment to the Newton project. And despite being the first company to commercialize the original hypertext vision of electronic documents that could be linked together with pointers -- with the Hypercard program Apple developed in the mid-1980's -- the company was unable to discern the vast power of the obvious next step to the World Wide Web.
But it may be impossible to go back to the days of the quirky Apple Computer that thumbed its nose at its competitors with legendary cockiness.
Under John Sculley, a former Pepsico executive who took over from Apple's co-founder, Steven P. Jobs, in a bitter board room spat in 1985, Apple held to a course that set it apart from the rest of the computer companies. Mr. Sculley painted a future of a trillion-dollar information economy in the next century, but ultimately lost his job when he promised too much.
Under Michael H. Spindler, who took over from Mr. Sculley in 1993, Apple's sense of mission grew murky. The company seemed to turn inward, as if Mr. Spindler -- who had a reputation as the consummate operations man -- believed that it was enough to please customers and ship products.
Mr. Spindler rejected the idea that Apple needed a public vision to differentiate itself from other computer makers. He cut public contact to a minimum, and, when conditions turned down, the company started to slip into a bunker mentality.
Mr. Amelio may ultimately evince the vision and passion necessary to restore Apple's culture of innovation. But from his first public outing, it was difficult to see how he would evoke the heritage of Apple's co-founders, Mr. Jobs and Stephen Wozniak, who pioneered one of America's remarkable industries with their savvy -- and also with their passion.

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL;
Cash and Carry On at Trader Knick

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
Economic downsizing continued yesterday at Madison Square Garden. Soon to follow is the head-hunting process, in which someone very good at what he does will be paid gobs of money to guide the company back to prominence.
Until then, Willie Anderson will try his best to serve as the interim impact player. 
 The Knicks may not catch the Chicago Bulls or the Orlando Magic this season, but in a span of 11 days they have put themselves in position to become one of the most aggressive bidders during the Great Free Agent Auction of 1996.
With the National Basketball Association trading deadline approaching on Thursday, they completed their second deal in less than two weeks yesterday by acquiring the 6-foot-8-inch, multitalented Anderson and the backup center Victor Alexander from the Toronto Raptors in exchange for guard Doug Christie, the backup center Herb Williams and an undisclosed amount of cash.
Nothing personal, the Knicks keep saying. Just business.
"Unless somebody calls and gives us a Michael Jordan, this is the team we'll stick with," General Manager Ernie Grunfeld said via a conference call. "Most likely, we'll have betwe'n $9.5 million and $10 million to work with under the cap. We explored all our options, the best situations for the present and the future.
"There have been a lot of rumors about certain deals that didn't come to fruition. We just looked at this as a case of where we could stay on a competitive level and also improve for the future."
With the nearly $10 million in spending money they will have this summer, the Knicks will be able to court almost anybody not named Shaquille O'Neal. They can realistically go after a power forward of the future such as Juwan Howard, or pay a shooting guard like Steve Smith enough to keep him happy but not enough to upset the salary framework of the other starters. They can even, though they will constantly deny it, test Patrick Ewing's value on the supreme-center market that will include Dikembe Mutombo.
For now, they finally have a backcourt player in Anderson who can consistently break down a defender off the dribble.
"Willie's been around a long time; he's been a good player and he satisfies a position which we really haven't had," Nelson said. "It gives us a different look."
Anderson, a slashing type swingman who has missed 115 games over the past four years with different leg injuries, has played in all of Toronto's games this season. Viewed as one of the league's pre-eminent players after his first two seasons, he has slipped many notches the past few years but still has enough Scottie Pippen-like and Clyde Drexler-like skills to be effective in the open floor.
In 49 games for Toronto this season, the eighth-year player averaged 12.4 points on 44 percent shooting, 3.8 rebounds and 31.9 minutes. His best season was his rookie year in 1988, when he averaged 18.6 points, 5.1 rebounds and 4.6 assists a game for the San Antonio Spurs.
Alexander, a 6-10, 26-year-old, has been on the injury list since Nov. 11 and is not ready to run up and down the court. His foot problem nullified a trade to Cleveland earlier this season. Alexander was the player in the Knicks-Raptors deal that everyone had concerns about.
All four players in yesterday's trade must pass their physicals for the trade to be cfficial.
Grunfeld said the Knicks would not put Alexander on the injured list immediately but that he would need time to get ready to play.
Alexander said the injury is not a problem, but admitted that he wou'd need at least two weeks to get into game shape.
As coach and general manager for Golden State, Nelson drafted Alexander out of Iowa State. He said Alexander has always had a weight problem.
Alexander is listed at 265 pounds and would not disclose his current weight. "Usually when he doesn't say, it's not such a good thing," Nelson said.
The difficult part of the trade for Grunfeld was parting with Williams. Grunfeld called him the classiest veteran he has been associated with. Grunfeld said Williams, who may be traded again by the expansion Raptors before Thursday, "will always have a spot in our organization, on the floor as a coach or in the front office."
The key factor in the deal, though, was that both Anderson and Alexa'der are in the last years of their contracts. Christie had two years left on his and Williams had one year left.
Anderson makes $2.5 million, but nearly $700,000 of that money is deferred. About $1.8 million of his salary counts against the cap. Alexander makes $1.7 million. Christie ($1.463 million) and Williams ($1.3 million) amount to less than $3 million in salary this season, meaning the Knicks probably parted with about $500,000 in cash.
So now, over the course of 11 days, the Knicks have changed one-third of their roster, parted with nearly $25 million in contracts and freed themselves of two players Nelson was never fond of, basketball-wise, in Christie and Charles Smith. Smith and Monty Williams were dealt to San Antonio on Feb. 8 in exchange for J. R. Reid, Brad Lohaus and a first-round draft choice.
Now, the Knicks will most likely go through an adjustment period as their four new players learn Nelson's system and Charles Oakley sits out for six weeks because of a broken right thumb. The Knicks lost to the Nets on Saturday night at the Meadowlands and have lost two of three since the All-Star Game break -- or since the first trade was made.
At any rate, the club has followed its midseason brainstorm -- dump the contracts of Smith and Christie, free salary-cap room and try to make a playoff run with what they already have -- to perfection. The only casualty may be whatever distant hope there was of winning a title this season.
"Oakley getting hurt was obviously not a part of our plan," Grunfeld said. "We are concerned about that, but injuries happen. Until he comes back, we just have to hold down the fort. It's probably going to be quite some adjustment period. I don't know how long that adjustment period is going to be.
"As of today, we still have the sixth-best record in the league."

HEADLINE: Apartheid's Fall Opens Door to Scourge of Cocaine

BYLINE: By SUZANNE DALEY 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Feb. 18

 BODY:
On a weekday afternoon recently, the streets of this city's largely black Hillbrow neighborhood were alive with commerce -- vendors selling fruit from plates on the sidewalk, barbers working under makeshift tents, men sitting behind ancient pedal-powered sewing machines, willing to tailor at a moment's notice.
But everywhere, it seemed, there were also anxious young whites. A group of white teen-age girls, still in school uniforms, approached a doorway looking over their shoulders. Across the street, two white boys waited outside a gate nervously jiggling their pockets. At a service station, a young white woman darted from her car to speak to a man on the corner. The exchanges -- money for drugs -- were quick and not particularly subtle. 
 Nearby, in a more residential area called Yeoville, runners waited on the grassy corners of each block, approaching any car that slowed down. "What you looking for?" was the opening line.
While a crack epidemic raged through the United States and much of Europe in the 1980's, this country remained virtually free of cocaine. International sanctions, which isolated South Africa from the world and eventually helped to topple the apartheid government, had the unexpected benefit of also isolating South Africa from the hugely addictive drug.
But now, as South Africa returns to the world economy, it has become a target for drug traffickers seeking to enlarge their markets. In the last few years, the amount of cocaine confiscated here has soared, and even more telling, officials say, the price of the drug on the street has plummeted because so much is available. Heroin use is also on the increase, though not as fast as cocaine.
"A few years ago, if you'd get a few grams, that was a decent case," said Superintendent Ian Ralph of the Johannesburg narcotics squad. "Now it's much bigger. Cocaine is freely available, just about anytime day or night. It's all over the place, and it's still getting worse."
Police officials admit that they are hardly ready to combat the influx of drugs. The South African police force has only about 400 men assigned to the task nationwide. At Johannesburg airport, where international flights have more than doubled since 1990, no new narcotics agents have been hired, and the X-ray machine they used to inspect luggage from the planes broke down more than a year ago and has not been replaced.
Police officers at the airport are amassing an interesting collection of suitcases with false bottoms and storage containers made to look like everything from hair-spray cans to engine parts. But there is no doubt about how much gets through.
In one instance, the officers found an unaccompanied suitcase filled with cocaine. By checking shipping records and comparing handwriting, they figured out that it was only the latest shipment from a dealer who had passed more than two tons of cocaine through the airport.
The police confiscated only about 400 pounds of cocaine in 1995. But that was up from about 24 pounds in 1992. South Africa's new status in the drug world has drawn the attention of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, which announced last month that it would soon open an office here. The British have promised to do the same.
South Africa not only has a sizable population rich enough to use drugs. It is also strategically placed between South America and the Far East and is therefore particularly attractive to drug dealers looking for a transit point for shipments to Europe. It also boasts the best airports, ports and roads in Africa.
"Many of the things that make this country so great are the things that give it such potential for major international drug dealing," Thomas A. Constantine, the head of the D.E.A., said after touring the country.
While South Africa is only now discovering cocaine and heroin, it has always had a drug-using population. Most popular was a powerful, locally grown marijuana called dagga that has played a role in tribal customs for centuries.
More recently, a synthetic drug called Mandrax, which is manufactured in South Africa and India, has been popular. Mandrax was a legally available sleeping pill until the 1970's. Since then, many South Africans have taken to crushing it, mixing it with marijuana and smoking it.
Officials estimate that 4.5 million tablets of Mandrax were sold in this country last year, for between $8 and $10 a tablet.
Those who run rehabilitation centers say they first began seeing cocaine addictions about four years ago. But in recent months there have been more and more users of crack, the smokable and most addictive form of cocaine.
"It's getting totally out of hand," said Dr. Sylvaine de Miranda, the director of Phoenix House, a rehabilitation center here. "Four years ago, we might have had one cocaine case a year. Now we are getting 6 to 12 inquiries a day."
For the time being, the smallest quantity of cocaine usually sold here is a "rock" of crack, which sells for about $14. Police officials say their greatest fear is that cocaine -- which is half the price it was a year ago -- will become as cheap as Mandrax.
"Crack is much, much worse than Mandrax," said C. J. D. Venter, the head of the country's organized crime task force. "If they can swing that market, then the potential for violence is enormous."
The cocaine originates in South America, and it is usually distributed here by Nigerians, who come in as tourists or refugees. They rarely use the drugs themselves.
Their customers are largely white, since whites are the most likely to be able to afford cocaine.
At a rehabilitation center here recently, a 16-year-old girl described her downward spiral of addiction to cocaine. In three months, she said, she wiped out her $3,000 savings account. Then, she said, she pawned her jewelry and even her shoes. Then she started stealing from her parents.
"I found I could buy cocaine anywhere I wanted," she said. "I went to four different high schools in the last year, and I could get whatever I wanted at all of them."

HEADLINE: Essay;
In a Smoke-Free Room

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Two weeks ago, newsmagazine covers were touting Steve Forbes; polls were reporting growing Forbes strength in Iowa and pulling away from the field in New Hampshire.
Eschewing all food during that feeding frenzy, I expressed a certitude that no rich newcomer would be the Republican nominee. Now, with Forbes's balloon punctured, there are none in fickle medialand so poor to do him reverence. 
 The frenzy relocates. Still afflicted with the urge to surge, the pollster-pundit-strategist complex has now chosen Pat Buchanan as its Hero-Villain of the Week.
We are being treated to the If parade: If it snows hard, and if the Forbes TV barrage has weakened Dole, and if the floaters split the support of electable candidates by alighting on Lamar Alexander -- won't Buchanan's True Believers propel him to victory?
Certitude time again: no Buchanan showing in any early primary will determine the nomination outcome. Today's Republican Party has a life wish and -- remembering how its Goldwater debacle ushered in L.B.J.'s Great Society -- will not be led down the path to certain defeat.
Therefore, Republicans interested in replacing Clinton can treat the Buchanan showing, whatever it is, with respect but not with a deference rooted in fear. Sideshows are over; the 1996 G.O.P. campaign is now between Dole and Alexander.
I recall a dinner with Lamar early last year. In a booth at the Palm restaurant in Washington, with the field of candidates widening and his recognition factor in single digits, he revealed a strategy of survival known best to long-distance runners: "The last one left standing wins."
After New Hampshire, he will be one of the two electables left standing. What will the Dole-Alexander race be about?
At the start, it will center on who has the best chance of beating Clinton.
The resolute Alexander, who learned speechwriting at the knee of the legendary Bryce Harlow, knows how to focus on a few issues and hone his message down to a few memorable lines; that's why he can present himself as a more articulate and media-savvy opponent to Clinton in toe-to-toe debate.
Beyond that, Lamar will find ways (other than walking across the United States) to contrast his relative youth and energy with Dole's age and the potential return of Dole's testiness. The younger man has not been doing this subtly enough; now that he has established himself as Dole's alternative, Alexander is likely to appeal to undecided Republicans with the vigor of his "outsider's" attack on Clinton.
The experienced Dole, tested in crisis and advantaged by his handicap, is the long-distance runner. He paces himself better now; knows the track's purpose is to collect delegates rather than media kudos; and may have enough kick left for a convention sprint.
Dole will leave most of the hard-shell Buchanan vote to Buchanan and compete with Alexander for the other three-fourths of Republicans. That means casting the race along the lines of 1980, with himself as ol'-shoe Reagan and Alexander as preppy Bush. (Lamar, financed and advised by Bushies, is aware of the danger; the key state may be Texas, with Senator Gramm and Governor Bush taking different sides.)
At March's end, if both Dole and Alexander are on their feet, the strategy of mutual undermining -- "too old" vs. "Bush II" -- will lose appeal and have to be subordinated to a more elevated campaign about ideas showing "vision" and "leadership."
Cornball? Hardly; conservatives like me would like to see a preconvention campaign that focuses not on flat taxes or border fences but on the means to budget balancing, power devolution, term limits and assertive foreign policy.
China and Russia may force foreign decisions, Dole's strong suit; as the economy turns down, Alexander has the more imaginative ideas. Both can play off the Buchanan minority's iso-protectionism.
If the party and nation are lucky, we will sail through to an open convention in San Diego. Credentials fights; platform debates; horse trading in smoke-free rooms; floor demonstrations; above all, suspense (Lugar on the 10th ballot?)
Can't wait. Pity the dull Democrats.

HEADLINE: Balkan Leaders Pledge to Carry Out Dayton Accord

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: ROME, Feb. 18

 BODY:
Officials of the United States and its NATO allies concluded two days of sometimes tense meetings with Balkan leaders here today, producing a series of declarations that recommit the former warring parties to full compliance with the Bosnian peace accords.
In four formal documents, the Presidents of Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia pledged to resume contacts with commanders of the NATO-led force, to carry out on schedule the establishment of a unified administration in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, to insure the safety of war prisoners and refugees, and to commit themselves to the prosecution of war crimes and other human rights abuses. 
 The talks were called because of increasing frustration over the pace at which many provisions of the Dayton peace accord were being put into effect.
Serbian agreement to at least some of the terms of today's documents was eased by assurance from the United States and its allies that moves would begin this week to suspend economic sanctions against the Bosnian Serbs.
Much of the substance, if not always the detail, of this weekend's agreements was included in the Dayton accord, which was signed in Paris in December. It is unclear to what extent the renewed assurances, which were accepted by Presidents Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia, will restore momentum to the faltering peace effort.
Nevertheless, Assistant Secretary of State Richard C. Holbrooke, the chief American negotiator, said, "We have avoided a crisis."
Speaking at a news conference, Mr. Holbrooke, who is to retire from the State Department this week, said, "We have prevented a situation that could have jeopardized the Dayton agreements."
In the principal document, the three Presidents reaffirmed their commitment to fully carry out the Dayton accord. Thus, Serbia agreed that its military officers would resume contacts and talks with NATO military officials, which were suspended to protest the arrest of Bosnian Serb officers as suspected war criminals.
Agreement was reached on specific terms to reunify the Bosnian city of Mostar, which is divided between Muslims and Croats and has been a major stumbling block to progress.
Mr. Holbrooke insisted that the weekend's meetings, which were joined by officials of France, Britain, Germany and Russia -- the countries that with the United States make up the "contact group" that has tried to bring peace to the former Yugoslavia -- did not alter the Dayton accord.
"Let me stress: there was no change to Dayton here in Rome," Mr. Holbrooke said.
Officials sought to emphasize the progress made in resolving problems surrounding Sarajevo, where the transfer of several Serbian-held suburbs to the control of the Muslim-dominated Government has faced resistance. In what appeared to be a concession to the Serbian side, the United States and its allies agreed to begin the process of lifting sanctions imposed by the United Nations against the Bosnian Serbs, in exchange for fresh impetus on resolving the deadlock in Sarajevo.
In recent days, large numbers of Serbian families have deserted Sarajevo. In a statement that was signed by Presidents Milosevic of Serbia and Izetbegovic of Bosnia, as well as political leaders of the three factions in Bosnia -- Muslim, Serb and Croat -- the Sarajevo Serbs were called on not to desert their homes.
"We appeal to all to stay in the city," the statement read, adding that residents should "rest assured that their legitimate rights will be taken into account."
Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai N. Afanasyevsky of Russia said the decision to consider lifting sanctions would "promote peace and positive attitudes toward the three parties."
American officials sought to play down the significance of this issue, recalling that an end to sanctions had been foreseen by the Dayton accord. They suggested that it represented merely a technical step, which hinged on NATO commanders' assessment of the Bosnian Serbs' willingness to abide by the Dayton agreement's terms on military disengagement.
"This is not a concession," Mr. Holbrooke said. "It must be earned by actions on the ground."
In Dayton last year, the rival factions agreed to a timetable for pulling their troops back behind a zone of separation, and the suspension of sanctions was made contingent on compliance.
Officials said substantive agreement had been reached early today, but hours of further debate had been required to resolve the final issue, the reunification of Mostar.

HEADLINE: Newspaper Owners Do the Shuffle;
Communities Worry as Dailies Pass From Chain to Chain

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON 

DATELINE: MIDDLETOWN, Conn.

 BODY:
For a generation, family owners of local newspapers in places across the country like this old city on the Connecticut River have been selling off to chains.
But a new phenomenon has arrived here in Middletown and from coast to coast: chains are now selling many of those same newspapers to other chains. The result is a widespread churning of hometown dailies that is reshaping the newspaper industry, leaving communities confused about who their corporate publishers are -- or what they stand for -- and raising old questions about whether corporate control of newspapers is good for the country. 
 Many people in communities with new corporate owners of their newspapers said their towns seemed diminished when their papers became a commodity traded among outsiders. Some people here in Middletown say the arrival of the Journal Register Company, the second chain owner in four and a half years, has meant a disappointing end to some of the local idiosyncrasies and autonomy that survived the first phase of chain ownership.
One example much noted by people here is the newspaper's new design, which made The Middletown Press look just like the newspapers that Journal Register bought not long ago in the nearby towns of New Britain and Bristol.
"You wonder whether The Middletown Press is just going to be one of those papers that changes hands every few years when the owner can make a profit," said Stephen T. Gionfriddo, a councilman and former mayor here, who echoed the sentiments of people in a dozen other places.
Some newspaper executives say groups of nearby papers are more efficient to manage and can benefit from economies of scale like shared printing plants. Local news, they say, can be re-used in neighboring papers, on computer on-line services and in printed "niche" products like tabloids on high school sports and other topics.
The Middletown Press and four other Connecticut dailies owned by the Journal Register Company now share articles, and all the papers can rely on a single reporter to cover Hartford sporting events or news from the statehouse, said Robert M. Jelenic, the company president.
But, "to me," Mr. Gionfriddo said, "The Middletown Press no longer feels like a hometown paper, and that, to me, has been a loss."
During the last three years, 256 of the nation's 1,550 daily papers have changed hands, more than the total during the previous six years. At the same time, the number of newspaper deals involving groups selling to other groups has increased steadily. Last year, 75 percent of all the newspapers sold passed from one group to another, up from just 16 percent 10 years ago, according to Dirks, Van Essen & Associates, a newspaper broker.
Newspaper analysts say the churning of local papers is a symptom of an industry reshaping itself to compete with new competitors like electronic information distributors. They say it also represents a new phase in the deepening trend toward consolidation that has been bringing newspapers across the country under the control of chains for decades.
With many newspapers struggling against higher newsprint prices and weakening circulation, some companies are shuffling their papers to "cluster" dailies so they can cut costs and share information gathered by their reporters.
Other companies are collecting small papers, which typically have much higher profit margins than big-city dailies. Still others are backing away from smaller papers to concentrate on larger dailies or electronic media as the newspaper industry grows more competitive.
Some industry analysts say such strategies reflect the reality that it has become harder to wring profits from newspapers of all sizes. "There is a realization that the newspaper business is still a good business, but it has to be made more efficient and the way you become more efficient is by reducing costs and through economies of scale," said Kenneth T. Berents, a newspaper securities analyst at Wheat First Butcher Singer in Richmond.
The shuffling of local papers has involved companies of all sizes, including giants like the Gannett Company, which bought 11 dailies last year, and The New York Times Company, which sold five dailies last year, and smaller companies like the Journal Register Company of Trenton, a fast-growing chain that bought the Middletown paper in September. Journal Register is owned by the New York investment firm E. M. Warburg, Pincus & Company.
In the newspaper equivalent of an odd-lot sale, Thomson Newspapers, based in Canada, sold 25 American newspapers last year, from the Barstow (Calif.) Desert Dispatch to the Herkimer (N.Y.) Evening Telegram. The biggest buyer was Hollinger Inc., controlled by the Canadian press entrepreneur Conrad Black, which now publishes 111 dailies in the United States, more than any other company.
Executives at Journal Register, echoing those at other companies that are buying newspapers, say efficient management will give their papers new life. But to some people changes in ownership have brought unwelcome changes to their hometown papers.
In places like Fayetteville, Ark., and Sedalia, Mo., people said editors installed by new owners did not seem sufficiently acquainted with the towns to know who was prominent enough to merit an obituary.
Jane Gray, the Mayor of Sedalia, said the sale of The Sedalia Democrat by Thomson Newspapers to Freedom Communications of Santa Ana, Calif., seemed to leave Sedalia out of the equation. "It seems to me," she said, "there needs to be some kind of peer input, which you can't have if you don't even know who they are, where they are."
What has happened to The Middletown Press in recent months and the local debate about it in this city of about 43,000 south of Hartford, provides a glimpse of similar stories in scores of other towns.
For The Press, the latest chapter began four years ago with the D'Oench brothers, who had run the paper for 32 years and knew most everyone in town. They realized, Russell G. D'Oench Jr. said recently, that no one in the family was interested in taking over the paper. "We were trying to put it into good hands," said Mr. D'Oench, who was editor while his brother, Woodbridge D'Oench, was publisher.
The natural choice, Mr. D'Oench said, was Eagle Publishing, a small chain owned by the Miller family, which published the respected Berkshire Eagle in Pittsfield, Mass. But soon after the sale to Eagle, residents and staff members of The Press said, the match provided a disturbing first taste of the risks of chain newspaper management.
Executives sent in by the Massachusetts managers quarreled bitterly with each other and then abruptly changed The Press from an afternoon to a morning paper, a decision that some people here said betrayed a lack of understanding of the rhythm of Middletown. Some blame that switch for a rapid drop in daily circulation to about 13,000 from about 20,000.
Not long after that, Eagle Publishing slipped into its own financial troubles because of an ill-timed real estate investment in Massachusetts. The Middletown Press, some people here say, seemed something of a stepchild after that.
By last summer, the Millers' financial troubles led them to sell their newspapers to Media News Group of Denver, controlled by W. Dean Singleton, one of the newspaper industry's most bottom-line-oriented executives. But by the time the dust had settled in September, Mr. Singleton had sold The Middletown Press once again, this time to Journal Register.
Journal Register, which owns The New Haven Register, The Trentonian and 15 other dailies, was from the start a different kind of corporate owner from Eagle. Known as intensely focused on profit, the company's reputation preceded it here. Journalists at The Press said they were concerned about whether the new owner would block efforts to put out a quality paper. Some said they were especially anxious about several incidents that had received extensive publicity in Connecticut.
When Journal Register started a new Sunday issue in 1994 at its paper in Torrington, Conn., for example, a reporter for the paper wrote an article about delivery problems for the new issue. The reporter was dismissed. Then the editorial page editor resigned, saying the paper had refused to print letters to the editor protesting the dismissal.
News accounts had portrayed the episode as a sign that Journal Register would compromise journalistic values in favor of its business interests.
And just as the company was buying The Middletown Press last fall, The Hartford Advocate, an alternative paper that circulates here, described Journal Register as "a top-down, bottom-line, feed-'em-to-the-wolves corporation."
Mr. Jelenic, president of Journal Register, said in a recent interview that some of the bad publicity came from worried competitors. He refused to discuss the Torrington incident, but he said Journal Register improved all its papers by, among other strategies, combining operations with nearby papers it owns.
"Because you have so much in the way of efficiencies," Mr. Jelenic said, "you can have a few fewer people but you can get a better product."
Within a few weeks of Journal Register's arrival, national and international news, which had long been featured prominently in The Press, was de-emphasized. Some of the paper's longtime journalists were not offered jobs. Soon, virtually the entire news staff was gone.
On Oct. 1, the familiar black-and-white layout was replaced with the new design, which emphasized bright colors, including a red banner on the front page and large pictures. There were new sections and many small local articles by reporters no one around here had heard of before.
James F. Normandin, the new publisher here, said the newly designed paper had received an enthusiastic response because of an emphasis on local news.
But on Main Street, where the changes in The Press have often been a topic of conversation, the reviews have not always been good. Vincent Amato, who has run Amatos toy store for 56 years, said the paper relied on young reporters "who don't know the background like the people who were here for a long time and lived here." He said the paper was filled with insignificant articles. "It takes me about a quarter of the time to read the paper that it used to," he said.
William Corvo, who is active in local Republican politics and whowrote a political column for the paper until the new management stopped it, said The Middletown Press had lost the flavor of Middletown. "The substance is missing," he said.
Russell D'Oench, the former editor and co-owner, said the story of The Middletown Press had not worked out as he had hoped. The new publishers, he said, seem to have designed their paper without a sense of place. "It is definitely a chain cookie-cutter solution," he said. "It wouldn't have been my preference."
Mr. Jelenic said he was used to criticism and he did not dwell on it. In fact, he said, he was off on a trip: He was in search of other towns where papers like The Middletown Press are for sale again.

 For 112 years, The Middletown Press has served as the local paper for its namesake city of 43,000 south of Hartford. Once a family-run afternoon daily, it has changed hands twice since 1992. The Press was transformed to a morning paper with extensive design and content changes, many of which have distance loyal readers. With many newspapers struggling against higher newsprint prices and weakening circulation, more chains are selling small hometown dailies to others.

HEADLINE: Hark! A Mainer Stirs Economic Populism!

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: NORTH PARSONSFIELD, Me.

 BODY:
Clanging on a trash-can lid to kick off a Maine corn chowder potluck meeting this month, the featured speaker and organizer plunged into a fast-paced condemnation of corporate downsizing and free trade.
"Corporations aren't there for the public good," she told the crowd of about 70 loggers, farmers, environmentalists and self-described anarchists at a schoolhouse in this town near the New Hampshire border. "They're there to produce more profits for the stockholders in the next quarter." 
 Patrick J. Buchanan is not the only one bringing a message of economic populism to working-class New Englanders worried about layoffs and weakening wages.
The potluck speaker, Carolyn Chute, Maine's native-daughter novelist, has been organizing a grass-roots political movement centered on making corporations and government more responsive to workers. Calling her group the 2d Maine Militia, Ms. Chute has attracted some of Maine's conservatives with her support for gun-ownership rights and by bashing the North American Free Trade Agreement.
But the group, which Ms. Chute began last year and which is more gun club than militia, is appealing to conservative and liberal Mainers alike by opposing proposals for a flat income tax and demanding an end to corporation campaign contributions and tax subsidies for big business.
Regarding such issues as abortion and gay rights, she and her followers consider them distractions from the more important issues of jobs and government accountability to the working class.
Growing up in a blue-collar family, and experiencing poverty as a single parent, Ms. Chute, who is in her 40's, has long complained about the lack of attention given to have-nots in this country.
"Many other militias and many individuals blame gays, blacks, Jews, Spanish-speaking folks, welfare mums, illegal drugs, seat belts, schools without prayers, women with shoes, abortions, environmentalists, unseen Communist forces and so-called liberals," Ms. Chute wrote in a Dec. 24, 1995, opinion article in The Maine Sunday Telegram, a Portland newspaper.
"The whole of America is squabbling over all these details while huge corporations smilingly take more than 50 percent off the top of the Federal budget for subsidies including outright handouts for researching new business opportunities in other countries where they can exploit foreign workers like they exploit us, all in the name of free enterprise and individual rights."
Ms. Chute has gained a fierce loyalty from many rural Maine readers with her 1985 best-selling first novel, "The Beans of Egypt, Maine," and other gritty books about working-class poverty and powerlessness.
But despite Ms. Chute's popularity, her group has an uncertain future. No definitive plans have been made on how to achieve the group's goals, and no donations have been solicited. She acknowledges her ignorance of the political process but pushes aside suggestions that the group will simply fade away for lack of money and sophistication.
"We realize that our goals may take many lifetimes," she said in an interview at the potluck lunch. "We have to be patient. We're trying to educate and we're also trying to educate how powerful we can be."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: LOSING MOMENTUM;
The Surge Has Waned, but Forbes Remains Hopeful

BYLINE: By ERNEST TOLLERSON 

DATELINE: NASHUA, N.H., Feb. 18

 BODY:
Barely two weeks ago in Iowa, Steve Forbes was a heavyweight. His Presidential candidacy spooked the front-runner, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas. Now, on the eve of New Hampshire's primary, Mr. Forbes finds himself a bantamweight candidate, hoping to do well enough to get an economy-class ticket to future primaries.
This, of course, is not a fate Mr. Forbes muses about, at least in public. He has settled into a survivalist mode. "This race is now wide open," he said in an interview on Saturday. "Dole has lost his aura of invincibility. Buchanan has become a serious player. Alexander has become a serious player. The question is, Can Buchanan and Alexander survive the examination that every candidate goes through? So it's going to be very fluid, very fluid for another three weeks before it shakes out." 
 By and large, the forces that converted a heavyweight into a bantamweight seem to have been matters within Mr. Forbes's control. They include his multimillion-dollar campaign of negative advertising, his decision not to speak in depth about any issue beyond his flat-tax plan, and an inability to win the trust of a critical mass of religious conservatives. Even minor breaches of political etiquette, like returning to his headquarters for a strategy session the day after the Iowa caucuses instead of coming straight to New Hampshire, annoyed some of the party faithful here.
Asked how he felt about the advertising strategy, which he has abandoned and now refers to as "a mistake," he said: "Certainly my negatives are going down. How much that translates into votes, I don't know. But I think we have turned the corner."
At some of the stops Mr. Forbes has made in the final run-up to Tuesday's primary, there are subtle signs of his flagging fortunes. At his speech in the Daniel Webster College gym on Saturday, the college students flanking the Forbes family on the bottom row of the bleachers and the ones in the second row held Forbes signs, but many were not supporters. The second row was made up of students from a political science class at Tufts University in Massachusetts; a few supported him, but others were just there at an instructor's advice.
And Mr. Forbes is finding it much easier to move about New Hampshire than was the case in Iowa -- because media interest in him is waning. Last Sunday a swarm of television crews surrounded him as he entered a Holiday Inn in Des Moines to give a speech, making movement through a section of the lobby dangerous. ABC reported later that there were close to 50 crews. On Friday night, after Mr. Forbes greeted Nashua City Republicans at a dinner, only six crews trailed the Forbes family to elevators in the Nashua Marriott.
In the eyes of some analysts, Mr. Forbes's negative-advertising war broke a cardinal rule. "You've got to lay a positive base before you go negative on everyone else," said William Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine. "I'm a friend of his, and I hope he gets out of the race."
Once Mr. Forbes won the perceptual look-at-me primary in the minds of voters and the media, he seemed unable to broaden himself from Steve Flat Tax; he never gave major addresses devoted solely to other issues.
And although he is not the only candidate using attack advertising, his record in that regard in Iowa and New Hampshire is longer than any of his rivals. Only Mr. Forbes has had the means to wage a multimillion-dollar air war, because he dipped into his own fortune and chose not take public matching money, freeing him of Federal spending limits.
Mr. Forbes has also been unable to convince many Christian fundamentalists that his opposition to abortion is genuine. Today, mindful of that, he made a last-minute effort to open a dialogue by meeting informally with clergy members and others who oppose abortion.
The views of Lyn Nofziger, who was an aide to President Ronald Reagan and now is a Dole supporter, are typical of the analysis of Mr. Forbes's rise and near-collapse in an anti-tax state that appeared hospitable to his message.
"Once you got him out of talking about the flat tax, he was a little vague," Mr. Nofziger said. "Secondly, I think his negative ads against everybody seemed to have a bad reaction."
But there is also a Lazarus current in speculation about Mr. Forbes. "His message of growth and opportunity and freedom is one that still has powerful resonance," said a prominent conservative who asked for anonymity. "It's too early to write his obituary."
Mr. Kristol disagreed.
Reiterating a position taken in a recent editorial in his magazine, he said that Mr. Forbes remained "an improbable Presidential candidate," a person Americans would not be willing to take a gamble on.
Mr. Forbes sees his reduced circumstances here as the confluence of forces mostly beyond his control. In the interview, he cited Mr. Dole's negative television advertisements. Also, he said, both the leadership of the Christian Coalition and the press damaged his candidacy.
Mr. Kristol said that if Mr. Forbes withdraws soon, he can continue pushing the party to embrace Mr. Reagan's vision of growth, opportunity and curbing government. He said Mr. Forbes deserved credit for moving the party "away from an almost excessive focus on balancing the budget."

HEADLINE: Incoming Leader of N.A.A.C.P. Vows That 'Change Is at Hand'

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
Kweisi Mfume, who is to be formally sworn in tomorrow in Washington as the newly chosen chief officer of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, has already put his personal stamp on the troubled organization.
"Change is at hand -- we are in the process of reinventing ourselves," Mr. Mfume said Saturday night after his selection was ratified at the N.A.A.C.P.'s annual board meeting in New York. 
 Mr. Mfume, who served as chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus from 1992 to 1994, faces the challenges not only of reviving the N.A.A.C.P. but also of grappling with a national political climate that threatens to roll back civil rights advances.
In approving his contract by a unanimous vote, the board tried to put to rest the recent years of internecine power struggles and scandals that have hurt the N.A.A.C.P.'s recruitment drives and fund-raising campaigns and damaged its clout as the country's oldest and best known civil rights organization.
The top post had been vacant since 1994, when the board dismissed Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. as executive director after revelations that he had secretly spent N.A.A.C.P. money to fend off a sexual harassment and discrimination complaint.
Entrusting Mr. Mfume with broader power than his predecessors held, the board amended its constitution to create for him the new post of president and chief executive officer. It also agreed to have him report to a 17-member executive committee instead of to the full 64-member board.
Board members called Mr. Mfume's speech healing and upbeat. The chairwoman, Myrlie Evers-Williams, said, "It's a glorious day for this organization as well as for the country."
But the internal problems Mr. Mfume faces were still evident in the wrangling and disorganization at the three-day board gathering at the Hilton hotel in Manhattan, ending with a 12-hour meeting -- much of it in executive session. In a public relations blunder, a news conference scheduled to showcase the new president to the nation was delayed more than eight hours.
Even after staff cuts, the N.A.A.C.P.'s $6 million-a-year operation has a $3 million debt. Stressing its commitment to fiscal responsibility, the board authorized its lawyer to seek restitution of more than $100,000 it says was misspent by the former chairman, William F. Gibson, whom it ousted a year ago but who still has loyalists.
Mr. Mfume said he was eager to rebuild the organization's membership, which he estimated the paid total at 500,000, plus 500,000 volunteers. He promised to straighten out the records "so there won't even be a question."
President Clinton's expected attendance at the swearing-in underscores the symbolic importance of the N.A.A.C.P., with its long history of protests, litigation and legislation. But critics say the N.A.A.C.P. seems irrelevant, uncertain of its mission and upstaged by other black organizations, like the Nation of Islam with its Million Man March.
In Kweisi Mfume (pronounced kwah-EE-see oom-FOO-may), the N.A.A.C.P. has a self-made man who rose from dire beginnings in Baltimore. An orphan, he became a school dropout and homeless youth who fathered five children out of wedlock.
But he turned his life around through education and work, becoming a poised, popular radio broadcaster and then a City Councilman and five-term Democratic Congressman.
Identifying with the "despair and hopelessness" of disaffected black youths, Mr. Mfume said he would make them a priority for the N.A.A.C.P. Also high on his list is voter registration, economic development and support from foundations and corporations.
Mr. Mfume relinquished his Congressional seat to lead the N.A.A.C.P. The board declined to release the terms of his contract but did not dispute a reported salary of $200,000.
In a bitter episode in Mr. Mfume's career, he announced "a sacred covenant" with the black nationalist Louis Farrakhan in 1992. Jewish organizations and some black leaders assailed Mr. Mfume, who later disavowed his remarks.
At the board meeting, he said: "Racism, sexism and anti-Semitism are wrong. As long as there is an N.A.A.C.P., they will never enjoy a quiet and acceptable existence."
He called for wider coalitions with other minority groups, saying the organization is "big enough, bad enough and broad enough" to reach out to Hispanic, Asian-American, native American Indian, Jewish and other groups.
Noting that blacks have always reflected a broad spectrum of political views and styles, Mr. Mfume struck a mainstream note for the N.A.A.C.P.
"We want to create and cultivate a movement that represents the best of America," he said. "Racial and religious tolerance and effecting change in government became the banner of N.A.A.C.P." years ago and remain valid today, he said.

So when the Cuban leader strode into a reception room at the Palace of the Revolution here early today to meet Robert and Michael Kennedy, two nephews of the American President, history hung heavily over the encounter.
The Bay of Pigs, the Cuban missile crisis -- Mr. Castro reflected on the major conflicts between the United States and Cuba that marked his first years in power, and on the Kennedy assassination. But pressed by his American visitors during a colloquy that lasted nearly three hours, he also responded to issues that still cloud relations with the United States, like human rights and Cuba's nuclear power program. 
 "My family and my own life have been intertwined with Cuba," Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told Mr. Castro at one point, recalling how as a child he was allowed by his father, the Attorney General and chief adviser to his brother the President, to come into meetings on the Cuban missile crisis. "Although there was much antagonism in the political relationship," he added, there was also respect for Mr. Castro's skills as a soldier and leader.
"It's unfortunate things happened as they did, and he could not do what he wanted to do," Mr. Castro said, referring to John F. Kennedy's assassination. "It is my impression that it was his intention after the missile crisis to change the framework" of relations between the United States and Cuba, which remains hostile even today.
The Kennedy brothers have been in Cuba since Wednesday as part of private visit by a delegation of 10 American energy experts and environmental safety advocates organized by the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Citizens Energy Corporation.
The United States Government granted the groups the licenses that allowed them to travel legally to Cuba for the visit, which is to end on Monday.
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., 42, is senior staff attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, which is based in Washington, and lobbies in the United States and abroad on environmental and energy issues.
Michael L. Kennedy, 37, is chairman of Citizens Energy Corporation, a Boston-based nonprofit company that promotes the development of alternative energy resources and has been active in the third world.
Their meeting with the Cuban President began at 12:30 this morning because, Mr. Castro said, he had been watching a Cuban baseball playoff game on television late Saturday night and wanted to see how it ended. The team he was rooting for, Villa Clara, won 12-4, as it turned out, beating the Havana Industriales, and Mr. Castro entered in a chipper mood, wearing his customary green fatigues.
As is his custom in such discussions, the Cuban leader roamed over a wide variety of topics, offering assessments of luminaries ranging from Jacques Chirac and Mikhail S. Gorbachev to Babe Ruth and Louis Farrakhan. But he turned several times to his memories of the three years in which he squared off against John and Robert Kennedy during the cold war.
Mr. Castro did not refer to the American-sponsored assassination attempts against him that took place during the Kennedy Administration, nor did he offer his theory of who killed the President. But he talked at some length about the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961, which, he argued, was primarily a product of the Eisenhower Administration. The invasion attempt, carried out by Cuban exiles who were armed and trained by the United States, was a disaster, with most of the invaders killed or captured.
"I don't think they were left with many options in regard to Cuba," he said, referring to John and Robert Kennedy. "When they took office, all the plans were on. It would have been too difficult for them to change things. I think they inherited a legacy from the previous Administration."
Clearly in a ruminative state of mind, the Cuban leader reflected on how the fortunes of the Kennedy Administration were linked with his own. "President Kennedy enjoyed great prestige after the missile crisis," he said of the October 1962 showdown over Soviet missiles in Cuba in which both Mr. Castro and Nikita S. Khrushchev were forced to back down. "It was different than after the Bay of Pigs."
The day President Kennedy was killed, Mr. Castro recalled, he was meeting with a French journalist who had agreed to serve as an unofficial messenger between the men. "We were talking in Varadero at noontime," he said, referring to a beach resort on Cuba's northern coast. "What a coincidence that was. Just as we had started talking, the radio broadcast news of the President's assassination. That was very dramatic news, especially for me."
Michael Kennedy informed Mr. Castro that recently declassified United States Government documents now in the possession of the Kennedy Library in Boston indicate that President Kennedy was considering steps to improve relations with Cuba at the time he was killed.
"Have they all been declassified?" asked a clearly curious Mr. Castro, who was given copies of the documents at the end of the meeting.
Mr. Castro was also reminded that before he seized power in 1959, Robert and Michael Kennedy's maternal grandfather, George Skakel, owned a home in Varadero, where a neighbor was Fulgencio Batista, the dictator Mr. Castro would overthrow.
"Did we nationalize it, by any chance?" Mr. Castro asked, laughing at the thought. He then mocked legislation currently before Congress, sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican, and Representative Dan Burton, a Republican of Indiana, that would impose sanctions on foreign investors who acquire properties in Cuba originally owned by Americans.
"You don't need Helms-Burton to be able to go there," to the family's winter home, he told the Kennedys and their cousin Michael C. Skakel. "We can make an arrangement."
Appealing to their host's sense of history, and his place in it, the Kennedys urged Mr. Castro to free several political prisoners. The Cuban leader did not seem surprised by the request, but neither did he offer much encouragement when he was handed two lists of names.
"You too?" he said, referring to previous meetings with members of the Kennedy family and foreign delegations that have also asked him to release political prisoners. "You can show me the list so that you will be forgiven in the United States."
After examining the lists and asserting that "these were surely given to you by the State Department," Mr. Castro suggested that if the United States lifted its 34-year economic embargo against Cuba he might be inclined to be more yielding.
"When the blockade is lifted and there are no longer hostilities, this category of prisoner will not exist anymore," he said. "It's in your hands. It's up to you."
Mr. Castro's remarks followed a roundup in recent days of Cuban dissidents. At least 10 people, all of them members of a coalition of opposition, human rights and professional groups called Concilio Cubano, have been arrested in the crackdown, and another is still being sought, according to colleagues of those detained.
The coalition has been trying to organize a conference here next weekend and has asked for Government authorization to meet, citing provisions of the Cuban Constitution.
The bulk of the meeting was devoted to discussion of Cuba's energy needs and its recently renewed nuclear power program. The Kennedys and the others in the delegation strongly urged Mr. Castro to abandon the nuclear program, arguing that alternative energy sources would be far safer, cleaner, cheaper and more efficient.
The future of the nuclear power plant is "a very complex question," Mr. Castro responded. But he indicated some flexibility on the issue and poked fun at his former Soviet allies and their technology, saying he looked forward to the day nuclear reactors would become "20th-century pyramids, like those in Egypt," and describing the Soviet Union's nuclear power program after the Chernobyl disaster as "just an excuse to ask for more money."
As Mr. Castro was speaking, a Russian delegation led by Minister of Nuclear Energy Viktor Mikhailov was arriving here to discuss plans to finish a nuclear reactor on Cuba's southern coast. If anyone else has a better idea, the Cuban leader indicated in what was clearly a reference to the United States and other Western nations, he would be happy to hear it.
"That chapter is not closed yet," he said. "We are open to options."

Down These Frigid Streets: Homeless in Canada

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Feb. 18

 BODY:
Warily, he walked into the Moss Park Armory of the Canadian Armed Forces in downtown Toronto, spotted a large cardboard box filled with pile and down jackets and tried one on for size. Other homeless men and women were doing the same.
His eyes sunk in dark pools on a furrowed face, his hands slightly shaking, he gave his name only as Matt and said he was 53, a former construction worker, living on the street for the last three years. 
 "Construction went down the tubes," he said, his voice cracking. "There was nothing else out there for me."
His wife found another man, he said, and took their five children.
Matt kept the jacket, as he was meant to, then helped himself to coffee, soup and doughnuts and spent the night on a cot -- benefits of an unusual military mission. For the first time, the Canadian Army has swung into action to try to stop deaths of the homeless from the numbing cold on Toronto streets.
Winters are always cold here, with temperatures plunging sometimes well below zero Fahrenheit and the wind off Lake Ontario something else again. But this year's harsher than usual Arctic blasts, on top of a 22 percent cut in provincial welfare allowances and the failure of employment to pick up after the longest recession since the 1930's, has created emergency conditions that are straining the resources of Canada's biggest metropolis.
"I can safely say I'm shocked at the condition of some of the people coming in here," said Lieut. Col. Tony Welsh, commander of the armory regiment, the Queen's Own Rifles of Canada, which this month responded to an emergency appeal from the Toronto City Council to host the homeless. "A lot of the skills we're using aren't regular soldiering skills."
"Or if they are," he added with a smile, "they are being used in different ways."
Three homeless men have frozen to death so far this winter, more than in any other winter in recent memory. One, in a plywood lean-to under an expressway, could not be identified for days because his hands had frozen solid over his face. A second was huddled by the door of a beauty college in a Chinese district, the third curled inside an unheated bus shelter.
Intensely proud of their Scandinavian-like social safety net, Canadians usually identify homelessness with the United States, or the third world. Yet here in Toronto, often held out as one of the best-functioning cities of North America, a surge of homelessness is not only testing compassion but setting off a political storm.
"It's a shock to see three people die here like this," said David Hutcheon, a city councilor who worked with Mayor Barbara Hall to persuade the army to open the armory to the homeless. "It's like watching somebody die in your living room."
Until the army came on the scene, hostels and churches were struggling to meet the demand. Some 4,500 hostel beds are available on any one night, up 700 over last year, and 26 churches have opened their doors.
The best estimate of the total number of homeless comes from Anishnawbe Health Toronto, an Ojibway Indian organization that looks after street people, about a fifth of whom are Indian.
Anishnawbe, which operates a health center downtown and sends out street patrols with sandwiches, coffee and soup for all the homeless, not just Indians, has gathered statistics that show the number of homeless in this city of three million rose from 11,500 in 1992 to 19,500 in 1995.
The executive director, Barbra Nahwegahbow, noted a 43 percent increase in just the last nine months of 1995. "The social conscience that Canadians seem to think they have is not really there," she lamented. "The concept still exists, but resources needed to make it fully work are harder to come by."
Spurred by the deaths of the homeless, Toronto's City Council has just approved a crisis fund amounting to $450,000 in United States currency to provide a 24-hour telephone line with information on available hostel beds, to help with psychiatric problems, to pay salaries at day drop-in centers and to increase sources of food.
"No more funerals," a demonstrator shouted as the council voted for the package this month. A sign held by another activist read, "Westinghouse and Frigidaire do a better job housing the homeless than the province of Ontario and Metro" -- a reference to shelters made by street people out of the cardboard containers that wrap refrigerators.
Easing the plight of the homeless is not high on the political screen of the new Progressive Conservative government of Ontario's Premier, Mike Harris. It was elected last June on a platform of eliminating the province's swollen budget deficit and cutting high tax rates that it says impede economic growth. Mr. Harris says the way to solve the basic problem of homelessness is through faster economic growth.
Jack Layton, chairman of the Toronto City Council's newly created Homelessness Task Force, said what frightens him the most are large numbers of people arriving at homeless shelters as part of families led either by a mother or two parents.
"Out of a total of 4,500 in the hostels, we now have more than 1,000 children and an increasing number of single mothers," he said. "We've just never seen anything like this before."
A recent report by the Toronto city government's hostel division notes that there are more women among the homeless. "Life on the streets is dangerous for women and not an option that many would choose. It naturally follows that those women who do become homeless are exceptionally vulnerable and needy."
Mr. Layton and the municipal report both cite as an important factor the shrinking stock of cheap rental apartments in the wake of a provincial government decision to halt housing projects for the poor.
The sharp cuts in welfare allowances are also taking their toll. "The poor are getting poorer," said Maj. Ronald Bowles of the Salvation Army, which runs three Toronto shelters. "We like to think this kind of thing doesn't happen on our doorstep, but it does."
Roger Hunter, chaplain at the 75-year-old Scott Mission, which also serves the homeless, lauds public donations of sleeping bags, blankets and boots. "The deaths," he said, "have raised the awareness of the community and challenged people's comfort levels."
Comfort levels are most directly challenged during a ride with an Anishnawbe street patrol. Every night, two vans loaded with hot food and drink, sleeping bags and blankets make the rounds of downtown sites frequented by the homeless.
Despite the low temperatures and availability of the armory and other refuges, many of the homeless prefer to remain outdoors, citing unsafe conditions and restrictive regulations in the shelters. It is considered a violation of their basic rights to move them indoors forcibly, as is done is some American cities.
One homeless man encountered by the patrol was Marty, 30, who sat in front of a bookstore wearing a sweatshirt, sweater, winter coat, knitted hat and scarf. He was inside a goose-feather sleeping bag and covered with blankets.
A street person for the last three years, he said: "I have no job and no education. So this is the only way I know how to stay out of trouble and survive without money." Why wouldn't he go into a shelter? "They're too far away and they make you do things."
Katt, 42, who is part Indian, lives on a grate across the street from the United States Consulate. She used to work in an auto body shop. Cataracts have impaired her sight and she has not been able to work for the past six years. How does she survive? "I've been out in Regina where it's minus 70. This is paradise."
An element of pride creeps in as people talk. Frank, 42, sleeps in front of a restaurant in Chinatown. "Last night that wind was cutting through like crazy, but I lasted it," he said. "If it goes below minus zero, it doesn't matter. I'm still there."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: LABOR;
With New Militancy, Nation's Unions Hope to Drive Republicans From Congress

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: BAL HARBOUR, Fla., Feb. 18

 BODY:
The nation's labor unions, now under more militant leadership, are gathering here today to open a drive to oust Republicans in Congress, promising their most organized and expensive political campaign ever.
With the wealthy getting richer as workers have struggled to get by, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has scrapped its prior regime's scruples about pitting the two groups against each other and will attack Republican candidates they say have helped drive down standards of living. 
 "Class war?" asked Denise Mitchell, head of public affairs for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., whose leaders begin their annual, four-day policy-making convention here on Monday. "I think they're waging class war on us." The wage gap, she said, "has become the driving issue."
Acknowledging public indifference to narrow union issues, like laws on organizing new members and the right to strike, the labor leaders intend to emphasize issues of pay that affect all working people, union and nonunion.
Often at odds in the past over issues like abortion, trade and health care, leaders of most of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s 78 affiliated unions, representing 13 million members, are proclaiming the theme of raising wages and closing the income gap with rare unanimity.
In the campaign last fall that led to his defeating Lane Kirkland, the federation president who presided over 16 years of decline by organized labor, John J. Sweeney warned that unions were veering toward irrelevance. Unions have watched their influence dwindle as their membership fell to a sixth of the workforce, from a third in the 1950's.
Mr. Sweeney promised to commit much more money and personnel to organize new members and to elect lawmakers who agree with labor's agenda.
The federation says it will pour far more resources into this election campaign than it had ever done before. It says it will spend $35 million getting working people to the polls, at least twice as much as it spent in 1992, and that member unions will also raise their spending.
Mr. Sweeney's political director, Steve Rosenthal said unions will assign hundreds of members to work full time on campaigns by March and 2,500 to work full time getting out the vote in the weeks before the November election.
The federation's political strategy is shifting, too. While it will endorse a Presidential candidate and many unions will endorse other candidates, the leadership is discouraging attacks on their opponents. Rather, the unions will inform voters about the issues, and then let them decide which candidates respond best to workers' interests.
"We believe workers are smart," Mr. Rosenthal said. "Given the right information about what's going on in this country, they'll vote for our candidate."
So far, the strategy has passed one test -- the Senate race in Oregon last month. Representative Ron Wyden, a Democrat, defeated a Republican businessman, Gordon Smith, by 17,000 votes, with the help of organized labor.
The federation fielded 12 full-time staff members from its Washington headquarters, and unions provided 25 more. Mr. Rosenthal said they had helped get 78 percent of union members in key districts to the polls.
"The Oregon race," said Mr. Sweeney after the election, "provides a vital first chapter in a new textbook on politics we're going to write this year."
Still, the labor movement's threats and breast-thumping pronouncements have often proved naively quixotic. In November 1993 they promised to rally their members to vote out the 37 Democrats in Congress who supported the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada, which unions saw as a threat to American jobs.
While union leaders could not stomach supporting the Democrats' opponents, many of those pro-Nafta, but otherwise pro-union, lawmakers were swept out of office when the Republicans took control of Congress after the 1994 elections. Forty of the new Republicans lawmakers have since earned zeros in the federation's ratings of their votes on labor issues, Mr. Rosenthal said.
The trade agreement and the shift in Washington provided turning points for the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s political strategy.
"Since Nafta, the world has changed," said Jay Mazur, president of the 252,000-member Union of Needle Trades, Industrial and Textile Employees. "With words like downsizing, people are being fired wholesale while corporate leaders keep raising their own salaries."
Union leaders cite a cascade of economic data showing a growing gap between the lowest and highest paid workers. The nonpartisan Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris reported last year that among its 25 member nations, the gap was widest in the United States.
Many other studies show the salaries of American corporate chief executives steadily growing to levels equivalent to 150 to 225 times the wages of their lowest paid employees. Census Bureau studies show that the lower four-fifths of American households have experienced declining incomes over 20 years through 1994. The top 1 percent of American households collect 17 percent of all income and own 42 percent of the wealth.
"The ground has never been more fertile for clean, class-based appeals than it is today," Greg Tarpinian, executive director of the union-funded Labor Research Association in New York, wrote in his monthly newsletter.
The union leaders are both flattered and fretful that the theme of wages, jobs and the income gap is reverberating in the Republican Presidential campaigns of Patrick J. Buchanan and Bob Dole.
They note that Senator Dole, who recently spoke about the disparity between workers' difficulties and Wall Street's success, has in recent years led Congress's rejection of every hot-button issue on the labor agenda, including raising the $4.25-an-hour Federal minimum wage, tightening enforcement of workplace health and safety regulations and barring employers from permanently replacing workers who strike. Mr. Buchanan has urged trade policies to thwart the loss of American jobs abroad. "But nothing could be more divisive," Ms. Mitchell said, "than his positions on women's rights and immigration."

The metropolitan region has recovered only about a third of the 770,000 jobs it lost during the recession years of the late 1980's and early 1990's, and shows no signs of quickly regaining the rest. While old-fashioned economic growth seems to have returned to most of the country, the growth of the region's economy since 1992 has been weaker, spottier and downright stranger than anything before it, because so many of the region's industries have been fundamentally rearranged and in some cases seriously eroded.

Dole, Stung in 1988, Charts Cautious Economic Course

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: HUDSON, N.H., Feb. 18

 BODY:
When he was running for President eight years ago, Bob Dole offered bitter medicine to reduce the deficit: an across-the-board freeze for one year on all Federal spending. And he lost the New Hampshire primary.
Now, with just two days to go until New Hampshire votes again, and with talk in the air of a possible upset of Mr. Dole by Patrick J. Buchanan, Mr. Dole is offering a somewhat more palatable pill. 
 In a speech here on Saturday night, he outlined an unspecified package of what he called the "four freedoms of economic security": support for a balanced budget, no "unreasonable" taxes, less regulation and a free international market.
The speech was billed as a major economic address. But in pulling together various notions that Mr. Dole, the 72-year-old, five-term Kansas Senator, has mentioned in snatches on the campaign trail and in the well of the Senate over the years, it broke no new ground. The speech was delivered at a nonpartisan Chamber of Commerce dinner on Saturday night after the 6 o'clock news, guaranteeing minimal exposure.
Mr. Dole's advisers concede that as he attempts to appear more upbeat this year, in his final pursuit of the Republican Presidential nomination, he is being vague about his economic plan, searching for a way to address the economic anxieties of the New Hampshire voters who are responding to Mr. Buchanan's clarion call of economic populism. Mr. Buchanan rails against trade deals that he says have benefited corporate America at the expense of workers, and he wants to halt immigration.
"There's a period of evolution going on as to what the Dole economic plan would be," one aide said. "Within the campaign, there is some debate over how to respond to the issue of wage stagnation, which the Clinton White House will be making a big deal of.
"Some in our campaign want to stress it," the aide added. "Others are more concerned that those solutions don't involve more governmental intervention, that it be a very market-oriented approach."
Mr. Dole's overall goal, aides said, is to show support for a growth-oriented economic program that shows sympathy for workers who are nervous about the future -- without alienating the corporate giants who might be downsizing. Those corporations make up the traditional Republican base and have contributed heavily to Mr. Dole's campaign.
Mr. Dole reflected this ambivalence in his speech. "Yes, these are the best of times for many who work on Wall Street," he said. "But the facts leave no doubt that they are also the worst of times for many who live and work on Main Street, Main Street America."
He cited the loss of 258,000 high-paying manufacturing jobs in the last year nationally -- but suggested that the blame lay with President Clinton, not with corporate America. "The average hourly real wages are now 5 percent lower than they were a decade ago," Mr. Dole said, "and they haven't increased one cent, not one cent, since President Clinton took office."
Noting that Americans are "working more and earning less," he then borrowed some of the words that Mr. Clinton himself pounded repeatedly in his 1992 campaign. "These are the Americans," Mr. Dole said, "who for years have paid their taxes, played by the rules and have made sure that America's future was always better than the past."
The audience, about 150 people, applauded only twice during the speech, for generic antitax sentiments aimed at the heart of the typical tax-loathing New Hampshirite: He said he would sign unspecified legislation to "end the I.R.S. as we know it" and would support a constitutional amendment requiring a three-fifths' majority before Congress could raise income taxes.
"Everything he had to say was positive," said Kathy Cardin, 40, a nurse who listened to Mr. Dole. "But we've been told this -- lower taxes and more jobs -- before, and he didn't say any ways that he would do it. Wages aren't going up, people are being laid off and there are no guarantees on retirement. I'm sorry he wasn't more specific."
Russell Thibeault, president of Applied Economic Research, an economic and real estate consulting company based in Laconia, said, "Buchanan really spotted the anxiety about job security, and it sounds to me like Dole has fashioned a response that is shooting toward economic growth, but it is pretty late to be fashioning responses."
One problem for Mr. Dole, Mr. Thibeault said, is that his campaign "has been selling leadership and experience in the face of an electorate that is looking for some fresh ideas." He added: "He has not been very specific about an economic program, although I don't think there's a big payoff in being too specific because then you become a lightning rod."
Acknowledging Mr. Dole's lack of specifics, an aide said: "He's a very consensus-oriented, input-oriented politician. He wants to get a better feel for where the majority of America wants to see this thing move forward, where there is support instead of ethereal theory -- that's where the process is now."
Mr. Dole, who has a lengthy history of supporting both tax increases and tax cuts, might have learned in 1988 that too much stiff medicine can sour a candidacy. He refused to sign a no-new-taxes pledge back then, but he signed one this year. And on the trail, he comes close to offering a tax cut without actually doing so. Defending a balanced budget, he says that it would save the Federal Government $60 billion in interest payments every year, "and those savings could translate into a $500-a-year tax cut for every household."
Because of his hardscrabble background in dust bowl Kansas, Mr. Dole's top priority has always been balancing the budget and eliminating the deficit, not cutting taxes. But in this tax-allergic state, Mr. Dole walks a fine line when he criticizes the flat tax proposed by Steve Forbes, the publishing heir.
Some Dole advisers wish that Mr. Dole had proposed a flat tax some time ago, while others say such a proposal appears to favor the wealthy and would be a disaster for Mr. Dole to advocate.
Mr. Dole could not hide his true colors on this topic on Saturday night, as he veered from his prepared text -- the first time this year that he has read from one -- and made this warning about the flat tax: "We're either going to add to the deficit or not everybody's going to get a tax cut. You can't have it both ways."
Everything in Mr. Dole's history suggests that given the choice, he would not add to the deficit -- that is, he would not cut taxes. But that could be a perilous statement to make directly here. So Mr. Dole has been sticking with bromides.
"If we keep our eye on doing the right thing," he said at a Chamber of Commerce breakfast in Portsmouth, without specifying what the right thing might be, "we'll have a great future.
"We're going to enter the next generation stronger than ever," he went on, "with more jobs and more opportunities, better education, better environment -- all the things that we're concerned about are going to be there because of you and your confidence in the future of America."
He seemed so carried away with being upbeat that he went on to say that New Hampshire voters did the right thing in 1988 when they elected George Bush instead of him.
Mr. Dole said at first that New Hampshire "made a little slip in '88" when it elected Mr. Bush. Then he added: "But as it turned out, you probably did the right thing. President Bush did an outstanding job, and I was very proud to work with President Bush as the Republican leader in the Senate."

HEADLINE: Why Women Decide to Skip Marriage

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Single Motherhood: Stereotypes vs. Statistics" (Week in Review, Feb. 11): This is a global phenomenon and not unique to the United States. The most dramatic rise in out-of-wedlock births has occurred in advanced industrialized countries. The United States rate is about the same as that in Canada and Britain, slightly lower than in France, and far lower than in Denmark and Sweden. 
 Recent research has found that increased female labor force participation accounts for a far greater portion of the decline in the American marriage rate than the drop in male employment and wages (and far more than availability of welfare benefits, which declined in value as rates of single motherhood rose).
It is not clear to what extent the slow pace of men's adaptation to their changing roles may have left women more disenchanted with marriage.
United States marriage rates remain among the highest in the industrialized world. But as women become more independent economically, men's willingness to be full partners in the family may emerge as an increasingly important factor in determining how women value marriage.

To the Editor:
Your Feb. 11 Week in Review article attempts to show that the major forces driving the growth of unwed motherhood are economic. This is yet another transparent liberal rationalization that poverty tends to breed moral laxity. 
 Unwed mothers have divorced the concepts of marriage and childbearing or they wouldn't be unwed mothers. You never explain why someone in financial straits wants to deliberately make things worse.
You also say that social psychologists are telling us that only college-educated people can fathom the economics of marriage. Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich warns that only 20 percent of future jobs will require a college degree. Are you predicting the end of marriage as we have known it?

HEADLINE: China Searches for Respect

BYLINE: By Lucian W. Pye; Lucian W. Pye, professor of political science emeritus at M.I.T., is the author of numerous studies of Chinese political culture.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
This is a tough time in relations between the United States and China. Washington is torn over what to do about Beijing's saber rattling in the Taiwan Strait, its covert nuclear aid to Pakistan and Iran, its failure to clamp down on the pirating of intellectual property and its continued flagrant disregard of human rights.
China, for its part, is apparently convinced that the United States is a superpower in decline and determined to contain China, a superpower on the rise. Both the reformers and hard-liners are united in the conviction that they must appear firm and bold if they are to make a smooth transition after Deng Xiaoping's death. 
 In contrast, Washington seems ambivalent. Its actions do not match its words, and its words do not appear toreflect careful thought or strong conviction.
The fact that relations with China are troubled should not be surprising, for the relationship has rarely been close, except for the brief period of near alliance against Soviet expansionism. There are just too many fundamental obstacles in political cultures, history and ideologies for the political relationship to be a warm one.
The economic successes of Deng Xiaoping's reforms should have warmed up relations, making the Chinese more self-confident and at ease with the outside world, less touchy about slights to their sovereignty or perceived meddling in their internal affairs.
However, this success has only generated greater tensions and frustrations. The Chinese take seriously the forecast that they will soon have the world's largest economy. They therefore feel that they deserve recognition and respect as a superpower-in-waiting. It is not enough that they are already a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and one of the five nuclear powers. Somehow all of their accomplishments of the last two decades have not produced as dramatic a change in their international status as they had expected or believe is their due.
Most of the reasons for the hypersensitivity of the Chinese leadership can be traced back to the regime's eroding legitimacy. With the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe, and the need to erase the memory of the Cultural Revolution and the Mao Zedong era's ideological fanaticism, the leadership is confronted with a crisis of faith in Marxism and Leninism. Therefore it has had to look for a new basis of legitimacy, and has sought to find it in nationalism.
However, Beijing suddenly finds that the only version of nationalism, available is a bankrupt one, barely better than angry xenophobia, a crude "we" against "them" view of the world. Possessing what is the world's oldest civilization, China should have a trove of ideals and principles, myths and symbols, and stories of heroes that could be woven together to produce an uplifting, positive nationalism.
Yet a half-century of the Communist Party's unrelenting attack on Confucius and all the values associated with his legacy have left a population emotionally dead and unresponsive to the glories of China's high culture.
China also has one of the world's richest folk cultures. Yet puzzlingly, no politician in modern times has sought to tap into that storehouse in order to articulate a vision of what makes China a unique and worthy nation. Mao may have praised the Chinese peasantry, but only as an abstraction, a symbol of the downtrodden. He did not bring to the country's political discourse the excitement of the peasants' calendar of celebrations or their didactic myths.
With neither the high culture nor the popular culture providing a coherent sense of Chinese nationalism, the country is left without a shared and inspiring vision of what the nation should stand for in the world of nation-states.
China is a congeries of contradictions that should not be united by only base atavistic sentiments of race. It needs a loftier vision of national identity. Indeed, to call for the return of Taiwan to the "motherland" on the basis of blood ties alone, without any overarching ideals, common values or shared visions, does violence to China's historic grandeur. Such an approach to reunification has no more legitimacy than bluffs of war.
Without the security of a proud and constructive nationalism, China's leaders are bound to be thin-skinned, suspicious and arrogant in claiming their self-defined rights.
Moreover, the lack of a principled nationalism means that there are no standards of honorable and legitimate leadership, no constraints on Beijing as to what is unthinkable, or "un-Chinese." Therefore the threat of conquest only advertises to the people of Taiwan that submitting to reunification would be to suffer rule by whim.
It is questionable whether the current leadership can articulate a version of nationalism worthy of the Chinese people. Also, the task of formulating for China an appropriate set of collective ideals and sentiments cannot be left to an intellectual elite, for they have already floundered in their attempts at it over the last century.
The current pattern of economic growth and political stagnation has led not just to violations of human rights but to a shutting down of debate over the values that would give content to a higher sense of nationalism.
By contrast, Taiwan, in renouncing dictatorship, opened the way to a public dialogue that is giving shape to a sense of collective identity -- something that will elude China until it opens itself to a similar process.
In the face of all this is there anything the United States can do to ease relations with a China so bedeviled? Given the hypersensitivity of the Chinese leadership, it is understandable that Washington feels it must walk on eggs and seek "constructive engagement" through quiet diplomacy.
Yet there may be a problem with such an approach. American politicians, in spite of operating in a democratic political culture, tend to believe that honest communication is best realized in face-to-face meetings behind closed doors and that public statements are unreliable because they usually only serve public relations purposes, rarely expressing real convictions.
The exact opposite is the rule in Chinese political culture. There, private settings are where hypocrisy usually prevails because everything said is designed either to preserve harmony or for dramatic effect. One knows where the other really stands only from public statements, which are made without the constraints of courtesy.
Therefore, Washington's attempts at "constructive engagement" will not go far unless backed by a clear and unequivocal authoritative statement as to what it expects of the relationship, and what it foresees as China's place in the world.
The statement should probably declare that America expects China to become a more open and freer country, and to this goal encourage greater trade and contacts between our two peoples. The Chinese authorities may not like what is said, but their rejoinders would start a debate as to alternative visions, which, in going beyond "to get rich is glorious" would advance the quest for a new national identity.
What troubles United States-China relations is not going to be solved by tinkering with policy. The need is for more of the "vision thing," on the part of both parties.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE ROUNDUP;
Pledges, Accusations and Appeals As First Primary Vote Draws Near

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 18

 BODY:
Senator Bob Dole won a high-profile endorsement. Patrick J. Buchanan turned his attacks on the "knights and barons" of the Republican Party. Steve Forbes appealed for votes from anti-abortion forces. And Lamar Alexander reiterated his opposition to the ban on assault weapons.
With a series of television appearances, campaign stops and commercials, the Republican Presidential candidates moved into the final hours of the primary today, mixing the personal attacks that have characterized the campaign until now with endorsements and some discussion of issues. A look at where the three candidates highest in the polls were and what they were saying: 

Bob Dole
A Longtime Rival Steps Into Line
MANCHESTER, N.H. Feb. 18 -- One month after warning that Republicans could never unseat President Clinton with Senator Dole's "empty rhetoric," Senator Phil Gramm flew here today to make the exact opposite argument as he endorsed his former rival in the Republican Presidential primary this week in New Hampshire.
"Bob Dole is the one Republican candidate in this race today who can bring together economic conservatives and who can bring together social conservatives and who can make the Republican Party again one united party that is committed to beating Bill Clinton," Mr. Gramm said at a press conference at Mr. Dole's campaign office here.
Mr. Gramm's endorsement of Mr. Dole had been expected since he dropped out of the Presidential race last week, after his fifth-place showing in Iowa. Both Mr. Gramm and Patrick J. Buchanan had laid claim to the support of the Republican Party's right wing, and Mr. Buchanan's position here improved markedly after Mr. Gramm's withdrawal, to the distress of Mr. Dole.
The Dole campaign had pressed for Mr. Gramm's endorsement this weekend.
Advisers to Mr. Dole said today that they did not expect any particular tactical advantage from Mr. Gramm's decision, given that Mr. Gramm had so little support here in pre-primary polls. And while Mr. Gramm had assembled an impressive organization here, Mr. Dole already has the support of most of the state Republican leaders.
Mr. Gramm asserted that his decision to support Mr. Dole had nothing to do with reports that Mr. Buchanan's supporters had distributed photographs of him and his wife, Wendy, who is Korean-American, with a caption that read, "Many conservatives will not vote for him due to his interracial marriage. He divorced a white wife to marry an Asiatic!" Mr. Dole's aides have been making certain that reporters are aware of those allegations.
But Mr. Gramm went on to note that Mr. Buchanan had received help from supporters of David Duke, the white supremacist from Louisiana.
"In the party of Bob Dole and Phil Gramm, there's no room for racism," Mr. Gramm said. "I've never in my political life made any kind of compromise with racism." ADAM NAGOURNEY

Japan's merchandise trade surplus fell 83 percent last month from a year earlier, its biggest drop in six years, the Finance Ministry said today.
Weak exports and strong imports of automobiles, personal computers, semiconductors and clothing helped narrow Japan's trade gap in January to $467 million. 
 The dollar initially fell against the yen on the news because currency traders had speculated that the trade gap could have been lower. The dollar slipped as low as 104.88 yen from 105.24 yen late on Friday in New York. But it recovered as the session wore on; in late afternoon trading today, the dollar was quoted at 105.10 yen.
"Some traders had even expected a trade deficit," said Masahiro Yamaguchi, manager of foreign exchange at Tokai Bank.
With the United States, Japan's trade gap in January fell 51.2 percent to $1.55 billion, its biggest monthly decline in 16 years, the ministry said.
Japan's trade surplus with Asia and the European Union also shrank. With Asia, the gap narrowed 1.1 percent to $1.61 billion, its first decline in 12 months. With the Union, it fell 24.7 percent to $676 million, the first decline in three months.
Economists warned about reading too much into the sharp decline because January's surplus tend to fluctuate significantly. Still, they said, the figures show that Japan's trade gap is shrinking, having fallen for seven consecutive months, and should continue to shrink for at least the rest of the year.

HEADLINE: A Mean Chess-Playing Computer Tears at the Meaning of Thought

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
 But for many cognitive scientists, computer experts and philosophers, the question is not: Which entity is more intelligent? Rather, it is: What is intelligence, anyway? The smart answer is, It depends on whom you ask.
Both Mr. Kasparov and his adviser on computers, Frederick Friedel, said this week that they felt Deep Blue, with its vast computational excavations of each chess position, had begun to emanate signs of artificial intelligence, the first they had ever sensed from a machine.
"As it goes deeper and deeper, it displays elements of strategic understanding," Mr. Friedel said of Deep Blue. "Somewhere out there, mere tactics are translating into strategy. This is the closest thing I've seen to computer intelligence. It's a weird form of intelligence, the beginning of intelligence. But you can feel it. You can smell it."
Herbert Simon, a professor of computer science, psychology and philosophy at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, concurred. Any computer thinks to some degree, he said, when it brings to bear the element of problem solving he calls selectivity -- that is, a sense of knowing where to look in its warehouse of information for its answer to a question.
Human thought, he said, consists of "first, a great capacity for recognition, and second, a capability for selective research."
Deep Blue has to be considered a thinker, he said, because along with its colossal ability "to spin its wheels", the brute force calculation which is the traditional strength of computers, it also has a sophisticated evaluation system. In other words, Deep Blue, like a human being, does not have to search out each and every possible chess move to discover the best option; it has the ability, programmed in its software, to recognize useless possibilities and discard them along the way, a function that increases its efficiency.
This, of course, is what a human chess player does; Mr. Kasparov cannot match the computer's searching speed, but with his intuition and experience, he does not have to. He recognizes fruitlessness instinctively.
It was in 1957 that Professor Simon, whose lifelong research has focused on the human thought process and who won a Nobel Prize in economics in 1978, predicted that a computer would be the world chess champion within a decade; in that service, he helped design a computer program that tried to emulate the thought processes of a grandmaster.
He proved to be wrong, and today he says he did not understand it would be brute force as opposed to selectivity that would bring a chess computer to an equal footing with men and women. But that does not diminish the accomplishment of Deep Blue, he said, which with its powerful amalgam of brute force and selectivity, is not unlike what humans do, if different in the ratio of its elements.
There are different types of thinking, he added, "but I would call what Deep Blue does thinking."
Baloney, said John R. Searle, a philosophy professor at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of "The Rediscovery of the Mind," (M.I.T. Press, 1992), which argues against the possibility of mechanical thought.
"From a purely mathematical point of view," Professor Searle said, "chess is a trivial game because there's perfect information about it. For any given position there's an optimal move; it's solvable. It's not like football or war. It's a great game for us because our minds can't see the solution, but the fact that we will build machines that can do it better than we can is no more important than the fact that we can build pocket calculators that can add and subtract better than we can."
Professor Searle scoffed at Mr. Friedel's sense that the calculating power of Deep Blue had begun to evince the feel of an intelligent being.
"I could say the same thing about my pocket calculator," he said. "In the early days I could outwit it. Divide 10 by 3, then multiply that by 3 again. You wouldn't get 10 again; you'd get 9.999999. Now, they have tricks to solve that. But in order to get human intelligence, you've got to be conscious. Does the computer worry about its next move? Does it worry about whether its wife is bored by the length of the games?"
Virtually everyone seems to agree on two things. One is that it is inevitable that a computer will eventually be the world chess champion. The other is that whatever the accomplishment of Deep Blue, the accomplishment of its creators is sublime.
"In building a path-breaking, successful program, the I.B.M. team has definitely demonstrated artistry that is impressive and moving," said David Gelernter, the Yale art historian and computer scientist. "But the artistry is on display in the code, the program they wrote, more than in the chess game played by the computer, which is hard to associate with their own creativity and artistry."
A. Joseph Hoane, one of Deep Blue's programmers, said after the match that there was no question they could go on and improve the machine, but he wondered aloud whether he wanted to be part of it. The research was undertaken as part of a more general effort to bring powerful parallel processing technology to bear on complex computational problems, a field of study with proven applications in such diverse arenas as pharmacology, data mining, finance and air traffic control.
"I want my work to be fundamentally useful, and after this I have to be shown that it is," Mr. Hoane said. "At this point I have to wonder whether I'd be spending my time doing computer science or whether I'd be spending it improving the way a computer plays chess."
Several cognitive scientists said Deep Blue's victory in the opening game of the recent match told more about chess than about intelligence.
"It was a watershed event, but it doesn't have to do with computers becoming intelligent," said Douglas Hofstadter, a professor of computer science at Indiana University and author of several books about human intelligence, including "Godel, Escher, Bach," which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1980, with its witty argument about the connecting threads of intellect in various fields of expression. "They're just overtaking humans in certain intellectual activities that we thought required intelligence. My God, I used to think chess required thought. Now, I realize it doesn't. It doesn't mean Kasparov isn't a deep thinker, just that you can bypass deep thinking in playing chess, the way you can fly without flapping your wings."
Those who ascribe to the theory that machines are just machines that will always be apprenticed to human masters tend to view the hoopla over the chess match and the worry over the ascension of the machine as, well, "crazy," to use the word of Berkeley's Professor Searle.
"It's just a hunk of junk that somebody's designed," he said of Deep Blue.
Paul Saffo, a technology expert at the Institute for the Future, a think tank in Menlo Park, Calif., more or less agreed. "People who fear machines don't need to lose any sleep just yet," he said. "To me, the match was interesting as a cultural event. Chess, whereas it's a difficult problem to solve for computer scientists, is just a constrained formal problem. O.K., a computer beat a grandmaster, but computers aren't any smarter than they were the day before. The question I'd ask, now that this Rubicon has been passed, is What's the new arbitrary measure? Maybe it's a computer that plays go," -- the ancient Japanese board game that has yet to be conquered by a machine -- "or a computer that can fill in an I.R.S. form without getting an audit."
Professor Hofstadter has another idea. He says it is not impossible that a machine might one day learn from experiences and feel things as humans do. But in the meantime, that is still what separates us and them.
In "Godel, Escher, Bach" he held chess-playing to be a creative endeavor with the unrestrained threshold of excellence that pertains to arts like musical composition or literature. Now, he says, the computer gains of the last decade have persuaded him that chess is not as lofty an intellectual endeavor as music and writing; they require a soul.
"I think chess is cerebral and intellectual," he said, "but it doesn't have deep emotional qualities to it, mortality, resignation, joy, all the things that music deals with. I'd put poetry and literature up there, too. If music or literature were created at an artistic level by a computer, I would feel this is a terrible thing."

HEADLINE: A Public Station Sheds Some Glitter And Digs for Its Intellectual Roots

BYLINE: By LAWRIE MIFFLIN 

 BODY:
At the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Awards presentations for excellence in broadcasting a few weeks ago, public television's "The American Experience" was honored for a trio of documentaries: "The Battle of the Bulge," produced by Tom Lennon; "F.D.R.," produced by David Grubin, and "The Way West," produced by Ric Burns.
Those three esteemed documentary film makers all live and work between West 73d and West 93d Streets in Manhattan. Yet the place they turn for production partnership is not the New York public television station, WNET, but Boston's PBS station, WGBH. 
 They are not exceptions. Despite the abundance of film makers, writers and historians in New York City, few groundbreaking or provocative documentaries get produced at WNET/Channel 13 anymore.
Two decades ago, WNET was the intellectually principled and driven eldest sibling in the poor but striving family of public stations. Until 1983, it was home to the Independent Documentary Fund, which financed Fred Wiseman's pioneering unnarrated films, among others; it ran the WNET Television Lab, which nurtured experimental video work by Nam June Paik and Twyla Tharp and documentaries on subjects ranging from the effects of low-level radiation to Harvey Milk, the slain San Francisco Supervisor and gay rights champion.
Today, WNET still produces more hours of programming for the PBS system than any other station. But it is best known for opulent productions of ballet, opera and classical music like "Great Performances," and for the "Nature" series.
Channel 13's image as glossy purveyor of low-risk, high-entertainment programs is not entirely fair. But it exists, and William F. Baker, the station's president, says he wants to change it. After persuading Ward B. Chamberlin Jr., a longtime public-television programming executive who had been at WETA in Washington, to return to WNET in 1994 as his deputy, Mr. Baker said he told him, "I want to hire the best programmer there is in public television, bar none."
That person, the two men decided, was Tamara E. Robinson, also of WETA, where she directed cultural and arts programs. So last March she became WNET's vice president for national programming.
"One reason we brought Tammy in was we felt our relationship with the independent community was not as strong as it should be," Mr. Baker said. "And she had a reputation as being the best there is."
Ms. Robinson said that upon arriving at Channel 13, she found the volume of programs in the works to be a little thin, especially in public affairs and news. She said she was trying to rebuild bridges to independent film makers.
"There were some bad feelings, a sense that the station was not friendly to their ideas," she said. "Some felt that 13 was arrogant, didn't return their phone calls, didn't treat their projects carefully."
"Treating projects carefully" means serious fund-raising, and there WNET faces the frustrations the whole public television system faces. It is generally easier to raise money for programs underwriters know will be popular -- like the performance arts -- or at least noncontroversial, like science, nature and educational programs. And it is easier to raise money for a series than for a onetime documentary: quality documentaries take years to research and produce and can cost from $400,000 to $1 million per hour of final film.
That's why a station's commitment is needed. At WGBH in Boston, a number of independent documentary makers say, the executive producers of two series, "Frontline" and "The American Experience," have been relentless in their pursuit of two goals: first, the money to produce documentaries, and second, excellence in the final product, so that the underwriters, public and private will give again.
"WNET was the cutting-edge station for a while, but it didn't have the staying power this place has," said a WGBH executive who insisted on anonymity. "Constancy is important. The challenge is to keep the show going, keep the money flowing and the personnel in place."
Several independent producers complained that before Ms. Robinson arrived, WNET programming decisions were made by committee and project proposals were endlessly passed around.
Steven Fischler and Joel Sucher, partners in Pacific Street Films in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., said that they had been getting the runaround since 1989 on a one-hour documentary they have just completed on the photojournalist Jacob Riis.
"One would say, 'We have to talk to marketing,' and marketing would say they had 'too much on their plate' right now," Mr. Sucher said. "Someone else would say, 'Let's keep trying.' They gave us lip service. Finally the Ford Foundation put up the money, and we finished it on our own."
They still don't know whether WNET will be the presenting station for the PBS system, or even whether the film will be presented on public television at all.
But Mr. Grubin, the producer of "F.D.R.," "L.B.J." and other historical documentaries, said that PBS stations cannot be all things to all producers. He noted that he and Bill Moyers raised the money themselves for the poetry series they produced for WNET last fall.
"I'd like to have a poet on every week, the way we have Louis Rukeyser every week," Mr. Grubin said in a reference to the economist on PBS's "Wall Street Week," produced by Maryland Public Television. "But they can find sponsors for Rukeyser and not for poets.
"It would be different if Channel 13 were sitting on a pot of money and said, 'We don't like poetry,' " he said. "There's always a problem of money."
Ms. Robinson said that she was more interested in series than in specials or single-installment documentaries because "you spend as much time raising money for a onetime special as for a series."
Her job of rebuilding bridges to independent film makers has been complicated by WNET's backing of two projects that compete with films already well under way at WGBH in Boston.
WNET is planning to co-produce a 10-hour series by the Hollywood producer David L. Wolper on New York culture in the 20th century as well as a film on Harry S. Truman by the documentary film maker Charles Guggenheim. WGBH has a 10-hour series on the history of New York City by Mr. Burns and a Truman film by Mr. Grubin in the works.
Mr. Grubin, who has done all his presidential films for WGBH, said, "Nobody says all history films have to go through Boston; anyone can do Truman, if they can find the resources."
But Mr. Burns, after two years of being "graciously courted," as he put it, by executives at WNET, said he had hoped the two stations would present his New York series jointly -- "WGBH because of my longstanding relationship with them, and WNET because it's the flagship New York station."
"I have enormous respect and affection for the people who run WNET and still hope we may sort things out," he said. "But I just don't understand their priorities."
Ms. Robinson emphasized that the Wolper and Burns projects were different and that Channel 13 viewers would eventually see both. She also noted that Warner Brothers, to whom Mr. Wolper is under contract, was putting up "a lot of money" to help produce the film on New York culture for WNET.
"If they can bring money to the table, and we can raise money, and we can produce an interesting, compelling, entertaining, educational documentary, there's nothing to lose," she said. "And they can help with promotional possibilities, too.
Officials of the station point out that more of WNET's budget goes to program production now -- about 80 percent of its gross revenue -- than in any previous year. Its December pledge drive was one of its most successful fund-raising efforts, drawing 15,754 pledges totaling $1.3 million. And the station has attracted $53 million in a capital campaign intended to raise a $65 million permanent endowment, Mr. Baker said.
"At least people know the place is economically sound and stable," he said. "That has been my first priority."
It also means that he and Ms. Robinson can focus on the next priority, diversifying the programs WNET produces. Ms. Robinson pointed to a number of programs in the works for this year and the next, among them a history of America's love affair with the automobile, a one-hour documentary on the legacy of the G.I. Bill, a biography of Norman Rockwell and a five-part series on the Arab lands of the Middle East and North Africa.
WNET has also made a deal with the fledgling Independent Film Channel, a small cable network whose programming is not available in the New York City area, to broadcast some of its films.
"We also focus on programs that can extend into the schools, like the Norman Rockwell or Truman biographies," she said. "People forget that's a major part of our mission. God knows teachers appreciate it, though, especially the extra teaching materials we provide."
Although changing a big institution takes time, Ms. Robinson sees progress in sharpening WNET's programming. "There is more focus, more teamwork," she said. "With funding always precarious, we have to be careful we focus on where the best ideas are, not just on which ideas will attract funding."
 The article also misstated the availability of the Independent Film Channel, a pay-cable service, in the New York area. It is indeed available, to subscribers of Liberty Cable, a satellite-delivered cable service reaching parts of Manhattan, the Bronx and New Jersey.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC PULSE: The New York Region;
Region's Economy in Fundamental Shift

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON and THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Through the darkest days of the recession in the late 1980's and early 1990's, there was a certain tenet of faith in the New York region: Like the seasons, the business cycle was eternal, and when the downturn was over old-fashioned growth would return.
For most of the country, that is exactly what happened. In one year of recovery, 1992 to 1993, the nation as a whole recovered all the jobs lost in the recession and even gained a few more. 
 But the New York region, which sprawls from the pharmaceutical belt around Princeton, N.J., through the financial empires of Wall Street and the once military-dependent corners of Long Island and Connecticut, has recovered only about a third of the 770,000 jobs it lost, and shows no signs of quickly regaining the rest.
To be sure, the economy of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut is no longer sinking. But after four years, the recovery has become a puzzling economic phenomenon in its own right. Economic growth since 1992 has been weaker, spottier and downright stranger than anything before it, because so many of the region's industries have been fundamentally rearranged and in some cases seriously eroded.
Much of the aircraft industry on Long Island, for example, is considered gone forever. Hartford's title as the nation's insurance capital has become mostly honorary as companies have merged and shrunk.
"One step forward and one step back is a fair characterization," said Matthew T. Crosson, president of the Long Island Association, a business and civic group, "but there haven't been a lot of steps forward."
For many of the region's industries, the pressures are compounded by fierce competition from other parts of the country and the world where labor costs are lower and where governments spend lavishly to attract new business.
Last week, an influential planning group, the Regional Plan Association, warned that if current patterns held, the 31 counties of the New York metropolitan region could enter a long-term economic decline in the next century.
The association, after a five-year study, said the region must rebuild the urban centers; connect the now-separate transit systems into an integrated whole, and restructure the local education systems to strengthen poorer districts and to prepare students for the changing workplace of the 21st century.
Other experts are not quite as pessimistic, arguing that the region is simply struggling through an unusually slow, uneven recovery from a long and deep recession. But whatever view turns out to be right, it is clear that the upheavals in the last decade have rewritten many rules of the economic game.
Princeton, N.J., provides a good example of the new topsy-turvy economy. The city is an anchor of the pharmaceutical corridor that runs from Trenton to New Brunswick. The recession had not been as bad there. Employment -- much of it concentrated at landmarks like Johnson & Johnson and Bristol Meyers-Squibb -- had risen steadily from 1990 to a peak in 1993 of nearly 51,000 workers.
But the succeeding years have been a nightmare, largely because of managed health care, which has forced all segments of the medical industry -- even the teaching hospitals of Manhattan and the insurance companies of Hartford -- to cut costs. In 1994, the New Jersey drug industry shed about 2.8 percent of its total jobs, and in 1995 it lost another 4.3 percent, state figures show.
"The bottom line in terms of the economy is that the cutbacks that the pharmaceuticals are doing will continue," said Robert F. Johnston, president of Johnston Associates, a venture capital firm in Princeton that specializes in the drug industry.
"There is going to be more firing by the big guys than hiring by the little guys," Mr. Johnston said.
Other forces have deeply complicated the recovery.
Layoffs have swept the once-inviolate public sector as cities and states confront swelling deficits. In addition, Republicans are now in power in New York City and the three states, and all are on a crusade to cut government spending in the hope that lower taxes will spur business expansion and lure new companies. But so far that has not happened.
Wall Street has restored few of the jobs eliminated after the 1987 stock market crash, even though the securities business has boomed.
An aging population, nervous about job security, has cut back on consumer spending.
In addition, unusual economic shifts in the suburbs have contributed to the region's weak recovery. Places like White Plains, Morristown, N.J. and Stamford, Conn., whose corporate office parks have been among the great motors of growth in the region for the last 30 years, stumbled almost as badly in the recession as New York City did -- and some did worse. And most have been bypassed in the recovery because of corporate downsizing.
So great are the changes that in some ways the economic health of New York City now looks better than that of its suburbs.
While new economic forces have created some winners, the good news is mixed with bad. Some start-up pharmaceutical companies around Princeton, for example, have thrived by taking contracts from larger ones. That allows the larger companies to shed jobs even as new ones are created down the street.
And with some winners, success has done little for local employment. After 10 years of struggle, the Liposome Company in Princeton received Federal approval in December for its first commercial product, a drug to fight fungal infections.
The company won, but New Jersey lost. Even though Liposome plans to keep its scientists and top executives in Princeton, it will gradually transfer production of the drug to Indianapolis, where labor is cheaper and where the company was able to buy a factory site from a bankrupt competitor.
"There's no continuum anymore, no pattern that stays for any length of time -- there's no set formula," said Jack L. Atkins, a real estate developer in West Orange, N.J. "It feels like you can't stay happy too long."
 
Structural Problems
A Shrinking Base Of Corporations
When New York City emerged from the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's, the economy surged with a vengeance as pent-up demand produced a buying spree of retail goods and real estate, and new hiring by businesses.
But the latest recovery has produced nothing of the kind. The recession from 1989 to 1992 eliminated 580,000 jobs in New York State, 262,000 in New Jersey and 165,000 in Connecticut, according to a study by Nicholas Perna, chief economist for the Fleet Financial Group in Hartford. Since then, Mr. Perna said, New York has regained only 33 percent of its jobs, New Jersey has regained 67 percent and Connecticut only 18 percent.
Experts say those numbers reflect deep structural problems in the region's economy. Chief among them is the concentration of company headquarters -- 112 of the nation's top 500 corporations are based in the region, and many continue to shrink as corporate America merges, downsizes and sheds workers.
Corporate layoffs continue to be the greatest drag on economic and psychic health. Following a string of mergers by other banks, the merger of Chase Manhattan and Chemical Bank, for example, is expected to eliminate 12,000 jobs.
In New Jersey, AT&T said it would eliminate 7,000 workers this year as it splits into three companies. In Connecticut, Aetna Life and Casualty Company is to sell its property-casualty unit to Travelers Insurance next month, costing another 1,500 jobs.
Some of the greatest pressures are in health care, insurance and pharmaceuticals, three of the region's largest industries, as managed care and the pressure to lower medical costs sweep the nation.
But corporations are not the only ones cutting back. The thousands of military jobs that were cut by the Federal Government in the early 1990's have been compounded by waves of cuts at city and state agencies. In the last two years, for example, New York City has cut 16,000 municipal employees, leaving a work force of 233,000.
And the cuts are likely to continue; Connecticut, New York State and New York City all face major budget shortfalls in the coming year.
One of the harshest assessments of the region's economic health comes from the Regional Plan Association, which studied employment trends and several of the region's largest industries from 1982 through 1992, a period that included both boom and recessionary bust.
The study found that the New York region came in last in employment growth among the nation's 15 largest metropolitan areas, generating only an 8 percent increase in jobs. Several metropolitan areas that are widely thought to be graying industrial laggards did far better -- the Cleveland-Akron region had a 13 percent employment gain, while the number of jobs in the Detroit area grew by 22 percent.
Perhaps even more unsettling, the study found that the New York region's biggest industries -- financial services, the electronic media and publishing, the arts and tourism, health services and fashion -- suffered steep losses in their share of the national and global markets. On average, it said, the industries' market share shrank 25 percent by 1992 from 1982.
Such weak performance over a decade, combined with the longstanding handicaps faced by business in the New York region, like high wages, taxes and real estate prices, are provoking urban planners, economists and business executives to ask: Will it only get worse?
"We might limp along for another decade," said Claude Shostal, president of the Regional Plan Association, "but if nothing changes we could be facing an economic abyss."
But others suggest that the region, for all its problems, may simply be where it has been for 200 years -- at the head of the curve as the rules of economic engagement change throughout the world.
"This region was No. 1 for so long people think that something is terribly wrong," said Saskia Sassen, a professor of urban planning and an economic analyst at Columbia University.
She attributed the region's poor performance to the maturing of its industries and the inevitable catching up by other urban areas producing goods and services that become inexpensive and standardized.
But to Professor Sassen, the region is well-positioned to catch the next wave of economic expansion.
"There was Pax Britannica and London was No. 1," she said. "There was Pax Americana and New York was No. 1. Now the rules have changed, and rankings don't much matter, but the real issue is that any city or region has to be plugged into the global economic network," she said. "And on that score, New York is connected."
 
Signs of Strength
More Tourists And Super Stores
Despite all the region's problems, there are small glimmers of hope for the 11 million people who work here -- and the nearly 1 million who do not have jobs.
For the first time since the recession, the region is faring no worse -- or at least not much worse -- than the nation.
Indeed, at a time when the nation's economy has slowed to a standstill, New York City and its suburbs have shown scattered signs of strength.
In Westchester and Fairfield counties and in northern New Jersey, where the construction boom in the late 1980's left many office buildings begging for tenants, vacancy rates have shrunk steadily for three years.
And real estate experts on Long Island and in New Jersey say that commercial properties that went unsold for years have recently changed hands as some investors have placed big bets that property prices have finally bottomed out.
Another positive sign comes from Wall Street. Although the city's largest brokerage houses offer scant hope of a hiring boom, they show little inclination to leave New York, as had long been feared, thanks in part to significant tax breaks from the city.
In recent months, firms like Morgan Stanley and First Boston have either moved to or leased new headquarters in Times Square and the Flatiron District.
In addition, the lofty year-end bonuses being dispensed to Wall Street executives -- many exceeding $100,000 this year because of the bull market -- are sure to filter down through luxury car sales and the like.
Some of the strongest signals are coming from the city itself, especially Manhattan. Tourism, spurred by the low value of the dollar and lower hotel taxes, has soared. Retail sales are up, helped in part by the opening of several huge new suburban chain stores -- Bed, Bath and Beyond, Barnes & Noble and others.
"We think the retail environment is very bright," said Alfred Lepore, president of Ferrara's, the pastry shop on Grand Street in the Little Italy section of Manhattan.
This year, for the first time in its 100-year history, Ferrara's is expanding. It will open three new shops in Manhattan, one on 42d Street just off Broadway, joining a wave of fresh investment in Times Square, long blighted, but now resurgent.
In fact, for evidence that the rules for economic success have changed, one might take a walk in Manhattan, starting at Broadway and 47th Street, under the neon blast of Morgan Stanley and Company, which moved into its headquarters there last year. It announces its link to the international economy loudly, with 10-foot-high electronic zippers that display stock prices and huge digital clocks displaying the time in London, Moscow, Tokyo and other cities.
On 42d Street, the refurbished New Victory Theater opened two months ago. Seven other blighted theaters are expected to reopen in the next two years, part of a surge of redevelopment in Times Square.
One is bound to be struck by clusters of foreign tourists. And somewhere along the way there might also be a movie crew, since more feature films and television series are being shot in the city than at any time since the 1950's.
Along the Avenue of the Americas, from 23d Street to 14th Street, there is even more evidence of economic promise. This strip has attracted more than 12 huge stores, like Today's Man and Filene's Basement, to its long-derelict lofts and warehouses.
Farther south is New York University, where student applications from around the world have soared (as at Columbia, 100 blocks uptown).
Then there are TriBeCa and the caverns of lower Manhattan, where hundreds of software designers and computer artists have formed Silicon Alley, a cluster of start-up companies hoping to take advantage of the cyberspace boom.
Since almost all these ventures are small -- many consisting of one person and a computer -- they provide little promise of a broad upswing. But Manhattan has clearly become a magnet: the New Media Association, a two-year-old group in which computer entrepreneurs exchange advice and business contacts, now has 2,000 members, representing more than 1,000 Manhattan companies, according to Brian T. Horey, the association's president.
For that and other reasons, analysts say, New York City is approaching the millennium with something of vast value -- an improved image as a safe, stimulating and profitable place to do business.
"Clearly, there are a host of possibilities in the city," said Henry Raimando, chief economist for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, who believes that the region's best economic prospects lie in the city, not the suburbs.
"The old star that was in Manhattan exploded and moved out," he said. "Now a new star is forming at the core."
 
Wounded Confidence
Wary Consumers, Weary Psyches
Changes in the local economy may also be affecting residents more deeply than statistics can show. A mood of penny-pinching pessimism -- reported by retailers and real estate professionals throughout the region -- is probably the clearest example.
"People are worried about their jobs and they are so much more cautious," said Anthony Chianese, general manager of Brewster Honda in Brewster, N.Y.
"I would say the economy is pretty flat right now as far as consumer confidence goes," Mr. Chianese said.
Economists and local planners say, however, that the changes go beyond mood, and that the 1990's are leaving a much deeper mark on the region by widening the gap between rich and poor.
While there are perhaps growing opportunities for highly paid computer software engineers and designers, many of the new jobs being created simply are not as financially good as the ones that were lost.
On Long Island, for example, two of the fastest-growing industries in recent years were restaurants and home health care services -- neither of which paid more than about $18,000 for a worker's annual salary, according to the Long Island Association.
By contrast, of the fastest shrinking industries -- aircraft and parts, search and navigation equipment and telephone communications -- none paid less than $49,730 a year in average salary.
"The biggest problem we have is convincing these folks there are no jobs anymore like the ones they used to do," said Michael B. Falcone, the Suffolk County labor commissioner.
"They made $60,000, now they're making $35,000," Mr. Falcone said. "They try to eke out an existence but it's tough, very tough."
New investment and spending patterns in this decade have compounded the jobs issue, economists say. Professor Sassen at Columbia argues, for example, that much of the region's past prosperity was based around a middle class that spent most of what it earned and an upper class that invested locally. But the middle class is stressed and cautious, and the rich are as likely to invest abroad as in the business down the block.
The changes are also pushing some residents toward a broader search for direction in their lives.
At St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Mount Kisco, N.Y., the Rev. Ralph E. Peterson said that the fastest growing segment of the church is Sunday services for families.
"There is this spiritual energy and response," he said. "They have seen the economic uncertainty. They have watched their parents struggle, achieve and buy expensive homes in Bedford and Chappaqua. They are seeing the uncertainty and that inevitable affluence doesn't follow, so they're looking for something more."
"I think there is a rediscovery of a spiritual dimension in life," he added. "Because of this collapse of certitude."

 A study by the Fleet Financial Group in 1992 shows the recession of the early 90's hit the tristate area earlier and harder, and stayed longer, than it did the United States as a whole.
 Graphs compare the tristate region to other major metropolitan areas of the United States with respect to job growth and share of U.S. output in major industries between the years 1982 and 1992. Graphs also show effect of the recession on different sectors of the job market in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut during 1993, 1994, and 1995. And finally, graphs provide an economic sampler of economic health in the region during the '90's.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Lean, Mean and Loopy

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
As the glorious array of Republican candidates moves from primary to primary, dwindling perforce but still dazzling us with profound debate, we must not ignore the generosity of the Republican leadership toward its foe. Unprecedented, one might say. Or, one might say, loopy.
First the mainstream Republican candidates ignored the political and economic issue of the day -- the deep and justified fear of workers that they will be kicked out of their jobs and cheated out of what they had assumed was a link between security and high company profits. 
 Downsizing desolated those who received the tap on the shoulder. And it put fear into their relatives, friends and millions of others still employed -- fear of the American capitalist system, in which they had been brought up to believe they had a part and a stake.
This refusal to note the economic and psychological gravity of downsizing strengthened Patrick Buchanan, the Republican Party's very own threat to the Republican Party. He was taking note. As prescription he offers isolationism, division, bigotry -- his customary poison pill.
But finally in New Hampshire, Senator Robert Dole recognized that millions were indeed worried sick. He said something about corporate greed and job loss. Greed is not the paramount issue. That would be fairly easy to deal with compared with the problem of the revolution in technology and production. Still, something said is better than nothing.
Now here comes political loopiness raised to art form. About the time that the Senate majority leader was recognizing dangers in unmitigated lean and mean, Republican senators in Washington killed the chance of bringing to the Government a man who had early seen the importance of a little forethinking in downsizing.
Felix Rohatyn, senior partner of Lazard Freres, the investment banker who helped guide New York City out of financial disaster in the 70's, delivered in 1994 the plainest analysis of what was going on in America after three years of economic growth and rising financial markets:
"Simultaneously hundreds of thousands of people have been laid off by companies going through restructuring, while technology and competition have kept average incomes from rising. The big beneficiaries of this expansion have therefore been the owners of financial assets and a new class of highly compensated technicians. . . . What occurred was a huge transfer of wealth from lower skilled middle class American workers to the owners of capital assets and to a new technological aristocracy. . . .
"As a result the institutional relationship created by the mutual loyalty of employers and employees in most American businesses has been badly frayed. . . . These relationships have been replaced by a combination of fear for the future and a cynicism for the present. . . ."
Mr. Rohatyn came to think he might be of use as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve system, a job that was opening, in putting forward some thought about this and other economic problems. President Clinton thought so too. But Republican senators said they would fight in committee to block him. Mr. Rohatyn declined to become the political football du jour, and withdrew.
So the only approach on the table is to trust that higher profits will lead to more investment and productivity and that eventually labor will be rewarded with a larger share in the economy. Perhaps; time will tell.
But time will also bring more pain to those selected out, more tension to American society.
Mr. Rohatyn wants a policy that would ease both -- not by denying that advanced technology will cause job loss but by creating new jobs through an increase in overall American economic growth.
Among other things, he wants to encourage private job investment by lowering interest rates and government investment in job creation through public works.
He might have been able to get some new discussion going instead of letting the pain get deeper and the fears wider until they become America's class struggle.
The danger of injecting an experienced and original brain into a situation that even Republican Presidential candidates saw as critical was averted. Not noting, the glorious array of candidates moves on.

HEADLINE: Why Make Divorce Easy?

BYLINE: By Maggie Gallagher; Maggie Gallagher, a scholar at the Institute for American Values, is the author of "The Abolition of Marriage: How We Destroy Lasting Love."

DATELINE: BRIARCLIFF MANOR, N.Y.

 BODY:
For all practical purposes, the debate is over. Almost all Americans now agree that divorce is harmful to children. Now the question becomes: What, if anything, can we do about the fact that at least half of our marriages fail?
Get rid of no-fault divorce, say some state legislators in Michigan, one of several states with an active campaign to reform divorce laws.
Call it a delayed backlash. Unlike some European countries, which impose five-to-seven-year waits for contested no-fault divorces, Americans in the late 60's and 70's opted for speedy spouse disposal. Almost every state adopted some version of no-fault divorce, either by eliminating the need to find marital wrongdoing or by speeding up the divorce process. 
 In short, no-fault divorce (or more accurately "unilateral divorce") allows one partner to dissolve a marriage at any time, for any reason, or for no reason at all.
No-fault was supposed to remake divorce into a kinder, gentler institution. It hasn't worked out that way. Under no-fault, divorces today are no less angry. In her book "Second Chances," Judith Wallerstein found that about half of all the couples she studied were still locked in bitter conflict five years after divorcing.
Thanks to no-fault, divorces have also become more common. Between the late 60's and mid-70's, the likelihood that a couple would divorce in the first five years of marriage jumped by one-third. A recent study in The Journal of Marriage and the Family suggests that no-fault pushed up the divorce rate anywhere from 15 to 25 percent.
Supporters of no-fault divorce argue that it strengthens marriage, because couples can leave bad marriages and make better ones. But, as the University of Texas demographer Norval Glenn has pointed out, surveys suggest that the opposite has happened. After 25 years of no-fault, there are as many unhappy marriages as ever, and far fewer happy ones.
That no-fault divorce has led to a surge in the divorce rate should come as no surprise to anyone who has ever been married. Even the best marriages go through bleak times.
What would happen if courts treated business contracts as they now treat the marriage contract? What if our courts refused to enforce contracts and instead systematically favored the party that wished to withdraw, on the grounds that finding fault was messy, irrelevant and acrimonious? Under such circumstances, the economy might collapse.
Imposing a five-to-seven-year waiting period for contested no-fault divorces could raise the number of marriages that ultimately succeed, while insuring that those who want a quick and easy divorce negotiate with their partners in order to get it.
Law is more than a system of punishments, as Mary Ann Glendon, a Harvard law professor, has pointed out. It is also one way we pass values from one generation to the next. Our divorce laws define what the marriage commitment is.
The purpose of making divorce more difficult is not to torment a couple into staying together but to give weight to the original contract, to put the law on the side of those who say: Wait, think, reconsider. Something of inestimable value -- a commitment to love and care for another human being -- is about to be lost. Is there really no way the marriage can be saved?

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Japan Trade Surplus Plummeted in January

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 19

 BODY:
Japan almost posted a trade deficit in January, the Finance Ministry reported today.
Japan's trade surplus in January plummeted 83 percent from a year earlier to only $467 million. That is far below the typical monthly surplus, which last year averaged about $9 billion. 
 The trade surplus with the United States shrank 51.2 percent from a year earlier to $1.549 billion, the fastest rate of decline in 16 years.
For the first 20 days of the month, Japan actually ran a global trade deficit, and some economists and currency traders had expected Japan to post its first monthly deficit since January of 1984.
Economists cautioned that Japan's trade surpluses in January tend to be unusually low, in part because holidays at the beginning of the year slow exports. Hence, the monthly figures recorded for the rest of the year will be much higher.
Still, the January figure confirms that Japan's trade surplus, the highest ever recorded by any country in the world, is on the decline.
The January surplus, the excess of exports over imports, was the lowest recorded since January 1990. And the 83 percent decline from a year ago was all the more striking because in January 1995, exports were disrupted by the Kobe earthquake, resulting in an unusually low trade surplus.
Japan's imbalance has been dropping because the rise of the Japanese yen over the last three years has crimped exports and spurred imports. For 1995 as a whole, the surplus, as measured on a customs clearance basis, dropped for the first time in five years to $107 billion.
But in recent months, the yen has weakened again to about 105 to the dollar, compared with a high of 80 to the dollar last spring.
The fall in the yen actually increased the January trade surplus because it lowered the price of Japan's exports and raised the price of imports, as measured in dollars. Yet buyers on both sides of the Pacific Ocean have not had a chance to adjust their buying patterns to reflect the new situation.
In the coming months, however, if the yen stays at around 105 yen, Japan's exports might pick up and imports growth could slacken, thereby slowing the decline in the trade surplus.
"We're kind of skeptical that the trade surplus will continue to go away," said Yoshito Sakakibara, an economist in Tokyo for Salomon Brothers. He said that seasonally adjusted, the January surplus was $5.4 billion.
In January, imports, as measured in dollars, grew 16.9 percent from a year earlier, led by a 71.5 percent rise in imports of computers and other office equipment.Exports rose 6.7 percent over all but those to the United States declined 2.9 percent. Exports of cars continued to decline as the United States car market weakened and as Japanese auto makers shifted more production to the United States.

HEADLINE: A Horse of a Different Color;
Saratoga Would Keep Casino Taint Off Its Tidy Turf

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON 

DATELINE: SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y., Feb. 15

 BODY:
This city is famous for the horses. And not the hayride kind. The kind you bet on.
But judging from the improbable role this horse-racing community has chosen for itself lately, one might conclude that people here were shocked -- shocked! -- to discover that gambling was going on, to steal a phrase from "Casablanca." 
 In trying to get Saratoga Springs off a state list of locations where casino gambling would be legal under a proposed amendment to the State Constitution, this city is battling a designation that so many other communities, including New York City, could be said to covet.
A unanimous City Council vote to remove Saratoga Springs from consideration has given the debate over casino gambling a paradoxical setting: The summer playground for the social elite may now be the most anti-gambling town in New York State. And it is certainly the most anti-gambling place with both Thoroughbred and harness tracks.
"We don't really think of this as a gambling town," said Barbara A. Lombardo, the managing editor of the 13,000-circulation newspaper, The Saratogian.
And while there has been some concern about the effects of casino gambling on the town, and certainly the economic impact on the tracks, there has also been a definite tinge of moral opposition to betting itself.
Joseph W. Dalton Jr., president of the Chamber of Commerce and one of the most ardent casino opponents, refined the distinction between betting on the horses and betting in casinos: "When you go to the race track, you're going for a social experience," Mr. Dalton said. "When you go to the casino, you don't talk to the slot machine."
The rumpus here may provide an early taste of a coming statewide argument over the proposed constitutional amendment for casino gambling. When state legislation was passed last year to start the process, the Saratoga-Lake George region, Buffalo, Niagara Falls and the Catskills were all named as areas where bill sponsors had concluded that residents wanted casinos. If the measure passes again next year and if it is signed by Gov. George E. Pataki, which is considered likely, it could be presented to voters in 1997.
But after years of casino gambling being viewed by many towns as a possible economic elixir, Saratoga Springs may embody what gambling experts say is the start of a backlashin communities that have been disappointed over the financial returns and in others that have begun to worry about the social impact of gambling. The opposition is strong in Saratoga Springs, and includes Republicans and Democrats, the Chamber of Commerce and local institutions like the Adirondack Trust Company and Skidmore College.
There have been all the standard arguments that casino gambling could draw people of questionable means who would spend money only in the casinos. "The bus drops you off at the door and, 14 hours later, you come out bleary-eyed and broke and you haven't been to a restaurant and you haven't been to a dress shop," said Philip W. Klein, one of Saratoga Springs' representatives on the County Board of Supervisors.
But there has also been considerable talk about the evils of wagering, such as gambling addiction. "The people who can least afford to gamble are the ones who are in there gambling," said Thomas G. McTygue, one of the council members who voted to get Saratoga Springs off the casino list. "We've got enough homeless people, we don't need to contribute to it," said Mr. McTygue, a Democrat who is also the city's public works commissioner.
Any dangers associated with betting on horses have somehow been excluded from such conversations. Why? Mr. Klein offered this Saratogian's explanation of what goes on at the track: "That's not gambling. That's a sport. Any old-timer will tell you that."
After the City Council vote, Mr. Klein introduced a measure now before the county board that would take a similar stance to get Saratoga County out of the constitutional amendment. And the State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, who represents this area, said in an interview that he would delete Saratoga County from the proposed amendment if the supervisors go along. The outcome of the vote in the spring, board members say, is uncertain. In 1994, the supervisors went on record with a nonbinding resolution saying they were against casino gambling. But now, with some board members showing annoyance at Saratoga Springs' pushiness on the issue, Mr. Dalton of the Chamber of Commerce said, Saratoga Springs, population 26,000, may have to work hard to bring the rest of the county of 190,000 people along on its anti-gambling crusade.
Which means the strange argument here is far from over, with critics charging that politicians are basing their actions on moral concerns and the politicians firmly denying such accusations.
In an interview, Bruce J. Levinsky, a Saratoga Springs developer who favors casinos, accused the city's anti-casino forces of getting sidetracked by such questions as the propriety of betting. "We need the revenue," Mr. Levinsky said. "We can't get hung up on some emotional issue. If you want morality, go to a church."
But in a separate interview, the newly elected Mayor of Saratoga Springs, J. Michael O'Connell, a Republican, strongly denied that his opposition to casino gambling was based on any moral consideration. "We're a horse-racing, gambling community, so I doubt if I'd be in office if I took a moral position," the Mayor said.
What is really at issue, some people here say, is a desire to keep out the sometimes seedy elements who tend to congregate in casino towns. Saratoga Springs' preferred image is of the well-turned-out people who make the August meet of the Saratoga Race Course (see Carly Simon's lyrics about a guy who was so vain and went up to Saratoga, where his horse, naturally, won).
But, Charles V. Wait, the president of the Adirondack Trust Company who opposes casino gambling, said Saratoga also formed a sense of its self-image from the genteel, illegal casinos that thrived here for decades until the 1950's. They were quiet, orderly and had limited hours, he said, because they were controlled by mobsters who were anxious to avoid undue attention.
Even nostalgia, in the casino conversation here, gets an unusual ride. Mr. Wait, whose father and grandfather were also presidents of Adirondack Trust, advanced his own somewhat unorthodox analysis of the debate. He said people do not want casinos partly because they are convinced the modern corporate proprietors could not match the quality operations of their Saratoga predecessors. "We had gambling," said the bank president wistfully, "when it was the best it could be, when it was run by the Mafia."
In all the talk, some of the pro-casino people here say, it is sometimes hard to tell that Saratoga Springs may really just be afraid that blackjack tables may prove more of a draw than racehorses, which have been part of the scene here since 1863. Some of the anti-casino people go out of their way to declare that "we aren't carrying water for anyone," as Mr. Dalton of the Chamber put it.
But aren't the tracks worried about the tables? Kenneth Noe, the president of the New York Racing Association, which operates the Saratoga Race Course, said his organization had not taken a position on the proposed constitutional amendment. But when he was asked about potential competition, Mr. Noe explained a fundamental of business. "If you have a filling station on one corner," he said, "and you open a filling station on another corner, I would think it'll take some of your business away."
Up the Northway about 27 miles from here, Robert M. Blais, the Mayor of Lake George Village, where there is no race track, said that people there had not yet thought much about the casino issue even though Warren County, where Lake George is located, is also included in the proposed constitutional amendment.
But he said he had been following the Saratoga Springs debate. And he said the people of Warren County were likely to see things the same way. "I can see something quite identical happening here," he said.
Well, maybe not identical.

HEADLINE: From '80 Crime, White-Sioux Tension Today

BYLINE: By DON TERRY 

DATELINE: MOBRIDGE, S.D.

 BODY:
The main bridge over the Missouri River here stretches nearly a mile before it connects this overwhelmingly white farming town of 4,200 people to the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, where Sitting Bull is buried on a bluff and the vast prairie dips and rolls into the horizon.
It is also a bridge across time. Mobridge, a working-class city where the best stores and most of the jobs are, is on the eastern side of the river, and sets its clocks by central time. On the western side, where unemployment exceeds 60 percent and the mud after a thaw is ankle deep around the tiny houses scattered across the 900,000-acre reservation, people officially function in mountain time, one hour behind. 
 Indeed, these reluctant neighbors have rarely been in sync; stubborn prejudice and bloody history have seen to that here as in other parts of the country, especially where reservations abut predominantly white residential areas. And now, the possible answer to a 16-year-old murder mystery could make the distance between them even greater.
"There's always been prejudice and tension between whites and Indians around here," said Becky Rice, an 18-year-old white woman who works as a cashier at a downtown grocery store. "I'd do anything to change it. It's stupid. But I don't see it changing no time soon, not with this trial coming up."
In April, Nicholas A. Scherr, a burly, 31-year-old white man from one of Mobridge's well-known families -- the Scherr name adorns the city's sports arena, its social centerpiece -- is scheduled to go on trial for the rape and murder of an 18-year-old Sioux, Candace Rough Surface, who lived on the reservation.
People on either side of the bridge say the trial could divide neighbors along racial lines and challenge long-held perceptions of truth and justice. To hear some tell it, that is already happening. Most Indians interviewed believe there is a strong chance that Mr. Scherr will be found not guilty because he is white and well-connected, and the victim was a Sioux. But most whites are confident that an impartial jury can be impaneled and will "do justice" regardless of racial considerations.
Ms. Rough Surface's badly decomposed body was found in a bed of mud and twigs in a Missouri River inlet in May 1981, after she had been missing for nine months. Local police officers and Ms. Rough Surface's friends had searched the area for some time after reports of her disappearance -- to no avail.
"We didn't know where to start," said Sheriff Jim Spiry of Walworth County. "In the back of our minds, we had this fear of foul play. When someone just disappears off the face of the earth, somebody has to know something. But we kept running into dead ends."
Federal officials were called in when her body was found with five bullet holes in her head and back.
Law-enforcement officials say that with neither physical evidence nor eyewitness testimony, they have reached an impasse. Periodically, they have renewed their investigation, they said, but Indians insist that after the initial activity, the police let the case die.
Then last fall, Mr. Scherr's cousin, James E. Stroh, confessed to taking part in the rape and slaying when he was 15 and Mr. Scherr was 16.
"She was petrified; she was whimpering," Mr. Stroh testified at a preliminary hearing in November.
In a plea agreement, Mr. Stroh, who is now 30, implicated Mr. Scherr as the instigator of a night of partying that ended with gunshots echoing across an isolated pasture.
According to the police, Mr. Stroh himself was betrayed by a family member during a bitter divorce in Wisconsin, where he was living. Over the years, he said at the hearing, he had shared his secret with a number of people, including his wife.
Mr. Stroh has been charged with manslaughter and assault even though he admits taking a turn raping and shooting Ms. Rough Surface -- out of fear, he said, of his cousin. Mr. Scherr has been charged with murder and rape and could face the death penalty if convicted.
Reed A. Rasmussen, Mr. Scherr's lawyer, says his client is innocent. "It's been very difficult on his family," Mr. Rasmussen said. "People have already convicted him with only hearing the state's case."
In the last 16 years two people have been killed here: Ms. Rough Surface and, in 1986, her father, who was beaten to death by a family member. That man was quickly arrested, tried and convicted.
Why it took so long to charge someone in Ms. Rough Surface's slaying is uncertain.
"It's been a case we've wanted to solve for a lot of years," said Daniel J. Todd, the Walworth County State's Attorney. "But I've wondered why we couldn't come up with information before now" -- especially in Mobridge, where "people on one side of town know what's going on in someone's house clear across town."
It is not hard to find Indians who say they know the answer: race.
"She was just an Indian," said Ms. Rough Surface's niece, Polly. "Her life didn't count as much."
To show Mobridge residents that her life counted to them, in the weeks after Mr. Stroh's confession, Ms. Rough Surface's family and more than 300 advocates for Indians marched and rode horses across the bridge last December demanding "justice for Candi."
Another demonstration is planned for April 22, the trial's opening day, and for a while there was talk of a boycott of downtown businesses, where many Indians said they have never felt comfortable shopping.
"Indians often get followed through the store when they go shopping in town," said Rob Renville, a Sioux and Vietnam War veteran who administers a vocational training program on the reservation. "I'd like to believe that race doesn't play any role in justice for Candi, but this is a white man we're talking about. If it was an Indian man accused of killing a white girl, he'd already be cooked."
"But things have gotten better around here," he added. "We've moved into the 1970's."
In Mobridge, many whites said the city was being unjustly blamed for the slaying and that progress in race relations was being ignored. They note that although there are only one or two Indian-owned businesses here, Indian employees can be found up and down Main Street.
Acknowledging that there are still many problems, Sister Teresita Schaefbauer said: "I've been here since 1980 and you didn't see a Native American working in a store. Now, there's quite a few."
Whites and Indians attend school together. They gamble together at the reservation casinos. They sometimes marry one another. Ms. Rough Surface's older sister, Clara, is married to a white man.
"The Indian is accepted here," said Pepsi Lawrence, the Indian owner of the Fireside Supper Club. "I hope this whole thing doesn't get to be a racial thing. It might mess up a good thing."
Mobridge is the trading center for people living in a 60-mile radius of the city. In the summer the streets are crowded with fishermen. The city likes to call itself the "walleye capital of the world."
Life here is good, said Rick Cain, the Mayor who, like all Mobridge officials, is white. He blames "the few Indians in town who feel they are constantly being discriminated against" for any racial tension.
J. R. Buchholz, a 17-year-old white youth who works at a local grocery store, said the Indians "think we're all bad guys and that we're trying to take over everything." He added: "Maybe sometimes we are. But I think what we're really trying to do is just maintain what we have."
What many people in Mobridge still have, said Patty Seiler, a white woman who works in a photography studio, are racist views of Indians. "Whenever something bad happens," she said, "the first question people ask is, 'Was it an Indian?' "
In a move that angered many Indians, more than 100 people signed a petition seeking to lower Mr. Scherr's bond of $200,000. It was not lowered, but Mr. Scherr, who had been working at a local trucking company, came up with the money anyway.
Still, the petition seems to have gobbled up much of the neutral ground in this case. For example, members of the Scherr and Rough Surface families worship at the Roman Catholic Church here. But when Mr. Scherr's mother asked the priest, the Rev. Richard Ortmeier, to sign the petition, he said he did so with little thought.
Then he realized how angry and hurt the Indians were about the petition drive, and asked that his name be removed from the list. "It never dawned on me it would stir up the others," Father Ortmeier said. "I'm just afraid that somehow, they're both going to be against me now."
For many Indians, justice in the case means nothing less than a guilty verdict. For many whites, it means a fair trial, although they acknowledge that the chances of having an Indian on the jury are slim. The jury pool is drawn from the local voter registration list, and the overwhelming number of voters listed are white.
Bea Medicine, an anthropologist who grew up on the reservation, said Mobridge is like "a Southern town in the 60's." Whites "have a symbiotic relationship" with Indians, she said: "they hate us, but love our money."
Even the Scherr-Howe Arena, the yellow-and-red brick building that draws people from 100 miles away to attend everything from basketball games to farm shows, has been dragged into the case.
The building was renamed in 1990 in honor of an Indian artist, Oscar Howe, whose murals line the arena's walls, and Jim and Bill Scherr, white twins who were members of the United States wrestling team in the 1988 Summer Olympic Games. Bill Scherr won a bronze medal, and Jim Scherr placed seventh. They are Nicholas Scherr's older brothers. Ms. Medicine is trying to have Mr. Howe's name removed so, she says, it will not be sullied by the Scherr's.
But Ms. Rough Surface's 71-year-old mother, Alberta, said that was going too far because the two brothers are not involved in the case. She added that whatever happens in the trial, Indians and whites must still live together and not allow the past to poison the present.
"We want justice," she said. "We don't want violence. We want the men who did this to be put away so they never hurt anyone else's daughter. We don't want to hurt innocent people. We don't want to be like them."

HEADLINE: Unions Looking South To Find New Members

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: BAL HARBOUR, Fla., Feb. 19

 BODY:
Trying to halt the four-decade-long slide in the percentage of workers belonging to unions, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. unveiled plans today to intensify efforts to attract American workers to unions, with a focus on the South.
Making good on his promise to expand the federation's organizing efforts, John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s new president, said that increasing union membership was crucial for giving workers more power to reverse the decline in real wages that most Americans have experienced over the past two decades. 
 "We must all face a basic fact," Mr. Sweeney said at the winter meeting of the federation's executive council. "We cannot bargain decent contracts for our members, nor can we obtain public policies that protect working families, unless we can build a substantially larger labor movement."
Several union officials said they expected the A.F.L.-C.I.O., together with its 78 affiliated unions, to spend more than $100 million on trying to organize workers over the next 18 months.
Next year alone, officials said, the federation will increase its spending on organizing to more than $15 million, from $2 million a year ago.
In announcing a unionization drive for the South, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is hoping to succeed where it failed in the late 1940's, when it undertook a campaign known as Operation Dixie. Although labor leaders said they expected the new Southern campaign to be difficult and expensive, they said it was vital to recruit workers to unions in the South because the region represented such a major part of the nation's economy.
"It's through the organized strength of working families that we can win better public policies," said Denise Mitchell, the federation's communications director, "and it will be hard to do that if we don't have strength in the South. We think we are ready. We think we've put it off too long."
Richard Bensinger, director of the federation's new organizing department, said he was confident the Southern campaign could unionize many government workers, service workers and factory workers.
Having spent his first three-and-a-half months as president making internal changes in the federation, Mr. Sweeney is using the Florida meeting to demonstrate that he is putting new energy and direction into the lethargic federation's activities. In addition to unveiling the organizing drive, he plans to announce that the federation will devote far more money and manpower than ever before to help pro-union candidates in a campaign year.
To prod individual unions to step up organizing, the federation announced a program today in which individual unions could ask to work with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. on organizing drives and would receive $1 in federation matching funds for every $4 the union puts up. And to increase the expertise behind such organizing efforts, the federation said it would oversee such cooperative organizing efforts and help select the head of such organizing campaigns.
This is an important shift for the federation because historically it hardly provided money, manpower or advice to aid organizing efforts by individual unions. But union officials said it is increasingly important for the federation to lend its expertise because corporate managements have grown more sophisticated in defeating unionization drives.
Federation officials said that because most organizing is done by a handful of unions, one goal of the new program is to spur unions that have done little organizing to step up their efforts.
Labor leaders said poultry processing, hospitals and nursing homes were among the industries where the federation hoped to focus its organizing energies. As part of its new strategy, the federation will seek to organize not just one or two employers in an industry in a region, but also to organize all employers in that industry.
Mr. Bensinger said this was the best way to obtain good contracts from employers because otherwise companies could argue that they could not afford to pay higher wages when their nearby competitors were not unionized.
Mr. Sweeney announced today that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. was for the first time setting up a Working Women's Department, which will seek to help female workers nationwide and relay their concerns to the federation, state governments and the Federal Government.
He said this department would be headed by Karen Nussbaum, who is director of the Department of Labor's Women's Bureau and was a former secretary who founded 9-to-5, the National Association of Working Women.

HEADLINE: Council Pushes Own Budget Ideas

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
The New York City Council has long been criticized for failing to take a strong stand in budget talks with the Mayor, but some early signs suggest that in at least one respect, this year may be different.
Now that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has offered his preliminary budget, community groups and lobbyists who long for a more energetic Council argue that the legislative body should be using this time to devise an aggressive alternative. Council members concede that is not happening now. But they explain that their powers are limited. They also say it is too early to act because the Mayor's $31 billion financial plan is extremely uncertain. 
 "There are good points to the Mayor's financial plan and there are bad points to it," said Herbert E. Berman, chairman of the Council's Finance Committee. "But it's just the beginning of the process, and there's a distinct possibility that a lot of things will change before a budget is finally approved in June."
But while the Council is not preparing an alternative budget, Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, and consequently many other Council members, have already locked their sights on at least one major goal -- to persuade the Mayor to include in the budget the Speaker's $1.4 billion proposal for school reconstruction.
Never before in previous budget debates has the Council decided so early to push a major proposal like this one.
Mr. Vallone -- who holds tight controls over the Council -- started to campaign for his proposal in earnest several weeks ago. With the support of school officials in hand, he went to Albany to plead his case before state legislators, whose approval is needed for the proposal. He lobbied Gov. George E. Pataki on Feb. 9. And on the same day, joined by Mr. Berman, he decried the rundown condition of the city's schools at a State Board of Regents hearing.
Heartened that state officials have not dismissed the proposal out of hand, Council leaders believe they can persuade the Mayor to agree to some version of their plan. They say that while the Council may have given up too easily on previous budget initiatives, they will not fold on this one.
Calling decrepit schools a priority problem that must be addressed, Mr. Vallone said at the Feb. 9 hearing: "This situation is a disaster in the making. And we refuse to pass the buck to the next generation."
The Mayor so far has not endorsed Mr. Vallone's proposal to extend the city's 12.5 percent personal income tax surcharge for three years to pay for new schools and to repair crumbling school buildings. He calls the plan an unnecessary tax increase.
"I have yet to see a plan that convinces me that anywhere near all of that money would ever be spent on a school," the Mayor said recently. "You are essentially trying to create a dedicated tax for a system that has proven it has no capacity to spend money wisely or sensibly."
The surcharge, previously used to pay for additional police officers expired at the end of last year. It cost about $78 a year for someone earning a median income of $36,000 a year. Mr. Giuliani has also said he does not think the city's Board of Education can be trusted to spend the money wisely.
Mr. Vallone, for his part, has honed his oratory to counter the Mayor's criticism. "What we are asking New Yorkers now is not to accept a tax increase but simply to defer a tax decrease," he said. "I won't duck the use of the 'T word' where it's appropriate. But I will also not permit any party to misrepresent what the Council is proposing to do here."
The Council Speaker also stressed that the funds would go to the School Construction Authority, not the Board of Education.
But even as Mr. Vallone tries to steer the budget process with his school construction proposal, some Council members say the legislative body is still playing too minor a role. Some of them say they oppose the Mayor's proposed cuts to cultural institutions, libraries and recycling programs. But advocacy groups have already started to lament that there is no organized effort to stop severe reductions to school and welfare programs.
Councilman Sheldon S. Leffler of Queens said he would like to see the Mayor and the Council do more to grapple with the fundamental problem that the city spends more than it makes.
"Rather than add restorations to the Mayor's budget, we need to do more to shore up the fundamental imbalance of the city's finances," he said. "But that's an uphill struggle."
Some Council members said criticism may be muted because many of the proposed cuts have been threatened in previous years only to be restored in the Mayor's final budget -- a scenario they say is likely to be repeated this year.
"No one's really going around wringing their hands about specific cuts yet because there's a Chicken Little aspect to the budget process," said Councilman Anthony D. Weiner of Brooklyn. "Sometimes, it's in the interest of politicians to hold out dire consequences early on and then later say we'll restore it."
Michael S. Clendenin, a spokesman for Mr. Vallone, said criticism of the Mayor's financial plan may be softened because many things can change between now and late April, when the Mayor submits his final budget.
"There's also a recognition that the city is still in a serious economic bind, and this is going to be another bad budget year," Mr. Clendenin said.
Chris Meyer, a lawyer for the New York Public Interest Research Group who follows the Council closely, said the Council has forgone many chances to change significantly the way the city delivers services.
"The Council's budget hearings usually devolve into very parochial questions about the members' individual districts," he said. "And the Council never deals with the larger issues."
The tenor of next month's hearings is not likely to change, but Mr. Meyer acknowledged that Mr. Vallone has come out uncharacteristically early and tenaciously for the school construction plan.

HEADLINE: Copyright Pirates Prosper In China Despite Promises

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: GUANGZHOU, China

 BODY:
Inside a military compound, where the veranda alongside his office looks out on a grand, white-columned building used by the Chinese Air Force, Wang Binyan leaned back in his black leather chair and spoke genially about being a copyright pirate.
Pirating is not so bad, Mr. Wang said, if it means selling compact disks at prices ordinary Chinese can afford, like $1. Never mind that for two years -- until Beijing ordered him to suspend operations in December -- exports made up most of the five million disks copied at the Cai Ling Audio and Video Company, where he is chairman and general manager. 
 "It's the Hong Kong and Taiwan people who bring us the master disks," said Mr. Wang, 52, nodding with a firmness intended to identify the real culprits. "And it's the Japanese who create the demand by pushing so many electronics on China."
Inside a military compound: the location of Mr. Wang's office says more about today's piracy of intellectual property in China than his roundabout self-justifications.
His cozy relations with the military are doubtless why he seems so relaxed, even in the midst of a crackdown that is apparently timed to counter another American threat of trade sanctions on more than $1 billion worth of Chinese goods shipped to America.
A year after a landmark agreement between the United States and China promised to fight intellectual property violations and pirates like Mr. Wang aggressively, factories like his in Guangdong Province are still flouting enforcement efforts.
In the meantime, 220 million cassette tapes and 45 million CD's, worth a total of $250 million, were copied illegally in 1995, the International Federation of Phonographic Industries says.
Although a few compact disk factories were finally suspended by Chinese Government officials late last year, not one has been prosecuted, nor has a business license been revoked.
In fact, it is increasingly evident that pirates like Mr. Wang are protected by powerful forces -- military, secret police and organized crime -- which the central Government has failed, or simply declined, to rein in.
The more Beijing insists that it has succeeded in cracking down on flagrant pirating, the more those factories still punching out everything from computer software to music CD's stick out with prominence.
For his part, Mr. Wang did not deny that some compact disk factories were partly owned or controlled by military people, but he maintained that it was merely a coincidence that his own landlords were military.
"My only connection to them is the rent I pay," he said, smiling broadly.
Music industry executives say that virtually all of the 19 factories here in Guangdong, the engine room of China's booming coastal economy, have violated copyright laws at some time, and that some are still making thousands of high-quality illegally copied disks each week.
One piece of evidence is a CD-ROM -- compiling Windows 95, OS/2 and other computer software on a single disk -- that is widely sold for $2.50 in Shenzhen, across the border from Hong Kong.
During the last year, the executives estimate, the total reached tens of millions of compact disks and hundreds of millions of cassette tapes, making China the largest producer of pirated music in the world, and one of the five largest of pirated software. The Business Software Alliance reports that an estimated $525 million worth of software was copied illegally in 1995.
It is the export market that most concerns international music and software companies.
True to Mr. Wang's explanation, it is often organized criminals from Hong Kong and Taiwan who carry master tapes to a factory in China and then transport pirated disks back out for sale in Southeast Asia, though some Chinese-made copies have been found as far away as Russia and Latin America.
In their own defense, Chinese officials like to point out that task forces have been formed and raids on retailers carried out, including a blitz in January that netted 400,000 illegally made compact disks in the city of Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province. That looked like a lot when the disks were being bulldozed, a scene replayed on national television.
But the raids attacked the symptom, not the cause. And attacking the cause itself requires a political will that China's leaders -- for a variety of reasons -- have not yet shown.
"It may be that the guys in Beijing believe it when local officials report that they have the situation under control," said Stephanie Mitchell, a vice president of the Business Software Alliance, an advocacy group. "It may be a mixture of naivete, incompetence, turf battles and something worse."
The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, recently warned China that 100 percent tariffs could be imposed on more than $1 billion of Chinese imports to the United States if more was not done. While there is no written requirement that China meet the terms of last year's agreement by the Feb. 26 anniversary, American officials call it a "benchmark" that should not be ignored if future trade agreements are to be respected.
If trade talks look futile, music and software industry executives and lawyers agree that the United States is taking the right tack, laying the groundwork for better enforcement and alternating carrots with sticks to urge Beijing to eventually get serious.
"You've got to keep the pressure on any way you can," said Joseph T. Simone, an intellectual property lawyer in Hong Kong. Chinese companies that are themselves victims of pirating will be the greatest beneficiaries of tougher enforcement, Mr. Simone said, but until they can exert serious leverage it will be up to American and international business groups to do so.
In a meeting here on Feb. 8, Guangdong officials assured Lee Sands, an assistant United States trade representative, that they had enough evidence to revoke the business licenses of more factories, but they declined to say which or how many.
Of the 19 compact disk factories in Guangdong, the officials said, 4 have been ordered by Beijing to suspend operations and 5 more have stopped production for other, presumably business, reasons. But none have been prosecuted, and music industry executives say they suspect that several of the suspended factories are actually operating after hours, including Mr. Wang's. He denies it.
Mr. Sands finished a round of talks with trade officials in Beijing on Feb. 15, and the United States trade representative's office said the talks would resume at an unspecified date after the Chinese New Year holiday.
Apart from questioning Chinese officials about enforcement problems, Mr. Sands also broached a touchy issue in his talks that, in a way, cuts to the core of Beijing's commitment to enforcing intellectual property rights.
In early December, representatives for a worldwide organization of music companies closed down their office in Guangzhou after they were warned that their lives were endangered by organized criminals who had been hired by pirates.
The representatives, who work for the International Federation of Phonographic Industries, opened the office in 1993 to collect information on music piracy and to use China's legal system to fight it. Fifteen people worked there.
"It's a fact of life in fighting piracy that you get death threats," said Catrin Hughes, the federation's communications director in London. "What made this more serious was that our people learned that a contract had actually been taken out on members of our staff."
An assistant to Cheng Ching-ming, the federation's chief representative in China, said Mr. Cheng could not talk publicly about the incident because the organization is currently negotiating with the Chinese authorities about reopening the office and seeking assurances that the staff will be protected.
But two lawyers familiar with the incident said what was perhaps most remarkable was the identity of the man who delivered the warning to the federation staff -- an officer in the Guangdong State Security Bureau, a local arm of the secret police. It was not a friendly warning, Mr. Cheng told associates.
"It's impossible to untangle the web of who's working with whom," one lawyer said. "There's a Wild West mentality. But this was pretty shocking."
Although federation's staff likes to keep its distance from American officials, to avoid fueling Chinese suspicions that they are tools of the Americans, their aims are identical: to stop piracy and the resulting losses to businesses.
Mr. Sands specifically asked his Chinese counterparts to insure that the federation could reopen its office safely, American officials said, emphasizing the right of legitimate organizations to carry out legitimate activities.
But Mr. Wang, the genial copyright pirate, lost his composure when asked about the federation's representatives.
"Those people are snakes!" he yelled, recalling that he tried to help them when he was first approached by Mr. Cheng, even arranging a lunch with his friends in the local government to introduce them.
"I help them, and what do they do?" he said. "They send people here undercover to buy CD's to see what we were making! They were spying!"
Mr. Wang admitted that what he had sold the federation's buyers was indeed pirated music, and said he understood that it was against the law. And he did not seem sheepish about displaying his closeness to local officials whom he invited for lunch with Mr. Cheng.
But he seemed to be most offended by what he saw as a violation of a code of honor.
Though he denied any detailed knowledge of the threats made against Mr. Cheng and his staff, Mr. Wang said he thought they deserved whatever they had coming, and acknowledged that the matter had been discussed at length among competing compact disk pirates.
"We were all deeply offended by them," he said, referring to the federation staff. "They want to protect intellectual property rights. I have no problem with that. But it is wrong for them to spy."
Mr. Wang, originally a stage actor and film director before taking over a music publishing house that spent $2 million on a compact disk production line, is formally under investigation by the Guangdong authorities and may be subject to a fine. But he doesn't seem too worried about it.
"I've done something wrong, O.K.," he said. "Give me a chance to change. They'll give me another chance."

HEADLINE: Gore Is Singing a Popular Refrain to Gathered Union Leaders

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN

DATELINE: BAL HARBOUR, Fla., Feb. 19

 BODY:
Signing on squarely with the leading items on organized labor's election-year agenda, Vice President Al Gore told the nation's unions today that President Clinton would veto Republican proposals to shrink the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and curb its powers to police the workplace.
After meeting privately with the 57 union leaders who make up the policy-making executive council of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Mr. Gore told reporters that in their current form, similar workplace safety bills before the House and Senate "would really undermine and devastate OSHA's ability to do its job." 
 Often at these annual meetings, unions find plenty of bones to pick with the White House, even Democrats. They were slow to endorse Bill Clinton's candidacy for President four years ago, and they criticized him for supporting the enactment in late 1993 of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which they saw as a threat to jobs.
But in the current election-year climate, the White House, the Democratic Congressional leaders visiting here and the A.F.L.-C.I.O., now under the more militant leadership of a new leader, John J. Sweeney, are singing from the same song book.
Soon after his election last October, Mr. Sweeney began proclaiming that "America needs a raise." Today, in the talking points that Mr. Gore brought into the meeting, he said, "We also agree with President Sweeney that Americans need a raise."
In news conferences after their own appearences, Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader, and David F. Bonior, the minority whip, invoked the same phraseology.
All dwelled upon the economic phenomenon that the unions are pressing hardest -- the widening gaps in income and wealth of the rich and the poor. The issue, the Vice President told reporters is "whether wages are going to grow or continue to stagnate."
In the 1996 elections as in those four years ago, he said the issue is "still the economy." Other issues, like family concerns, Medicare and the environment matter, too, he said.
"But it is still the economy that's at the bedrock of our ability to solve any of these problems," he said. He also reiterated Clinton Administration support for an increase in the $4.25 Federal minimum wage, which was last raised, from $3.80, in 1991.
But workplace safety is a red-hot button for labor, and the Administration's position was not entirely clear. Mr. Gore left wide room for compromise in saying the President would veto the safety and health proposals that "closely resemble" the ones now before Congress.
Nancy Taylor, the federation's legislative director, said both bills, one proposed by Senator Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, the other by Representative Cass Ballenger of North Carolina, were equally severe in restricting Federal safety investigators' access to workplaces like factories, offices, restaurants and construction sites.
But the Ballenger bill goes further in also eliminating another agency, the Mine Safety and Health Administration.
The workplace safety laws originated in the Nixon Administration and the author of the legislation was a Republican, William Steiger of Wisconsin. But business has long complained that they led to Government meddling and red tape.
As in the past, he also promised vetos of attempts to repeal the Davis-Bacon Act that bases construction wages on the those prevailing in communities and in that way prevents builders from bringing in lower-wage workers from other areas.
And he repeated a promise that the President would veto legislation, narrowly enacted last year in the House, to permit employers to appoint worker associations to represent worker interests and in that way thwart real unions from organizing the employers' work forces.
Mr. Gore also went to the Everglades National Park to press the Administration's plans to double spending for Everglades restoration.
"We are dealing with an extremely fragile system that is on the verge of collapse," he said.

HEADLINE: Nesting Beyond the Snowbirds;
Foreigners Flock to Miami's Luxury Condominiums

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER 

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
Ugo Colombo is a smallish man with a big taste for finely tailored Italian suits and tall buildings. Very tall buildings.
Today, he sits atop Miami's latest luxury-condominium boom -- the first in 15 years and the most extravagant by far -- watching his new project, a 51-floor tower called the Santa Maria, rise on the shores of Biscayne Bay. When completed next year, the $120 million tower will be the tallest residential building south of New York and east of Chicago. 
 Mr. Colombo, the 34-year-old scion of a Milanese family that made a fortune in plastics, is the leader of a pack. Other developers, most of them foreign-born like Mr. Colombo, are propelling dozens of orchid-colored buildings skyward along waterfront property extending from the northern reaches of Miami Beach to south of the spiky office towers of downtown Miami and Key Biscayne.
Apartments in many of these buildings are not the kennel-sized units of past condomania booms. By comparison, the new wave of development is palatial in size and price, aimed not at the typical winter-weary Northerner seeking an escape or a modest place to retire but at affluent Europeans, Latin Americans and local residents who already own a house in fashionable neighborhoods of Dade County.
The reshuffling of the real estate market here -- yet another measure of the widening gulf between the wealthy and just about everybody else -- reflects Miami's growing success in attracting international travelers, investment and trade. More specifically, deep-pocket developers like Mr. Colombo and his CMC Group are tapping affluent buyers in a market deemed dead and buried in the 1980's.
When outsiders think about Latin Americans in Dade County -- population, two million -- one image is that of Cuban and Nicaraguan exiles mixed with Colombian drug cowboys. South Florida remains a major point of entry for illegal narcotics and a way station for drug money.
But that image only scratches the surface. Today, some 650,000 Cuban-Americans, 75,000 Nicaraguans and 65,000 Colombians reside full time in the area, most of them hard working and prospering. And children and grandchildren of the exiles are now prominent in professional ranks, giving the business world a vibrancy Miami had previously known only in its nightlife and sports teams.
As the American hub for expanding hemispheric trade and banking, Miami is also home to tens of thousands of well-heeled Brazilians, Venezuelans, Peruvians, Argentines, Ecuadoreans and other Central Americans. It has long been a magnet for flight capital chased by political unrest or currency instability, particularly in the 1970's and 1980's when rich Latin Americans sought refuge from economic tumult.
Buyers of the new luxury condos also include business executives from Germany, Italy and France with offices plugged into Miami's prosperous international trade community, or their compatriots who crave a piece of the subtropical life for extended winter or summer vacations. Even Russians tasting the first fruits of capitalism are snapping up second homes at a surprising rate.
"Los Angeles is too far to travel for Europeans," said Mr. Colombo, who escaped the bleak overcast winters of Italy in 1983 to study at the University of Miami and learn English. "New York is too expensive. Miami is a perfect place for a second home in the sun, a city on the beach."
It helps to be high above it all, though. Glass-wrapped apartments on the top floors of the Santa Maria -- just beneath the $4.6 million penthouse -- come with sticker prices approaching $2 million, occupy 5,733 square feet of floor space and 1,742 square feet of terrace. That's enough room to fit a large suburban house and garden. Lower-floor condos spiral up from a $386,000 base price, with the average three-bedroom at somewhere more than $600,000.
Mr. Colombo throws himself into nearly every aspect of his project, whether negotiating with his financial backers, which include union pension funds; selecting Gagineau ovens for the Italian Snaidero kitchens, or working on details of the tower's smoothly cantilevered design with his Miami architect, Louis Revuelta.
Other new projects emphasize high style, including a 15-story condominium proposed for Miami Beach's Ocean Drive that was designed by Michael Graves, the noted Princeton, N.J., architect.
"All our research shows the three most important things buyers want are life-style issues," said Richard Lamondine, a developer putting up the first of five towers in the new planned community of Aventura, north of Miami Beach. The three: "Privacy, exclusivity and security."
To lure customers, developers have sales representatives in a wide number of overseas offices. "I have brokers in Caracas, Rio and Paris," said Gerald Kaufman, who directs marketing for several projects. "I myself have made two trips to Moscow in the past year or two."
Miami's appeal to visitors -- foreign and domestic -- is centered around South Beach, a 30-square-block neighborhood lined with sidewalk restaurants and restored Art Deco hotels in the lower third of Miami Beach. That's where Hollywood celebrities have joined the fashion-model set and European tourists.
But there is much more to this condo boom than European glitz and fashion. The pace of high-end condo development in the Miami area has more than doubled in three years, jumping from 23 individual projects in 1992, to 46 in the first three quarters of 1995. More than 3,500 high-end units, priced at more than $325,000 each, are coming on the market in the next three years, according to Lewis M. Goodkin, a real estate expert here who is a consultant for Price Waterhouse.
Meanwhile, older hotels and apartment houses on Miami Beach are rapidly being converted into condos at lower price ranges. And other projects that could add thousands of units are seeking financing.
In 1985, when a huge backlog of unsold smaller condos from the 1978-80 building binge glutted the market, the average sales price was less than $70,000. By last November, lifted by the revival of the high-end market that began in 1993, the average price of all new condos had jumped to nearly triple that level.
Real estate busts following booms are as expected here as summer heat and humidity after a glorious winter, but many analysts of the local market argue that this time should be different. Mr. Goodkin cited several factors.
"There is such diversity among the buyers, from so many offshore economies," he said, "that it's not likely that localized problems like the collapse of housing prices in the Northeast or currency controls in Venezuela can damage this market as they did in the 1980's."
The last cycle of condominium sales, he added, was exaggerated by speculative fever, with buyers snapping up blocks of units in a building, putting less than 10 percent down.
"When the market turned down they simply walked away from the problem, leaving the banks holding the mortgages," he said. "The savings-and-loan crisis ended that kind of lending. Now buyers are putting down 15 to 20 percent or more and that should bring stability."
New banking regulations and more conservative lending practices are also forcing developers to provide more of a project's start-up costs. As a rule today, banks will not provide construction loans until the developer has already signed tenants for 50 percent of the apartments.
But other local analysts are more skeptical about how sustainable this boom really is. "It's in the nature of builders to envision more demand than actually exists," said Paul Black, vice president of Appraisal and Real Estate Economics Associates of Miami.
With the Santa Maria, Ugo Colombo is betting that the demand will arise in response to the supply. He had the same hunch several years ago and hit the jackpot.
At the time, he was managing a dozen or more apartments owned by his father and other European investors on Brickell Avenue, a high-rise corridor of banks and apartment buildings on Biscayne Bay just south of downtown. He started snapping up unsold condos auctioned by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, forming a partnership with Trammel Crow, the Texas-based real estate firm.
"Everyone said condos on Brickell were dead, but by 1990 I saw the demand was there for the right properties," Mr. Colombo said.
His plans for the construction of a 40-story luxury condominium on the Brickell waterfront called Bristol Towers were met with derision. The real estate market at the time had taken a dive and condo sales were flat. Survivors of the savings-and-loan collapse were loathe to lend money at all. Mr. Colombo, along with new partners, went instead to European, Canadian and Japanese banks for the $50 million project.
"I felt I had a handle on what people wanted," Mr. Colombo recalled. "There was a pent-up demand for quality and security. People who already owned expensive homes in Miami and were fearful of crime wanted to shift to a secure, vertical location without giving up the comfort of a house."
What he also recognized was that Miami, hemmed in by the ocean to the east and the Everglades to the west, was running out of prime real estate, especially on the water. As the project began, other developers were busy replacing or repairing single-family homes damaged in 1992 by Hurricane Andrew. The only condos being built, with few exceptions, were inexpensive low-rises far from downtown.
By the time Bristol Towers was completed in 1993 nearly all of its 147 apartments had been sold for a total of about $80 million, netting Mr. Colombo a windfall and setting off a stampede by other developers. Counting on success, he had already acquired land for the Santa Maria, the last waterfront lot available on Brickell.
Skeptics, noting that the Santa Maria faces a lot more competition than Bristol Towers did, are not convinced Mr. Colombo can work his magic at a second Brickell property, especially one with selling costs of $250 a square foot, 20 percent more than his first project. There is also caution expressed about whether Japanese, Brazilian and Italian banks -- prime investors in the Miami real estate market -- will continue to pour money in if sales slow.
But that kind of rainy-day talk generally falls on deaf ears in Miami, where the subtropical sun inculcates optimism and the building cranes are flying once again.

A Flare-Up of Passions On Trade And Jobs

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
Usually arguments over America's trade policies are considered a snooze on the campaign trail, and for four decades how Washington should deal with its economic rivals has rarely been an issue for Republicans, the party of big business and traditionally an unflinching defender of free trade.
But the way the issue has suddenly flared in New Hampshire illustrates how divided Republicans have become in the past two years on the question of how to manage the nation's economy. And it is a testament to the power of Patrick J. Buchanan's oratory -- the underpinnings of a campaign that many Republicans agree has identified the anxieties of voters even if they dislike his solutions. 
 The most explicitly protectionist of the candidates, Mr. Buchanan has gathered steam and passionate crowds with his thundering calls for economic nationalism, and his declarations that his thinking is "the future of the Republican party." His rivals, meanwhile, perhaps a bit shocked at how well the message is playing, have simultaneously denounced Mr. Buchanan as an isolationist and a protectionist, while delicately edging in his direction.
Not one of the main rivals for the nomination has embraced Mr. Buchanan's most headline-grabbing economic remedies: for Japanese imports, 10 percent tariffs, and for Chinese-made goods, 20 percent, an extra margin that in Mr. Buchanan's view China deserves for both its obstreperous economic behavior and its repeated threats to Taiwan. Nor have any other candidates joined Mr. Buchanan's pledge to pull the United States out of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the newly created World Trade Organization, the Geneva-based arbiter of trade rules around the globe.
But to listen to the candidates in the last few days of the first primary battle is to discover that almost everyone in the race, from the tire magnate Morry Taylor to the front-runner, Senator Bob Dole, believes Mr. Buchanan has struck a chord among swing voters whom they ignore at their peril.
So far, however, only Mr. Buchanan has managed to sew the country's economic anxieties and its sense of diminished influence in the world into a single tapestry, with an interpretation of economic history that leads to his protectonist message. "It's a remarkable transition for the Republican Party," said I. M. Destler, a professor of the University of Maryland and one of the country's leading experts on the use of trade as a political tool in American politics. "Before Eisenhower, the protectionist wing of the party wanted to protect its friends in big business. But now there is a very different kind ofpopulist protectionism rising up."
The new strategy is explicitly aimed against Wall Street and the big contributors that have historically been the backbone of the Republican establishment. At the same time it is tailored to appeal to disaffected workers, once a core Democratic constituency.
Mr. Buchanan trumpeted that point today. "Who do you think can bring the Perot voters home for the Republican Party?" he asked at one campaign stop. "Do you think Bob Dole can bring them home? He was for Nafta and GATT and all those sell-out deals. I can bring the Perot voters home."
 The appeal of Mr. Buchanan's message has clearly caught Mr. Dole off balance, as he acknowledged half-heartedly today when he told workers at a New Hampshire electronics firm, "I didn't realize that jobs and trade and what makes America work would become a big issue in the last few days of this campaign." And the result is that so far, at least, Mr. Dole has been unable to respond to Mr. Buchanan's fire-breathing with anything more specific than a promise to "use the powers Congress has given the President" to open markets abroad and stop unfair competition at home.
Anything more specific is something of a minefield for Mr. Dole because his entire legislative life has been a testament to pressing the frontiers of free trade.
Mr. Dole, for example, joined President Clinton in pushing through the Nafta, though in recent weeks Mr. Dole joined other Republican leaders in torpedoing the Administration's effort to speed along negotiations that would have expanded the treaty to include Chile.
But Mr. Dole may rue the day in late 1994 that he showed up in the Rose Garden of the White House, next to Mr. Clinton, to announce his support for the global trade treaty that created the trade tribunal, which has become something of the economic equivalent of the United Nations.
Few voters in New Hampshire have heard much about the World Trade Organization, but that has not stopped Mr. Buchanan from using it to make his case that America has handed away its national sovereignty to "these institutions of the new world order." He was greeted with big cheers in Portsmouth, one of the state's more liberal cities, when he noted that the United States gets only one vote in the World Trade Organization, "which makes the world's greatest superpower the equal of Cuba, Bangladesh and Burundi."
Such imagery seems to have thrown Mr. Buchanan's opponents so off base that, so far at least, they have not challenged any of his claims, even the most dubious ones. The world trade panel, for example, does not have the power to overrule American laws. At worst, it can authorize trading partners to impose modest economic sanctions.
Nor has anyone challenged another of Mr. Buchanan's assertions: that the North American agreement has cost Americans 300,000 jobs. That is not based on unemployment figures; Mr. Buchanan said several months ago that he calculated the figure himself, by reversing the Clinton Administration's logic that every $1 billion in American exports creates 20,000 jobs.
But that is economics, not politics. And for the next few months, the party's future course may well depend on whether Mr. Buchanan's message has enough staying power to bring other candidates around to his views, even if they hate the whole idea.

HEADLINE: Willie Brown's Performance Is a Hit

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 19

 BODY:
It is more than a run-of-the-mill political honeymoon that this beauty of a city is having with its flamboyant new Mayor.
"It's a loooooove affair," Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr. said in a deep-throated croon. 
 Since he took office last month, coming home after years in Sacramento as Democratic deal-master and Speaker of the State Assembly, he has found that gourmets here lay down their shellfish forks to applaud when he enters restaurants. Moviegoers have shouted "Hurray! Here's the Mayor!" as he searched for a seat, he said. And a poll taken after his first month found that 61.6 percent of voters thought Mr. Brown, the city's first black mayor, was doing a good job.
"It's easy to adjust to adulation," he said with a chortle.
But it has not been as easy for Mr. Brown, 61, to adjust from manipulating the back rooms of the Assembly to governing a city, where the Mayor's every word is dissected by press and public.
He caused considerable alarm with a proposal that "gang kids" police city buses. He also provoked some outrage when, in defending an appointee who was accused of inflating his credentials, Mr. Brown said that everybody lies on their resumes.
Indeed, his reputation in Sacramento as an operator slippery as an oil slick -- a California Journal poll released this month ranked him the smartest member of the Assembly but 76th out of 79 members on integrity -- still causes low-burning concern among his new constituents.
Nevertheless, most San Franciscans still appear enchanted with their Mayor, citing an indisputable reason: Mr. Brown is making city politics interesting again. In an era when most big-city mayors have become conservative in manner and politics, Mr. Brown has brought panache and extra pull on the national stage, holding meetings with friends like Bill Clinton.
"A lot of people were scared originally that he was just a crook, he was going to come in and steal everything worthwhile in the city, that he'd be using the mayorship as a springboard to a bigger job," said Harry Swets, an advocate for the homeless known as Hooks for his two prosthetic arms. For now, though, Mr. Swets said, after asking Mr. Brown to ease up on arrests of the homeless and getting good signals: "It's exhilarating. It's a rush. We were looking for something optimistic."
Part of the rush Mr. Brown brings with him is the wicked fun he provides a town that revels in local gossip. Some say he reminds them of Jimmy Walker, who presided over New York in similarly high style (until he was driven out of the Mayor's office by scandal in 1932).
The city can now follow Mr. Brown up close to see which exquisite suit or hat he will wear next; which glamorous young date he has been seen dining with or which outrageous bon mot he has tossed out.
Then, there is a less benign new pursuit: reacting as one unpredictable idea after another floats off the top of his head and into public debate, prompting editorial huffs and popular concern only, as often as not, to see the proposal withdrawn.
San Franciscans are also watching as the new Mayor tries to take control of a somewhat ossified City Hall and give its policies more of the left-leaning slant that the city has historically taken, even while maintaining his status as arguably the most important Democrat in California.
Over all, judging by Mr. Brown's first weeks' performance, "I would predict he'll be more powerful than ever," said James Richardson, Mr. Brown's biographer and a reporter at The Sacramento Bee. "Because he's in a more visible position than ever and makes it even more visible by being Willie. People don't really know what an Assembly speaker is but they know what a mayor is."
Especially this Mayor.
Mr. Brown began generating unusual noise and heat from the moment he won office in a runoff election on Dec. 12, beating the incumbent, Frank Jordan, a former police chief, with 57 percent of the vote. He sported a cap reading "Da Mayor," celebrated his ascension with a public bash for more than 50,000 on the city's waterfront and bantered with President Clinton on the phone.
Within days, he had appointed the city's first Asian-American police chief and its first black fire chief. Along with them came a diverse array of officials reflecting this urban kaleidescope of about 750,000 people, with its sexual mix of heterosexuals, homosexuals and bisexuals, and its ethnic and racial mix that is roughly 11 percent black, 29 percent Asian-American, 13 percent Hispanic and 47 percent white.
He also began igniting verbal firecrackers. Some were minor, like his declaration that in his City Hall, employees would not wear jeans -- and if they did, he would send them home to change and dock their pay. ("What's next?" demanded The San Francisco Chronicle. "The creation of a new city Department of Couture?") He ran into graver criticism for his proposal that "gang kids" maintain order on the city buses. The foxes would be guarding the henhouse, bus riders complained. Mr. Brown later said that he had meant that the youth patrols could include reformed gang members. But that uproar and others were enough to prompt The San Francisco Examiner to complain about his premature verbalizations in an editorial titled "The Mayor's Mouth."
The looseness of Mr. Brown's remarks has not translated into a loose grip on his administration, however. In contrast to Mr. Jordan, who was seen as submitting to the mind-control of his consultants and dubbed by one official the "nebbish mayor," Mr. Brown runs an autocratic regime, wielding his power as nakedly as he did in Sacramento.
Mr. Brown is milking his dukedom to the last drop, with such vainglorious moves as plans to give visiting dignitaries leather-framed snapshots of them with Mr. Brown, CD-ROMs of San Francisco's best music and art with Mr. Brown on the cover and bottles of Napa Valley wine with guess-whose signature on the label.
Mr. Brown faces a typical compendium of urban ills, from a homeless population even more painfully visible than New York's to a heavy caseload of AIDS patients and a troubled transportation system.
He has offered few specific programs so far but asserts that "San Francisco will be the city to watch" to see how those problems can be tackled. He is planning a meeting of business and government leaders on the city's economic future this spring and has begun a program that circulates police officers onto buses at least twice per beat.
The new mayor's greatest possible pitfall, said Merv Field, an analyst who has been measuring California politics for 50 years, is that "San Francisco's endemic problems are just intractable."
Others believe the ultimate test for Mr. Brown will be whether he can tame the city employees when contract time comes; whether he can pull together a deal to build a waterfront baseball park meant to keep the Giants in San Francisco and whether he can win generous state funds for the city from his once and future nemesis, Gov. Pete Wilson, and an Assembly now under Republican control.
But even if the Mayor is stymied right and left, Mr. Field said, he has a proven ability to come out of any situation smelling sweet, a Teflon quality that can only be compared to Ronald Reagan's. Whether Mr. Brown will indeed try to parlay the local power he is expected to gain here into a bid for the governorship or Congress remains to be seen.
"Willie never plans anything," Mr. Richardson said. "He's a daylight runner: he sees the opening and goes for it."
Mr. Brown is widely expected to help run President Clinton's re-election effort in California, but he maintains that while he plans to be very helpful to Mr. Clinton, he will seek no title in the campaign organization.
"I have a city to run," Mr. Brown said. He is also, he freely admitted, busy having the time of his life.
"I am now beginning to wonder why I didn't look into local government sooner," he said.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE OVERVIEW;
CANDIDATES CLASH OVER TRADE ISSUES HEADING INTO VOTE

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 19

 BODY:
In the final hours before the nation's first primary, the unusually vituperative competition here for the Republican Presidential nomination swerved today into a confrontation over international trade.
Senator Bob Dole, who led for months in polls and now finds himself in a tight, unpredictable competition, offered a revealing acknowledgment of how Patrick J. Buchanan and his protectionist positions have come to dominate the race. 
 "We didn't plan it this way," Mr. Dole told more than 300 workers crammed into the cafeteria of Cabletron Systems, an electronics firm in Rochester, on the Maine border. "I didn't realize that jobs and trade and what makes America work would become a big issue in the last few days of this campaign."
In a biting retort, Mr. Buchanan said in an interview in his hotel room here: "Where has he been? Where has he been? That is a pristine example of an attitude or outlook in Washington -- of a Washington, D.C., that is totally out of touch with America." The former commentator, himself a native and lifelong resident of Washington, added, "How they could go through an entire campaign of a year and not be aware of this, I do really not know."
Mr. Dole's unprompted remarks were the biggest surprise on the final full day of stumping, which stretched from a pancake-flipping contest that attracted several candidates (wearing aprons) here this morning to a well-orchestrated torchlight parade this evening led by Mr. Dole in Milford, in the southern end of the state.
His comments underscored how issues in the race have shifted on a week-by-week, if not a day-by-day, basis -- from curbing big Government to abortion, then to the flat tax and now to the American worker. They also demonstrated how Mr. Dole, who enjoyed a commanding lead for most of last year, was caught off-guard by an issue that is critical to voters here.
As the candidates made last-ditch efforts to elbow one another out of the way in the drive up to what is traditionally the most crucial primary, Lamar Alexander, the former Governor of Tennessee, also ridiculed Mr. Buchanan on trade. But on the coast in Portsmouth, where Mr. Alexander completed the last mile of his 100-mile, yearlong walk across the state, he devoted himself to a stepped-up assault on Mr. Dole.
"Bob Dole is ducking interviews," Mr. Alexander said. "He's running negative ads. He doesn't have one single idea about how to lead us into the next century."
But Steve Forbes, the publishing magnate, could not resist entering the fray over trade, declaring to workers at a fiber-optic cable factory in the town of Newington near the coast: "There's another vision that says America can't compete in the world any more -- that America can't move ahead. That we have to bunker down, hunker down and isolate ourselves from the world, sort of a fortress mentality."
The jousting over trade was the latest turn in one of the most fluid primary battles here in years. A half-dozen of the latest tracking polls by independent organizations and campaigns showed that Mr. Dole and Mr. Buchanan -- the first- and second-place finishers in last week's Iowa caucuses -- were locked in a too-close-to-call duel for first place here.
The surveys also showed that Mr. Alexander and Mr. Forbes were in a competitive fight, with both trying to break out and even make a long-shot try for first place. Mr. Alexander appeared to be in a stronger position than Mr. Forbes -- and could benefit from a high turnout -- because he has the highest favorable ratings among the contenders. But all that anyone could seem to agree on was that the outcome was too close to venture a prediction and that it could well hinge on variables like the weather. The forecast for Tuesday in many parts of New Hampshire is for light snow and freezing rain, which could dampen turnout.
The other candidates -- Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana; Alan Keyes, a former State Department official; Morry Taylor, a tire manufacturer, and Representative Robert K. Dornan of California -- were barely registering in the polls.
"As I sit here today," said John P. Stabile, the state Republican Party chairman, "I would not want to bet a nickel on who might win -- and, usually, I have a good sense. Buchanan's people are maniacal. Dole's people are large and well-organized. And Lamar's people, though they were slow getting together, they seem to have been reinvigorated."
The most pronounced substantive shift in the final hours of the race has come from Mr. Dole. After months of campaigning on his leadership skills and three-decade record in Congress, Mr. Dole is now reacting to Mr. Buchanan, who has been rising in the polls by making populist appeals to the economic anxieties of workers and by bashing international trade agreements.
Without citing Mr. Buchanan by name, Mr. Dole pressed his free-trade position, telling the workers in Rochester: "Building a wall around America is totally wrong. No one would share that view who's concerned about the future of this country." He warned the Cabletron workers that "your company is going to shrink" if protectionist trade policies are enacted.
Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, a moderate on social issues who withdrew from the Presidential race last year, endorsed Mr. Dole today and immediately took on Mr. Buchanan's trade proposals. He also accused Mr. Alexander of playing both sides on abortion.
The attacks seemed only to enliven Mr. Buchanan, who clearly relished the newfound attention as he was surrounded by a shoving, swirling mass of hundreds of reporters.
"I will look out for and defend the interests of Americans in all these trade negotiations," Mr. Buchanan said at a lumber yard in Barnstead, northeast of here. "I cannot understand why my Republican opponents go into their little mantra of protectionist isolationism every time we say we want to defend the interests of American workers and American businesses."
The frenzied debate today reflected a race that is more volatile and intense than Republicans say they have seen here in years. Some analysts said that with the close competition, a front-runner might not emerge on Tuesday.
"If the polls have any accuracy," said Robert Craig, a professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire, "it looks like we're going to have a first in that we're going to have three tightly grouped front-runners."
If that happens, the race could drag on far longer than many Republicans had imagined. Mr. Dole has the most at stake because he has long been viewed as the candidate to beat. And he raised expectations last week when he said he had to prevail in his New Hampshire campaign, his third try.
But even as their supporters fretted over the fluctuations in the polls, Mr. Dole, Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Alexander behaved like confident front-runners.
"If we break through in New Hampshire," Mr. Buchanan said, "they're not going to be able to stop us."
Mr. Alexander said: "My own sixth sense of politics tells me it's a very tight race and, however it comes out, I'm going to be doing very well because people are going to be looking at a weakened Dole with no ideas at all."
And Mr. Dole, winding up at the torchlight march, tried to set his sights beyond Tuesday. "One candidate," he said, "and only one candidate, can bring our party together and beat Bill Clinton."
 "And Mr. Dole, winding up at the torchlight march, tried to set his sights beyond Tuesday. 'One candidate,' he said, 'and only one candidate, can bring our party together and beat Bill Clinton.' "

HEADLINE: Small Travel Agencies Face Hard Times Under Fee Cap

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
Mary Hogan, the owner of a tiny three-person travel agency in Cambridge, Mass., thought she was ready for anything in the notoriously fickle travel business. "I survived the gulf war," she said, "when not a soul was traveling anywhere."
But she did not survive the decision made a year ago by the airline industry to limit the normal 10 percent commissions on domestic travel to no more than $50 a ticket. She closed up shop last April, shortly after the cap went into effect. 
 "When my income went down and my overhead didn't, I had the business sense to know to get out," Ms. Hogan said. "As we speak today I know five other people who are closing their agencies. The small, independent agency is an endangered species."
That may be an exaggeration, but clearly something is amiss. Last year, even though overall travel revenues were up and the number of agents grew, 1,550 full-service travel agencies went out of business. That is 53 percent more than in 1994, according to figures compiled by the Airlines Reporting Corporation, the clearinghouse for funds between airlines and travel agencies. Many of those were replaced by new agencies springing up elsewhere, for a total of 33,600. But single-office locations -- most of them the traditional mom-and-pop shops that have long been the mainstay of the industry -- fell by 1.3 percent.
Moreover, the longer the cap has been in effect, the more agencies are going out of business. Travel Weekly magazine reported 484 full-service agency closings in the fourth quarter of last year, compared with 407 such closings in the third quarter of 1995 and 340 in the second quarter. There were only 290 closings during the fourth quarter of 1994.
"Many small agencies struggled all year to hang on," said Lauraday Kelley, president of the Association of Retail Travel Agents. "When you'll really see closings and mergers is later this year, when leases and contracts with customers expire."
Others echoed that view. "Lots of people in the industry think we'll see a drastic number of people calling it quits in the next few months," said Paul Rudin, senior vice president of industry affairs for the American Society of Travel Agents.
The majority of agencies do less than $2 million in business annually. Most of them see themselves as under siege from almost every side: from the imminent opening of a prototype Wal-Mart Travel agency in Roanoke, Va., to the spread of travel and reservation services onto the Internet. And with the savings airlines already achieved last year by capping domestic flights -- commissions fell 3 percent to $3.69 billion -- carriers are now talking about whether they can get away with capping commissions on international flights as well.
No wonder, travel agents say, that so many smaller agencies have decided to call it quits.
Stephen and Ruthie Dukkony of Annapolis, Md., were travel agents for 17 years before recently concluding there was little future as an independent agency for their Annapolis Travel. Three months ago, they sold it to Travelogue, a small chain based in Washington, although they continue to run the agency.
"In the past we used the 10 percent commission we made on fares over $500 to offset the money we lost writing low-priced fares," Mr. Dukkony said. The caps "pushed us over the edge."
Although about one-third of agencies charge service fees or say they plan to do so, small agencies fear that fees will drive away customers. Even giant American Express withdrew its $20 fee on airline tickets priced less than $300.
When Delta Air Lines began the stampede by airlines to cap agency commissions last February, the driving force was clearly economics. Delta, in its bid to cut a total of $2 billion in operating costs in little more than two years, argued it had little choice but to seek savings from commissions, its third-biggest expense after salaries and fuel. Delta's commissions to travel agents fell $157 million last year, or 12.5 percent, to $1.1 billion. During the fourth quarter of last year, Delta's commission payments plummeted 17 percent compared with the comparable period a year earlier.
The only hope for the agencies of lifting the cap is to win a class-action lawsuit against AMR's American Airlines, Continental Airlines, Delta, Northwest Airlines, UAL's United Airlines and USAir. The suit contends that the carriers conspired to impose the caps. The jury trial -- from which Trans World Airlines was dropped as a defendant last spring when it restored the full 10 percent commission -- is tentatively scheduled for the fall in the United States District Court in Minneapolis.
"Because it's in litigation, we don't have any comment on the cap," said Jackie Pate, a Delta spokeswoman.
To blunt the impact of commission caps, many agents have diversified into specialty markets and into booking more tours, hotels, rental cars and cruises. Results appear mixed.
Hotel commissions more than doubled last year, to $74 million. But only about 300 agencies out of an estimated 10,000 responded to an offer by Carnival Cruises to increase commissions for bookings from those who had not done business with the cruise line before. That was "far fewer than we expected," said Tim Gallagher, a Carnival spokesman.
Still, many surviving travel agencies are optimistic. Northwestern Travel Service, a large Minneapolis agency, spent a good part of last year renegotiating contracts with its commercial accounts, at a cost to its bottom line. "But our clients are now paying more attention to what services we offer them, and finding them worth the price," said Arthur I. Dahl, Northwestern's president.
While acknowledging that the commission caps hurt, Mark Mancini, an industry consultant in Los Angeles, also sees vast opportunities for travel agents as opinion brokers.
"You can access the best fare from New York to Paris, but try finding how far it is to Monet's gardens at Giverny," he said. "What travel agents can do best is tell you what planes have more legroom and what airline has better food."
Meanwhile, newcomers are still coming into the business, although at a slower pace than before.
Faye DiGirolamo opened Paradise Travel Ltd. in Kansas City, Mo., after having worked as an independent agent for a dozen years. "Even with all the drawbacks, I love the business," he said, "I never intend to be in another one the rest of my life."

Wrong Turn: Swords Into Plowshares

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BUDAPEST

 BODY:
For decades, Hungary was the powerhouse of Olympic fencing, bringing home more gold in that sport than any other. Their male duelers were virtually invincible.
Then politics, of the Soviet kind, intervened. The Hungarians had to share with the Russians their secrets of balance, distance, footwork and blade work, as well as the ability to coordinate them all into a rhythmic movement. With the help of exiled Hungarian coaches, the Germans started to improve and the Italians, always talented, got better. 
 Now, it's hard for the Hungarians to remain dominant the fencing team's senior coach, Tamas Kovacs, conceded above the din of clashing steel blades during a team practice.
"More and more nations are joining fencing and more and more are developing on the world stage," said Kovacs, whose father was one of Hungary's repeat gold medalists in the saber class.
Like most sports in Central Europe in the post-Communist era, fencing, even though it is Hungary's glory, is strapped for money. Fencers are no longer handed a job with a decent salary where they don't have to work, Kovacs said. His national team members now receive a monthly stipend from the Government that is only enough for two tanks of gasoline for their cars. There is no prize money from the Government for victories abroad.
These days, Hungary's best hopes are not with their male swordsmen but with the women, who are world champions in the epee class.
Internationally, fencing was considered an arcane sport, usually practiced by an elite group with access to the money needed for expensive and hard-to-get equipment. But the sport, based on the dueling of centuries ago and romanticized by sword play in Errol Flynn movies, has begun to catch on in the United States. About 150,000 Americans belong to 800 fencing clubs, according to the United States Fencing Association.
For first-time spectators, one of the most striking attributes of fencing is the age of its champions. Compared with many other sports, fencers are golden oldies -- in their late 20's -- by the time they reach their peak. This is in part because fencing relies as much, if not more, on mental shrewdness as it does on physical prowess. Like boxing, tactics are crucial.
Take the 25-year-old Gyorgyi Szalay, who is training in the epee for Atlanta. Even she is a little young, by Kovacs's standards at least. "The best age is 28 to 30," he said. "By that time you have the maturity in the head and the body."
Szalay, relatively tall (5 feet 10 3/4 inches) and not slim (143 pounds), describes competition this way. "It's 60 percent brain work and 40 percent physical work," she said. "If you take two equal competitors, what will decide who is champion is who is stronger psychologically."
At the world championships at The Hague last July, Szalay said, she and her partner, Timea Nagy, defeated the Japanese team through sheer mental stamina. "They were ahead, 40-35, and then we won by 45-40," Szalay said. "At the point we broke even I was coming on stronger psychologically."
Indeed, Kovacs refers to Szalay as the brains of the team. It doesn't matter that she is slightly slower on her feet than some of her teammates.
Nagy, also 25, is lighter (123 pounds) and shorter (5-10), and as a result, she is the speedster.
"They represent different styles," Kovacs said. "This is good for a team because if they are all the same, it is easier for an opponent to figure out the vulnerabilities. There are national teams where the competitors are the same, but the results are not good."
In Hungary, fencers generally start at age 10. By then they are old enough to wield the weapons but young enough not to be absorbed completely by other sports, Kovacs said. Young fencers are encouraged to dabble in some other sports so that their legs and shoulders don't become overdeveloped as they develop physically.
Szalay recalls first fencing at age 8 when she wandered into the local club that happened to be close to her home. Now, as the Olympics loom, she trains 12 hours a week -- much less than swimmers, for example -- and is serious about her university studies in economics. "You can't do fencing for such a long time," Szalay said during a break between matches. "It's not a monotonous type of sport which only involves physical work."
She held her helmet, a kind of wired cage in one hand, and her weapon, attached to an electronic wire, in the other. She was dressed in a white sweatshirt of heavy protective material, white breeches and white leather gloves, a uniform reminiscent of the days when tennis was whites-only. Szalay said she had just heard that competitors at Atlanta can, for the first time in the Olympics, wear uniforms with colors. "I think I will stick with white and hope my opponents won't be wearing something designed by Vaserily," she said, referring to the Italian artist whose work features patterns with pointillist dots.
Fencing's three classes are the saber, the foil and the epee. In epee, all of the body can be touched by the opponent's weapon; in foil only the torso, and in saber the upper body. (Saber is a male-only sport.)
Since the 1956 Olympic Games, the foil and epee classes of fencing are judged electronically -- every time a fencer touches an opponent with the tip of the weapon in the correct target area, a circuit is completed, a buzzer sounds and a light goes on on the scoreboard.
Hungary's drooping financial support for fencing keeps the sport struggling to keep abreast of Western countries where the fencing tradition is not so deep but the equipment is now more plentiful. In Italy and France there are now weapons specially designed for children, an innovation that the Hungarians cannot afford.
The insignia of a prominent Hungarian bank, OTP, adorns the walls of the training hall here, but the bank's financial support is spent on organization and travel, not on incentives for players, Kovacs said. But even the bank's support is not sufficient.
Italy and Germany, Kovacs said, have made great progress in part because of lucrative prize money.
When he requests more financial support from the Government, he is politely told how proud the nation is of the fencing results and then brushed off.
Under those circumstances, Kovacs said he was hoping for slightly better than the medal cache at the world championships when he was "pleased but not very pleased." There, the Hungarians won one gold (women's epee team), one silver (women's epee individual) and two bronze (men's saber team and men's epee team).
"We can only stay in the front line of world fencing if we create a professional system," Kovacs said. "For the sport to survive it is essential to have prizes so it attracts the best people."

 CORRECTION:
A sports article on Tuesday about the Hungarian fencing team misspelled the surname and native country of an artist cited by one fencer stating her preference for the design of their uniforms. He is Victor Vasarely, not Vaserily; he is from Hungary, not Italy.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
ORLEY ASHENFELTER, the Princeton University economist who regularly upsets the wine establishment with his unorthodox approach to judging vintages, has completed a new classification of California cabernet sauvignons.
His method is similar to the most famous of all wine rankings, the 1855 classification of the wines of Bordeaux: it is based not on tasting and sniffing, the traditional tools of wine experts, but on the prices of mature wines at auction. 
 For the California wines, his ranking is based on prices that the wines attained at auctions during 1995 in San Francisco, Chicago and New York. The youngest wines were from the 1985 vintage, the oldest from 1968. Some 2,000 transactions were involved.
To make his comparisons, Mr. Ashenfelter chose one wine as a benchmark: Beaulieu Vineyards Private Reserve. It is, he said, "the most commonly sold mature premium California wine."
The prices of the other wines in his ranking are expressed as a percentage of the price of the Beaulieu Vineyards wine from the same vintage.
The top wine in his new classification was Caymus Vineyards Special Selection. With the Beaulieu Private Reserve rated at 100, the Caymus wine's rating was 366. Second was Opus I, the wine produced in the Napa Valley by the combined efforts of the Robert Mondavi Winery and Chateau Mouton-Rothschild in Bordeaux. Its price as a percentage of the Beaulieu Private Reserve was 242. Third was Stag's Leap Wine Cellars Cask 23, with a rating of 239.
Rounding out the top five were Dunn Vineyards Howell Mountain, with 215, and Heitz Cellars Martha's Vineyard, with 206.
The next five, in order, were Spottswoode Vineyard Napa, with 172; Ridge Vineyards Monte Bello, with 155; Silver Oak Cellars Napa, with 150; Dunn Vineyards Napa, with 142 and Beringer Vineyards Reserve Napa with 141.
All wines in the top 10 were grown and produced in the Napa Valley except the Ridge Monte Bello, which comes from a mountain vineyard in Santa Clara County.
Five years ago, in a ranking of cabernets from 1958 through 1982, Heitz Cellars Martha's Vineyard was first, Cask 23 was second and the Monte Bello third. Fourth and fifth were Joseph Phelps Vineyards Insignia and the Jordan Vineyard and Winery's Alexander Valley. Five years later, the Phelps Insignia had slipped to 14th place and the Jordan to 24th.
In the 1991 rating, Caymus, which is now far ahead of any competitor, was in 13th place with its regular Napa Valley issue. The Special Selection, which normally sells for $100 or more a bottle, apparently was not yet a presence in auction sales. Nor, similarly, were Opus I and Dunn Howell Mountain.
In the 1991 rating, nine wines sold for more than Beaulieu Vineyards Private Reserve. In the current ranking, 17 wines demand higher prices than the benchmark.
"It would be tempting," Mr. Ashenfelter said, "to suggest that the B.V. Private Reserve had slipped, but a look at our price listings shows that this is not the case. The benchmark simply has more competition at the top end of the market."
Mr. Ashenfelter ranks 19 wines below the Beaulieu Private Reserve, beginning with Duckhorn Vineyards Napa, with a comparative rating of 99 and dropping down to Charles Krug Winery's Vintage Select, with a rating of 33. It is in this group of wines, Mr. Ashenfelter said, that the best bargains are likely to be found at wine auctions. He mentions, among others, Sterling Vineyard Reserve wines from the 1970's, Freemark Abbey Bosche, Clos du Val and other bottlings from Heitz Cellars, Ridge Vineyards, Joseph Phelps and Robert Mondavi.
Auction prices for well-known mature wines are invariably higher than younger versions of the same wines at retail. But almost without exception, the top wines at auctions are also very expensive when new. The top 10 on the Ashenfelter list retail for $45 to $100 a bottle. As Mr. Ashenfelter notes in his commentary on the rankings, it is almost impossible to find a bottle of California cabernet for under $25 that can be matured for a decade or more.
Mr. Ashenfelter notes that while more than half of all mature California wine sold at auction in this country is sold by Butterfield & Butterfield in San Francisco, prices of the same wines sold at auctions in Chicago and New York are much cheaper. His advice to collectors: "Sell your California wines in San Francisco. If your are looking for bargains, bid on the relatively small number of California wines offered in the catalogues of the Chicago and New York auction houses."
He is somewhat elitist when it comes to what to buy. "Stick to wines from the Napa and Alexander Valley," he advises. "Although a few wines from the Sonoma appellation have entered our list of top wines, just as many have departed."
He forgets that Ridge Monte Bello figures prominently in all his lists. And of course, the Alexander Valley is in Sonoma.
Mr. Ashenfelter asserts that while prices vary somewhat from vintage to vintage, "it is important to recognize that while it may exist, the role of vintage variability is far smaller in California than it is in Europe." More than a few California growers might disagree.
Based purely on the prices they bring, 1968 and 1970 are the most desirable California vintages in the last three decades. The 1974's and 1978's follow close behind. Of more recent releases, 1985 stands out, with 1984 highly regarded, too.
Mr. Ashenfelter tracks the auction prices of all these wines, as well as the wines of Bordeaux and Burgundy, in his newsletter, Liquid Assets, which is published at 169 Nassau Street, Department Q12, Princeton, N.J. 08542. A subscription costs $30 a year for two issues.
 
TASTINGS
Niebaum-Coppola Estate Rubicon 1990.
Napa Valley. About $35.
In 1975, when Francis Ford Coppola bought Inglenook, the Napa Valley home of Capt. Gustave Niebaum, he wanted to make the kind of wine that had been made there in Captain Niebaum's time -- great cabernet. By almost all accounts, he has done just that. Officially, Rubicon is just a red table wine blend, one that isn't necessarily 75 percent cabernet sauvignon, which by law it would have to be to use the name. But in practice, in some years it contains as much as 95 percent cabernet. Rubicon is often a tough, tannic wine when it's young. It's always packed with flavor; it just needs time to come around. Recognizing this, Mr. Coppola and his wine maker, Scott McLeod, have held back some vintages for up to seven years before releasing them. This 1990 is a big, assertive wine. It's good now; in 10 more years, it will be great.

HEADLINE: West Side Project Has Many Opponents

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "On Riverside South, It's Time to Break Ground" (letter, Feb. 17): Edward J. Malloy is wrong that "Representative Jerrold L. Nadler stands virtually alone" in opposing the project. Every West Side Democratic Party district leader, city and state legislator stands with Mr. Nadler in questioning the wisdom of the developer Donald Trump's proposal. 
 There are good reasons. The proposed mammoth buildings would dwarf the already overdeveloped neighborhood, exacerbating pedestrian and vehicular congestion and worsening our dirty air and diminished light. Moreover, the 5,700 apartments would further strain the inadequate sewage system that barely services the West Side now.
Good urban planning requires that environmental and economic concerns be addressed. That is why we stand with Mr. Nadler in stressing environmentally sound development -- to meet our needs as a growing community without compromising our health, safety or quality of life.

The New Cynics

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH; Thomas L. Friedman is on vacation.

 BODY:
Since my household is not yet protected by the V-chip, I could not prevent Simon, who is 11, from stealing glimpses of the G.O.P. bloodbath in New Hampshire. But when I caught him red-handed over the weekend watching a Steve Forbes rally on C-Span, he had an airtight excuse: He was reporting a story.
For two years Simon has been a reporter for Children's Express, the national organization that trains kids to gather news and disseminate it through syndicated columns and broadcast media. For a Presidents' Day appearance on National Public Radio's "Talk of the Nation," Simon and other C.E. reporters (as they call themselves) had been assigned to find out their peers' view of Presidential politics. 
 Simon had asked some 30 contemporaries if they wanted to grow up to be President -- and found only two who said yes. He agreed with the disenchanted majority and saw little on TV to dissuade him from his negative view of politicians. "In their speeches I can't tell their opinion of stuff," he said. "They just say how good they are and that they're going to do good for America." The next day on the radio only one child -- Izetta Mobley, 14, of Washington -- wanted to grow up to be President, but even she was turned off by the mudslinging of New Hampshire. "It makes us very cynical," she said. "It makes us not want to find out anything about politics."
When I was 14 and growing up in Washington, I'd never heard of cynicism. The Presidents of my youth, Ike and J.F.K., were role models, even if one of those Presidents was something less than a patron saint in a family of Adlai Stevenson partisans. Role model is hardly the part that Bill Clinton was born to play. And the Republicans who yearn to replace him can't even fake it. The conventional adult wisdom about last week's televised debate was that the candidates all behaved like 11-year-olds, but if you met Simon and his friends, you'd see what an insult that is -- to children, not politicians.
The tragedy of the G.O.P. campaign is that it actually boasted a potential hero -- Mr. Dole. But for all his rhetoric about undertaking one final mission for his country, he slept through the alarm once the battle had to be fought -- when his country, not to mention his party, needed him to stand up to Pat Buchanan.
Unlike any candidate of either party, Mr. Buchanan is addressing the economic fears of middle-class Americans in the era of downsizing -- albeit with the false panacea of xenophobic protectionism. Rather than acknowledge such fears as genuine and offer positive proposals of his own, Mr. Dole at first wanly mimicked his opponent's populist rhetoric, then retreated entirely with out-of-it expressions of surprise that jobs had become a campaign issue.
On the cultural front, Mr. Dole lacks the courage to take on Mr. Buchanan's courtship of the bigot vote. Imagine if the Senator had forcefully challenged him during the debate on his views about women, blacks, immigrants, the Jewish "amen corner" and homosexuals -- playing Joseph Welch, if you will, to Mr. Buchanan's Joe McCarthy. Instead Mr. Dole made a Nixonesque joke about a photo of his dog.
As the Senator disappeared on primary eve to hide from TV interviewers, he might have done well to consult a powerful new memoir, now circulating in galleys and due out this spring, by a Republican who has loomed large in New Hampshire, former Senator Warren Rudman. In the book, titled "Combat," Mr. Rudman enthusiastically supports Mr. Dole for the Presidency. Like Mr. Dole, he is "classically conservative" and a war hero (of Korea). Unlike Mr. Dole, Mr. Rudman is willing to engage in eloquent peacetime combat to advance patriotic causes that include deficit reduction, campaign reform and the defeat of what he calls the "repugnant" social agenda of "self-commissioned Christian soldiers" taking over his party.
But Mr. Rudman is in private life now, soon to be joined by former colleagues he admires, like Bill Cohen, Bill Bradley, Sam Nunn and Nancy Kassebaum. The surrogate hero he backs for President was missing in action in New Hampshire. Given this spectacle, what American of any age wouldn't be turned off? If we are to rescue our children from permanent cynicism, we must insist that they forsake the campaign at once for more wholesome TV fare. "Beavis and Butt-head," maybe, or "Jenny Jones."

HEADLINE: Jobs and Environment Aren't in Conflict

 BODY:
To the Editor
Your Feb. 15 front-page article on layoffs in the Eastern coal fields provides an instructive lesson on the extent of the "jobs versus environment" trade-off. 
 Around 600 coal miners a year, across a multistate region, have lost their jobs over a five-year period as electric utilities switched to low-sulfur Western coal to meet clean air standards.
At the national level, however, there is no trade-off between jobs and the environment. Jobs created from environmental spending offset those lost in industries bearing higher regulatory costs.
Job losses in manufacturing as a direct result of environmental regulation have been small compared with other sources of job loss; around 1,000 to 2,000 jobs a year in the late 1980's.
This pales in comparison to layoffs from, for example, AT&T-style corporate downsizing.
Few manufacturing companies are relocating overseas because of strict environmental regulations in the United States. More than a dozen studies have tried to find evidence for the so-called pollution haven hypothesis, but none have succeeded.
The jobs-versus-environment trade-off is most severe in rural, extractive industries, like logging and coal mining, because relatively large numbers of good jobs are at stake, and because of the resource-dependent nature of the communities affected. This kind of trade-off is atypical. At the national level, jobs and the environment are not in conflict.

HEADLINE: Citing Crackdown on Dissidents, Cuban Group Cancels Conference

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Feb. 20

 BODY:
A coalition of Cuban dissident and human rights groups has canceled plans to hold a conference here this weekend, citing what they called "a wave of repression" by the state security apparatus against the organizers of the event, which would have been the first of its kind.
In a statement made available to reporters here, six of the main leaders of Concilio Cubano, as the recently formed group is known, said they canceled the conference because of "the imprisonment of numerous dissidents and acts of harassment against others." 
 They also said that state security officers had searched the homes of some members of the organization, which advocates free and democratic elections and respect for human rights.
The organization's leaders and diplomats here said that at least 28 of the group's members have been arrested as part of a crackdown on dissidents over the last week, including a group of 10 today and 4 of the 5 members of Concilio Cubano's steering committee. The fifth person is said to be in hiding, and at least one of those already in custody is reported to have begun a hunger strike.
The United States has condemned the arrests, saying they "exposed the truth about claims by the Cuban Government that any semblance of freedom of speech and association exists in Cuba today." A State Department declaration called on the Cuban Government to "release these defenders of human rights, to cease its campaign of harassment" against them and "to accede to this organization's reasonable requests."
Concilio Cubano was formed last year by some 130 human rights, dissident and unofficial professional groups. Its members include several of Cuba's best-known human rights campaigners, as well as organizations that have developed ties with democratic political parties abroad and independent associations that represent economists and lawyers.
The group's steering committee wrote a letter in late December to the Council of State, the Cuban Government's supreme body, formally requesting permission to hold the conference. Though the Government acknowledged receiving the request, the group's leaders said, it still has not issued a formal written reply.
In its request, a copy of which was made available to reporters, Concilio Cubano said it was seeking to hold "a plural, democratic and constructive encounter."
In the absence of a response, the group had gone ahead with plans to hold its first national congress, and had organized 14 study commissions to examine various aspects of Cuban life. But on Friday, a lieutenant colonel from the Ministry of the Interior contacted Gustavo Arcos Bergnes, Secretary General of the Cuban Committee for Human Rights, and told him that the meeting would not be permitted, according to the statement issued by the group.
Last month, an official delegation from the European Union, led by Manuel Marin of Spain, visited Cuba and urged Cuban officials to permit the conference to be held, according to diplomats here. The Latin American Association of Christian Democratic parties made a similar appeal, and had asked for visas to attend the conference as observers.
While here, the European delegation also met with leaders of Concilio Cubano at the home of the Italian Ambassador, diplomats said. The European Union began talks about an economic agreement with Cuba last November, and has been hoping to use the prospect of more favorable trading and investment ties to encourage a more open political atmosphere here.
"This shows that internal security considerations predominate over all international considerations," a diplomat here said. "It's very discouraging for anyone who has hopes of a peaceful transition or of increasing political space."

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Roundup;
Justices Reconsider Law Requiring Cable TV to Carry Local Stations' Signals

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20

 BODY:
In a case with important First Amendment implications for Government regulation of communications, the Supreme Court agreed today to review a 1992 Federal law that requires cable television systems to retransmit the signals of local broadcast television stations.
The cable industry has fought the requirement as an unconstitutional interference with editorial discretion, a form of compelled speech that under Supreme Court precedent would clearly violate the First Amendment if applied to require a newspaper to carry material that its editors did not want to print. 
 Broadcasters sought and have defended the "must carry" rule, as the requirement is known, as necessary for the survival of at least some stations that would otherwise be dropped by cable systems and thus be cut off from the nearly two-thirds of American households that now do their television-watching by means of a cable connection.
The case is before the Supreme Court for the second time. In June 1994, a bare majority endorsed the general economic theory behind the law, the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act: that the role of cable as a "bottleneck or gatekeeper," as Justice Anthony M. Kennedy described it in his opinion for the Court, creates a potential for abuse that could result in fewer choices being available to television viewers.
But rather than uphold the law at that time, the 5-to-4 majority voted instead to send the case back for further review before a special panel of three Federal judges. The special court, authorized by Congress to provide a speedy constitutional review of a law with evident constitutional vulnerabilities, had initially upheld the must-carry provision in 1993 and upheld it again two months ago. The cable industry then brought the new Supreme Court appeal.
The case, which will not be argued until next fall, reaches the Court at a time of change and ferment in communications law, with First Amendment issues at the forefront. On Wednesday, the Justices will hear arguments in a constitutional challenge to a separate Federal law, intended to curb access to sexually explicit programming on certain cable channels. And the new Telecommunications Act of 1996, an overhaul of current law that President Clinton signed earlier this month, is already under attack in Federal court for provisions regulating indecency.
While these cases raise distinct issues, they have in common the need for the Court to settle on an appropriate standard of review for the constitutional issues presented. In its earlier ruling on the must-carry provision, the Court selected an intermediate standard of review for regulation of cable television: more searching scrutiny than would be applied to broadcast television, but well short of the strict scrutiny that bars most Government regulation of the print media.
Now the Court must give some content to the general prescriptions of the 1994 ruling by deciding whether the economic evidence the lower court considered about the effect of cable on the health of broadcast television was weighty enough to meet the standard of review.
The lower court concluded that in the absence of the must-carry provision, substantial numbers of broadcast stations would lose the cable audience and would decline or fail as a result. In its appeal, Turner Broadcasting v. Federal Communications Commission, No. 95-992, the cable industry is arguing that this concern amounts to protectionism and reflects an impermissible judicial endorsement of the proposition that "more broadcast stations is always a good thing."
The makeup of the Court has changed in a potentially significant way since its initial consideration of the must-carry provision. Justice Harry A. Blackmun, a member of the 5-to-4 majority in 1994, has retired, and his successor, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who tends to analyze Government regulation from an economic perspective, may well take a more skeptical view of the desirability and efficacy of the regulation in this case.
The very fact that the Court decided on a second, full-dress review of the case suggests that the Justices were not satisfied with their 1994 ruling as the last word. Under the special appellate review provisions Congress attached to the law, the Court could have decided the case summarily, upholding the lower court in a brief order without a full opinion. The Clinton Administration, joined by the broadcast industry, urged the Justices to take that course.
There were also these other developments at the Court today:
 
 Sentencing Appeal
There were numerous allusions to the history of a case that was argued before the Court today on appellate review of sentencing, but essentially no discussion of the actual facts of the case: an appeal by the two Los Angeles police officers convicted after a Federal trial of violating Rodney G. King's civil rights by beating him in a violent arrest in 1991. Their lawyers were arguing that a Federal appeals court erred by setting aside the lenient sentences they received.
While the Federal sentencing guidelines called for the two men, Stacey C. Koon and Laurence M. Powell, to receive 70 to 87 months in prison, Judge John G. Davies of Federal District Court in Los Angeles imposed a sentence of only 30 months. Judge Davies cited several factors to justify what is known under the guidelines as a "downward departure," including the "specter of unfairness" from the Federal prosecution that followed a state criminal prosecution in which the men were acquitted.
In a 1994 ruling, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, found the factors Judge Davies relied on to be impermissible, and ordered the sentences recalculated. Mr. Koon and Mr. Powell, who have been released from prison, were both in the courtroom today, but face renewed imprisonment if the Court upholds the Ninth Circuit and if they eventually receive increased sentences.
The question for the Court in the case, Koon v. U.S., No. 94-1664, is the degree of deference an appellate court should give to a trial judge's selection of factors warranting a lower sentence than the guidelines provide. Perhaps reflecting a widespread dislike of the sentencing guidelines among Federal judges, the Justices did not appear particularly receptive to the Administration's view, presented by a Deputy Solicitor General, Michael R. Dreeben, that trial judges should receive little if any deference on appeal if they vary from the guidelines.
 
 Right to Die
Without comment, the Justices turned down an appeal in a case from Michigan that could have given the Court an opportunity to elaborate on a question it has addressed only tentatively: whether states are obliged as a matter of constitutional due process to defer to a person's wishes, as understood by a legal guardian or other surrogate decision maker, not to be kept alive by artificial means.
The case was an appeal by the wife of a man whose catastrophic neurological injuries in a 1987 car accident left him paralyzed, unable to communicate, and fed through a tube. Her request to allow him to die, based on his often-stated desire before the accident never to be kept alive to live "like a vegetable," was supported by the hospital's bioethics committee, a probate judge, and a state appellate court. But the Michigan Supreme Court ruled last year that because the man was not technically in a vegetative state, his earlier statements were inapplicable. The case is Martin v. Major, No. 95-821.
 
 Ten Commandments
Also without comment, the Court refused to hear an appeal challenging Colorado's display of the Ten Commandments, carved in stone on a four-foot-high monument in a park adjacent to the state Capitol in Denver. Local members of the Freedom From Religion Foundation, a group based in Wisconsin, had sued the state on the ground that the monument violated the constitutional separation of church and state.
A lower state court agreed, but the Colorado Supreme Court overturned that decision in a 4-to-3 ruling last June, finding that the monument was part of a permissible display of various historical monuments and artifacts that celebrated "the cultural tapestry that is Colorado." The case is Freedom From Religion v. Colorado, No. 95-527.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Hong Kong and Singapore Vow To Join Japan in Monetary Steps

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 20

 BODY:
Monetary authorities in Hong Kong and Singapore have agreed to intervene in their currency markets on behalf of Japan, an arrangement that will give Tokyo a new weapon in resisting the rise of the yen, Japanese officials said today.
While the long-term effectiveness of the new arrangement remains to be seen, the announcement -- as well as reports that Japan's central bank was buying dollars for yen in the foreign-exchange markets -- bolstered the value of the dollar, sending it up by more than 2 yen in Asian trading. The dollar's advance faded in European trading. 
 [In New York late Tuesday, the dollar pared its gains to end the day at 105.75 yen, up from 105.20 on Friday. The dollar slipped to 1.4473 marks, from 1.4535. The British pound fell to $1.5450 from $1.5520 on Friday. Financial markets in the United States were closed Monday.]
Under today's agreement, the authorities in Hong Kong and Singapore will buy or sell currencies in their markets at Japan's request, using Japanese central bank funds.
A senior Japanese Finance Ministry official said Japan wanted to increase cooperation with other Asian nations because these countries were becoming increasingly important in world trade and currency markets. "They cannot be excluded anymore," the official said.
Today's announcement, currency-market analysts said, raised the possibility of powerful coordinated Asian actions.
C. H. Kwan, an economist at the Nomura Research Institute, said the agreements were part of a broader trend toward cooperation among monetary authorities in East Asia.
The Hong Kong and Singapore currency markets are substantial. Their combined turnover equals that of the New York market, Finance Ministry officials said. The foreign-exchange reserves of Asia, Australia and New Zealand accounted for 42 percent of the world's total in 1994.
Japan has been trying to lower the exchange value of the yen as part of an effort to revive its economy by making exports more competitive. Toward this end, the central bank has cooperated with the American Federal Reserve in buying dollars.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Atlanta's Real Summer Games

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., Feb. 20

 BODY:
For the first time since the night they won the World Series, Bobby Cox gathered all of his players in the Atlanta Braves' clubhouse today. With suntan lotion substituting for Champagne, the manager issued a warning.
"All this nonsense you read about conceding the division to us, and everybody else is playing for a wild card, is a bunch of beans," Cox said, substituting a couple of clubhouse-type words in spots. "We don't throw our names up on the wall and win." 
 But with names like Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz, Mark Wohlers, Fred McGriff, David Justice, Marquis Grissom, Chipper Jones and Ryan Klesko, the Braves do pose a problem for the other teams in the National League East. Some members of those teams have already remarked that, realistically, they have to set their sights on the wild-card spot this year because how on earth could they possibly expect to knock the Braves from the division's No. 1 spot?
It is those comments that Cox addressed on the day of the Braves' first full-squad spring workout, and it is that perception that he will try to dispel throughout the spring and the summer. Once his players start believing in the perception, Cox knows, they will be ripe for removal as King of the N.L. East Mountain.
"You're going to have great memories from '95, but we have to get our game faces on and crank it up again," he told the players. "We have an owner who wants to see us do it again. And how are we going to do it again? We're going to do it with hard work and pulling for each other and picking each other up. Certainly the talent's here to get the job done."
Five members of the Braves' championship team are gone, though no key members, meaning five new players will be on the roster opening day. One fellow Cox doesn't want lurking in the clubhouse is the one named Complacency.
"I used that word a lot," Cox said after his meeting with the players, offering excerpts from his address: " 'It's just a word that will not exist here. We won't let it happen because I know each one of you well enough to know that you do want another championship. That's why we're in this uniform. And our owner, I've never seen him so happy. He's really, really pleased.' "
Ted Turner was not on hand to see his troops run around the field and take their first swings of the spring. Until they get to the post-season, he generally follows them -- closely, Cox said -- from a distance because he has so many other business matters to occupy his time. But with Turner's economic blessing, General Manager John Schuerholz and Cox have assembled the best team in baseball.
Even so, Cox and his players rejected the idea that the Mets, Marlins, Phillies and Expos have already conceded -- or should concede -- the Braves their fifth straight division championship.
"I wouldn't concede nothing," the manager said. "I'd never say that."
Nor would Glavine, who allowed only one hit in eight innings in the Braves' 1-0 victory over the Cleveland Indians in the sixth and clinching game of the World Series.
"People can say all they want -- we're the team to beat, we're the best team," Glavine said. "But that's all just talk. You still have to go out and play the games."
But what hope could Glavine and his teammates give those other teams, teams they outdistanced by 21 games last season? If they really believe their division rivals have a chance to unseat them, at least give them a clue about how it might happen.
"Maybe there are some teams out there that are surprising," Glavine said, "like we were in '91."
There it is -- 1991, a season cited by other players besides Glavine.
"We had no chance to do anything and we went to the World Series," Smoltz said. "Baseball is a great sport in that you can be the best team on paper, but if you don't get the job done on the field, it doesn't matter."
On July 7, 1991, the Los Angeles Dodgers, with a 49-31 record, led the Braves (39-40) by nine and a half games. When the season ended, the Braves were the champions of what was then the N.L. West. They edged the Dodgers by one game, running out the rest of the season with a 55-28 record, compared with the Dodgers' 44-38.
"Everything fell into place," Smoltz said. "We got the breaks. Guys filling in had career years. When you look at championship teams, you'll see guys having career years."
So if the Mets, say, are to topple the Braves, Lance Johnson, Bernard Gilkey and Todd Hundley, for example, would have to have career years. It wouldn't be difficult for Bill Pulsipher, Jason Isringhausen and Paul Wilson to have career years because they have had little or no major league careers.
A veteran leader or leaders could also help, the Braves said.
"We got some leaders -- Sid Bream and Terry Pendleton -- and we started believing," Smoltz said of a team that had become used to languishing in last place in the 1980's. "If I had experienced nothing but those losing teams, I'd say forget winning the division; let's play for something else. Now you look at those teams in our division, each team has enough leadership to get them to where they want to go. That's why when Terry Pendleton went over to the Marlins, we all said, hmmm, he might help them out more than we'd like."
Those leader type of players also have a function with the Braves. Second baseman Mark Lemke said they are the players who will keep the Braves from becoming overconfident, helping Cox in his quest to keep everyone's feet planted firmly on the ground and their minds focused sharply on the need to win the proverbial one game at a time.
"The leadership of the veterans, guys that have been here before, like Bream and Pendleton, rubs off," Lemke said. "Guys like Maddux come to work hard every day. They've won Cy Youngs, but you wouldn't know it the way they come in here and do their work."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Crude Oil Prices Rise Sharply On Lack of Agreement With Iraq

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices posted their sharpest one-day gain since the Persian Gulf war yesterday, while gold prices tumbled.
The surge in oil prices came after Iraqi and United Nations negotiators ended two weeks of talks on Monday without an agreement on a plan to allow Iraq limited oil sales to pay for food and medicine. The plan would have allowed Iraq to sell as much as $2 billion worth of oil over six months. 
 "Without the Iraqi thing hanging over our head, people are looking at how good demand is, and demand all over is up," said Jerry Samuels, managing director at ARB Oil Inc. in New York.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for March delivery jumped $1.89, to $21.05 a barrel, the highest price since March 4, 1993. It was the biggest one-day gain in an active contract since Jan. 26, 1991. The market was closed Monday in observance of Washington's birthday.
The March contract expired yesterday; the active April contract surged 87 cents, to $19.27 a barrel.
While traders still eventually expect an oil-sale agreement between Iraq and the United Nations, the apparent failure of the recent talks indicates that no Iraqi oil will come to market for months.
In the meantime, demand for crude oil from refineries is strong and oil stockpiles in the Midwest, where the futures contract specifies delivery, are at their lowest since the American Petroleum Institute began measuring them in 1987. Stockpiles in the nation's refining center on the Gulf of Mexico are also close to their lowest on record.
Gold prices plunged. Gold had been bolstered in part by hopes that economic weakness would prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. But testimony by Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, dashed those hopes yesterday. Mr. Greenspan told Congress that weakness in the economy was "likely to be temporary."
Mr. Greenspan's speech "was very bearish for gold," said Jim Steel, a vice president for commodities research at Refco Inc. in New York. "We have high interest rates in a low inflationary environment, and now, no prospects for further rate cuts."
The April gold contract fell as much as $8.30 on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange before recovering to end $6.40 lower at $401.10 an ounce, the lowest since Jan. 19.
On other commodities markets, wheat prices plunged following forecasts that rains would soak the winter wheat crop during the coming weeks, helping ease months of dry weather. The Commodity Research Bureau index of 17 commodities fell 0.51 point yesterday, to 249.64.

HEADLINE: Wife Recalls Subway Bomber's Obsessions

BYLINE: By DON VAN NATTA Jr. 

 BODY:
The wife of Edward J. Leary took the witness stand yesterday in her husband's defense, telling jurors how his behavior became increasingly bizarre and obsessive in the months and weeks leading up to two subway firebombings that he carried out 14 months ago.
The wife, Marge Schaller, a pediatric nurse, testified for the defense as Mr. Leary's lawyer began presenting their case in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. Mr. Leary, 50, is charged with attempted murder and assault in the two firebombings that injured 50 people in December 1994. 
 Although prosecutors say the explosions were part of a plot to extort money from the Transit Authority, Mr. Leary's lawyers, who do not dispute that he carried out the attacks, say his behavior stemmed from his use of a mix of drugs, including Prozac, prescribed to treat his growing depression.
In answering the questions of his defense lawyer, Robert Fogelnest, Ms. Schaller recalled how she watched in frustration as her unemployed husband failed to find another job as a computer technician after Merrill Lynch dismissed him in January 1994. At times, she said, it appeared as if he was not even trying to find work.
This lack of ambition was not the only change Ms. Schaller said she noticed in her husband. Instead of looking for work, she said, Mr. Leary devoted much of his time to strange, inexplicable activities.
For example, she said her husband spent many days, and some nights, rummaging through garbage cans and Dumpsters near their home in Scotch Plains, N.J. She said he brought home a variety of items: a dozen old suitcases, 12 car batteries, 5 rusty weight-lifting benches, shards of broken glass and discarded clothes and food. She said he spent many hours assembling a wooden model car, sanding and painting it over and over again.
Ms. Schaller also testified that Mr. Leary became obsessed with his physical appearance, often staring at himself in a mirror, trimming his hair three or four times a day and picking at blemishes on his face with a nail clipper.
When she pointed out his odd behavior to him, she said he replied: "It's O.K. I'm going to someone really good." The reference was to a psychiatrist named John Steven Weihs, who advertised his services in The Village Voice. Dr. Weihs had prescribed Prozac and a wide range of psychotropic drugs to Mr. Leary, she said, adding that her husband had complete confidence in him.
Mr. Fogelnest asked Ms. Schaller a series of questions seeking to show that the Leary family had not suffered from financial troubles in 1994, which prosecutors say was the motive for Mr. Leary's extortion plan.
She testified that they owned three apartments in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and two houses in New Jersey. "We weren't concerned about our finances," Ms. Schaller said. Mr. Leary, she said, even turned down a job offer during the summer months of 1994.
Throughout the day yesterday, Mr. Leary sat at the defense table, twiddling a pen between his fingers and looking impassively at his wife. Several times, their eyes met. Each time, Ms. Schaller smiled at Mr. Leary, but he quickly looked away.
During cross-examination, the prosecutor, Peter Casolaro, focused on statements that Ms. Schaller made about her husband's behavior several days after the Dec. 21, 1994, explosion. He tried to show jurors that she said her husband had not acted despondent or angry when she left for work that morning.
But Ms. Schaller said she could not recall what she had told reporters about her husband. "I was under extreme stress when I was having that press conference and I don't remember what I said or did not say," she said.
Mr. Casolaro also asked Ms. Schaller whether she had sought help for Mr. Leary or whether she felt her family was in danger. "I never thought we were in danger," she said. "In hindsight," she said, she wished that she had sought more help for her husband.
"Your husband is depressed, exhibiting bizarre behavior, and you did not find that was sufficient to take action?" Mr. Casolaro asked.
"No, I did not," she said.
In addition, Ms. Schaller said she had originally told reporters that her husband was not responsible for the subway explosions.
But in later questioning by defense lawyers, Ms. Schaller said that she believed that he had no role in the bombings because that is what Mr. Leary had told her from his hospital bed. Mr. Leary's legs were severely burned in the Dec. 21 explosion.
"He said he dropped his resume to the subway floor," she recalled. "He said he pulled the resume up off the floor and the bag blew up." She added that she now knows that he carried the explosive on the train.

HEADLINE: Squeezing the Textile Workers;
Trade and Technology Force a New Wave of Job Cuts

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

DATELINE: PISGAH, Ala.

 BODY:
Martha Smith cried as she left the Dover Mills plant of Andover Togs Inc. on a Wednesday afternoon late in January. Along with approximately 100 other people, she had lost her job sewing children's clothing.
Now she is enrolled in a state-sponsored program to learn clerical skills. "There's no more textile jobs around here," she said. "They are all going to Mexico and overseas." 
 Ms. Smith, who has lost three jobs due to plant closings, seems to have the evidence on her side. Two other sewing mills in this region of northern Alabama closed at about the same time, sending 550 people, most of them women, into the local labor market.
The layoffs are not just a regional phenomenon. After four years of stability, employment in the apparel industry took a sudden plunge last year, falling by more than 10 percent, to 846,000, from 945,000 at the end of 1994. An additional 42,000 jobs vanished in the fabrics industry, which produces the raw material to make clothing, for a total shrinkage of 141,000 jobs -- 40 percent of all manufacturing jobs lost in the United States last year.
Job losses like these provide grist to politicians with protectionist messages, especially in an election year. So while dismantling trade barriers benefits most consumers by lowering prices, it also deepens blue-collar anxieties in industries that are vulnerable to foreign competition.
The new wave of job losses in the apparel industry, coming as they did soon after the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the latest global trade accord, benefits candidates who say they want to save jobs and protect workers. Four years ago it was Ross Perot railing against free trade accords, and this year, the Republican populist, Patrick J. Buchanan, has enjoyed a surge in the polls with his attacks on free trade as a sellout of American labor.
And while textile-plant closings have been a fixture of the economic scene in the small towns of the South and Northeast for nearly a quarter-century, the recent hemorrhage of jobs, though predicted by many economists, is devastating some areas. It is driven by two forces -- government policy, which encourages free trade with low-cost apparel exporters like Mexico and Malaysia, and high technology, which helps big, profitable textile companies produce more cloth with fewer workers.
"We have lost on the order of 500,000 jobs in apparel in the past 23 years and we will probably lose another 40,000 to 50,000 this year," said Carl Priestland, an economist with the American Apparel Manufacturers Association.
Most of the pain will be felt in small towns like Pisgah, named after the mountain that Moses climbed to get his first glimpse of the Promised Land. Locals fear that Andover Togs, Pisgah's biggest employer, will shut down its remaining operations, including lithography and engineering, in addition to the sewing plant it just closed. If that happens, 400 more jobs will disappear -- and with them, the town's hopes for an economic recovery.
"I do a good business with people at the mill, so this is going to slow down the economy big time," said R.D. Mitchell, a former mayor who runs a Chevron service station that is one of the town's unofficial gathering spots. "There are a lot of people being pushed out of jobs within a 20-mile radius of here," he added. "People can't spend money they don't have."
For all the financial turmoil in textile workers' lives these days, the industry itself remains a huge and profitable sector of the American economy. Output has grown steadily, from $32.8 billion in 1974, to $56.3 billion in 1984 and to $74.2 billion in 1994, the last year for which figures are available. Even after adjusting for inflation, the increase over the last two decades has been more than 33 percent. Profits in 1994 totaled $1.74 billion, or 2.7 percent of sales, half the 5.4 profit margin for all manufacturing.
Broadly speaking, the textile trade consists of three sectors. Fiber manufacturers, the smallest of the three, spin cotton and other raw materials into threads for the fabric makers, which weave the threads into cloth for apparel producers to make into clothing.
While it is profitable, the continued prosperity of the industry hinges in large part on its ability to squeeze out as many American jobs as possible from the production process. The two main sectors -- raw fabrics and finished clothing -- achieve that goal in two very different ways, cutting labor costs and automation. And industry experts say that outside attempts to stanch the bleeding may do more harm than good.
Clothing manufacturers, swamped by a flood of cheap imports from Asia and elsewhere that have grabbed 50 percent of the American market, up from 20 percent two decades ago, stay profitable by exporting jobs to low-wage Latin American countries like Mexico and the Dominican Republic.
These companies have been unable to exploit America's vaunted technological superiority to offset their foreign rivals' wage advantage because no one has been able to develop an economical alternative to the old-fashioned sewing machine. Automated machines have a hard time handling soft, floppy cloth, and the vision-recognition systems needed to match patterns at seams, collars and cuffs are far too expensive for the low-margin apparel business.
In an integrated apparel factory, one that converts raw fabric to finished clothes, 50 percent of the jobs are sewing machine operators, 86 percent of whom are women. "You can automate design, you can automate pattern setting and cutting, but sooner or later you have to push fabric through a sewing machine," Mr. Priestland said. "That's still the bottleneck."
And that is where government policy comes in. Congressional approval of the North American and world trade accords in 1994 and 1995 made it much easier for American corporations to bring in goods from factories in third world countries, notably Mexico, by moving to eliminate quotas on imported apparel.
The search for cheap labor is nothing new. Many of the mills that are closing now migrated to impoverished regions of the rural South decades ago from the relatively prosperous Northeast. Even today, says David Thornell, director of the economic development authority of Jackson County, an economically depressed region that includes Pisgah, many of the factory workers here till the fields part time to make ends meet.
But with the factory idle, farming alone will not pay all the bills, and residents are bitter. "They pay those people down there a dollar and a nickel an hour," said Jim Mabry, another Pisgah resident. "Then they ship the clothes back here for finishing so they can call them American-made."
Andover Togs, which is based in New York, says it had little choice but to open its factory in the Dominican Republic. "I don't think we have ever seen a retail environment this sour," said Alan Kanis, the company's chief financial officer. He added that the company's major customers, discount chains like Wal-Mart and Kmart, were major importers, forcing the company to keep a tight rein on its costs.
David Buchanan, associate dean of the college of textiles at North Carolina State University, predicted more mills would shut down. The trend could turn out-of-the-way places like Pisgah into ghost towns, just as many farm villages in the upper Midwest faded into history when farming became mechanized.
"Historically, the role of the textile and apparel industry has been to provide employment for the otherwise unemployable," Mr. Buchanan said. "But that has been changing. If there is no work, the sons and daughters will move away, the way they did in farming. If there is no reason for a town to exist, it will go away."
If American apparel makers are surviving by hiring cheap labor overseas, the other big component of the textile industry, the companies that weave the cloth and fabric, is thriving by applying the latest technology at home.
A visit to the Cone Mills Corporation plant in Greensboro, N.C., shows the strides in productivity that American fabric makers have made in recent years. In the weaving room, a total of 416 looms pump out 12,000 square yards of denim every hour, nearly 50 percent more than the 1,000 older machines that they replaced. Yet they are so much easier to operate that only about 20 workers are needed to tend them, about one for every 21 looms and a tiny fraction of the 400 or so workers that handled the previous generation.
Not only that, but weaving technology is about to take a major step forward. The projectile looms in use now can insert 258 threads a minute; new air-jet machines just now coming onto factory floors can process 745 a minute, nearly three times as many.
Cone plans to replace its older machines with the more advanced models but will not increase its production capacity, since little growth is seen in the American market. "We'll just have fewer looms and fewer people," said Patrick Danahy, Cone's president.
The combination of faster machines and fewer people explains the decline in employment in the fabric industry from more than 700,000 in the late 1980's to 625,700 in January, even as fabric output increased.
Although the people in Pisgah are unhappy when their jobs depart for Caribbean nations like the Dominican Republic, the location is good news for the American fabric industry because the new factories there are more likely to buy cloth from them rather than their Asian competitors.
"Eighty percent of clothing imports from Mexico and the Caribbean are made of American fabric," Carlos Moore, executive vice president of the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, said. "That explains why we have been able to supply a lot of fabric in the face of slow growth and imports."
And though the recent liberalization of world trade seems to be accelerating the exodus of apparel jobs from the United States, Mr. Moore said it might also provide an opportunity to increase American raw-textile exports. "Most countries have traditionally protected their textile industries, but now they may be forced to open up," he said.
Moreover, some people question whether the North American Free Trade Agreement and other trade pacts should be blamed for the flight of jobs abroad. Without the trade agreement, Mr. Danahy of Cone Mills said, "Both the apparel and textile jobs would have gone to Bangladesh and elsewhere in the Far East.
"With Nafta in place," he added, "the textile complex on this continent is more competitive."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Rate Doubts Still Undercut Bond Prices

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Investors in Treasury bonds extended their losing streak to four sessions yesterday as disappointment with the Federal Reserve and technical factors led prices down.
The Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, testified before a Congressional subcommittee yesterday on the state of the economy and monetary policy, but did not give any definitive signs of the Fed's intentions concerning interest rates. Those anticipating assurances of further rate cuts, perhaps as soon as March, got none. In fact, Mr. Greenspan said nothing to prevent further selling in the current climate of rising rates. 
 The 30-year bond tumbled 2 points yesterday, to 94 22/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, rose to 6.40 percent, from 6.24 percent on Friday. The yield jump, and the corresponding slump in the long bond's price, was the largest one-day move since May 1994.
Eric Hamilton, senior fixed-income analyst at Technical Data in Boston, said that the market "is clearly on the defensive and needs to see continued signs of an economic slowdown before its regains its lost ground." With a weakening economy, interest rates can fall, and bond prices rise.
Without fresh economic data to give direction, traders said, the market leaned toward technical trading, like volume and price movement.
Tony Crescenzi, head of government bond trading at Miller, Tabak, Hirsch & Company, a New York brokerage firm, said, "There are times when selling begets selling because there are technical support levels that have been violated." While the technical activity had increased, he said, there has been no apparent change in market fundamentals.
James Hale, a fixed-income analyst at MMS International in San Francisco, said that selling started in Europe on fading hopes of lower interest rates there, and that caused a selloff in New York.
Meanwhile, large hedge funds put pressure on the market by selling Treasury securities they had financed in Japanese yen. Weakness in the dollar alarmed some investors as the yen grew stronger, forcing the funds to unwind the yen trades because of the potential for currency losses.
As for Mr. Greenspan's testimony, Mr. Hale said that the market was nervous before he even began to speak. Prices fell before Mr. Greenspan spoke, and then fell further after he left traders doubtful that the Fed would lower rates further.
"I think it's fair to say, considering the backdrop of only moderate economic growth and slow inflation, that the market has oversold," Mr. Hale said. "In the short run, the market behavior has turned psychologically so bearish that the oversold condition may continue."
Gerald A. Guild, senior vice president of the taxable fixed-income department at Advest Inc., said that while the day's decline did begin for technical reasons, it expanded beyond that. "The psychology has changed so that people are now concerned about an acceleration in economic growth, accompanied by increased fears of inflation.
"Economic growth is still at 2 to 2.25 percent, which is tame," he continued. "Consumer prices are up 2.75 to 3 percent, and unemployment will fall minimally to between 5.5 to 5.75 percent, from the current 5.8 percent. There are no wage pressures, so it's important to remember that wage growth only grew 2.9 percent in 1995 -- the lowest rate in 15 years. The market is overselling itself."
The three- and six-month bill auction yesterday drew decent demand as rates were mixed, with the rate for a three-month down 2 basis points, to 4.78 percent, and the six-month issue up 4 basis points, to 4.75 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

 	 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.792	97.599	Discounted Rate	4.78%	4.75%	Coupon Yield	4.92%	4.95%	High Price	98.799	97.614	Discounted Rate	4.75%	4.72%	Coupon Yield	4.89%	4.92%	Low Price	98.792	97.599	Discounted Rate	4.78%	4.75%	Coupon Yield	4.92%	4.95%	Accepted at low price	48%	31%	Total applied for	$47,866,843	$48,584,794	Accepted	$13,308,103	$13,203,319	Noncompetitive	$1,441,603	$1,177,911	

Both issues are dated Feb. 22, 1996. The three-month bills mature on May 23 and the six-month bills mature on Aug. 22.

HEADLINE: Testimony by Greenspan Rattles Stock and Bond Markets;
Blue Chips Fall 44.79; 30-Year Bond Plunges In Fourth Day of Selloff

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Stock and bond markets declined sharply yesterday, continuing a four-day selloff that is leading some investors to question whether a fundamental shift in sentiment might be under way.
For months, investors have been wagering that slower economic growth would lead to further declines in interest rates. And that belief, traders and analysts said, helped send the stock market to highs and pushed short- and long-term interest rates down sharply. 
 But in the last week that faith has been fading. And yesterday, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, raised doubts about additional cuts in short-term interest rates, knocking one of the main supports from beneath this year's stock market boom.
In a volatile session that saw two rounds of sharp price declines and only one solid rebound, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 44.79 points, or more that eight-tenths of a percent, to 5,458.53. At one point, the index was down nearly 70 points. With yesterday's decline, the Dow has lost 142 points, or 2.5 percent, in the last four sessions. (The stock and bond markets were closed on Monday in observance of Washington's Birthday.)
Other market indexes also fell yesterday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 7.33 points, or 1.13 percent, to 640.65, while the Nasdaq composite index slipped 7.47, to 1,083.24.
Bonds also tumbled, with the price of the 30-year Treasury bond falling more than 2 points, the largest loss since May 1994. The yield on the long bond, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, rose to 6.40 percent, up from 6.24 percent on Friday. As recently as Jan. 19, the yield on the long-term bond was less than 6 percent, and the selloff has wiped out all the gains made at the end of last year. [Page D17.]
Analysts are not yet ready to declare this year's market rallies over, especially in stocks, where the Dow is still up 6.7 percent despite the current selloff. But the recent declines are making them wonder if investors have given up hope for further cuts in interest rates and are beginning to worry more about inflation, despite the fact that inflation has remained at 3 percent for four years.
"Based on what Alan Greenspan said, there are valid questions about the timing and degree of further cuts in interest rates," said A. Marshall Acuff, portfolio strategist at Smith Barney.
Byron R. Wien, director of United States portfolio strategy at Morgan Stanley, added: "The Administration wants growth even if it includes higher inflation. The focus has shifted from fiscal responsibility to economic growth, and that's bad for interest rates."
Election-year talk about getting the economy to grow faster, especially the new emphasis among leading Republican Presidential candidates like the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, is what is making some investors worry about inflation. To the bond market, growth raises the possibility of inflation, giving bond traders yet another reason to be cautious. And rising interest rates can worry the stock market.
The Republican candidates have all but dropped their previously fervent calls for balancing the Federal budget, focusing instead on reasons why the United States economy needs to continue to grow.
President Clinton yesterday sounded his own call for continued economic expansion, saying he wanted to appoint someone to the Fed's board of governors who holds pro-growth views on the economy and does not just represent the "conventional wisdom."
Mr. Wein of Morgan Stanley asked: "How long has it been since you've heard somebody get up and scream about a balanced budget? That kind of talk smacks of cutbacks and sacrifice, and that doesn't attract voters."
Already, bond markets around the globe have started to suffer higher interest rates, said E. Wayne Nordberg, a partner at Lord, Abbett & Company, a New York money management firm. In recent weeks, traders who borrowed money at very low rates in Japan to invest in bonds paying higher rates in Germany, for example, have begun to unwind those positions, he said.
In addition, the inclination of central bankers across Europe to act together "is beginning to weaken," Mr. Nordberg said. "Therefore, European central banks might pursue more inflationary monetary policies." In such an environment, "for more speculative traders to turn around and take profits is not unusual," he said.
That is starting to spell trouble for foreign stock markets. Among other active markets yesterday, the Mexican Bolsa index fell 71.03 points, or 2.4 percent, to 2,904.41, and the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 index declined 62.57, or 1.2 percent, to 4,963.80. In Britain, the FT-SE 100 index lost 29.70, to 3,714.60, and in Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 index dipped 65.58, to 20,655.67.
Mr. Nordberg added that he expected to continue to see greater volatility in the American stock market leading up to the fall election.
Reflecting the sharp decline in the big American stock indexes yesterday, stocks recording losses on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered those with gains nearly 4 to 1. Volume was 395.9 million shares, down from 445.6 million on Friday.
Volume was relatively light throughout the day, giving at least one trader pause about whether the decline in prices represented the beginning of a larger decline in stock prices. "I would expect more volume if institutions really were selling heavily," said Jack Baker, head of institutional equity trading at Furman Selz.
After stock prices declined sharply at the opening bell, falling more than 50 points in the first half hour, they quickly rebounded and stayed relatively steady, at about 5,470, until 2:30 P.M., when Mr. Greenspan began his testimony before Congress.
What Mr. Greenspan said was not as important as the way in which many investors and traders chose to interpret his remarks. The Fed chairman said that the seeds are in place for moderate, sustainable growth. While a positive remark for those worried that economy may be slowing too much, stock and bond traders decided that Mr. Greenspan's comments cast considerable doubt on whether the Fed would make further cuts in short-term interest rates in the near future.
Not all large stocks were losers yesterday. I.B.M., for example, traded as high as 120 7/8 before closing 1 1/8 higher, at 119 1/8, its highest price since March 1991. The company yesterday introduced new products and services that will allow its existing mainframe computers to serve as Internet servers, perhaps breathing new life into the large boxes that many computer experts consider to be dinosaurs.
Among other active stocks, Sierra On-Line gained 7 3/8, to 34 1/2, after agreeing to be acquired by CUC International, which fell 6 1/4, to 31 1/4.
In addition to I.B.M., several other technology stocks also posted gains. Cisco Systems rose 1 1/8, to 45 5/8; Micron Technology moved up 3/4, to 36 7/8; Motorola jumped 7/8, to 56 1/8, and Apple Computer, whose new chairman outlined his priorities to the media on Friday, rose 1 1/2, to 29..
Bank stocks fell sharply on the outlook for higher interest rates. J. P. Morgan fell 1 7/8, to 79 3/8; Bankers Trust New York dipped 2 1/8, to 63; Citicorp fell 1 1/2, to 73 7/8, and Chase Manhattan, finished down 1 1/2, at 68 1/2.
Utility stocks, which also typically feel the effects of sharp moves in interest rates, declined. The Dow Jones utilities average, a closely watched industry barometer, fell 3.99 points, or 1.7 percent, to 225.75.

HEADLINE: U.S. Set to Impose Limited Trade Sanctions on China

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration intends to punish China for supplying nuclear materials to Pakistan by applying selective sanctions intended to hurt China without disrupting American companies that do business there, senior officials say.
The sanctions, which could be tariffs on Chinese imports or restrictions on the export of American goods that the Chinese want, are an alternative to broader penalties prescribed by law for countries that violate international arms trading rules. 
 Officials said President Clinton would formally impose the broad sanctions, but waive them on grounds of national interest and immediately order the narrower measures "to make the punishment fit the crime," as one senior Administration official put it.
Without a waiver, the law would cut off $10 billion in loan guarantees to American companies, hurting American workers along with the Chinese.
Officials have been examining possible penalties since last week to try to head off a growing furor about China in Congress. Action is expected soon.
Possible penalties could aim to cut off high-tech American products that China cannot get elsewhere, or could be devised to punish the specific military-run factories blamed for the arms exports to Pakistan.
To punish Pakistan, the officials say, an agreement to deliver $368 million in American aircraft -- missiles and howitzers that already have been paid for -- is likely to be blocked, as it was once before.
The Administration is also threatening separate economic sanctions against China for failing to stop its factories from wholesale piracy of copyrighted music compact disks and computer software.
With conflicts bubbling over intellectual property rights, human rights, trade and military threats to Taiwan, Administration officials say they cannot ignore the violation of China's vows on cooperating to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and retain credibility with Beijing or Congress, especially in an election year.
"Good relationships have to run both ways," a senior American official said, echoing the new, harder line in American policy toward Beijing stated most vividly last week by Secretary of Defense William J. Perry in a speech at the National Defense University.
"It takes two to tango," Mr. Perry said. "It takes two to engage. While we are committed to engagement, we are not committed to engagement at any price."
While emphasizing that engagement with China is a vital part of America's security interests and its policy of "preventive defense in the Asia-Pacific region," he said, "It is time for China to start sending the right messages."
But at the same time, American officials want to be sure they are sending the right messages, especially to an insecure leadership waiting for the death of Deng Xiaoping and using nationalist credos, whether over Taiwan or trade, to buttress a faltering Communist ideology.
Whether the issue is the export of nuclear materials, a peaceful resolution on Taiwan or a satisfactory end to the struggle over intellectual property rights, a senior official said, "We feel a deal is a deal, and telling China you have to play by your commitments sends a positive message on other issues."
Officially, the United States has not yet stated that China is in violation of nuclear nonproliferation law, only that officials are evaluating intelligence reports indicating that China supplied Pakistan with 5,000 ring magnets late last year to enrich uranium for weapons use.
Although China and Pakistan deny all wrongdoing, senior American officials say there is little doubt that a violation occurred and that the United States must respond.
The officials say that talks are going on with the Chinese to be "absolutely sure we know the facts" and to try to negotiate China's "future behavior, which will be one factor in how we proceed."
But the officials feel constrained by a 1994 American law that requires the cutoff of United States Export-Import Bank loan guarantees to American companies doing business in China if China sells nuclear-weapons information and technology.
The amount at stake is now $10 billion, and if the American companies lose their contracts, China can buy the same products in other countries, the officials say.
"The main victim is U.S. business, and China doesn't suffer," said Stanley O. Roth, who was in charge of Asia policy at the National Security Council until Jan. 1 and now is the head of research at the U.S. Institute for Peace.
James R. Lilley, a former American Ambassador to Beijing and director of the American legation in Taiwan, who is now at the American Enterprise Institute, said, "China violates nonproliferation norms and the United States shoots itself in the foot, and no one else in the world follows us on this."
That is why, in several interagency meetings at the White House, officials are searching for sanctions and penalties that do not cut both ways.
Mr. Roth suggested that waiving the Export-Import Bank penalties would be easier if China would acknowledge its actions and negotiate a stricter regime "to stop in the future." Failing that, he suggested, "sanctions could be targeted in a way that gets China's attention" on issues of high-technology trade with the United States that Beijing cannot replicate.
"Anything will inevitably lead to howls of protest from Beijing, but at least you don't undermine nonproliferation," Mr. Roth said.
Of course, American officials acknowledge, China may respond by canceling the American projects guaranteed by the Export-Import Bank, including a $23-million sale of generator parts by Westinghouse Electric Corporation.
As an indication of the mood in Beijing, China's Foreign Trade Minister, Wu Yi, vowed last week to retaliate against American exports to China if Washington imposed more than $1 billion in sanctions against Chinese imports in the dispute over intellectual property rights.
The American trade representative, Mickey Kantor, has vowed to impose the sanctions if China does not live up to a bilateral agreement reached last year to shut down more than 30 factories producing millions of dollars worth of pirated American software, compact disks and videos.
As they debate these issues, American officials say, they are concerned that hitting China with multiple penalties in such rapid order may encourage Beijing to act more aggressively or irresponsibly toward Taiwan, which holds its first democratic presidential elections on March 23. President Lee Teng-hui, who has been pushing to get Taiwan a seat in the United Nations, is expected to win handily, and the Chinese have been organizing military exercises and threatening missile strikes to put psychological pressure on the Taiwanese to back off any moves toward independence.
American officials have repeatedly said that China could not successfully invade Taiwan, but they have also warned Beijing about stability in the waters around Taiwan and sent an American aircraft carrier through the Taiwan Strait, ostensibly because of bad weather.
Given the most serious danger, which is military conflict, and China's generally good relations with Mr. Perry, it was no surprise that he became the front man for the Administration's tougher tone, Mr. Lilley said.
Mr. Lilley said he believed that Beijing was using threats against Taiwan as a tactic to obtain softer American responses on other issues, from nonproliferation to trade.

HEADLINE: Poll Indicates Support for Tax to Rebuild Schools

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
Rather than allow a $1.50-a-week tax to expire, an overwhelming majority of New Yorkers would be willing to redirect the money to help rebuild the city's crumbling schools, according to the results of a poll released yesterday by Quinnipiac College.
Eighty-two percent of the poll respondents said they approved of the idea behind a plan that the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, proposed last month to raise $1.4 billion for school reconstruction. 
 Mr. Vallone hailed the poll results as proof that his proposal has popular support. But Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani held firm in his opposition. He said once again that he did not believe that the Board of Education could be trusted to spend the money wisely. And he called the poll question "a loaded question that produced the result it wanted."
Poll participants were asked: "Currently, the average taxpayer pays an extra $1.50 per week in New York City income taxes, which is dedicated to hiring more police. This tax is due to expire at the end of the year. Do you think the tax should be continued and spent on rebuilding the city's public schools or do you think the tax should be allowed to expire in December?"
The poll was conducted from Feb. 9 to 13 and found that New Yorkers believe education is one of the most important problems facing the city -- second only to crime. It also found that black and Hispanic residents favored the school construction tax plan more strongly than the overall group; 90 percent of them answered yes.
"These numbers say that people think this is what should happen," said Maurice Carroll, director of the college's Polling Institute in Hamden, Conn. "It says that $1.50 a week doesn't seem like a lot of money to people if the money goes for school repairs. And this is everybody -- across the board."
Mr. Carroll also defended the phrasing of the question, and said: "It's a fair statement of what happens."
The city is not expected to need money for hiring police officers because the Mayor has said he plans to cut the police force by about 1,500 officers from its peak of 38,310 by the end of this year.
The poll surveyed 880 city residents and had a margin of sampling error of 3.3 percentage points.
Mr. Vallone, who has spent the last few weeks lobbying the Mayor, Gov. George E. Pataki and leaders of the State Legislature on behalf of his plan, said he hoped the results would help advance the political debate.
"It should be the spark plug to get everybody on the same page," Mr. Vallone said. "And it should zero in on the fact that New Yorkers may be tolerant of debate, but they want action."
The Mayor, however, repeated his concern that the money from the surcharge would not actually be spent on schools.
"The fact is, we should straighten out the school system first before we put more money into it or before we give it a dedicated source of funds," he said. "That would be the worst possible thing to do."
Mr. Vallone insisted, however, that the money would go directly to the School Construction Authority, which is overseen by a board made up of the Schools Chancellor and representatives appointed by the Mayor and the Governor. He said he hoped to conclude negotiations with the Mayor by May, in time to send the plan to the State Legislature for final approval.
Dave Begel, a spokesman for Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, said he was heartened by the poll results. "But I don't think it's surprising that people are willing to dig a little deeper when they think the money will go to schools," he said. "The conditions have been pretty well documented, and people recognize that it's hard to learn under these circumstances."

HEADLINE: Changing City, Changing Carnival

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 20

 BODY:
The parade was staged by one of the lesser of the private, secretive clubs that put on the world-famous party of Mardi Gras. What it lacked in history and old money, it filled in with racket and tableau as it lurched along St. Charles Avenue last week, the drums booming like thunderclaps, the colored beads dropping like Kool-Aid rain.
It was almost a full week before Fat Tuesday and the roaring climax of Carnival in New Orleans, but the avenue's median -- what people here call "neutral ground" -- was awash with jumping, cheering, hollering spectators who begged for the trinkets tossed from the passing floats. Most of the spectators on that block were black, as are most of the people in New Orleans, but the men looking down from the floats were white. 
 Then, as the parade moved past the stately old Pontchartrain Hotel, one club member pushed back his mask, revealing a black face underneath. The sight of him made several people shout a greeting, and made one teen-age girl smile.
"People just like to see a black person on a float," said 16-year-old Cornelia Williams, who has been coming to parades since she was a baby. It is not that she dreams of riding in one herself. But in a city where a migration of whites to the suburbs has left a racial mix that is more than 65 percent black, she does not want a white man telling her she cannot be a part of something because of her color.
Four years have passed since the city adopted a landmark ordinance barring racial discrimination against prospective members by clubs that parade at Mardi Gras. Rather than comply, a few of the oldest clubs, or krewes -- among them Comus, which had paraded here since 1857 -- shut down their parades, leaving what many older white families see as a gap in Carnival's soul.
But the truth, many here say, is that the ordinance did to Carnival and New Orleans only what the passing of time was sure to do anyway; it just erased a little early the insult of the exclusion that blacks felt when a parade of no one but white men passed in the streets. While it is true that the ordinance took from some people a gilded part of the city's past, that part could not have survived much longer in a city of high crime and high unemployment, where many whites had given up and were moving out.
In a way, the changes in Mardi Gras reflect the deeper changes taking place in the older Southern cities as families that controlled commerce and social lives for 100 years lose political power to blacks and others moving in from other parts of the country. The old Mardi Gras was the last symbol of the power these families held here in New Orleans.
"There is a sense in which Carnival is New Orleans, and it reflects the sociology of the city damn near to perfection," said Munro Edmonson, a retired professor of anthropology at Tulane University, who for some 40 years, as both social scientist and casual observer, has studied the complexities of Mardi Gras.
Comus, Momus and other private men's clubs remain part of the city's mosaic, still hold their grand balls and still congregate with their own kind. But the time when their ideal could be paraded in public has passed. "At a symbolic level, it was very dramatic," Dr. Edmonson said of the 1992 ordinance. "But it was a change that was already going on."
To outsiders, and to many residents as well, the gaps left by the departure of the stately parades of Comus (pronounced KOH-muss) and others is barely felt. New krewes fill the street with grand parades, and the revelers fill the air with "throws" -- fake gold coins, cheap plastic beads and even ladies' underwear -- just as they always have. The flambeau carriers still light the way with their smoking torches, jazz still sounds on St. Charles Avenue and on Canal Street, and the big floats still glide. What some said would be Carnival's death knell has turned out to be more like a speed bump on the way to something different and inevitable, white and black revelers alike said this week.
Carnival is always in flux. Over the years there have been not only black krewes with histories dating from early in the century -- the first king of one such krewe, Zulu, spoofed Rex, the King of Carnival, in 1916 by donning a lard-can crown -- but also gay krewes that have boomed and died, their members lost to AIDS, and even a parade for people who just want to parade, a procession of big trucks filled with them.
Mardi Gras traditionalists say Comus, Momus and Proteus, the three top-drawer krewes that dropped their parades rather than endure the city's intrusion, were true Carnival and cannot be replaced. On the other hand, another traditional krewe, Rex, established in 1872, retained its parade by opening membership to blacks after enactment of the ordinance, which had been proposed by Dorothy Mae Taylor, then a Councilwoman.
"I know for a fact that three years before Dorothy Mae Taylor" pushed through the legislation, "Rex was trying to integrate," said Arthur Hardy, editor and publisher of the Mardi Gras Guide, who is a lifelong follower of Carnival history. "She didn't accomplish anything except destroying a part of our heritage. We kicked our great-grandfathers in the shin. Certainly the black community hasn't won anything."
Asked about changes in his secretive club, a Rex spokesman, demanding anonymity, would say only that "our organization abides by the ordinance" and that "it has caused no problems of any kind." Rex still has "all the functions it had before," he said, "continues to parade and continues to be the pre-eminent Carnival organization."
He would not comment at all on whether he was proud that the color line had been broken. It is against the krewe's guidelines to discuss its members, even, apparently, in the abstract.
The history and the topography of New Orleans are the key to understanding why the drunken prelude to the penitential season of Lent has come to spur such a world of feeling here, Dr. Edmonson said.
"New Orleans has never been as segregated as other cities," he said. "It doesn't have enough dry land for that. Everyone lives cheek by jowl. That has changed with white flight, but there never was a kind of spacial segregation possible elsewhere. With the Creoles," the lighter-skinned blacks, traditional leaders in black New Orleans, "we did not have two races, but three. The mansions and slums are within shouting distance."
Over its history, he continued, the people of New Orleans "fell into a pattern of social interaction in which they knew everything about their neighbor's business but put on elaborate pretenses of not knowing. You're polite to your neighbor here; politeness is a shield against contact. In that sense, the snobbery of the krewes was a way of separating rather than uniting people.
"The whole thing came to be a system largely composed of fantasy, and largely retrospective. Carnival glamorizes the past, and looks back to a day that never was: an elite that never had any legitimate claim to the aristocracy ride their floats like sneering marquises before the French Revolution, tossing baubles."
But in the last decade, New Orleans has been in the throes of change that, "anywhere else, would have been social revolution," Dr. Edmonson said. "We went through the major upheaval of white flight, the beginning of burgeoning suburbanization."
Still, white residents belonged by the thousands to private Mardi Gras clubs that excluded blacks. And although the clubs financed their own floats and costumes, it was public money, for police services and so forth, that allowed them to parade. "It became unreasonable not to raise some kind of fuss," Dr. Edmonson said. "The city spends a lot of tax money coping with Mardi Gras."
The change did not come easily, though. Whites opposed it overwhelmingly, and, a poll in The Times-Picayune showed, so did 51 percent of blacks. "People naturally select, like with business partners," said Mr. Hardy, the Mardi Gras Guide publisher.
But on the parade routes this week and last, black revelers, and some whites as well, said they did not miss the parades of the old krewes and did not believe that Mardi Gras had been badly wounded. Indeed, the desire by some black people here to continue with the old system had been based not on respect or approval of the white krewes but instead on years of resentment: they simply wanted nothing to do with them.
Ultimately, integration moved both ways across the color line. "We had a graduate student from Norway," Dr. Edmonson said, "who fell in love with the Mardi Gras Indians," the black men who stage their own elaborate festivals of feathered costumes, song and verbal assaults. "Eventually, they made him a member of a tribe."

HEADLINE: House Democrats Assail Welfare Plan Backed by Governors

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20

 BODY:
House Democrats today sharply criticized a package of welfare proposals endorsed unanimously this month by members of the National Governors' Association, including 18 Democrats.
At a hearing of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, Republicans praised the governors' proposals. Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., the Florida Republican who heads the subcommittee, said the governors "rode into town in the darkest days of winter and breathed life back into a welfare reform debate that was on life support." 
 But all four Democrats at today's hearing criticized the proposals, saying they did not adequately protect poor children. Catholic Charities USA, a national network of local charities run by the Roman Catholic Church, echoed that concern.
The comments underlined the differences between liberal House Democrats and President Clinton, who has applauded the governors for their bipartisan effort. In a speech to the governors on Feb. 6, Mr. Clinton said, "I believe we're going to pass welfare reform legislation." But he and his appointees later objected to specific elements of the governors' package, including cuts in the growth of spending on food stamps and a provision that would allow states to reduce their own welfare spending.
An Administration official said tonight: "The President wants a welfare bill. He absolutely, positively does. The question is, Can you get a decent one? Some House Democrats would clearly prefer that nothing pass this year, while we would prefer that something pass."
Sharon M. Daly, deputy director of Catholic Charities, said the governors' proposals "would repeal the Federal guarantee of protection for poor children, allow states to turn their backs on their obligations to poor families and repeal the right of individual children to receive protection against abuse and neglect" by parents.
"For more than a year," Mrs. Daly said, "the welfare debate has focused almost exclusively on personal responsibility." But, she said, the Roman Catholic Church, from the Pope on down through the bishops, teaches that Government and society also have responsibilities: to help guarantee that people have "suitable employment," adequate wages and welfare benefits when jobs are unavailable.
The chairman of the governors' association, Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, a Republican, told the members of Congress today: "Governors are just as concerned about children as you are. We will not allow children to go without protection, without food, without sustenance."
Under questioning by Democrats, Mr. Thompson said flatly, "The Catholic Church is wrong."
The governors said Congress should give each state a lump sum of Federal money, known as a block grant, for assistance to poor people. State officials would have vast new discretion to design their own welfare programs.
While poor people would no longer be entitled to cash assistance, the Federal Government would establish a $2 billion contingency fund to help states with high rates of unemployment or child poverty.
Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said the contingency fund "is likely to be wholly inadequate" in a recession. Moreover, he said that the governors' proposals would shift costs from the states to the Federal Government and "threaten to undermine the food stamp program as a safety net for children."
Mr. Levin asserted that "a substantial number of welfare recipients could lose their Medicaid coverage" under the governors' proposals.
Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California, said he was not surprised at the bipartisan agreement among governors. "Governors can get together whenever greed is involved," Mr. Stark said. "They all support this because it will save them a lot of money."
Another California Democrat, Representative Robert T. Matsui, said in an interview: "This would be a great deal for the governors. We raise taxes. They spend the money and are not accountable."
The split among Democrats is reflected in the Clinton Administration. Officials at the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services are more critical of the governors' proposals than are White House officials. Mr. Shaw said, "The Administration has chosen not to send a witness to today's hearing."
The Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna E. Shalala, plans to testify next week at a Senate hearing on the governors' proposals.
New estimates by the Congressional Budget Office show that the governors' proposals, by adding money for child care and other services, would significantly reduce the savings achieved by the welfare bill. The measure passed by Congress last year would have saved $60.2 billion over seven years. The version favored by the governors would save $42.3 billion, or 30 percent less, the budget office said.
In the 1992 campaign, Mr. Clinton promised to "end welfare as we know it," but last month he vetoed a welfare bill passed by Congress, saying it was too harsh. Haley Barbour, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said Mr. Clinton could embrace the governors' proposals or "kowtow again to his liberal base and destroy any chance of genuine welfare reform."

HEADLINE: Testimony by Greenspan Rattles Stock and Bond Markets;
Hopes of Rate Cut Dim As Economy Is Termed 'Basically on Track'

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20

 BODY:
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, described the economy today as soft but dismissed fears of a downturn, giving the impression that he was not eager to bolster growth with another round of cuts right away in short-term interest rates.
"A number of fundamentals point to an economy basically on track for sustained growth, so any weakness is likely to be temporary," Mr. Greenspan told a House panel in his required semiannual report to Congress on the outlook for the economy and the central bank's monetary strategy. 
 Traders in the securities markets, who have been counting on further rate cuts from the Fed in response to a string of weak economic reports for early 1996, registered sharp disappointment. Even though Mr. Greenspan did not entirely close the door to lower rates in his afternoon appearance, his generally positive spin on the economy contributed to a surge in interest rates in the bond market. Losses in the stock market mounted after his testimony.
Also today, an index intended to predict the economy's course posted its first advance after three months of declines. With 8 of its 10 available components moving higher, the index of leading economic indicators climbed two-tenths of 1 percent for December.
Mr. Greenspan's appearance came at a particularly delicate time, scheduled coincidentally on the day of the primary election in New Hampshire, where questions about economic growth figured significantly in the political debate. In a speech in New York last week, President Clinton, after studiously avoiding criticizing Mr. Greenspan for three years, suggested that the Fed should be more concerned about encouraging growth and not so worried about the threat of inflation.
Mr. Greenspan's term as chairman expires at the end of next week. White House officials have made clear that Mr. Clinton sees no alternative to reappointing Mr. Greenspan to another four-year term. Indeed, the Fed chairman suggested today in ducking a question about various tax proposals that he thought he would have ample future opportunity to expound.
The White House is also hoping to announce nominees this week for two vacancies on the seven-member Federal Reserve Board, according to the White House spokesman, Mike McCurry. One slot is the vice chairmanship, which the President had sought for Felix Rohatyn, the New York investment banker. Mr. Clinton had said that Mr. Rohatyn's presence on the Fed would encourage a debate over whether the economy is capable of sustaining faster growth than the generally sluggish rate of recent years. But Mr Rohatyn withdrew his name after strenuous opposition emerged from Congressional Republicans.
The current list of candidates for the Fed posts is believed to include Laurence H. Meyer, a St. Louis economic consultant; Peter Kenen, an economics professor at Princeton University; Eugene Ludwig, the Comptroller of the Currency, and Robert Shapiro of the Progressive Policy Institute, a Democratic research group that President Clinton helped found.
"The President is interested in the strongest possible nominees for the Federal Reserve Board," Mr. McCurry said today, "and he's made it clear he thinks there should be a representation of views on the board that reflects the debate among economists and specialists on how best to stimulate economic growth."
While Mr. Greenspan is a virtual shoo-in to win approval from the Republican-controlled Senate, the nominees for the other Fed positions are expected to face intense grilling from the Senate Banking Committee. Still, any of them appear more likely to win support than Mr. Rohatyn would have. His role in the financial rescue of New York City in the 1970's and his frequent calls for greater public investment have been cited by conservative critics as evidence of a fondness for government intervention.
Mr. Greenspan, a paragon of caution and a master of disguised intentions, said nothing explicit about the probable direction of interest rates in his testimony today. But the tenor of his prepared statement and his answers to questions suggested that he saw no urgency to extend the quarter-point cuts in rates that were made in mid-December and late January.
"There is no question this is a soft economy," the chairman said in response to Representative Jim Leach, an Iowa Republican, who had inquired whether the economy might contract for a few months. But Mr. Greenspan said he doubted that the situation would deteriorate into "negative growth," observing that January's "dismal" numbers, which were hurt by the Northeast blizzard, may be giving way to a modest rebound.
"It seems February is doing a shade better," Mr. Greenspan said, noting, however, that little data are available yet for this month. .
The views expressed in the monetary report that Mr. Greenspan delivered were close to the consensus among economists. It projected that the growth of gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, would be 2 to 2.25 percent in the period from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996, quite similar to the Clinton Administration's projection of 2.2 percent.
The Consumer Price Index was projected to rise by 2.75 to 3 percent, just below the Administration's 3.1 percent, while the Fed's projected unemployment rate, 5.5 to 5.75 percent, was in line with the Administration's 5.7 percent. The outlook is more important as a guide to the thinking of Fed officials, who tend to respond with policy changes when the economy appears to be veering outside the projected path, than as a particularly reliable forecast of the economy.
"The economy has started off slowly early this year, but fundamental conditions appear to be more encouraging than recent data might seem to suggest," the report said, predicting that the economy will "grow moderately" in 1996 with no significant pickup in inflation.
Members of the House banking subcommittee elicited these other observations from Mr. Greenspan today:
*A failure by Congress and the White House to reach agreement this year on a credible deficit-reduction plan would mean that some of last year's two-percentage-point decline in long-term interest rates "will have to be refunded." Passage of a program, by contrast, would bring rates down "quite a bit further," Mr. Greenspan predicted.
*The Fed would have been "irresponsible" not to have raised interest rates in 1994 because classic signs of accelerating inflation were starting to appear, including longer lead times on supplier deliveries and a surge in overtime hours worked by employees.
*Stressing the need for a better-educated work force, Mr. Greenspan, a conservative, said he agreed with Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, a liberal who often sounds this same theme, "on quite a lot of things." Their accord on this issue, he said, has proved "quite a surprise to both of us."
As for today's statistic, the rise in the index of leading indicators, the compilation of which has been taken over by the private Conference Board from the Commerce Department, was a modest two-tenths of 1 percent in December. Yet it did break a string of three consecutive declines that averaged a similar amount and it was broadly based.
The biggest positive influences were a decline in average first-time claims for unemployment insurance, higher stock prices and a rise in consumer expectations. The two negatives were a decline in the price of materials especially sensitive to the business cycle and a shrinking factory workweek.
But analysts said the index for January, to be reported March 7, was likely to turn negative again.

HEADLINE: Abused Boy Found Dead In the Bronx

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
In unrelated incidents, two Bronx children -- both of whom were taken from city custody and returned to a parent -- became the latest additions to New York City's list of child abuse victims yesterday. One 2-year-old boy was found dead and his father was charged with murder; a 2-year-old girl was raped and her mother and uncle were arrested.
Both victims recently had been under the care of the city's child protection agency, but both had been returned to a natural parent within the last year, according to city officials with knowledge of the cases. It was unclear last night whether the agency had supported returning the children. 
 Nicholas Scoppetta, the Commissioner of the Administration for Children's Services, said investigations of how the city handled both the cases were under way. Mr. Scoppetta said he was uncertain whether the details of either case would be publicly released under the terms of recently enacted legislation relaxing confidentiality restrictions.
The two cases were the latest in a numbing series of abuse incidents that have come to light since the death last November of Elisa Izquierdo, a 6-year-old child whose mother was charged with her slaying. Since the girl's death, the city's child protection agency has been reorganized and put in the hands of Mr. Scoppetta. And in some of the recent cases, the moves in Albany to ease the confidentiality rules have allowed officials to release more details about abuse incidents than they had in the past.
In the death of the 2-year-old yesterday, Anthony Mikell, 43, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder after the police responded to a report of an unconscious child in an apartment in a Mott Haven housing project. The police said Kevin Mikell was found with a dislocated arm, bruises and cigarette burns on his body. The medical examiner's office is to conduct an autopsy today.
James Taylor, a neighbor, said one of the three children living with Mr. Mikell had come to his door around 8 A.M. The child said her baby brother was not moving. Mr. Taylor said he entered the apartment and discovered the child lying under a thin blanket on a day bed in a darkened living room. Mr. Mikell was present and crying, the neighbor said, adding that the father claimed the child had vomited and choked.
But the portrait offered by the police of Kevin Mikell's final 24 hours was a brutally grim one: Bronx detectives said the father had forced the boy to sit for more than 12 hours on the toilet as part of a grotesque training exercise, alternately smacking and feeding the 26-month-old child. At roughly 11 P.M. on Monday night, the detectives said, the father beat the child until he collapsed on the living-room floor. The detectives said the child, with bruises on both sides of his face and his forehead, had been dead for four hours when they arrived shortly after 8 A.M.
The detectives said Mr. Mikell had one prior arrest, a 1987 charge of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, and they said that in 1994 police officers and child protection agency workers had responded to an incident at the apartment, though they did not offer any details. Detectives added that Mr. Mikell had a hearing impairment and was living on government disability payments.
According to the officials with knowledge of Kevin Mikell's brief life, the child was born on Dec. 18, 1993, and was officially placed in the city's care 10 days later, apparently because of a positive drug test. The officials said the child's mother had a history of drug abuse. Standard procedure in such cases would be to place the child with a foster family.
It was unclear last night who initiated the action to return the child to the father. Officials last night could not rule out the possibility that Mr. Mikell had filed a petition with the courts to retake custody. Any return, however, would have required the input of the city's child protection agency, as well as the approval of a Family Court judge.
Yesterday, Mr. Taylor, as well as another neighbor who often baby-sat for the three children living with Mr. Mikell, said the father was unemployed and living alone. They said Kevin Mikell's mother, Gwendolyn, lived in a shelter and would "come and go" to the apartment. They said that while the apartment was kept in less than ideal shape, they had not seen obvious signs of abuse. The two other children were placed under the city's care yesterday.
"The funny thing is that his little girls were not crying -- they were just so solemn-faced," Mr. Taylor said. "The only one crying was the father. He was crying so loud he was scaring me."
In the other case, in University Heights in the Bronx, the police arrested Melissa Julius and Joseph Julius and charged them in the rape and molestation of Ms. Julius's 2-year-old daughter. The police said yesterday that they initially responded to a 911 call from a woman saying she was being choked by her boyfriend.
After arriving and interviewing the apartment occupants, the police arrested Ms. Julius, 34, and the child's uncle, Mr. Julius, 26. The police said that Mr. Julius had raped and abused the child and that Ms. Julius had known of the assaults and not taken action. She was charged with endangering the welfare of a child.
Ms. Julius, according to the officials familiar with the city's child protection agency's records, is the mother of seven children, all of whom have been placed in foster care at one time or another. The listed reasons for the placements, the officials said, are neglect or abuse, and it appeared that the mother's drug problem was the underlying reason.
Beginning in 1991, the records are said to show, some of the children began to be returned to Ms. Julius. In 1991, two children were returned to her custody. A year later, another child was returned. Early in 1995, one child was adopted by a family, and last March, two children, including the child who the police have charged was abused, were discharged back to Ms. Julius's care. One child remains in foster care.
It could not be determined yesterday what the city's child protection agency's position was on returning the children to a home that agency officials knew to be seriously troubled.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who said earlier this year that the protection of individual children should take precedence over all other concerns, including the reunification of families, said he was aware of both of yesterday's developments.
"I have been informed in both," Mr. Giuliani said. "The agency is going through the facts under the new law to see what they can appropriately disclose."
The city's Public Advocate, Mark Green, whose office conducted a yearlong examination of the city's child protection system, said the rash of recent cases indicated the problem of child abuse appeared to remain out of control.
"Case after case shows that the Child Welfare Administration is dropping the ball when it comes to abused children," Mr. Green said. "While we applaud the appointment of Mr. Scoppetta, it is essential that he submit a timetable for reform. Nothing but a complete overhaul of the agency will help protect our city's children."

HEADLINE: The Vision Thing, Again

 BODY:
The New Hampshire primary results may teach the Republican Party what the Democrats learned in the era of Walter Mondale -- the Presidency is not a reward for faithful party service. Senator Bob Dole has yet to find a message that means anything to Americans worried about a brand-new set of economic problems. Like Ted Kennedy's disastrous foray in 1980, Mr. Dole's wounded run for President has been defined by his inability even to articulate why he wants the job.
America is bedeviled by growing economic inequality in the midst of plenty. The efficient, post-industrial economy is brutal in the way it separates winners from losers. The bulk of the population, which has less than a college education, is falling further and further behind. This growing income gap is the critical political issue for turn-of-the-century Americans. The Reagan-era policies of low taxes and restrained spending spurred growth, but they supply no comfort. When people are worried about being laid off from their jobs, losing their health care or not being able to give their children a better future, every statistic that shows the economy doing well makes them feel worse. 
 Pat Buchanan's campaign offered a simplistic solution -- higher trade barriers -- that cannily played into voter insecurity. Mr. Buchanan's "conservatism with a heart" combined protectionism with his longtime appeal to the religious right and anti-U.N. paranoia. It served him well in New Hampshire, but it frightened Republican regulars with the prospect of turning the party over to fringe elements. Mr. Buchanan also never took his economic plan beyond hot-button oratory. He has never admitted that high trade barriers would mean higher prices for working-class families, and threaten the livelihood of American workers who produce goods for export. Still, the trade issue hit home, cruelly exposing Senator Dole's lack of any organizing vision for his campaign or the nation.
Mr. Dole originally hoped to slip past the economic issue, confining himself to a stump speech that was a paean to banality. "Like everyone else in this room, I was born," he confided to an election-eve rally. The Senate majority leader contended that his selling point was leadership. But he expressed it with ideas lifted from Newt Gingrich's Contract With America, usually couched in terms that suggested he was trying to submerge himself in the safety of G.O.P.-speak. ("We also believe it's real important to send more power back to the states. . . .")
Lamar Alexander's strong third-place showing may be a reward for the fact that the former Tennessee Governor tries to speak to concern about a rich but inequitable economy. He stresses education, promising to retrain laid-off workers for more sophisticated jobs, and give poor children $1,000 school vouchers. But after months of campaigning in New Hampshire, Mr. Alexander was still best defined by the fact that he was a mainstream Republican who was not Bob Dole. The most innovative sections of his platform were half-baked at best. His welfare plan and scheme to reduce illegal immigrants appeared to have barely gone anywhere near an oven. He will now be tempted to package himself solely as the un-Buchanan.
That would be a mistake. The last Republican nominee, George Bush, was ridiculed for his discomfort with "the vision thing." The New Hampshire campaign revealed that this year's Republican contenders have their own vision problems when it comes to offering real solutions to the next generation of economic issues. Senator Dole last night demonstrated the limits of a platform that fails to go beyond the concept of his Congressional seniority. The voters, meanwhile, are waiting for a candidate with a plan for the economy that lifts all boats, not just the yachts.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE VOTERS;
Down to the Wire, a Clutch Of Candidates and Choices

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: EXETER, N.H., Feb. 20

 BODY:
"I just now made up my mind right there," said Ruth Nottage, gesturing down at the entry threshold of the Town Hall voting precinct here this morning to underline the impetuosity forced upon her by what she decided was a befuddling slate of Republican Presidential contenders.
"I had questions about Dole from the very beginning," the 84-year-old voter said, explaining her last-minute decision, "and I thought, maybe Buchanan, but then I heard last night someone, Newt Gingrich, saying Buchanan would mean the Republicans lose Congress." . 
 "So I guess it'll be good old Dole, " she concluded with considerable resignation. "He had no message that came through, and I thought that was wrong. But, good old Dole it is."
With a sense of duty more pronounced than any motive of overwhelming enthusiasm, New Hampshire voters offered variations on Mrs. Nottage's theme as they trooped to the polls to pick a Presidential choice.
The one candidate who did stir them noticeably, Patrick J. Buchanan, was praised by his supporters for the very certainty of his positions as much as for the issues he pressed.
"He is extreme; that's what the White House needs," said Chuck Marich, a 34-year-old sales representative who voted for Mr. Buchanan. "We need someone drastic to go in there and make some drastic changes."
Supporters of other candidates sounded less certain in explaining their choices.
"We may just be changing the sax for the piano, but I voted for Alexander," said Carol Lynch, an Exeter civic leader, referring to former Gov. Lamar Alexander's resolutely upbeat piano playing on the hustings. "I like him, and his wife, Honey, was terrific on TV the other night.
"I've run in school board politics, so I know how rough campaigning can be, but this campaign did turn me off to Bob Dole. He has gotten mean and dirty with time."
A sense of the candidates being jammed together all the way down the homestretch was clearly reflected in the voting day's muddle of vox pop at election booths across the state. Buchanan voters stood out in emphasizing their candidate's feisty consistency in his views.
"I don't think it's true that he's a racist," said Laura Gustafson, a 26-year-old mental health worker. "He just says what he thinks. He's very honest. He's not like a politician."
Buchanan supporters exulted at their candidate's refusal to split the difference on issues. "It's not a time for moderation," said James Carbonaro, a 38-year-old transplanted New Yorker. "Everyone says he's a right-wing nut, and I'm hoping they're right."
Some of the cited motives were rooted in narrow deduction, like that of a guarded woman who gave her name only as Janet in explaining her vote for the millionaire Steve Forbes: "Only because he certainly isn't in it for the money."
Other motives were downright arcane. "I'm scared to death of Elizabeth Dole," said Bill Drinkwine, a 46-year-old electronics technician from Nashua who voted for Mr. Forbes as an anti-Doles measure.
"I hate what she did at the Red Cross," Mr. Drinkwine said, complaining about a bad blood transfusion and warning that a First Lady Dole would be "in charge of everything."
Some voters searched for resonance with their personal code. "Buchanan's against abortion and against the openness of gays," said Diana Dupont, a housewife from Nashua. "It's time people started putting their morals first."
Others voted by the process of elimination. "I voted for Bob Dole because I thought he was the lesser of two evils, or three or four," Sandra O'Rourke said.
But Mr. Dole was counted out by Eric Robinson because of a lack of a clear message. "If he can't tell us in a primary what he's going to do as President, that's scary," said Mr. Robinson, a 28-year-old unemployed voter. "What's he going to do in the White House?"
Some New Hampshire Democrats, idle this year with President Clinton facing no primary challenge, took advantage of the primary cross-over process and tried to influence the Republican line. "At least this would be someone I could stomach," explained Eric Wilson, a 32-year-old Nashua lawyer after voting for Mr. Alexander in looking forward to a November vote for Mr. Clinton.
Slowly climbing the steps to Exter Town Hall with the aid of a walker, 92-year-old Don Wark would not explicitly announce his vote. "Bob Dole's too old, that's for sure," Mr. Wark did say of the candidate 20 years younger than he. Then Mr. Wark, who has voted in all the state primaries for half a century, alluded to the sheer relativity of the ballot as he smiled and trudged onward: "But maybe Dole's my man. Maybe he's all there is this year."
Right behind came Helen Drazyk who said she had considered Mr. Dole but voted for Mr. Alexander. "It was a mean campaign," Ms. Drazyk said, "and the candidates didn't talk enough about what the people were interested in. Dole showed this time he hasn't got any oomph left. He used to be more peppy."
Ms. Drazyk was not overheard by Elizabeth Dole, who coincidentally showed up at Town Hall to cheer the process on. Mrs. Dole did break into a smile when another voter, Marilyn Purswell, approached and announced, "I just had the privilege of voting for your husband."
"Why, you've warmed my heart," Mrs. Dole replied, and Ms. Purswell explained: "It kind of jelled in the last week for me. Senator Dole can step in on day one into the office of the President and be up to speed. He can work with the Senate and with the Congress and that means a lot."
Dwight Sharp voted here for Mr. Buchanan because of the resolve he communicated in his statements about social and economic resentments. But Mr. Sharp admitted that his candidate might not have the stuff to go all the way onto the November ballot.
As for Mr. Dole, Mr. Sharp said: "I just don't think Dole has the excitement or drive, myself. But if he squeaks through to November, I suppose I'll have to go for him."
Similar reasoning was cited outside a voting booth in Petersborough. "I stood behind Buchanan because I feel he stands for what I believe in," said Donna Migneault, a housewife with three children. "But I think Dole has a better chance to beat Clinton."
Joe Cummings said he was originally for Mr. Dole, but switched to Mr. Alexander as the campaign ended. "Dole is a great bureaucrat," he said, "but he doesn't have the vision you need."
Minnie Crane, a retiree, was straight and to the point. "Bob Dole got my vote," Mrs. Crane said. "I followed him right along and stuck with him, and my A.A.R.P. newsletter showed me he's on the right side of the issues."
Doubt about Mr. Dole was expressed by Bob Kunkel, a World War II veteran who voted for Mr. Buchanan: "Buchanan talks of veterans in terms of what services we need. Dole always talks about the war and himself. He seems egotistical."
As a newcomer to the mix, Mr. Alexander often was talked of by voters for his genial style, rather than his less-known positions on specific issues. But Daniel Gleneck, a computer programmer, said he studied the candidate's plan to end welfare and replace it with local charity and found it "too radical."
Mr. Gleneck, who voted for Mr. Buchanan, said, "Alexander proposed giving everything to the states, and I think this is going too far."
Buchanan voters looked beyond the primary with hope that their candidate not flare out with a bang at the August nominating convention, as he did in 1992. Robert Taylor, a 59-year-old dealer in antiques, said he sensed that this time Mr. Buchanan had he power to go all the way and defeat President Clinton.
"I got to try with my vote," Mr. Taylor said, ultimately as uncertain as any other voter outside the ballot booth.

BUCHANAN A NARROW VICTOR OVER DOLE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 20

 BODY:
With the whole nation listening intently, New Hampshire roared once more tonight and delivered a stentorian message that promises confusion for the Republican Party for months to come.
This small, remote state, so difficult to please, so prone to surprise, converted Patrick J. Buchanan from a candidate of protest into a front-runner of sorts. After months of grueling work, Mr. Buchanan, Senator Bob Dole and Lamar Alexander established themselves definitively as the prime contenders, finishing very closely bunched. But most politicians were hard pressed to predict how the contest would unfold in the weeks ahead or to guess the outcome. 
 Gov. John Engler of Michigan, a Republican, said pointedly tonight: "There is a long way to go until nomination. This is an intense three-way fight, and it is going to stay that way for a while."
It was, of course, a big night for Mr. Buchanan and a grim one for Mr. Dole. For the first time, it raised the bare possibility that Mr. Buchanan might win the nomination despite the opposition of most of the party's leaders.
At the very least, he seems likely to carry his candidacy right to the convention in August, with disruptive results. If he is rebuffed and his message of economic nationalism rejected, he could run as a populist third-party candidate.
No Republican has won the Presidency since 1952 without first winning the New Hampshire primary. But Republicans like Henry Cabot Lodge in 1964 have won here and failed to win the nomination.
Mr. Buchanan fired up conservatives, which was the main reason for his victory, but none of the three stirred mainstream Republicans and independents. Because of that and the large field, Mr. Buchanan's winning percentage was one of the smallest in the modern era.
Searching, perhaps, for a hero to worship, a third of those interviewed in an exit poll by the television networks and The Associated Press said they would have voted for Gen. Colin L. Powell had his name been on the ballot.
For the Republican Party, the results afforded little cheer. They suggested that the nominating campaign may last considerably longer than expected, with ideological disputes, mudslinging and endless bickering among the candidates on display week after week. The longer a party takes to agree upon a nominee and unite behind him, the more difficulty it tends to face in November.
Above all, the Republicans want to avoid another 1964, when Barry Goldwater snatched the nomination from under the noses of the party leaders but proved far too right-wing for the country and suffered a disastrous defeat.
Mr. Dole has now been tarred by his rivals as a tainted insider, well past his prime. Mr. Buchanan said on television today that the Senator was "in his declining years." The party's traditional backers on Wall Street and in big business have been alarmed by the rasping populism of Mr. Buchanan. The Republican sweep of November 1994 and the Contract With America have all but faded from public view.
Although Mr. Dole suggested that only he and Mr. Buchanan remained viable contenders, it may be that Mr. Alexander, the former Secretary of Education and Governor of Tennessee, gained the most from today's voting. He fought Mr. Dole and Mr. Buchanan on equal terms, easily eclipsed Steve Forbes for third place, ran significantly better than in Iowa and positioned himself well for primaries to come in his home region.
According to the exit poll, he did well among those who said they were looking for a vision of the future, among moderates and among young people. Four in 10 of Mr. Alexander's backers said they had planned at some point to vote for Mr. Dole.
South Carolina, which votes on March 2, just 11 days from now, could prove crucial for Mr. Alexander, as it did for George Bush in 1988, setting him up for the other Southern primaries later.
But Mr. Alexander needs a victory or a strong second-place finish soon. It is difficult to raise money on the strength of third places, and he is starting to run short of cash.
Senator Dole, a political thoroughbred who for the last week has looked more like a spavined old dray horse, failed in this state for the third time. As in Iowa, he took only a bit more than a quarter of the vote here -- far from impressive for a man with an elaborate organization headed by the popular Republican Governor, Stephen Merrill.
The Kansan, a figure of national prominence for a quarter century, failed utterly to generate excitement on the stump. His constituency remains tilted toward the old and the rich, and the exit poll indicated that about a third of the primary participants believed his age would interfere with his ability to serve as President.
He will be 73 years old in November and would be the oldest man ever elected President if he won. But he has more money on hand than anyone, with the exception of Mr. Forbes, and could still prevail in a war of attrition.
Mr. Buchanan was the only full-throated conservative among the major candidates here, owing to the withdrawal of Senator Phil Gramm of Texas. His economic nationalism, including his advocacy of American withdrawal from Nafta and other trade agreements, transformed the agenda in the final days of the New Hampshire campaign. But it appeared to have solidified rather than greatly expanding his base.
Mr. Buchanan, however, remains locked in a tight ideological box.
The conundrum facing him was evident in the exit poll. By taking unyielding positions, he rallied those who described themselves as very conservative, those who identify with the religious right and those who above all were seeking a candidate with backbone. But several of those groups are minorities that are widely resented.
For example, the religious right gave Mr. Buchanan his most stalwart support, but the exit poll showed that more than half of today's primary voters disliked the group.
Mr. Forbes, a political supernova who looked for a time early this month as if he might emerge as Mr. Dole's main challenger, ran fourth for the second consecutive week, and this time he did not challenge Mr. Alexander for third.
"He's gone," said former Gov. Hugh Gregg of New Hampshire, a Dole supporter.
In normal circumstances, Mr. Forbes would be out of the race. But he has enough money and apparently enough ego to keep going, and he has invested heavily in the Delaware primary, which is Saturday, and the Arizona primary next Tuesday. Mr. Dole is a heavy favorite in the voting in North and South Dakota, close to Kansas, which takes place on the same day as Arizona's primary.
Mr. Forbes was unable to capitalize on his advocacy of a flat tax in a state with a phobia about taxes that is unmatched in the United States, perhaps partly because of Mr. Merrill's advertisements condemning the idea. The millionaire publisher took only 4 votes in 10 among those concerned about taxes, and the votes of those who liked the flat tax better than the present system were split four ways.
The other four Republican candidates, including Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, are considered unlikely to press their campaigns beyond New Hampshire.
Most voters, the exit poll showed, kept an open mind until the waning days of the campaign, despite the onslaught of television advertisements, and did not decide how to vote until after the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 12. Four in 10 said they had decided in the last week, but no candidate benefited disproportionately from that.
Eight years ago, George Bush snatched victory from Mr. Dole in the last 72 hours of the campaign. To the mortification of the Kansan, Mr. Buchanan did the same thing to him this year. Mr. Dole had hoped to banish the ghosts of 1988 and all but insure his nomination with a sweeping triumph that never came. Ever laconic, the Senator said tonight that he knew now "why they call this the Granite State -- it's so hard to crack."
Ralph Waldo Emerson, a Massachusetts man, once wrote sourly: "The God who made New Hampshire taunted the lofty land with little men."
New Hampshire has a way of disappointing the famous and powerful.
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
The primary day poll was based on questionnaires completed by voters as they left voting stations throughout New Hampshire on Tuesday.
The poll was conducted by Voter News Service, an organization created by ABC News, CBS News, CNN, NBC News and The Associated Press.
The results are based on 2,529 Republican primary voters, in 60 randomly selected precincts across the state.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results from such polls should differ by no more than plus or minus three percentage points from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all Republican primary voters who turned out in New Hampshire yesterday.
Results based on smaller subgroups have a larger potential sampling error. In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of voter opinion on Election Day may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
Giggles Intact, Political Satire Is Back on TV

BYLINE: By CARYN JAMES 

 BODY:
"A lot of Republicans do not see Pat Buchanan as a joke, not any longer," Dan Rather said with high anchorman's seriousness on Tuesday night, not long before CBS projected that Mr. Buchanan would win the Republican primary in New Hampshire. Meanwhile, at the Comedy Central channel, which is covering the Presidential campaign under the banner "Indecision '96," the attitude was pretty much "Speak for yourself, Dan." Everyone from President Clinton to Mr. Buchanan becomes material at Comedy Central, and in an era of numbing press overload its coverage sometimes makes more sense than that of humorless reporters. The channel's standard-bearing talk show, "Politically Incorrect," is almost single-handedly reviving political satire on television.
With the comedian Bill Maher as host, "Politically Incorrect" deftly mixes guests from the world of politics and show biz, and keeps them on track as they discuss everything from gun control to the nature of celebrity. The show has become so successful that it has been snatched up by ABC, where it is to follow "Nightline" next year. It will stay on Comedy Central with new shows through the Presidential election. (It is shown every weeknight at 11, though Monday shows are repeats.) 
 Whether such a show can thrive at ABC is a wide-open question. One reason there is so little sharp political satire on television is that the form requires the freedom to take risks. It's no coincidence that satire on broadcast networks has become tame and unfunny, like the "Weekend Update" segment of "Saturday Night Live." The only truly risky satire is on cable, with "Politically Incorrect" and HBO's even edgier "Dennis Miller Live" (Fridays at 11:30). The economic stakes are lower and the language is looser. Bill Maher and Dennis Miller rely on a bluntness (the words "Buchanan" and "white supremacist" are a popular combination on "Politically Incorrect") that is hard to find anywhere else.
But "Politically Incorrect" has pulled off the rare trick of being irreverent without becoming irrelevant. It does this by using a healthy dose of common sense. The show is at its best when Mr. Maher and his guests don't strain to say outrageous things, but merely express what average viewers might have been thinking.
That approach was hilariously evident on Tuesday, when "Politically Incorrect" broke with its format and featured live reports from Chris Rock (once of "Saturday Night Live") in Manchester. It was after 11, Senator Bob Dole had come in second in the primary and Mr. Maher asked the traditional anchorman's question. "Chris, what's the mood there at Dole headquarters?"
"It's total denial," Mr. Rock answered. "It's like a community college pep rally. You'd think they won." That's exactly what some of us have been waiting years to hear a reporter say about a losing candidate's crowd.
On Tuesday, Mr. Maher had two guests instead of four, "one from the left and one from the right," as he put it, which is usually a bad "Crossfire" idea. Heather Richardson Higgins, from the conservative Progress and Freedom Foundation, was backpedaling hard about Mr. Buchanan's victory, insisting "the Republican party will never let him be the candidate." She was sparring with Al Franken, a master television satirist and author, whose new book, "Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations," is a best seller.
Combining entertainment and political observations, the book shares a satiric sensibility with "Politically Incorrect." The title of Mr. Franken's book lets him have it both ways: he gets a cheap laugh, and also parodies the typically low level of political commentary and humor. (What is the title, after all, except a satiric equivalent of those endless Clinton-at-McDonalds jokes?)
"Politically Incorrect" is more impartial; the Republicans just happen to be slugging it out right now. But it relies on Mr. Maher's savvy sense of when to get serious, when to joke and how to combine the two. The show lives or dies on his quick-witted response to guests.
When "Politically Incorrect" moved from New York to Hollywood last month, there was no significant change; it had always relied too much on celebrity guests. Some of them are smart and funny, some wearyingly sincere and some are just airheads. It is Mr. Maher's job to save them from themselves. When the film director Arthur Hiller turned up in the wearyingly sincere category, slowly intoning against Mr. Dole's attacks on Hollywood, Mr. Maher broke in with a lively, "You go, girl!" But on another show, when the actress Maria Conchita Alonso insisted that scientific tests should be done on convicted rapists instead of innocent bunnies, Mr. Maher found it impossible to regain control.
Sometimes an unlikely mix works. Star Jones, from "Inside Edition," and the actor Michael Gross recently took up the issue of a candidate for the Los Angeles Police Department who was turned down because he admitted to telling a racial joke. The question became: "What's worse? Being racist or dishonest about it?" This kind of lucid discussion would be hard to find on any other show.
It's not a good sign that Al Franken, Chris Rock and Dennis Miller are all refugees from the floundering "Saturday Night Live." When "Politically Incorrect" tries to bring its satire back to the networks, it will find out how far irreverence and common sense can go.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Pepsi Courts Myanmar, Preferring Sales to Politics

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

 BODY:
There are not many countries left where you can't buy a bottle of Pepsi-Cola, so when a suitable business partner turned up in the isolated Southeast Asian nation of Myanmar five years ago, Pepsico was eager to set up a bottling plant.
The timing was awkward, though. Almost three years before, in September 1988, an authoritarian Government with military backing choked off democratic protests that had evolved into an uprising, and the country formerly known as Burma was under tight army control. 
 Myanmar became a target of human rights campaigners, who continue to press for the kind of boycott they say helped bring change in South Africa.
Several American companies have pulled out in recent years. Levi Strauss dropped its contract suppliers in Myanmar three years ago. A spokesman, Michael Woo, said the step grew out of "a very serious review of the social and economic and political environment there as well as health and safety issues, the human rights environment and the possible impact on our brand image."
But Pepsico plunged ahead, thereby casting its vote in a long-running debate between boycott and constructive engagement in countries whose human rights policies fall short of American standards.
It is a debate with continuing implications, as American companies search the world for new places to grow -- and new sources of cheap labor. As they do, they face issues of human rights, exploitative working conditions and child labor.
Myanmar is a vexing case. Seven years after the repression of 1988, the military Government has begun to invitingly open the economy even as it clamps down on political opponents. Manufacturers say that the quality of work is consistently high.
American businesses, often out of self-interest, have argued that economic engagement is the quickest route to democracy, and Pepsico takes that view. "International trade over the long term builds understanding and communication," said Elaine Franklin, Pepsico's spokeswoman, citing the company's presence in the Soviet Union before the collapse of Communism. She said Pepsi had started small in Myanmar, with about $8 million in sales in 1994. But Pepsi was there, as elsewhere, she said, for the long haul.
In its global competition with the Coca-Cola Company, Pepsi has the edge in Myanmar, a nation of perhaps 45 million, though Coke has made a little headway in the north, where a thriving border trade has brought cheap goods from China.
A spokeswoman for Coca-Cola, Kathryn Norton, said that for "strictly business" reasons, the company had no plans to enter Myanmar. "Our policy," she said, "is not to involve ourselves in political matters."
Responding to the argument that companies should not dirty their hands with unsavory governments, Ms. Franklin of Pepsico said, "It is pretty arrogant of any company to decide to make its own foreign policy."
United States policy is neither to encourage nor discourage investment. But political sentiment is increasingly running against Myanmar's Government as it continues to stifle opposition led by the Nobel Peace Prize winner Daw Aung San Suu Kyi -- who has said that foreign companies should "jolly well wait" before doing business in her country.
And indeed, measures that would impose economic boycotts are gaining backers in both houses of Congress, with one in the Senate sponsored by Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky.
The Unocal Corporation, with a 28 percent interest in a $1 billion natural-gas pipeline project in Myanmar, is also moving ahead, despite lobbying by rights groups.
Barry Lane, a Unocal spokesman, said that if his company pulled out, another contractor would almost certainly step in. "What good is it going to do for the people of Myanmar by our not being there?" he asked. "We were in Indonesia when Sukarno was there; he put down some uprisings. But incredible improvements have been made there over the years. In the Philippines, we began under the Marcos regime."
But other companies, primarily clothing makers that can more easily transfer operations from country to country, have pulled out -- some citing moral objections, others for business reasons. In addition to Levi Strauss, these include Eddie Bauer, a unit of Spiegel Inc., and Liz Claiborne.
Levi Strauss has been a pioneer in "socially responsible business practices," issuing a set of guidelines in 1992 for its worldwide operations to insure, in the words of its spokesman, Mr. Woo, that its products "are manufactured in a way that is fair and humane and compassionate."
Typically, standards like these are applied to individual factories or local working conditions. Myanmar is a relatively rare case, in which companies have been forced by public lobbying to consider the human rights record of a government.
With most other companies that have withdrawn, human rights did not appear to concern them as much as the risk of bad publicity.
Eddie Bauer, for example, with 411 stores in North America and contract factories worldwide, pulled out of Myanmar last year to "better guarantee deliveries," a spokeswoman, Cheryl Engstrom, said.
In the past, the company has broken its ties with some foreign suppliers because of poor working conditions. But in Myanmar, Ms. Engstrom said, "it is difficult for us, as customers of a factory, to go outside the walls of that factory and begin making determinations about the status of the country."
Instead, she said, the company is concerned that because of growing opposition by the United States Government and human rights groups, "it would become impossible for us to work in Burma in the future."
Myanmar is flanked by nations eager to trade with it, sharply reducing the impact of withdrawals by Americans. It has not become a case on the scale of apartheid-era South Africa, where an international boycott helped end white-minority rule.
As of the last fiscal year, the United States accounted for just 8 percent of the $2.65 billion in investment commitments to Myanmar, with France, Britain, Thailand and Singapore providing most of the rest. China's vigorous cross-border trade is helping to spur the involvement of Southeast Asian nations, which do not want to cede influence to Beijing, the region's giant.
Still, backers of a boycott emphasize human rights concerns. "A lot of people have the attitude that business is business," said Matthew Donohue, a lobbyist with the Burma Action Committee, based in Portland, Ore. "But this is business that by being transacted is directly contributing to arrests and repression."
That is the sort of thing people will "have to start confronting as we move into the global economy," Mr. Donohue added. "We are going to have to assume some responsibility for the effects of the dollars we spend if we are going to consider ourselves to have the kind of moral fiber that traditionally the United States has held."

HEADLINE: The G.O.P.'s Extremism Debate

 BODY:
The famed Eleventh Commandment popularized by Ronald Reagan ("Thou shalt not speak ill of fellow Republicans") takes a beating in most primary campaigns. But not since the Goldwater-Rockefeller contest of 1964 has it been so quickly broken as in this primary season. Following Pat Buchanan's victory in New Hampshire, Bob Dole, Lamar Alexander and the Congressional leadership immediately resorted to the G.O.P.'s rhetorical equivalent of a tactical nuclear weapon against Mr. Buchanan by labeling him an extremist.
The word has been anathema among Republicans because so many of the party's candidates, starting with Barry Goldwater and including Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George Bush, flirted with extremism in their courtship of such factions as the Red-baiters, Southern segregationists, anti-abortionists and religious fundamentalists. Mr. Buchanan is not flirting with extremism so much as dancing with it. He has elevated the taking of far-out positions stated in inflammatory language from an occasional tactic to a constant strategy. 
 Senator Dole led the attack, declaring yesterday that "this is now a race between the mainstream and the extreme" and that Republicans must now decide whether theirs is a "party that keeps people out or brings people in." By implication, he denounced Mr. Buchanan as a "protectionist," an "isolationist," a "fringe candidate" and a "polarizer." Mr. Alexander and his enforcer, Bill Bennett, are using similar language. Last night, Colin Powell said he could not support Mr. Buchanan as the nominee. Mr. Buchanan has dismissed his opponents' comments as the "cuss words of a dying Establishment," while he wowed his ragtag audiences with an image of "peasants with pitchforks" marching on the castle.
Right now the Republican leaders are less worried about pitchforks and protectionism than about a Goldwater-sized defeat in November. If they truly wish to head that off, they should continue to confront Mr. Buchanan over the spirit and shape of their party.
The fine line between being a spokesman for the oppressed and a front man for the dark heart of American bigotry can be a narrow one. In a country as heterogeneous as America, where the economic system dictates that some people will be deemed winners and others losers, there will always be a lot of anger bubbling around the bottom of the melting pot. Hot-button orators like Mr. Buchanan have a particular obligation to make it clear what kinds of behavior and allies they will not tolerate. With his refusal to disown extremist aides and fringe organizations, Mr. Buchanan has shown a tendency to confuse building a "big tent" with sheltering a mob.
For all that, he is the most exciting stump campaigner since the 1980 Reagan race. He is witty, and in the somnolent Mr. Dole and the strait-laced Mr. Alexander, fate has provided him the perfect foils. But Mr. Buchanan is also dangerous, both to the Republican chances of winning the White House and holding the Congress, and to the future of his party.
He is a creature of the storm who is gaining strength because yesterday's consensus front-runner looks more and more like an extinct volcano. Mr. Dole spoke almost wistfully of wanting the G.O.P. to be "the best party in this country, not the narrowest party in this country." By definition that would be a party that attends to the issues of economic justice highlighted by Mr. Buchanan, but does not indulge in his demagogic appeals to those who flirt with repression, bigotry and violence.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls vs. Yen as Rumors Of Intervention Do Not Pan Out

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar slumped against the yen yesterday on signs that the Japanese central bank had not forcefully intervened on the American currency's behalf.
While there were reports that the Japanese were in the market buying dollars, some traders said that effort had no discernible effect, and the bank does not comment on its market activities. 
 On Tuesday, the dollar surged against the yen in Asian trading on reports that the Japanese were buying dollars and on an announcement that Singapore and Hong Kong monetary authorities had agreed to cooperate with Japan in foreign-exchange markets. The dollar retreated late Monday, and yesterday the retreat turned into a loss when no further intervention materialized.
"People bought dollars anticipating the Bank of Japan didn't want it falling and would intervene," said John McCarthy, foreign-exchange manager at ING Capital Markets. "When the B.O.J. didn't come in, it got dicey for the dollar."
Japan wants a weaker yen to make its exports more competitive, bolstering the sluggish economy.
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar fell to 104.98 yen from 105.75 yen on Tuesday. But the dollar rose to 1.4499 marks from 1.4473 marks. The British pound fell to $1.5430 from $1.5450.
The dollar received some support from United States stock markets, which rallied yesterday after recent losses. And the Treasury bond market, particularly hard hit on Tuesday, reversed course, making modest gains.
"The dollar is strongly correlated to U.S. stocks and bonds," said Karl Halligan, a currency trader at CIC Bank in New York. "At the moment, bonds are O.K. so the dollar is, too."
The possibility of further Bank of Japan buying is still buttressing the dollar, traders said. "The market perceives that the B.O.J. has an interest below 105 yen, so that's dollar-supportive," said Dan O'Connell, a currency salesman with the First National Bank of Chicago.
The dollar may also be benefiting from the Japanese bank's determination to keep interest rates low to help the economy pull out of its doldrums, said Wayne Grigull, managing director of foreign exchange at Merrill Lynch. "The B.O.J. has gone to great lengths to assure the market that rates will stay low, and that should continue to support the dollar against the yen," he said.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Heating Oil Prices Rise Sharply On Concerns Over Low Supply

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Heating oil prices surged yesterday, while gold staged a modest recovery.
On other markets, lumber prices tumbled for the third consecutive session. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 17 commodities rose 0.29 point, to 249.93. 
 Heating oil prices rose on expectations that heating oil stocks would drop another 5 million barrels, to two-year lows, with almost a month of winter remaining, said Tim Evans, an analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group.
Heating oil for March delivery rose 2.45 cents, to 58.84 cents a gallon, the highest since it settled at 59.59 cents on Jan. 10. The April crude oil contract, trading as the active contract for the first time, rose to $20 a barrel, but settled with a 44-cent gain at $19.71 a barrel. On Tuesday, the expiring March contract had its sharpest price jump since the Persian Gulf war.
Investors expected the American Petroleum Institute to report after the market closed that stocks of American heating oil and other distillate fuels fell 3 million to 5 million barrels after cold weather last week in the Northeast and Midwest, the nation's largest heating regions. The institute later reported that stockpiles fell last week by 3.9 million barrels, to 103.3 million barrels, the lowest level since April 3, 1994.
The smaller supplies have forced industries and others to pay premium prices for distillates on the cash markets.
Gold prices rose amid renewed expectations the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates soon. Lower interest rates would make gold more competitive with other investments. The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, in remarks to the Senate Banking Committee yesterday, left open the possibility of further rate reductions. A day earlier, he appeared to rule out rate cuts in the short term.
"The single most important thing for gold right now is interest rates," said Dinsa Mehta, senior chief bullion trader at Chase Manhattan. Prices were underpinned by continued declining production in South Africa. The nation's gold production is expected to fall to 416 tons in 1997, its lowest output since 1955, South African officials said.
April gold rose $2.90, to $404 an ounce, at the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
A California initiative would put lawyers to the free-market test.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
SO, who are the good guys in California's battle over limiting legal fees in civil suits? "Consumer attorneys," according to the ads now saturating local television in the Golden State -- the ones "who get unsafe automobiles off the road, protect people's retirement savings from investment frauds and force polluters to pay for cleaning up their poisonous waste."
Who, then, are the bad guys? Check the web site of the Consumer Attorneys of California (http:// www.seamless.com/consumer) for a list of the Silicon Valley movers and shakers underwriting Proposition 202, the initiative on the March 26 ballot that would cap lawyers' fees at 15 percent of the settlement in uncontested cases. Those with remaining doubts need only click on the web site's photo of the locked front gate of Tom Proulx's mansion -- presumably ill-gotten gains that Mr. Proulx, the founder of the Intuit software company and a leading promoter of Proposition 202, hopes to shelter from the wrath of the masses. 
 But you may not wish to rush to judgment. For Proposition 202 is modeled after a contingency fee reform proposal that has drawn support from liberal legal luminaries ranging from Erwin Griswold, the late dean of the Harvard Law School, to Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. And a close look suggests that apart from the vested interests at stake, the core question issue here is whether a free market can deliver legal services at competitive prices.
Proposition 202, one of three ballot initiatives that would radically change the rules for civil suits in California, regulates contingency fees. Typically, individuals suing for damages hire lawyers for a share of the court award or settlement, ranging from one-third to one-half. The advantage of this arrangement is that it doesn't take a deep pocket to go to court, providing the plaintiff can find a lawyer who thinks the case is worth the gamble.
If the market worked according to Adam Smith, however, one would expect the percentage fee to vary with the size and likelihood of the payout. In fact, contingency fees are almost never below one-third, even in cases that produce six- or seven-figure settlements after a brief negotiation. And Lester Brickman, a specialist in contingency fees at the Cardozo Law School at Yeshiva University in New York, thinks he knows why. "Lawyers hardly ever compete over price," he says. "Have you ever seen an ad for a lawyer that even mentioned the size of the fee?"
Proposition 202 would require a plaintiff's lawyer to solicit a settlement offer from the defendant. If the defendant made an offer within 60 days that was acceptable to the plaintiff, the lawyer's fee would be capped at 15 percent. If the defendant ignored the solicitation, there would be no restriction on the fee a lawyer could demand to pursue the case. But if an offer were made and the plaintiff rejected it, his lawyer could only reap bigger contingency payments on awards that exceeded the original offer.
Say a defendant's insurance company offers to settle for $100,000 and the plaintiff nonetheless decides to go to court, where he wins a judgment of $150,000. The plaintiff lawyer's fee would be capped at 15 percent of the first $100,000, plus whatever split he had negotiated with his client on the next $50,000.
Cases would be settled earlier, predicts Professor Brickman, and less of the proceeds would go to lawyers. More important, risks and fees would be linked in a logical way. "The premium for contingency," wrote Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun in 1987, "compensates for the risk of nonpayment if the suit does not succeed."
The fee cap would, no doubt, change the relationship between client and lawyer. Louis Storrow, a plaintiff lawyer in Carlsbad, Calif., who opposes the initiative, argues that it would create a "wedge between the client's interest and the attorney's interest." It would give lawyers an incentive, he contends, to press for quick settlements so they could collect an easy 15 percent and go onto the next case.
But Professor Brickman notes there is an inherent division of interest between lawyers and their clients, no matter how the fee is structured: hourly fees, the norm for lawyers in most other circumstances, create incentives to sell more services than necessary. And very few people in the market for legal help have the information needed to keep their lawyers on short leashes. Better, then, he suggests, to push the bias toward less protracted skirmishes using fewer legal resources.
For those who suspect that Proposition 202 amounts to a conspiracy against consumers, it may be reassuring that the lawyers who represent corporations -- California's Association of Defense Counsel -- oppose the ballot measure, too. "The initiative process is an unwieldy mechanism, at best, to enact complex laws," explains Julia Molander, a San Francisco defense lawyer.
The one thing everyone agrees on, it seems, is that Proposition 202 means less business for lawyers. And what's so bad about that?

HEADLINE: My Spy Story

BYLINE: By Frank Smyth; Frank Smyth has written for Foreign Affairs and other journals.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
After several days in a prison near Baghdad in 1991, I was told "they" wanted to see me. Blindfolded, I was led into a room where, judging from the voices, there were at least half a dozen men. For days, I had heard and sometimes watched as guards beat and tortured Iraqi prisoners.
The translator asked what my "real job" was. "I'm a reporter" for The Village Voice and CBS News Radio, I said. He translated my response in Arabic. I heard the reply from a man whose voice sounded older and less sympathetic. "You're lying," the translator echoed in English. "Tell us about your relationship with the C.I.A." I had none. 
 The interrogation lasted two hours. I was not abused. The Iraqis found me guilty of entering their country without a visa: I had admitted sneaking in from Syria after the Persian Gulf war with Kurdish guerrillas who wanted to overthrow President Saddam Hussein. As for the charge of being a C.I.A. agent, I remained "under suspicion," I was told. A week later, Iraq let me leave.
Last week, a blue-ribbon panel, sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations, proposed repealing a 19-year policy that prevents C.I.A. agents from posing as representatives of the working press.
Part of the panel's rationale is that the C.I.A.'s use of American embassies as a cover won't wash any longer. Skeptical foreign officials are asking why an embassy that issues relatively few visas has so many consular officials, why the political section has doubled in size or whether that new department is really doing economic research.
The panel director, Richard N. Haass, a former member of the National Security Council, asks whether precluding the use of journalism as a cover "is a luxury the United States can still afford." (Leslie H. Gelb, a former New York Times columnist who is president of the Council on Foreign Relations, disagrees with the proposal.)
 The C.I.A. supposedly terminated the practice in 1977, but last month the agency admitted that the practice has continued -- on extraordinarily rare occasions, it says.
If the Iraqis had been aware of this during the war, any of the 47 or so journalists picked up and held by authorities might not have come back. (One didn't: Gad Gross, a freelance photographer, was executed minutes after soldiers captured him.)
If agents began regularly passing themselves off as reporters again, governments around the globe could easily accuse almost any American reporter of being a C.I.A. plant. The burden of proof would fall on the journalist to demonstrate that he or she is not a spy.
The council's proposal, if adopted, would make it easy for any hostile official who fears inquiries by the foreign press to accuse reporters of being spies. The most probing reporters may well be denied entry or expelled.
The council's panel concluded that if spooks could get press credentials, the C.I.A. would be more effective. But many academics and policy makers seem to agree that the information available in the media is often as good as, if not better than, that found in classified C.I.A. documents. Aren't many offices in the Pentagon and elsewhere always tuned to CNN?
Allowing C.I.A. agents to pose as journalists not only needlessly puts reporters at risk but also undermines their ability to report foreign news properly or at all, limiting the information available to policy makers and the public. Instead of rehabilitating this passe cold war practice, the C.I.A. should be ordered to end it for real.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
The cruise industry is moving toward more campaigns in the face of declining business.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
INDIVIDUAL cruise lines are advertising more than ever. And if the industry as a group can reconcile the conceptual and financial differences, another $10 million in ads will come onto the airwaves in each of the next three years.
The proposed industry campaign is motivated largely by something the industry never planned on -- the sudden end to years of unbroken growth, which from 1970 through 1993 averaged 10 percent a year compounded. But in 1994 the number of passengers fell a little, by one-half 1 percent, and preliminary figures indicate a falloff of as much as 3 percent last year. 
 To stem the erosion this year, when seven new ships will add 13,000 berths, the 26-member Cruise Lines International Association invited bids on a campaign to spend a minimum of $30 million over the next three years. It is meant to tout the value of cruise vacations and to attract first-time passengers. That latter goal is especially important, because association research shows that only 8 percent of Americans have ever been on a cruise.
After selecting 10 agencies early last December, the association narrowed the list to two by the end of the year: Harris Drury Cohen of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners of New York. A final selection was expected this month, after both agencies made presentations before the cruise line association's managing committee in late January.
But the decision was postponed, at least until the next committee meeting in June, when the expected harmony foundered over how much each cruise line would contribute to the ad campaign and over whether to seek financing from a cooperative partner, such as a credit card company. There was even apparent disagreement over the direction the proposed campaign should take.
"The management committee liked the presentations," said James G. Godsman, president of the association, "but they suggested a number of refinements to make them acceptable to all the members." He added that he expected adoption of an ad campaign in June, but acknowledged that it would miss the prime summer cruise season and possibly next fall as well. However, some cruise officials doubt that the campaign -- the largest in cruise line history -- will ever be put into effect.
Whether it is or is not, individual lines are spending millions of dollars promoting their new ships, because some of them are now big enough to benefit from economies of scale.
Overseas Shipholding Group's Celebrity Cruises, for example, which launched the Century (1,750 passengers) last December and will launch an equally big liner in both December 1996 and December 1997, is advertising on television for the first time.
"We are increasing the advertising budget by 50 percent over last year," said Al Wallack, senior vice president of marketing and passenger services, "with the incremental monies being put into broadcast -- specifically, national cable and targeted broadcast." That campaign, began Jan. 6, will continue throughout the year.
Royal Caribbean introduced the Legend of the Seas last April and will add two new ships this year, two in 1997 and one in 1998 -- all six of them big enough to carry 1,800 to 2,000 passengers. Accordingly, the cruise line increased its advertising budget by 6 to 7 percent this year, to about $40 million -- half in network television, 25 percent in newspapers and the remainder in consumer and travel trade magazines.
"We've also invested about $1 million in creating and staffing our new web site," said Rod McLeod, the head of sales, marketing and passenger services.
Carnival's Holland America, which has doubled its fleet to eight ships in the last four years, is running two campaigns. The first, directed at travel agents, features ads in trade publications from last September through this April. The campaign is partly intended to welcome the M.S. Veendam, scheduled for delivery on April 30.
The other campaign, the biggest television advertising campaign in Holland America's history, is on network and cable channels and will continue all year. Developed by Omnicom Group's Elgin Syferd/DDB Needham of Seattle, the commercials were shot aboard the M.S. Statendam using an 85-foot telescopic crane with a 35-millimeter motion picture camera attached -- a feature that allowed for close-ups and panoramic shots of the ship in one sweeping motion.
Carnival Cruise Lines, the industry giant, is running a multimillion-dollar campaign in People magazine, from Jan. 29 through Nov. 25. Carnival's first magazine ad purchase since 1990, and the biggest media buy placed exclusively in People, which is owned by Time Warner, the campaign was created by HMV/ McFarland & Drier of Miami. It will consist of 38 full-page spreads and 19 different ads, each of which asks (and presumes to answer), "What's your idea of fun?"

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Rise in Price, Ending Slide

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
What a difference a day makes.
Treasury prices rose slightly yesterday, halting a four-day slide. Market participants were encouraged by comments by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, whose remarks on Tuesday had disappointed those betting on a cut in short-term interest rates. 
 While the comments of Mr. Greenspan yesterday did not differ significantly from his testimony on Tuesday, market participants reconsidered the Fed chairman's words in a more positive light.
"The Fed chairman must have had trouble sleeping last night, because he sounded a little more conciliatory today," said Jack Ablin, director of fixed-income and senior fund manager at the Private Bank at Bank of Boston.
Appearing before the Senate Banking Committee yesterday, Mr. Greenspan said that since the economy rarely faced more than a 50 percent chance of recession he was generally inclined to think it would forge ahead.
His comments suggested to market participants that a rate cut could still come soon if inflation remained subdued.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 11/32 yesterday, to 95 3/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.37 percent, from 6.40 percent on Tuesday.
On Tuesday, the price of the long bond tumbled 2 points. While the Treasury market had been soft in previous sessions because of concerns over supply and because of selling by large hedge funds unwinding yen-financed trades, Mr. Greenspan's testimony that day accelerated the market's decline.
Still, Mr. Ablin of the Private Bank noted the Fed chairman's comments on Tuesday were "still consistent with his overall strategy and that is to have more flexibility going forward by characterizing the economy as better than the market perceives."
The reaction by the market to Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Ablin said, reflected in part its anxiety over delays in data caused by the Government's recent partial shutdown.
"Part of the problem is that market was relying on his intake, since conventional wisdom tells us that the chairman has sources of information that are perhaps unavailable to the market in general," Mr. Ablin said.
In other market activity, the Treasury announced that it would sell $18.25 billion of new two- and five-year notes at auction next Tuesday and Wednesday. In when-issued trading yesterday, the new two-year notes were being offered at a price to yield 5.15 percent and the five-year notes at a price to yield 5.54 percent.
Today, the Treasury is selling $29 billion of 55-day cash management bills. The Government often sells the cash management bills to meet cash flow shortages when it has interest and principal payments.
In the corporate sector of the market, J. P. Morgan was the lead underwriter in GE Global Insurance's first bond offering. It is the largest long-bond offering for an insurance company. The $600 million sale of 7 percent fixed-rate notes due in 2026 was priced at 99.05, to yield 7.077 percent, or about 64 basis points more than a Treasury security with a similar maturity. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
In the futures market, which often has an impact on the cash Treasury market, the March 30-year bond contract closed at a price of 116 5/32, after hitting a high of 116 29/32.
Robin Mesch, chief fixed-income analyst with Thomson Research of Boston, said that "the long-term uptrend had reached a critical juncture at a price of 115 20/32 on the March contract."
"The initial reaction off this level yesterday showed there was an extreme interest in buying at this price point, as the market opened a full point higher in early trading," she said.

HEADLINE: What Buchanan Owes Clinton

BYLINE: By Jagdish Bhagwati; Jagdish Bhagwati, a professor of economics at Columbia, is the author of "Protectionism."

 BODY:
Patrick J. Buchanan's stump speeches calling for trade protectionism have taken on a life of their own even though they have been denounced by most mainstream policy wonks and politicians. He has used the issue to win the New Hampshire primary and has found that even Senator Bob Dole has borrowed part of his platform.
Yet Mr. Buchanan's specific prescriptions owe much to those very wonks and politicians -- many in the Clinton Administration -- who find his agenda appalling. He found the ammunition for his campaign without difficulty in his opponents' backyards. 
 Mr. Buchanan thinks that Japan is an unfair trader. His prescription: Bash it with 10 percent tariffs on every Japanese import.
I have a sense not of outrage but of deja vu. James Fallows once wrote a pair of influential articles in The Atlantic Monthly urging the "containment" of Japan. Among his remedies: precisely the retaliatory tariff that Mr. Buchanan espouses!
And Mr. Fallows's idea was not new. It had been suggested by Rudiger Dornbusch, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist.
Their conviction that Japan was an exclusionary importer and a predatory exporter has since been shared by other left-of-center journalists, including Robert Kuttner of The American Prospect and Michael Lind and John Judis of The New Republic.
As a Presidential candidate, Bill Clinton sought votes by catering to this prejudice. His platform, "Putting People First," promised legislation that would permit us to name Japan an "unfair trader" and to unleash retaliatory tariffs against it.
As President-elect, he appointed economists such as Laura Tyson, head of the National Economic Council, who shared these views. Unsurprisingly, Washington's think tanks suddenly had surprising converts to the cause of punitive tariffs against Japan.
But the get-tough policy with Japan failed miserably. The February 1994 summit meeting between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Clinton in Washington collapsed over our demands that Japan meet numerical import targets in specific sectors.
So did the May 1995 automobile trade talks. President Clinton threatened punitive tariffs on 13 models of Japanese luxury cars. In the end, he capitulated, with only a few paltry face-saving "concessions" from the Japanese.
Thanks to a passive press, somehow these failures turned into public relations successes. And the politics seemed to work to President Clinton's advantage. The thought that Japan-bashing pays politically could not have escaped Mr. Buchanan. He simply is much more forthright about it.
Such bashing is not the only element of his protectionism that derives from mainstream ideas. He also opposes the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the World Trade Organization, multilateral trade agreements first opposed by environmental and labor groups.
These groups first vilified the GATT as Gatt-zilla. They may shudder at Mr. Buchanan's prominence now, but he has taken their issues and turned them into a Presidential campaign.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE UNIONS;
Labor Leader Calls Buchanan Workers' Enemy

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: BAL HARBOUR, Fla., Feb. 21

 BODY:
A day after Patrick J. Buchanan won the New Hampshire primary by campaigning as a champion of workers' concerns, the leader of the American labor movement denounced the Republican candidate as racist, anti-Semitic and opposed to the interests of American workers.
John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., asserted that Mr. Buchanan only pretended to be a friend of workers, saying the candidate not only wanted to weaken occupational safety rules but also opposed an increase to the minimum wage and laws that would make it easier for workers to join unions. 
 "Saying Patrick Buchanan speaks for workers is like saying the Ayatollah Khomeini speaks for priests and rabbis," Mr. Sweeney said today at a meeting of the A.F.L.-C.I.O executive council here. "I don't think working Americans are going to be fooled by a Presidential candidate who talks the talk, but won't walk the walk."
Mr. Sweeney spearheaded a coordinated attack on Mr. Buchanan by union leaders here, with many of them voicing frustration and anger that the candidate had stolen labor's oratory to appear as the advocate of millions of workers who are anxious about falling wages and layoffs.
Steven Rosenthal, the A.F.L.-C.I.O political director, said: "It's like a wolf in sheep's clothing. He wants American workers to think he has the answers. But he has not put forward one proposal that's good for American workers."
Mr. Sweeney faulted Mr. Buchanan for embracing the same economic theories advocated by President Ronald Reagan, which the labor leader said "have transferred billions of dollars from the tattered pocketbooks of middle-income Americans to the silk-lined purses of the rich over the past 15 years."
"Patrick Buchanan is a racist, he's anti-Semitic, he bashes women right along with labor and immigration, and he's a believer in supply-side economics," Mr. Sweeney asserted. "We are none of those things."
At a breakfast with reporters on Monday, Mr. Sweeney said he broadly agreed with Mr. Buchanan's calls for scrapping the North American Free Trade Agreement and the World Trade Organization. But today, he distanced himself from Mr. Buchanan on trade, saying that unlike the Republican the federation favored open markets and that it opposed Nafta for reasons different from Mr. Buchanan's.
"Expanding our exports means good jobs, and we're for it," he said. "But we have to demand that we are not discriminated against in foreign markets."
At their meeting today, the executive council's 54 members approved the federation's most ambitious campaign plans ever, vowing to raise $35 million to educate Americans on pro-union issues and help Democratic House candidates.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Says Further Cut in Rates Is Possible

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
Helping to calm jittery financial markets, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told the Senate Banking Committee today that further rate cuts are possible as long as inflation stays low.
While Mr. Greenspan's overall testimony was little different from his statements that spooked the markets on Tuesday, investors nonetheless seized on the Fed chairman's comments today to bid up both bond and stock prices. 
 "The most probable outcome is coming out of this soft patch into moderate growth with low inflation," Mr. Greenspan said. But if the economy fails to improve as expected, Mr. Greenspan indicated that the Fed stood ready to respond with further stimulus.
"If we envisage that inflationary pressures are significantly subdued, it would not be inconsistent to move rates lower, as we did on Jan. 31," he said.
Analysts suggested that Mr. Greenspan, aware of how closely his comments are followed, may have been playing to the markets after the negative assessment of his remarks to a House subcommittee the day before in which he described the economy as "on track for sustained growth." Many investors took that to mean that the easing of monetary policy they had been counting on was less likely to happen soon.
Paul L. Kasriel, chief domestic economist for the Northern Trust Company, said that Mr. Greenspan said similar things both days but that on Tuesday he neglected to say the more or less obvious -- that the economy's condition might still allow for another round of rate cuts.
Indeed, Mr. Greenspan's statement today that the economy is "going through a significant soft patch," was remarkably similar to Tuesday's characterization of "soft" conditions that would likely prove temporary.
"Luckily he got another chance today," Mr. Kasriel said.
John R. Williams, a senior economist at Bankers Trust, echoed those comments, saying that it would be a mistake to regard Mr. Greenspan's confidence about the economy's underlying health as ruling out rate cuts should conditions dictate.
Mr. Greenspan also took the opportunity to comment in an unusually direct way on the market swing, attributing the slump in the bond market in the last week to a growing fear that Congress and the Clinton Administration would fail to reach a budget agreement, rather than as a signal that inflation was picking up.
Ebbing of budgetary resolve, Mr. Greenspan told the committee, was "to a large extent" the reason for the bond market deterioration.
Without identifying any other specific factors, he also referred to the possibility that both bonds and gold prices might be reacting to what many investment professionals believe to be the political ascendancy of Patrick J. Buchanan.
Much of Wall Street worries not only about Mr. Buchanan's protectionist attitude toward trade but the prospect that his strong showing increases the re-election prospects of President Clinton.
Enlarging on comments he made Tuesday, Mr. Greenspan expressed skepticism about President Clinton's suggestion that the rapid spread of information and other technology has markedly raised the economy's ability to grow faster without re-igniting inflation.
Mr. Greenspan said one problem was that it took some time for new technology to show up in increased national productivity -- the only source of growth other than an expanding work force -- because much of it does not mesh with the infrastructure to which it is applied. He cited as an example the invention of the electric motor, which was well developed in the late 19th century but that did not produce dramatic productivity gains until companies fully harnessed it in the 1920's.
Another reason to be cautious, Mr. Greenspan said, is a lack of enough people trained in the use of the new technology, which is refined so quickly that even skilled workers become anxious about their jobs.
Until the fruits of technology became statistically evident, Mr. Greenspan said, it would be too risky to base policy on its supposed contribution to a rising standard of living.
Without mentioning Mr. Buchanan or anyone else in the Republican Presidential field by name, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, who left the race after the Iowa caucuses, lobbed Mr. Greenspan a question about protectionism and the chairman said it was "the last thing" one would do if the goal was to raise productivity. This is because putting tariffs or quotas on foreign goods reduces competition at home, he said.
"When I was in the private sector I hated competition," said the one-time New York economic consultant. But, he said, "I recognized that it made me work better."
Senator Paul Sarbanes, a liberal Democrat from Maryland, pressed Mr. Greenspan to take out some additional "insurance" against an economic downturn, reminding the Fed chairman that he saw no recession in August or October of 1990 even though it was subsequently determined that a mild recession had already begun in July of that year.
Mr. Greenspan responded by saying he defined "recession" somewhat more rigorously to refer to a period in which there is a "tearing" of the fabric of economic relations that induces "implosion" or a decline that feeds on itself, a condition he said was not apparent in the summer of 1990.

HEADLINE: Sears Moves To Shed Stake In Prodigy

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS 

 BODY:
And now it is Prodigy's turn.
In the latest sign of upheaval in the computer on-line industry, Prodigy Services, the nation's third-largest consumer on-line information service, was put up for sale yesterday -- at least the half owned by Sears, Roebuck & Company. I.B.M., Sears's longtime partner in Prodigy, declined to comment on its own plans for the service, which has 1.7 million subscribers. 
 Sears's move came just a day after H & R Block Inc. announced it planned to spin off its Compuserve division, the second-largest service.
It might seem odd that these market leaders would want to leave the field, in light of phenomenal growth that saw total on-line subscribers in the United States nearly double last year, to 11.3 million. But with the market booming, analysts say, now may be the best time to sell out for companies not fully committed to the increasingly competitive and volatile business of putting consumers in cyberspace.
Sears, which analysts say had pumped about $600 million into Prodigy, indicated yesterday that it remained a retailer first and foremost, and H & R Block said on Tuesday that it wanted to focus on its tax-return business.
America Online Inc., the country's largest on-line service, with more than five million subscribers, has no other lines of business. But even it has been forced to scramble full time to keep up with the needs of increasingly sophisticated, ever- more-demanding consumers. Among other changes, America Online recently set up a separate company to provide direct connections to the global Internet for subscribers who choose to bypass America Online's own, proprietary lineup of information and entertainment services, discussion groups and other offerings.
As hardly a week goes by without a new alliance, acquisition or rumor of yet another change in the on-line industry, analysts acknowledge that the millions of Americans with computers and modems could become confused. But the upheaval, driven by competition, will ultimately be good for consumers, many analysts say.
"There's an ever-increasing number of options for consumers, in both the on-line services and the Internet," said Adam Schoenfeld, vice president of Jupiter Communications Inc., a research company specializing in Internet and on-line businesses. "The breakneck pace of innovation will lead to lower prices and more variety."
And what happens if your on-line company should change owners or disappear altogether? "I don't think users should concern themselves with the business tribulations of these companies," Mr. Schoenfeld said. "If your company goes out of the business, there are plenty of others waiting to take you."
But certainly, the on-line lineup is in flux. Since the beginning of this year, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has effectively shelved what was left of the former Delphi on-line service; AT&T has pulled the plug on its Interchange Network; the General Electric Company has unloaded its Genie service; Apple Computer Inc. said it was re-evaluating its support for eWorld, and the Microsoft Corporation told developers of information services for its Microsoft Network to redirect their efforts and create offerings for the World Wide Web.
Analysts cite a variety of reasons for the tumult, including intense competition, the high cost of development, competition from Internet access providers who bypass consumer services like Prodigy and America Online, and recent passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
"It's not a coincidence that these announcements happened right after the passage of the telecom bill," said Rod Kuckro, editor of the Information & Interactive Services Report.
The Telecommunications Act, recently signed by President Clinton, allows the big telephone and communications companies to expand beyond their traditional businesses and begin developing their own on-line information services.
"It's cheaper to buy a system with established customers than it is to build one from scratch, and the only companies that can afford to buy a stake in these on-line services and develop their infrastructure are the big telecom companies," Mr. Kuckro said. AT&T has been rumored to be a possible buyer of Sears's share of Prodigy.
Mr. Kuckro also noted the attractive demographic profiles of on-line service subscribers, who tend to be affluent and well educated -- people who are likely to buy advanced telecommunications services.
"Prodigy does not fit into Sears's long-term strategy for growth," Arthur C. Martinez, chairman and chief executive of the world's second-largest retailer, told financial analysts in New York yesterday.
Executives from both Sears and I.B.M. praised the evolution of Prodigy under its chief executive, Edward Bennett, a former cable TV executive at Viacom Inc. who was hired last year by Prodigy. Mr. Bennett made Prodigy the first of the big on-line services to offer its subscribers access to the Internet and the World Wide Web, an Internet service that reduces formerly complex computer commands to a point-and-click navigational system.
Since 1993, when the Internet's World Wide Web service suddenly became popular, analysts have been suggesting that the wide-open, global Web would overtake and overwhelm the smaller, proprietary services like Compuserve and Prodigy. The consumer services differ from the Internet in that they require special software, unique to each service, to tap into that service's private data bases of news, features, discussion groups and other on-line offerings.
Even with the Web, though, many analysts say the Internet is still too difficult to use. Services like Prodigy, Compuserve and America Online hide the Internet's complexity behind their own, easy-to-use software and back it with customer support systems that the Internet lacks.
"We remain convinced that the most compelling choice for the mass-market consumer is still on-line services," Brian C. Oakes, an analyst with J. P. Morgan Securities Inc., wrote to investors last month.
Sears's decision to sell Prodigy may be partly to capitalize on the potentially high value that an on-line system might command in the marketplace today. It is also, however, the culmination of a three-year program to return to its retailing roots. Sears has already spun off Allstate and Dean Witter, Discover & Company, its former insurance and financial services subsidiaries, and even sold the Sears Tower building in Chicago.
In yesterday's meeting with analysts, Mr. Martinez made no reference to electronic commerce.
But speaking to reporters afterward, Mr. Martinez said that if Sears were to become involved in selling over the Internet, it would be better for the company not to be tied to a single service like Prodigy.
Sears, like H & R Block, may also be eager to unload its on-line venture in what has become an increasingly hostile legal environment. Prodigy was sued for $200 million last year by a Long Island investment bank that accused it of libel, based on comments posted on the service by a subscriber. The suit was dropped, but a judge left open the question of whether Prodigy was liable.
 Compuserve, meanwhile, is under fire in Germany for providing children access to the Internet, which carries some pornography and hate literature. And all on-line services are challenging the Communications Decency Act, part of the new telecom law, which sets heavy fines and prison terms for the transmission of "patently offensive" material.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE PRESIDENT;
Quiet Glee Over G.O.P. Demolition Derby

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
President Clinton steered determinedly away from an assessment of the Republican Presidential field today, saying, "This country doesn't need another pundit." But his aides and advisers were as jubilant as if Mr. Clinton himself was the only victor in New Hampshire.
The President, after all, has campaign money in the bank. He is free from the Democratic Party's tradition of debilitating Presidential primary challenges. 
 And now the White House is watching the Republicans tear themselves apart in a bitter battle that Democrats believe will weaken the eventual Republican nominee and give Patrick J. Buchanan at the very least a strong role at the G.O.P. convention that will play into Democratic attempts to paint the Republicans as "extremists."
"If you liked what you saw in Houston in '92, you're going to love what you'll see in San Diego in '96," said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the general chairman of the Democratic National Committee. He referred to Mr. Buchanan's 1992 convention speech in which he declared that a religious and cultural war was under way in the nation.
For now, of all the Republican candidates, only former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee concerns the White House. "To have a moderate Southern governor with a huge wave of excitement behind him could be a problem," cautioned one of the President's advisers.
Publicly Mr. Clinton and the White House staff refused even to discuss the Republican field today, part of a strategy of keeping Mr. Clinton above the fray and Presidential.
"I'm going to be President and go out there and tell the people what I'm trying to do and what I will do if given a greater opportunity to do it," Mr. Clinton said, ducking questions about the Republican showing in New Hampshire. "I'm not going to get involved in their business."
In fact, the President's strategists see a two-phase campaign ahead and believe that Mr. Clinton may be waging the most important phase right now: an effort to pull his favorable ratings up so high that he will seem like the inevitable winner. That will, they hope, inoculate him for the second phase of the campaign that will come once the Republicans settle on a nominee.
"Seeing how venomously the Republicans attack each other, he's certainly prepared to face that kind of attack himself," the White House press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, said this week.
To raise his standing before the campaign is engaged directly, Mr. Clinton plans to run what his aides describe as a modified Rose Garden strategy through mid-April. It calls for him to rise above the negative tone of the Republican race by using the trappings and majesty of incumbency and restricting his campaigning to jaunts like his sweep through New Hampshire last Saturday.
"Americans don't like politics these days," said Don Fowler, the national chairman of the Democratic Party. "The longer he can be Presidential and not political, the more they will like him. It's that simple."
Already, the Democratic National Committee has helped Mr. Clinton raise his ratings through an aggressive use of early television advertising tied to the budget debate and featuring Mr. Clinton on topics ranging from Medicare to the environment to education.
Since the fall in swing electoral states, the party has been running a series of 30-second commercials that have added up to a $17 million television campaign. And because the ads do not call for Mr. Clinton's re-election, they do not count against campaign spending limits.
Now, moving forward from the budget debate, Mr. Clinton will try to use his bully pulpit to emphasize a Democratic "values agenda" to Lcompete on the field of social issues that Republicans have long made their own. His agenda is largely family based and children oriented, to appeal to people who feel that politics do not affect their own lives.
Advisers expect this Rose Garden phase of the campaign to culminate in state visits to Japan and Russia in April, majestic occasions high on ceremony and news coverage. By then, because of this year's unusually early primary schedule, the Republican nominee could be chosen.
Once his opponent is clear, Mr. Clinton will formally begin his campaign, officially announcing his re-election bid and putting in place a senior staff at Clinton-Gore campaign headquarters.
But that staff will be subordinate to the White House, where the deputy chief of staff, Harold M. Ickes, will be running the day-to-day campaign. Dick Morris, the Democrat-turned Republican consultant who worked for Mr. Clinton in his early campaigns in Arkansas, will run the media campaign and help Mr. Clinton shape his overarching message.
Most incumbent Presidents try to trade on the glory of the office, and Mr. Clinton's current tactics could seem to resemble those of George Bush, who made the mistake of lingering too long in the Rose Garden.
Mr. Clinton began fund-raising last April, far earlier than recent incumbents, in part to scare off any Democratic primary challenger. As a result, the President all but wrapped up his primary season money raising by the New Year's -- months before Mr. Bush did four years ago.
The President has brought in $27 million in contributions and is receiving about $11 million in federal matching money, said his finance director, Terence R. McAuHliffe. A couple more mail appeals are planned to bring in the remaining few million dollars allowed before the campaign reaches the ceiling set by public finance laws. So far the campaign reports spending little more than $6 million.
By contrast, the President's aides calculate, the Republican nominee will be hard pressed for resources to get through the long period until the August conventions, after which the two political parties start pumping money into the Presidential race.
Though much could still go wrong for the President -- the steady drone of Whitewater hearings, the economy, Bosnia -- his aides say they believe that they will be tactically well positioned.
"Let's say it's Dole," said one Clinton adviser, who predicted that Senator Bob Dole would bounce back from his second place finish in New Hampshire. "He will probably have very little money left to spend. So April through the convention he has a tough time buying any TV, staffing, or paying for a campaign plane. We will be flush with cash to do what we need to do."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE OVERVIEW;
SOME REPUBLICANS HOPING FOR A WAY TO STOP BUCHANAN

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 21

 BODY:
Jolted by Patrick J. Buchanan's triumph in the New Hampshire primary, Republicans around the country, including Gen. Colin L. Powell, today plunged into a furious debate over how Mr. Buchanan emerged and how he could be stopped.
Before racing from this state to campaign in next Tuesday's primary in South Dakota, where he tried to put his defeat behind him, Senator Bob Dole declared at a news conference here, "This now is a race between the mainstream and the extreme, that's what it's all about." 
 Indeed, the struggle broke out in earnest as a parade of moderate and conservative Republicans -- from members of Congress to state party leaders, and from mayors to grass-roots political workers -- said they could not support Mr. Buchanan and ridiculed his positions as anathema to the party's mainstream.
Breaking his silence about the Presidential contest since he announced last November not to run himself, General Powell, the retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said today: "Pat sometimes gives out messages that are of intolerance, which I think is very unfortunate. This is not the time for intolerance. This is the time for inclusion."
In an Iinterviewed on the ABC News program "Prime Time Live," he added, "We can't pull up our drawbridges and withdraw back into our own continent."
In a series of interviews, many Republicans who only a few weeks ago believed that Mr. Dole had the nomination cinched said today that they now consider it up for grabs. Mr. Buchanan's dizzying rise, they said, has had as much to do with the appeal of his message and his own political skills as the weaknesses in the entire Republican field.
But they said they were worried that Mr. Buchanan could fracture the party -- and cripple its prospects to win back the White House -- because of his support for a protectionist trade policy and an isolationist foreign policy, and for what many of his detractors decribe as his trail of racist remarks.
"I believe we have to make sure that Bob Dole's message of inclusion prevails," said Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine, who is supporting Mr. Dole. "It's absolutely essential for the future of the Republican Party."
Senator John McCain of Arizona, who was national chairman of Senator Phil Gramm's aborted Presidential campaign and who now backs Mr. Dole, said: "I don't know if he's unacceptable. There are positions he's taken which I have strong disagreements with. But I can't say we'd not respect the primary process."
Mayor Rudolph W. Guiliani of New York, who has stayed neutral in the race, put it bluntly: "We're going to do everything we can to stop Buchanan."
Former Vice President Dan Quayle complained: "There are a lot of nervous Nellies; there's a lot of hand-wringing going on. This is a wake-up call, folks. We're going to have to live with it, adjust and go on."
Mr. Quayle, who last year had considered making his own run for the 1996 nomination, lectured the Republicans who are in the race, saying they should have stuck with attacking President Clinton, not one another, and had become victims of their own negative campaigns.
"Clinton is the ultimate opponent and he has been missing from the debate," he said. Without irony, Mr. Quayle reprised a phrase of President George Bush's: "It's called 'the vision thing' -- they have to clearly spell out and articulate what they'll do for America."
Out on the hustings today, the candidates -- campaigning from South Carolina to South Dakota -- hardly heeded Mr. Quayle's warning. They went right back on the attack, with Mr. Dole and former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee calling on each other to quit the race.
Mr. Buchanan, meanwhile, relished the attention, predicting that his victory here would become "a legend in political history."
But even a Republican who sounded somewhat sympathetic to Mr. Buchanan, Representative Ernest Jim Istook Jr. of Oklahoma, said he was worried that the party would rip itself apart over Mr. Buchanan.
"I'm concerned over the different competitors that seem to want to join in bashing Buchanan, label him an extremist or any other such term," Mr. Istook said. "I think that's a major mistake. If you do that, you're also passing on that same label to the substantial number of people who are supporting him. Are you going to say that Republican voters are extremist just because he's touched a responsive chord with them?"
Nor were many Republicans particularly confident that Mr. Dole or Mr. Alexander, who finished third in the New Hampshire primary, could stop attacking each other long enough to slow Mr. Buchanan.
One important dynamic in the coming days will be whether Republicans who oppose Mr. Buchanan rally to Mr. Dole or view him as so damaged that they turn to Mr. Alexander.
Campaigning in Vermont, Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, who trailed in fifth place behind Steve Forbes, said he was not feeling any pressure to withdraw and try to help his fellow Senator. "Less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the Republican voters in this country have had a chance to cast a ballot," he said.
In any case, several prominent Republicans, including former Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, who backs Mr. Alexander, said that given Mr. Buchanan's success, the nomination fight might drag on to the national convention in August -- and result in the brokered convention. "We're tearing each other apart," he said.
Republicans are not accustomed to such intramural turmoil because the party has a tradition of rewarding its best known establishment candidates, like Mr. Dole, with the nomination. Many Republicans said they feared a scenario in which Mr. Buchanan wins the nomination but is such a lightning rod that he leads the party to defeat in November, much like Barry Goldwater in 1964.
Another scenario is that Mr. Buchanan does not win the nomination but stays competitive long enough to inflict such damage on the nominee that that he loses in November. That would be an echo of what happened to the Democrats in 1984, when the Rev. Jesse Jackson was a constant irritant to the campaign of Walter F. Mondale.
Haley Barbour, the Republican national chairman, sought to play down the divisions in the party and asserted that the record turnout in the primary here reflected dissatsfaction among many independents over Mr. Clinton. But Mr. Barbour acknowledged that the nomination could go any way.
"I have no idea who's going to win," he said. "Any party chairman in the history of mankind would prefer to have the nomination fight start late and end early. I have no idea how long it will go on."
Asked if he could support Mr. Buchanan if he won the nomination, Mr. Barbour twice refused to answer the question. Instead, his response was, "I have confidence in the Republican voters in the United States."
Speaker Newt Gingrich, emerging this evening from a House leadership meeting in Washington, fended off any direct questions about the primary results and seemed to suggest that Mr. Dole's political plight might not be so dire.
"There's a ton of time," Mr. Gingrich said. "Clinton began to recover in July of 1992, when he was running third behind Perot and Bush. And he seemed to have a lot of time to recover."
Patrick M. McSweeney, the chairman of the Virgina Republican Party, said he might back Mr. Buchanan but was critical of others in the party whom he said were ganging up on the former columnist and commentator. "Where is the Big Tent when it's Pat Buchanan?" he asked. Speaking of the Buchanan candidacy, he said: "Handled right, it could energize us. Handled wrong, you create fissures that are very hard to repair."
Many other state Republican leaders were not as upbeat about Mr. Buchanan. "I don't think we're to the point of death, yet," said Barb McTurk, executive director of the Colorado Republican Party. "But if this continues on it becomes difficult."
Republicans in several states said it might be difficult for Mr. Buchanan to endure the rapid-fire schedule of primaries in the next four weeks, given that he cannot come close to matching Mr. Dole's money and organization. Even so, they also said that Mr. Buchanan's victory here could give him an edge in many states.
"I had some of the Buchanan people mad at me because I was quoted as saying Dole would probably take Texas," said Tom Pauken, the Texas Republican chairman. "That's all changed. I think it's going to be very competitive here between Bob Dole and Pat Buchanan."
Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, a leading moderate who withdrew from the Presidential race last year, called on his wing of the party to rise up. "Pat Buchanan may accomplish for the Republican Party what I couldn't: getting the centrist Republicans off the sidelines and onto the playing field so Pat Buchanan can be stopped," he said.
Like Mr. Specter, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey is backing Mr. Dole, but she sounded less nervous about Mr. Buchanan. "I am not worried by the kind of discussion and the issues that Pat Buchanan is bringing up," she said, "because as the American people look at them over time, they're going to reject them and I believe Bob Dole will be the nominee."
William W. Pascoe, political director of the American Conservative Union, said he was concerned that Mr. Buchanan, if successful, could greatly damage the conservative moement. And he said the only way to stop him would be for Mr. Alexander to make a deal with Mr. Dole and become his running mate.
"If they want to head off a Buchanan nomination, one of them has to get out of the race and fast," Mr. Pascoe said. "Many conservatives are concerned about Pat. They're worried less about the Republican Party than the future of the conservative movement. They don't want him to redefine the conservative movement in his image."
In the interview that was broadcast tonight, General Powell derided Mr. Buchanan's foreign policy. "We won the cold war," he said. "Our former enemies are now our competitors, and they're also going to be our markets in the future. And so I think fair and free trade is the road to go and not to pretend to the American worker, the American people, that there is some promise in the other direction."
General Powell went on to assess why Mr. Buchanan's message has appeal. "There are angry people," he said. "We are going through a transition period, where our economy is changing, where our whole world trading and economic structure is changing and there are dislocations, and people are anxious.
"We've got to work our way through this. But to think we can work our way through this by shutting ourselves off from the rest of the world is the incorrect answer."
Sam Donaldson asked General Powell, "Could you vote for Pat Buchanan for President?"
The simple reply, "No."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: ON THE MOVE;
Exultant Buchanan Pushes Economic Insecurity Theme

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: MOUNT RUSHMORE MEMORIAL PARK, S.D., Feb. 21

 BODY:
With perhaps more audacity, but inarguably with more delegates than his opponents for the Republican Presidential nomination, Patrick J. Buchanan came here today and took the measure of this mountain for his own face.
"Yesterday, I won the first election of my whole life!" Mr. Buchanan exulted before about 200 supporters, as the sun dipped behind the Black Hills. 
 "After my great New Hampshire victory," he continued, "we thought we'd come out here and see if there was any more space up there on that mountain. We're that confident."
Pausing only for three hours' sleep after his victory, Mr. Buchanan traveled through three states today, hammering at the themes of gnawing economic insecurity and creeping one-world government that have catapulted him to the front of the pack and rattled the Republican party.
Even as Senator Bob Dole and Lamar Alexander, his two chief rivals for the nomination, lit out across country too, arguing that Mr. Buchanan was too extreme to be the Republican nominee for President, the former commentator stood at Mount Rushmore and said the men memorialized here endorsed his ideas.
"All four of these gentlemen up here on Mount Rushmore agreed with Pat Buchanan," he declared. "Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt all believed that the American economy was designed for the American workers and the American families."
He said those Presidents, who likenesses stared into the distance above him, would have rallied to his cry that the United States is sacrificing its independence through international trade agreements.
"What would these men up there have said?" he asked, before supplying the answer, which is becoming a slogan for his campaign, " 'Lock and load!' "
Mr. Buchanan said: "People tell me, 'Pat you're way out of the mainstream of the G.O.P. I'm in the mainstream of America!"
Pat Buchanan is having a blast. He has hardly slowed down since learning the results of the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday night, when he dashed down a hotel hallway, whooping and clapping his hands.
"In three weeks time, we've gone from nothing, from single digits, from questions like, 'Pat, when are you going to get out of this thing?' questions like that, to the point where the establishment in Washington is just terrified," Mr. Buchanan shouted today in Sioux Falls, S.D. "The phone calls and fax machines are going all over saying, 'What are we going to do to stop him?' I don't think they can stop us."
Mr. Buchanan, who barely two weeks ago was trailed by at best one mini-van's worth of reporters, found himself jetting from South Carolina to South Dakota to Colorado today, accompanied by three dozen journalists and several members of the Secret Service.
Police cars with flashing lights stopped traffic for him. Mr. Buchanan sought Secret Service protection in the last few days to help manage the crush of reporters.
"I'm very exhausted now," Mr. Buchanan said as he finished waving to the cameras. Then, turning to enter the door of his chartered airplane this morning in Columbia, S.C., the candidate added, "But we're having a lot of fun."
Whether he was inveighing against President Clinton, Speaker Newt Gingrich, "corporate butchers" or "Boo-Boo Ghali," as he likes to refer to Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Buchanan continued honing his attack on what he calls the establishment.
"The whole establishment out there, they don't know what's going on in America," Mr. Buchanan declared at the stop at the Sioux Falls, where he addressed several hundred supporters at the airport this afternoon.
"You know they've got to get the State Department to start giving orientation courses for when they send them out in America from Washington D.C.," Mr. Buchanan said. "You know, give 'em shots and everything, have 'em learn the language of America."
For all his enthusiasm, Mr. Buchanan was quick to demur when asked if he was now the front-runner for the nomination.
"No, I don't think so," the Republican candidate said. "I think Senator Dole has the resources, and he probably has the, you know, in the national polls, he probably leads."
But he added, "I am the only authentic conservative left in the race, and I am the principal challenger to Bob Dole for the Republican nomination."
Mr. Buchanan continued to add today to his list of establishment figures who have opposed him. In attacking trade agreements as a "sellout of American jobs, a sellout of American farmers, and a sellout of our sovereignty," Mr. Buchanan thundered in Sioux Falls, "all the establishment there -- Dole, Gingrich, Gramm, and Clinton and Rubin and Greenspan and the Heritage Foundation and the Brookings Foundation and The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal -- all of them came together" to support the agreements.
Mr. Buchanan went on to mock the idea of putting United States troops under United Nations command. "We don't take orders from Boo-Boo Ghali," he said.
Mr. Buchanan also pressed his opposition to abortion today.
In Columbia, S.C., this morning, he was endorsed at a news conference by Phyllis Schlafly, president of Eagle Forum, a conservative foundation, and national chairman of the Republican National Coalition for Life.
"There is no stronger pro-life candidate who is left running," Mr. Buchanan said at the news conference, pledging to maintain the Republican Party's plank opposing all abortion, to nominate an anti-abortion running mate, and to appoint Supreme Court justices committed to overturning Roe v. Wade.
"Neither Bob Dole nor Lamar Alexander has made such commitments," he warned.

HEADLINE: Pataki and Giuliani: Bound by Pragmatism

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 21

 BODY:
Not long ago, the scene would have seemed implausible. But there they were, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki, sharing a Manhattan dais last week, offering glowing appraisals of each other.
"I think he is a hell of a Governor," said Mr. Giuliani, who in 1994 predicted that "ethics will be trashed" in a Pataki-run government. 
 The Governor replied in kind. The Mayor's policies "are right for this city and this country," he said, even though in 1994 he accused Mr. Giuliani of crassly selling his endorsement to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in exchange for state aid to the city.
But now, defying expectations, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Pataki have forged an unusually effective alliance. They have surmounted the institutional conflicts that have long estranged mayors from governors, even those of the same party. And they have sidestepped a bitter personal feud born when Mr. Giuliani bolted the Republican fold in 1994 to support Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat.
After he was elected just over a year ago, Mr. Pataki was so angry with Mr. Giuliani that he refused to return the Mayor's phone calls for almost three weeks, prompting Mr. Giuliani to accuse him of pettiness. But the two men have clearly come to realize that their political lives are closely intertwined. No Governor can seem hostile to New York City, even if he dislikes the Mayor. And every Mayor needs help from Albany.
So time and again, Mr. Pataki has vetoed popular legislation opposed by Mr. Giuliani, most recently a police arbitration bill strongly advocated by the powerful police lobby. And time and again, Mr. Giuliani has effusively praised Mr. Pataki as courageous, defending him against Democratic charges that his policies have hurt the city. But all is not perfect. Beneath the detente, the two camps remain wary of each other. And for all its outward chumminess, the two men's relationship is built largely on political calculations, overlapping fiscal problems and shared enemies. Pragmatism, not personal affection, is the glue that binds them.
Their appearance together on "Saturday Night Live" in January provided an apt, if unintended, illustration of their alliance. In the opening skit, the two men piled praise on each other for their handling of the blizzard -- mirroring recent real-life public appearances.
Yet behind the scenes, they spent almost no time together, even though they were on the set for nearly five hours. When they were not rehearsing, they closeted themselves in private dressing rooms or sat in separate sections of the audience. After the show, Mr. Giuliani left the building while Mr. Pataki took his daughter, Emily, to the cast party.
But if they are not close friends, their mutual needs have made them political partners. Mr. Giuliani depends on Mr. Pataki because he has almost no other allies in Albany, which wields enormous power over his budget.
The city's natural ally, the Assembly's Democratic leadership, regards him with open antipathy. Perhaps more important, Mr. Giuliani's natural allies, his fellow Republicans, are almost as antagonistic. And the men who control the state Republican Party -- William D. Powers, its chairman, and United States Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato -- are still furious with him for endorsing Mr. Cuomo.
Mr. Pataki, on the other hand, needs Mr. Giuliani because he has almost no other allies in the city, where he won a scant 18 percent of the vote in 1994. By helping the Mayor, Mr. Pataki hopes to stabilize the city's shaky finances before they damage the state's economy. But he also hopes to inoculate himself against charges that his deep-cutting budget will devestate the city, his aides say.
"The Governor doesn't want to give Rudy a chance to say, 'George Pataki bankrupted the city,' " a senior Pataki adviser said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
In separate interviews, Mr. Pataki and Mr. Giuliani both predicted thatpragmatism would keep them working cooperatively for years to come. But other politicians say that the bitter memories of 1994, combined with Mr. Pataki's close friendship with Mr. D'Amato, one of the Mayor's oldest rivals, make a blowup inevitable.
"Knowing people in politics, and knowing that the Governor felt betrayed, I doubt he will ever forgive Giuliani for what he did," former Mayor Edward I. Koch said. "When the time arrives where Pataki can do him in without hurting New York City, I believe he will."
Beneath the smooth veneer of their public alliance, the two men have a businesslike personal relationship -- cordial but not quite warm, people close to both men say.
In general, they rarely socialize together outside of the political dinner circuit. Mr. Pataki frequently holds parties at the Governor's mansion in Albany and at his home in Garrison, and he has on a few occasions invited the Mayor to official receptions. But when, for instance, he held a birthday party for himself last year, he did not invite Mr. Giuliani, though several of the state's leading Republican officials were invited.
Yet even if they are not close, the two men have developed an amiable working relationship, their aides say. Their phone conversations have become more personal and include chitchat about their families and jokes about the weather. And though they have never had a heart-to-heart talk about the 1994 campaign endorsement, they have at least progressed to the point where they can joke about it in public.
"As far as I'm concerned, I can only think of one wrong decision he's made in the last couple of years," Mr. Pataki said of Mr. Giuliani at a Republican fund-raiser in Manhattan last week, breaking up the room. "And nobody gets 'em all right."
In an interview, Mr. Pataki acknowledged that the Mayor's acidic remarks in 1994 hurt him deeply. But he said he was not interested in revenge against the Mayor or the city.
"I'm human, and obviously it was something that was very difficult," he said. "But I have seen too many people in politics destroy themselves by keeping records. That's just not my nature. My nature is to look at the next fight, the next goal, and try to figure out how we can work together to achieve them."
Mr. Giuliani has yet to apologize for endorsing Mr. Cuomo, angering many Pataki advisers. But the Mayor has expressed regrets for saying in 1994 that a Pataki administration would be "a government of D'Amato, for D'Amato, by D'Amato."
"If I had known George Pataki better, I would not have said those things," Mr. Giuliani said in an interview. "He is a very honest and independent person who is able to make his own decisions. He's handled his administration in a very honorable way."
Still, many Pataki loyalists in the Legislature and the Republican Party have not forgiven the Mayor. Even now, they say Mr. Giuliani's refusal to endorse the state party's favored Presidential candidate, Bob Dole, has only fueled the tensions. Some people in both parties even believe that Mr. D'Amato will work behind the scenes for a Democrat in the 1997 mayoral campaign if Mr. Giuliani does not join the Dole camp. Mr. D'Amato denies that.
Perhaps sensing these subterranean machinations, Mr. Giuliani says he believes that keeping on good terms with the Governor and the state's other Republicans is not enough. "It's a terrible mistake for the mayor of New York City to get owned too much by one party or another," he said. "At different times, you need both of them."
Many politicians predicted that Mr. Pataki would try to undermine Mr. Giuliani as soon as he was elected. Indeed, when Mr. Pataki refused to talk to Mr. Giuliani after the election, it was a planned effort to rebuff and humiliate the Mayor.
But then a rapprochement began. In one of the new Governor's first major acts, he vetoed legislation that would have increased the city's annual pension payments by hundreds of millions of dollars. Then last summer, Mr. Pataki and his counsel, Michael C. Finnegan, helped negotiate an agreement that is expected to protect the city's water supply without requiring New York to build a $7 billion filtration system.
And in the last six months, Mr. Pataki has vetoed five bills strongly supported by police unions -- an extremely influential Republican constituency -- at Mr. Giuliani's behest. The last veto, of the arbitration bill, which the Mayor said would cost the city $200 million a year, was overridden by the Legislature a week ago.
Mr. Giuliani has responded to the Pataki vetoes with enthusiastic applause. When Mr. Pataki proposed a budget last year that reduced spending on city schools, mass transit and hospitals, Mr. Giuliani commended him for trimming government bloat. When Mr. Pataki called for transferring 1,000 state jobs from New York to Binghampton, Mr. Giuliani said he was "very fair to the city."
And even after it became apparent that the Governor had not done all he could to prevent the Legislature from overriding his veto of the police arbitration bill, Mr. Giuliani called him courageous. "He's demonstrated right from the beginning that in making his decisions, he assesses the good of the entire state," Mr. Giuliani said.
Such cooperation is more the exception than the rule in New York State politics, historians say. Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller and Mayor John V. Lindsay were bitter rivals for control of the liberal wing of the Republican Party. Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Koch, competitors in both mayoral and gubernatorial races, sniped endlessly at each other. And Mayor David N. Dinkins almost refused to endorse Mr. Cuomo in 1994 because he felt the Governor had repeatedly shortchanged him and the city.
"There is a natural tension that exists in all mayor-governor relationships because the city is a major claimant on the state," said Gerald Benjamin, a professor of political science at the State University at New Paltz. "I think Giuliani and Pataki are getting along famously, given the political context and institutional pressures."

HEADLINE: Farrakhan's Angry World Tour Brings Harsh Criticism at Home

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
Four months after his Million Man March edged him toward the political mainstream, Louis Farrakhan has touched off wide criticism with an extended world tour, which included countries the United States considers pariahs, and his bitterly anti-American remarks along the way.
Mr. Farrakhan, the head of the American group the Nation of Islam, said his 20-nation "world friendship tour" to Iran, Libya, the Sudan, Nigeria, Syria and other nations was intended to spread the message of self-help and personal responsibility that was voiced in October at the Million Man March in Washington. 
 But critics suggest that Mr. Farrakhan's purpose was to raise money at a time when some commercial ventures linked to the Nation of Islam are in financial trouble.
Whatever his motives, Mr. Farrakhan has generated condemnation not only from the State Department, which accused him of "cavorting" with terrorist states, but from other black leaders, who said his meetings in outlaw states undercut their efforts to promote human rights.
It has also prompted calls for a Congressional investigation into his denunciations of the United States, like the one he reportedly uttered last month in Iran on the 17th anniversary of the overthrow of the Shah.
"God will destroy America by the hands of Muslims," the Iranian press quoted him as saying. "God will not give Japan or Europe the honor of bringing down the United States; this is an honor God will bestow upon Muslims."
Mr. Farrakhan's trip began Jan. 17 and is to end this week after a visit to Malaysia, where he arrived late today, and where the official religion is Islam.
There is evident discomfort over the tour among traditional civil rights organizations struggling to determine their relationship with the fiery leader.
Ronald Walters, chairman of the department of political science at Howard University, said: "The interesting thing is how it plays among people who, after the Million Man March, thought they could welcome him into the pantheon of black leadership. Now they're finding out that consorting with him is not going to be as easy as they thought."
In Iraq, Mr. Farrakhan, who is 62, compared the deprivations of Iraqis living under United Nations economic sanctions with the fate of Jews in Nazi death camps. And in Iran, he denounced the United States as the "Great Satan" and predicted his preachings would land him in prison back home, saying that perhaps he would be jailed next to Sheik Omar Adbel-Rahman, the Egyptian cleric convicted in a plot to bomb landmarks in New York.
"Maybe there's a cell next to Abdel-Rahman for me," Mr. Farrakhan said, "and maybe he and I will be together reading the Koran and encouraging each other."
In Nigeria, Mr. Farrakhan voiced support for the military Government, which has refused to honor an election last June to restore democratic rule. He also chastised Western nations for their criticism of the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa, a writer and environmental advocate who had demanded a greater share of oil revenues for his people.
"They said that you hanged one man," he was quoted as saying, referring to countries that condemned the execution. "So what? Ask them, too, 'How many did you hang?' "
Many of Mr. Farrakhan's statements were reported by official press agencies and their accuracy could not be confirmed.
Mr. Farrakhan also sometimes puzzled his hosts. For instance, he and his 30-person entourage rode around South Africa in white stretch limosines with gold detailing, an ostentatious display unusual there. He also said he was scouring Africa to establish a "homeland" for black American prison inmates.
But what was merely puzzling to his hosts was offensive to many in the United States.
Randall Robinson, president of TransAfrica Forum, which lobbies on issues related to Africa and the Caribbean, was particularly upset at Mr. Farrakhan's support of Nigeria's military junta.
"I am extremely disappointed with the statements made on this trip in countries like Nigeria and Sudan," said Mr. Robinson. "His statements and the things that were said appear to make Minister Farrakhan an apologist for an authoritarian, corrupt and repressive regime."
Kweisi Mfume, the new president and chief executive of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (and a speaker at the Million Man March), said Mr. Farrakhan's visits to countries that flout international standards did "not help" efforts to establish "conformity with international law."
A State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, chastised the Muslim leader for his stops in Iran and Libya and accused him of "cavorting with dictators."
Representative Peter T. King, a New York Republican and a long-time critic, called for a Congressional investigation into whether Mr. Farrakhan had violated passport restrictions by going to Libya, where travel by American citizens is generally banned by Washington.
Calls this week to the official spokesman of Nation of Islam in Chicago seeking comment were not returned.
But Mr. Farrakhan has his defenders, among them Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., the former executive director of the N.A.A.C.P., who helped organize the Million Man March. "I think that the purpose of the trip was a good-will tour to take the spirit of the Million Man March -- which is a spirit of atonement and reconciliation -- to nations that need atonement and reconciliation,' Mr. Chavis said.
For some who took part in the rally, however, the trip seemed an irrelevancy.
"While some folks are international and beyond, we who function down here on the ground have to be about the business we talked about in Washington," said Jacques deGraff, president of a New York construction company, who attended the Million Man March.
Mr. Farrakhan's tour comes as several commercial enterprises affiliated with the Nation of Islam are experiencing financial difficulties.
A Chicago restaurant, Salaam, opened with fanfare last year, has accumulated tax bills, court judgments and liens sought by contractors totaling $300,000. And a security concern, the New Life Self Development Company, recently lost a $2 million contract at a public housing project in Chicago and is being sued by the city to recover more than $52,000 in back taxes.
Given these financial setbacks for the Nation of Islam, some critics suggest Mr. Farrakhan's tour was an effort to raise money from countries seeking to exert influence in American foreign policy.
"I believe he's trying to push as far as he can to, one, get money, and also to establish himelf as a spokesman for American blacks throughout the world," Representative King said.
A report by JANA, the Libyan press agency, that the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, had promised $1 billion to Mr. Farrakhan to finance political activities in the United States has prompted Congressional critics and the Justice Department to question whether the American Muslim leader should register as a foreign agent. Libya later denied any promise of financial support.
For his part, Mr. Farrakhan denies being motivated by money and is unapologetic about his comments, saying he is an American citizen who is guaranteed the right of free speech.
"I can go where I please and speak to anyone I please," he said in Ankara, Turkey. "I only have to answer to God."

Excerpts From Buchanan Campaign Speech

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a speech by Patrick J. Buchanan at a campaign rally in Nashua, N.H., on Saturday, as transcribed by The New York Times. The speech provides an example of the message Mr. Buchanan delivers in his standard campaign speech. 
 We're going all the way! . . .
Listen my friends, this is one of the final rallies in the great New Hampshire campaign, and let me tell you something. History is about to be made in the state of New Hampshire. I'll tell you -- I'll tell you why history is about to be made, because the establishment in Washington is quaking in its boots at what's going on across the country. . . .
The lights are burning late in Washington, D.C., tonight, friends. Because of this campaign. We came out of Alaska. We won a great victory in Alaska, down to Louisiana. We had a tremendous upset win in Louisiana. We went to Iowa, and after Bob Dole outspent us 5 to 1, he began with a 50-point lead. He ended up with a 3-point lead in Iowa. I don't think he's going to have a 3-point lead in New Hampshire. . . .
We will open the door of the Buchanan campaign to anyone who just doesn't close the door to us, friends. They're all welcome, because our objective is to send Bill and Hillary back to wherever they sent poor Joycelyn Elders. . . .
We'll get to the elections, my friends, but let me talk about something else. We'll get to there, but let me say something.
As I said in Louisiana, I said, now it's not a victory for a man, it's a victory for a cause. It's a victory for a cause that's larger than lotteries. It's a victory for a new conservatism of the heart. A conservatism that will look out and provide voices for the voiceless. It will look out for the right to life for the innocent unborn. . . .
It will look out for those working men and women who are seeing their jobs sent overseas. We're seeing those jobs sent overseas for the benefit of trans-national corporations. It's a new conservatism which is going to go to Washington. . . .
I know there's a lot of candidates running around, waffling around and ducking and hiding, and bucking and weaving and all the rest of it. With Pat Buchanan, even his critics will tell you in Washington, this is a man who means what he says. Let me tell you what I mean. I am pro-life. I will keep this party pro-life. . . .
(Inaudible)
I care about the working women and the working men of America. . . .
We're going to have a Republican Party that looks out for working men and women in middle-class families. . . .
Look what's happened in New Hampshire in the last five years. Wages of the working people are down 5 percent. Medium income of the New Hampshire family is down 15 percent. Twenty-thousand manufacturing jobs gone from New Hampshire. Lost a significant slice of your manufacturing base, just as America is losing a slice of the manufacturing base. . . .
They're all -- They're all sitting there talking nonsense, and they're throwing these questions up at me, and they don't realize I'm "Crossfire" trained and I can handle all that nonsense. . . .
All right, let me tell you something. Look at what's going on. They say, "Well, Pat, why didn't you oppose that wonderful free trade agreement in GATT?" I said, "Free trade agreement?" They said, "Yeah, free." I said, "Let me tell you about freedom." You find freedom on that stack of papers called the Constitution of the United States. You put GATT -- 23,000 pages, they're that high, they're that high -- and the first 20 pages, what do they do? They say that the control over world trade is transferred from the Congress of the United States, where our own founding fathers placed responsibility, to a global institution in Geneva called a World Trade Organization, where we get one vote out of 120. Our American vote can be canceled out by Fidel Castro.
People say, What does sovereignty mean, Pat? I say go down to the village green in Lexington. Go down and stand there, where 17-year-old boys stopped the greatest army in the world. Stand there for an hour, and you'll understand what it's all about. . . .
You've read the story of those 16 young Americans, shot down in that friendly fire incident in Iraq. . . .
The Vice President issues a formal statement to the parents of these young Americans to be proud; they died in the service of the United Nations.
Let me tell you, they didn't take any oath -- they took an oath to the United States. They took an oath to our Constitution, and when I'm President of the United States, never again will young Americans be sent into battle, except under American officers and to fight under the American flag.
You know about Michael New? Well, I'm going to tell those of you who don't know about Michael New. Michael New was a devout Christian, home-schooled, went into the Army of the United States, decorated in Germany, and Bill Clinton, his commander-in-chief, ordered him into Macedonia, and told him to put on that insignia, put on a U.N. helmet and take orders.
He said, I'm not going to do that, because I took an oath not to the charter of the United Nations, but to the Constitution of the United States. (inaudible) court-martialed Michael New, convicted him, and dishonorably discharged Michael New from the services of his country. Michael New is not the one who ought to be discharged from the service of this country. . . .
People ask me, what is our campaign all about, and could you sum it up in a couple of words? And, I said, my campaign is about restoring the Constitutional Republic. . . .
In this Constitution, certain responsibilities and duties are given to the Federal Government and the rest belong to the states respectively, and to the people, and one of those responsibilities, quite frankly, is the education of America's younger children.
That responsibliity -- that responsibility does not belong to the Federal bureaucrats. Now let me tell you something, there's a big secret in American politics about Federal bureaucrats, I want to tell about it. But to do so, I got to tell you the truth. I was born and raised inside the Beltway before it was a Beltway, Washington, D.C. I grew up in Washington, D.C. I even, at one time, 10 years old, I delivered The Washington Post. They robbed me blind, and I'll never forget it. . . .
I used to hitch-hike into an inner city high school every day for four years, and every day, one of those bureaucrats gave me a ride, and they're real nice fellows, but they're not all that bright. I'm telling you. Really, they gave us a ride down there, and now they're trying to dictate primary and secondary school education.
Well, I'm going to tell them, "Listen fellows, it's going to be short, we're going to put you on leave here. What we're going to do is we're going to end Goals 2000 and we are going to shut down the U.S. Department of Education."
(Inaudible)
Here's what's going on up there, what's going on, they're all watching you New Hampshire. They are watching New Hampshire. You've got the national press, and you've got the world press, they're all coming in.
(Inaudible)
You know, they said, What is he doing here? I've told the story many times. Let me tell it again.
It all began a year ago. . . .
This reporter comes up and says, "Pat you're not serious about getting into this are you?" I said, "Let me tell you what I'm doing. I'm giving up my job, opposite the great Michael Kinsley. I've given up my radio show opposite Rush. I've given up my sindicated column, and I've even given up my book contract." He said, "That isn't as big or as impressive as Newt's." A little bit of change, so I'm giving it up. So, I said, what does that tell you? He just shook his head and said, "Pat, I'm afraid that gives me my lead: Unemployed, angry white male, may seek Presidency." . . .
Look how we've changed the dynamic af American politics.
Bob Dole. . . . Now that fellow is extreme. He's an extremist. Who's Bob Dole most sound like he's acting like? I sound like an echo chamber at times. . . .
All the while, Bob's idea of a populist rally is to have dinner with Bob Strauss and Dwayne Andreas of ADM at Katharine Graham's place over in Georgetown.
(Inaudible)
I said look, you can't fool folks in New Hampshire. I said for 20 years in the realm of Pat Buchanan, William Lowe and (inaudible) and no one else was here to stand up against those tax increases, and my friend Lamar sipping coffee in the Cabinet room along with the tax raisers and the big spenders. . . . Lamar, you can't -- can't smoke 20 years of that by putting on that plaid shirt and walking across the state. It just won't do up here.
But they're all sounding like us. Even Bill Clinton. That fellow, Imus -- Imus -- Lamar, is that his name? Imus in the Morning said after Clinton's State of the Union, that's the best State of the Union Bill Clinton ever gave. He said, I think Pat Buchanan wrote that one.
. . .
Clinton in '96 is running against the guy who was President in '93.
(Inaudible)
He also says, "Listen, I think we got to get prayer back in the public schools." This guy is shameless, and you'll see him at the National Rifle Association, I'll tell you. At the next convention, he'll be up there and he'll have that camouflage outfit on. . . .
He'll hold up an AK-47 over his head and say, 'Don't try and take my firearms away from me, bud.' . . .
I came up here in 1992 . . . and challenged the President of the United States, 10 weeks before the New Hampshire primary. The reaction was mockery, laughter, and ridicule. . . . We almost get it and they beat us down. They beat us down in Georgia, and they beat us down in Tennessee. He said, well we finished that guy off. . . .
Then we slipped back in a year ago. (Inaudible) We shot through to Alaska and stunned them in Louisiana and stunned them again in Iowa and they are in a terminal pattern.
Better they shout their message from over the hill. You watch the establishment of all the knights and barons, and they're riding into the castle, pulling up the draw bridge real fast. All the peasants are coming with pitchforks, too.
We're going to take this over the top. This has been a great and good campaign. It's been about -- I'll tell you why it's been a good campaign. Look, we aren't going after these guys. (Inaudible) I don't know -- Look at all these guys -- Bob Dole is running and hiring these guys for $400,000, and the best they can do, you know, is college dirty tricks.
They got no vision. They got no objective. They got no convictions, beliefs -- all of them. Head piece filled with straw. That's what they're all about.
We got heart. We got soul.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE ASSESSMENT;
How 'Front Runner' in G.O.P. Race Had a Flat Tire in New Hampshire

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 21

 BODY:
How did it happen? How did Bob Dole, one of the most effective politicians of the post-war era, elected five times to the Senate, elected Republican leader more often than anyone in history, backed by the potent organization of a Governor who won re-election two years ago with a record 70 percent of the vote, contrive to lose the New Hampshire primary to a television commentator who had never before won an election anywhere?
Part of the explanation of Tuesday's victory by Patrick J. Buchanan lies, of course, in the ardent articulation by Mr. Buchanan of the economic fears and the social ideals of people who feel forgotten or disdained by politicians. 
 Voters surveyed by the television networks and The Associated Press as they left the polls said the question that mattered most to them was a candidate's willingness to stand up for what he believed in. Mr. Buchanan, who spells out his ideas in neon letters that no one could possibly miss, won the support of more than half of those who were searching for someone with backbone.
Obviously, Mr. Dole was hurt by the simple fact that Mr. Buchanan stood alone on the party's right wing, freed by the withdrawal of Senator Phil Gramm of Texas from the necessity of competing for conservative voters, while Mr. Dole and former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee competed for the backing of moderates, along with Steve Forbes, the publisher, and Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana.
"You have four people drawing from the same well," said former Senator Warren B. Rudman, a Dole man. "That's tough. If Forbes or Lugar had pulled out, and Gramm had stayed in, the whole election would have been different."
In a bid to change things, Mr. Dole said on Tuesday night that voters had to choose now between him and Mr. Buchanan, implying that Mr. Alexander was a distraction. But Mr. Alexander remains a viable if underfinanced candidate, as does Mr. Forbes, who has enough money to keep running as long as he wants.
Yet in truth, most of the blame for Mr. Dole's troubles lies not in his opponents, not in his stars but in himself. Mr. Buchanan's bold prescriptions would have seemed less so if Mr. Dole had put forward a program of his own. Like George Bush as President, Mr. Dole is thought to lack "the vision thing."
Intensely conscious of their special role in choosing Presidents, New Hampshire voters like to hear detailed ideas from candidates, adding up to a plan for the nation. They punish candidates who offer mainly a resume -- Edmund S. Muskie in 1972 and Walter F. Mondale in 1984 among Democrats, Mr. Bush in 1980 and 1988, when he won unimpressively, and Mr. Dole in 1988 and this year.
"Bob Dole is the quintessential in-basket candidate," said Tom Rath, a Concord lawyer who backed the Kansan eight years ago and switched to Mr. Alexander this year. "He tells the electorate, 'Throw me a problem and I'll figure out how to solve it.' This time, he was worse than usual. By Election Day, he had morphed into Fritz Mondale."
Mr. Dole's strategists kept telling him he had to talk about the future if he wanted to win. He tried, but often he produced banalities like this one, which emerged as he was cutting a ribbon at the former Pease Air Force Base near Portsmouth, which has been converted into an international trade center: "This is about the future. That's where this country is headed."
Seldom during his travels around the state did he speak with real passion. After it was clear that he had lost, he finally caught fire, telling his supporters that "we are engaged in a fight for the heart and soul of the Republican Party" between the forces of hope and the forces of fear, between the excluders and the includers. Too late, but much the most effective speech he made here.
Clearly, the flatness of his campaign contributed to a pervasive impression in New Hampshire that at 72 years of age Mr. Dole was too old for the Presidency. More than one voter said he should have been content to stay in the Senate instead of making a third run at the Presidency. Some even said they felt sorry for him as he made his umpteenth visit to Derry or Milford, and there is nothing more corrosive to a candidate's chances than to have people pity him.
Kathy Snyder, a mother of three from Nashua who voted for Mr. Buchanan, gave a typical explanation.
"I like Dole," she said. "I think Dole's a good man. I think he's been there a really long time and I think he's getting old. I think he's been comfortable there too long."
In the exit poll, a third of the voters said Mr. Dole's age would hinder him in carrying out the duties of the Presidency. A similar proportion said the same thing in Iowa last week. Here, only 7 percent of those expressing worries about the Senator's age voted for him, which means that about three voters in ten were unprepared to support him, no matter what he did in the campaign.
The younger the voter was, the less likely he or she was to vote for Senator Dole, the poll indicated. Among those 60 years old and older, he took 39 percent, a healthy plurality. But the numbers fell off quickly; among those 45 to 59, he took only 27 percent; among those 30 to 44, 21 percent, and among those 18 to 29, 18 percent.
There is anecdotal evidence as well of a fearsome generation gap. Younger voters in a group assembled by The New York Times to watch last Thursday's debate reacted with boredom or disdain to the Senator's references to his military service in World War II. To many Baby Boomers and Generation-X'ers, the fighting in Europe and the Pacific seems as wrapped in the mists of time as the War of 1812.
In conversations with friends last night Mr. Dole denied that there was anything wrong with his message. The problem, he said, was Mr. Forbes's negative television commercials, which he blamed for "knocking 7 points off my total and giving them to Alexander." Gov. Stephen Merrill of New Hampshire said the same thing this morning -- the morning when, he had said, he would have not egg but a whole breakfast on his face if Senator Dole did not win the primary.
Only 15 percent of the participants in the exit poll said that Mr. Merrill's endorsement made something of a difference or a lot of difference in their choice of a candidate, which is not good news for Mr. Dole. He is counting heavily on endorsements to carry him through the 28 contests in the next month.
"We're not going to change our views," the Senator maintained at a news conference in Manchester this morning, "but I think there are some things we need to listen to coming from people who are disenchanted and frustrated."
Sunnier than on Tuesday night, Mr. Dole called his defeat "a little bump in the road, but not a very big bump." New Hampshire, he said, was "just one stop on the way" to November. Conceding that he had not been in his best form, he promised, "You're going to see the real Bob Dole out there from now on."
For a little while, he sounded as if he meant it, inveighing against isolationism and protectionism and by extension, Patrick J. Buchanan, their new champion. He framed the contest to come as one between "the mainstream and the extreme." But then he lapsed back into platitudes: "Finally, it's about the future. I believe in America. I love America. And I know what made America great."
Perhaps Mr. Dole's biggest asset before this week was the widespread belief, based on his achievements over the last three decades, that no one could deny him the nomination. Now that mantle of inevitability lies in shreds.

HEADLINE: French Government Will Sell Thomson This Year

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

 BODY:
The French Government announced yesterday that it planned to sell Thomson S.A., the huge defense and consumer-electronics company, to private investors by the end of 1996.
It also said it would work to merge two other military giants, Dassault Aviation, manufacturer of fighter jets, and Aerospatiale, producer of aircraft, missiles and satellites, within two years. 
 The consolidation would serve to limit government spending. The moves are also intended to help carry out President Jacques Chirac's plans to reorganize the French military as well as to privatize state industries.
The statement on the intended sale was issued a day before Mr. Chirac is to announce a shake-up of the French Army and the military industries, including a plan to do away with compulsory service, possibly cutting the armed forces in half.
"Almost everyone else has downsized their militaries since the end of the cold war, but France hasn't," said Chris Avery, technology analyst at Banque Paribas in London. "The taxpayers have essentially been carrying the burden. So cuts and consolidations are long overdue, and it looks like they will come in a rush."
The driving force now is budgetary. An economic slowdown has reduced tax revenue and pushed the French deficit above the level required for participation in the first stage of a common European currency in 1999. With little hope that growth will surge in 1996, money saved from military cuts and the sale of state companies are key to France's hopes of qualifying for a role in European economic union.
The office of Prime Minister Alain Juppe said that the head of Thomson S.A., Alain Gomez, would step down and be replaced by Marcel Roulet, former head of France Telecom, the state telecommunications monopoly.
Financial analysts saw that move in a positive light, since Mr. Gomez, 57, who had been at the helm of Thomson for 14 years, was appointed by the late Francois Mitterrand, and is associated in their minds with big government, excess employment and the accumulation of huge debts at Thomson.
Mr. Roulet, 63, on the other hand, was dismissed from France Telecom last year, after four years as its chief executive, when he advocated an aggressive privatization of the telephone business, a process that labor groups opposed. At Thomson he is expected to push to make the company more profitable in the global weapons business.
Thomson S.A., which is a holding company, owns 58 percent of Thomson-CSF, which is traded on the Paris stock exchange and is active in aviation electronics, missile guidance and flight-control systems.
Though the company is profitable, the mergers that have taken place among military contractors in the United States, creating giants like Lockheed Martin, insure bitter competition and a questionable future, analysts said.
Thomson also owns Thomson Multimedia, which makes television sets under the RCA and General Electric names. That unit has hemorrhaged money, losing $120 million in 1994. Still, prospects for consumer electronics are considered brighter than the military business.
The holding company has accumulated losses of almost $2 billion over five years, and is thought to have accumulated debts of $4 billion, and to have less than $500 million in shareholder equity. It had sales in 1994 of $7.1 billion. "It's essentially a basket case," an analyst in London said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The French Government owns 76 percent of Thomson, and France Telecom, 20 percent.
Analysts were annoyed that the announcement yesterday carried no details of how the privatization would take place, except to say that Mr. Roulet would head the effort. The statement said merely, "In close consultation with the relevant Government ministries, Marcel Roulet is charged by the Government to undertake the necessary work for the privatization."
Two basic approaches to privatizing Thomson have been studied. One would involve combining Thomson Multimedia and Thomson-CSF into one group, and the other calls for selling them separately.
A combined sale could bring in as much as $2 billion, analysts said, effectively canceling a large part of the Government's debt at Thomson.
While last year's idea of privatizing France Telecom was politically treacherous for President Chirac, involving many workers and assuring huge layoffs, defense-industry privatization is less so.
In December, Mr. Chirac's officials announced names of the companies it intended to privatize in 1996, hoping to raise $8 billion in asset sales. Among those on the list for partial or complete privatization were the auto maker Renault and the insurance company, Assurances Generales de France. Now, Thomson joins that list.

HEADLINE: Students Paid the Price When Private Firm Took Over Schools;
Privatizers Made Gains

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re: "School Privatizers, In Retreat" (editorial, Feb. 12): 
 You reach erroneous conclusions on the performance and future of the school privatization industry.
Contrary to your editorial, test scores at the elementary school in Dade County, Florida, run by Education Alternatives Inc. were higher than those for children not involved in our effort.
In Baltimore, the 80 or so non-college-educated paraprofessionals did not lose their jobs, as you imply, but were transferred to schools not managed by E.A.I. More important, they were replaced with about 180 college-educated "interns," thus costing us more but giving the students greater benefit.
In addition, the financial statement from the district proves that we were not spending more per child than comparable schools in the city.
In Baltimore and Hartford, economics and not performance were at the heart of the difficulties. Dr. Walter Amprey, the Baltimore Superintendent of Public Education, has stated that our efforts were a success and that "significant gains" in student achievement were made.
In Hartford, we were on target delivering results as promised in our contract.

HEADLINE: Short of Money, the French Face Cuts in Their Cherished Military

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: BOURGES, France, Feb. 19

 BODY:
For decades, this town of tank-makers and army bases has thrived on France's determination to be a military giant.
While similar cities in America -- Long Beach, Calif., home of Lockheed, and Groton, Conn., headquarters of General Dynamics -- have suffered from sharp cuts in defense spending, Bourges and its 75,000 people have been cushioned so far by France's strong Gaullist tradition of maintaining an independent national defense, whatever the cost. 
 But that is about to change.
On Thursday, President Jacques Chirac will bow to intense budget pressure and announce a five-year plan to reorganize and reduce by more than a third the 400,000-strong French military and the industrial establishment that feeds it. He is also expected to say the new armed forces should be all-volunteer, like their British and American counterparts.
In a country where military service, an independent nuclear deterrent and a flourishing arms trade are matters of deep national pride, Mr. Chirac's plan for a slimmed-down professional force is a political gamble.
And nowhere more than in cities like Bourges (pronounced boorzh), where the Gaullist ideal of national service is also the means of livelihood for thousands in a time of economic anxiety.
"Here, people wonder where we are headed, and whether Bourges is going to come out all right," said the worried Mayor, Serge Lepeltier, a conservative member of Mr. Chirac's neo-Gaullist party who was elected last June after more than a decade of Communist-dominated government here.
French defense plants and military bases now ring his city like a stockade. But, said Mayor Lepeltier, "The world has changed, and we face much more competition from the defense industry in the United States on the international arms market than we ever did during the cold war."
Tough price competition is blamed for part of a $2.4 billion loss last year at Giat Industries, whose plant employs 1,400 people here. The company, which was entirely Government-owned until 1990 and has 11,500 employees in 12 locations in France, sold 436 Leclerc tanks to the United Arab Emirates for $4 billion in 1994 but had to make so many expensive concessions to wrest the deal from American competitors that currency fluctuations later turned the sale into a loss-maker.
"We live off the Leclerc tank in Bourges," said Mr. Lepeltier. He said Defense Minister Charles Millon had reassured local officials during a visit to the region that the French Army would continue to buy the tank and that the Government would help improve the efficiency of production lines so that it could be sold abroad profitably in the future.
France, unlike Britain, Germany and the United States, has long delayed responding to the industrial consequences of the end of the superpowers' arms race and has continued to support a huge weapons industry that provided 230,000 jobs last year, down from 310,000 in 1982.
But with France trying to reduce its deficit to qualify for a common European currency with Germany by the end of the decade, some people here fear that Mr. Chirac's plans will force them to bite the bullet.
["France must achieve a profound reform of its military and defense establishment, with the transformation of the army and of national service and the reconfiguration of the industrial complex," Mr. Chirac told the Cabinet in Paris on Wednesday, according to the Government spokesman, Alain Lamassoure.
[Mr. Chirac will appear on national television on Thursday night after presiding over a meeting of the national defense council and will suggest a debate on possible alternatives to outright abolition of the draft, which now also supplies civilian agencies like fire departments, ambulance services and parts of the national police, officials said.]
"There's been no attempt yet to prepare public opinion for what's coming," complained Michel Hosmalin, a secretary of the French Democratic Labor Confederation at the Giat plant on the eastern outskirts of Bourges. "The discussions have been held to a small elite around the President so far."
"Unfortunately, in France we don't seem to be able to solve social problems unless we have a confrontation and an explosion first," Mr. Hosmalin joked, recalling the national transportation strike that paralyzed the country at the end of last year until the Government withdrew plans to change the rules for calculating state railroad workers' pensions.
Jean-Claude Sandrier, the previous Mayor of Bourges and a Communist, says the French and European authorities should help defense industries convert to production of civilian goods to save jobs.
"The Government says it wants to build a European defense," he said, "but this should not come at the cost of dismantling the entire French national system unless a referendum shows that a majority of the French people want it that way."
Some other people here find that a bit rich.
"I remember the Communists demonstrating in 1982 and demanding that France stop selling arms abroad," said Jacques-Louis Tabare, who owns a small variety store on the Rue Moyenne, the main shopping street of Bourges. "Now they're changing their tune because arms are jobs in Bourges."
Last Thursday, he and most other storeowners shuttered their shops to show sympathy for about a thousand unionized arms industry employees, including many members of the Communist union, who marched on city hall to warn that Bourges would be a dead city if defense cuts were too precipitous.
"I greeted them at the door to show my solidarity," Mayor Lepeltier said.
But he also told them that Aerospatiale, the company that makes the Exocet air-to-surface missile, was planning to move 500 to 700 workers and their families from Paris to Bourges to centralize production of the missiles here, bringing the company's total employment in Bourges to 2,000 jobs.
But the company employed 2,800 people 15 years ago, when there were 12,000 defense industry jobs in Bourges. Now there are only 5,000, city officials say.
Just up a narrow cobblestone street from Mr. Tabare's shop, the dominant feature of the Bourges skyline -- the magnificent 13th-century Gothic cathedral -- is propped up with French and European Government funds to keep its stone buttresses from crumbling.
Mr. Sandrier suggested that something similar could be done for the defense industry. "What we need now is an urgent French and European conversion fund with money specifically targeted at helping defense industries find new products and different markets," he said.
But with the defense budget frozen at $37.9 billion this year, about the same as last year, the choices ahead look difficult. "When people don't know what's coming, they don't spend," said Mr. Tabare, looking out his shop window at a scattering of teenagers. They looked unlikely to do much for his bottom line even if Mr. Chirac does do away with the draft.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 23, 1996, Friday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about France's proposal to reduce its armaments industry, and the plan's effect on the town of Bourges, referred incorrectly to American cities in comparable situations. Long Beach, Calif., is a manufacturing center for McDonnell Douglas, not Lockheed; Groton, Conn., has a plant owned by General Dynamics but is not the company's headquarters.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
Inge's Bus Passengers, Stranded Overnight

BYLINE: By VINCENT CANBY 

 BODY:
DURING the height of his career in the 1950's, the playwright William Inge was sometimes placed in the pantheon of post-World War II giants with Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller. They were of the same generation, but Inge was not of the stature of the other two, being neither a great poet of the theater nor a grandly dramatic moralist. He was a deceptively prosy sort of writer.
Yet by his attention to the language and behavior of inarticulate, rural Americans, he created a small body of highly theatrical stage literature, works that are rivaled only by those of the far more rigorous Horton Foote. Inge dramatized the melancholy, the humor and the unconscious gallantry of commonplace characters. He saw them mostly in economically depressed but sexually charged circumstances, which proved extremely popular with both the critics and the public. In seven years he turned out the four plays that are his legacy: "Come Back, Little Sheba," 1950; "Picnic," 1953; "Bus Stop," 1955, and "The Dark at the Top of the Stairs," 1957. 
 He continued to work until his suicide in 1973, though nothing he wrote had the impact of those plays. His biggest hit: "Bus Stop," first seen as the memorable Broadway production, directed by Harold Clurman and starring Kim Stanley, then as the considerably rewritten film vehicle for Marilyn Monroe, directed by Josh Logan. It was also the basis of a 1960's television drama series for which Inge himself was a script consultant.
"Bus Stop" is still a good play, but you wouldn't know it from the superficial staging it's being given at the Circle in the Square, where it opened last night. This production and the 1994 Roundabout Theater production of "Picnic" would seem to demonstrate that Inge's work is as resistant to revival today as "Gammer Gurtons Nedle," which is nonsense.
"Bus Stop" is especially rich with possibilities. It can be very funny. It discovers the fresh and the particular within characters who can too easily be seen as archetypes of humdrum Americana. It's also constructed with an innate sense of a form that works well in popular theater:
A blizzard strands four bus passengers overnight in a small-town diner 40 miles west of Kansas City. They are Cherie, a pretty, not too bright, Ozarks-born B-girl and self-styled chanteuse; Bo, a strapping, lovesick young rodeo rider who's taking Cherie home to Montana to marry her, oblivious to the fact that she doesn't want to marry him; Virgil, Bo's brains and older pal, and Dr. Lyman, an alcoholic, Harvard-educated Ph.D. with a fondness for girls under the age of consent.
In the course of this fraught, turbulent night, Bo courts Cherie like a bull going after a blond mouse, Dr. Lyman romances Elma, the literature-loving, teen-age waitress, while Grace, the owner of the diner, finds time to accommodate Carl, the macho bus driver for whom she has long had an itch. Will, the local sheriff, and Virgil are the unsurprised spectators to the mayhem.
"Bus Stop" can be accurately described as a fugue whose themes are the various aspects of love. That, however, is to freight the text with meanings that should creep out in their own good time. It's primarily a comedy whose genuine sweetness never long disguises the bleak nature of the lives it's recording. Inge was too clear-eyed to be an outright sentimentalist. He longed for happy endings, but the ones he provided (and which soothed audiences) always left the door open for disaster.
He definitely was not a regional humorist. Yet this is the dominant impression you get from Josephine R. Abady's new production of "Bus Stop." In part this is because the principal performances appear to have been shaped in desperation. Though the actors are thorough professionals, they give the impression of being less concerned with the sense of their roles than with accommodating their uncomfortable rural accents while speaking their lines.
There's no doubt that Mary-Louise Parker and Billy Crudup, who play Cherie and Bo, are excellent actors. You should remember her in "Prelude to a Kiss" and him as one of the bright spots in "Arcadia." Yet both are allowed to sound like relatives visiting "The Beverly Hillbillies." It's not a question of the accuracy of their accents, but of the balance, of the way the accents take precedence in the performances, in this way clouding the characterizations instead of revealing them.
Wearing skintight toreador pants and a scrawny jacket of fake leopard, Ms. Parker looks exquisite and fragile as the besieged Cherie, but as soon as she opens her mouth we seem to be in a vaudeville sketch. In addition to his accent, the slightly built Mr. Crudup has another problem. He's physically miscast as the swaggering, rough-and-tumble bronco rider who has no idea of his own dangerous heft. As a result, Cherie and Bo don't seem to be involved in any deliriously crazy courtship, but in a contest to see who can outact the other. Everything seems too forced.
Patricia Dunnock is charming as the Shakespeare-quoting teen-age waitress, who's quite pleased when she learns that the elderly Dr. Lyman did have lascivious designs on her. Ron Perlman plays this fellow with fey elegance, and with less of any recognizable accent than with an insinuating W. C. Fields kind of slur. Kelly Bishop as the diner owner, the role originated by Elaine Stritch; Larry Pine as Virgil; Scott Sowers as Will, and Michael Cullen as Carl are all as good as they can be in a production that appears to condescend to the play.
Ms. Abady uses the stage space well. There's seldom the awareness that the actors are arbitrarily turning this way and that to allow the members of the audience, who are seated around the four sides of the stage, equal access to front views and profiles.
It should be noted that the performance seems to improve somewhat as it goes on. But it's anybody's guess whether this is because the performance really does get better, because one becomes adjusted to its failings, or because Inge's voice will not be stilled, no matter what the obstacles. Possibly it's a bit of all three.
 
BUS STOP
 
By William Inge; directed by Josephine R. Abady; sets by Hugh Landwehr; costumes by Linda Fisher; lighting by Dennis Parichy; sound by Tom Gould. Presented by Circle in the Square, Theodore Mann and Ms. Abady, co-artistic directors. At 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Wanted: Jobs of Last Resort

BYLINE: By Sheldon Danziger and Peter Gottschalk; Sheldon Danziger is professor of social work and public policy at the University of Michigan. Peter Gottschalk is professor of economics at Boston College.

 BODY:
Members of the National Governors' Association were on Capitol Hill yesterday, once again pressing their case for welfare reform. The group has captured glowing reviews from both President Clinton and Congressional Republicans for a package of proposals that would favor block grants to the states over a guarantee of Federal aid.
Liberal Democrats in the House have criticized the plan, saying its cuts in Federal spending are simply too hard on the poor. But they have not given enough attention to what is perhaps the plan's most problematic feature: It would end welfare recipients' entitlement to cash assistance -- after as little as 21 months in Connecticut -- even for those who, though diligently searching for work, cannot find anyone to hire them. 
 These provisions assume that anyone who really wants to work can find a job. And no one would dispute that any welfare reform proposal should require recipients to make a serious effort to find employment. But the proposal must be more realistic about the current demand for low-skilled workers, which has dropped steadily over the last two decades.
To take just one small but alarming example, the number of high school dropouts who are employed has steadily dropped since 1970 -- while the number of employed college graduates has risen by more than 40 percent.
Economists of all political persuasions have documented the increased extent of insecurity among American workers. Moderate economic growth since the early 1980's has on average raised our living standards, but low-skilled workers have seen the least benefit. The lack of jobs that pay adequately obviously bodes even worse for people trying desperately to get off welfare. Today, 45 percent of women who leave welfare find themselves back on it within a year.
The decline in demand for less-skilled workers is not so much the fault of Republicans or Democrats as it is of the changing economy. Real wages for low-skilled workers steadily diminished under Presidents Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George Bush, just as they continue to erode today. But these Administrations do share responsibility for the extent of the hardship. Government simply has not adapted its policies to deal with an economy in which the number of industrial jobs is shrinking.
The consensus among most Democrats and Republicans that welfare should be transformed from a cash-based to a work-based safety net is a promising development. But it will not be fulfilled by the governors' compromise unless their plan provides emergency help for people who have tried to find work and can't. Low-wage public service jobs of last resort would be the best way to provide such help.
The governors can improve their plan, which they hope will form the basis of Federal legislation, by requiring that states offer unsuccessful job seekers the kind of work-based safety net that Gov. John Engler has proposed for Michigan.
His proposal allows recipients who cannot find employment to perform community service in return for continued cash assistance. This provision is important in an economy in which the trend toward downsizing shows no sign of slowing, and it will be critical during any future recession. The National Governors' Association would be wise to include Mr. Engler's work-for-your welfare community service idea in its proposals.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Pat Calls the Tune

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Give him credit. Pat Buchanan has forced attention to the most important political fact in the country today: the belief of ordinary people that they are losing out in economic status and security.
Many Americans have seen their earnings stagnate or decline over the last 20 years. Thousands of middle-class people have lost their jobs in downsizings by blue-chip companies and merged banks. So voters respond when Mr. Buchanan says: "When AT&T lops off 40,000 jobs, the executioner that does it, he's a big hero on the cover of one of these magazines, and AT&T stock soars." 
Another service Mr. Buchanan has performed is to show that Gingrich ism is dead. Voters do not share the obsession of House Republicans with balancing the budget and gutting environmental protection. They care about their economic pain, not the Contract With America.
The trouble is that Mr. Buchanan offers quack remedies. Put a 40 percent tariff on all Chinese goods coming to this country: a nice round number. But what would China do about the American entrepreneurs trying to enter its huge market? And what would happen to political and military stresses in Asia?
The Buchanan program is essentially Stop the world, I want to get off. And that is a fantasy. The world market is here to stay. If America tried to wall itself off, we would simply fall behind other countries in economic creativity and growth.
Mr. Buchanan's success with his message is really a challenge to other political leaders, Republicans and Democrats, to offer serious remedies. For one, education is the key to individual and societal advancement in today's sophisticated economies. Yet American schools are crying out for reform and enrichment.
The need for better-trained Americans to compete in the world is a favorite theme of the Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich. This week it was taken up by the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, who said we were falling behind and called for "renewed commitment to effective education and training, especially on-the-job training."
So voices on both left and right point to the need for better-educated Americans. (Mr. Buchanan's main comment on the subject has been a demand to "shut down the Department of Education and return authority to the states and to the people.")
It is extremely important for Bob Dole and Lamar Alexander -- and President Clinton -- to address the public's economic fears. For unless they are convincingly addressed, they are the classic invitation to demagogy.
American history has been marked again and again by populist movements that worked off economic grievances by attacks on foreigners, bankers and "the elite." There were the anti-Catholic Know-Nothings in the middle of the last century, the Populists at the end of it (turning racist in the South), Huey Long in Depression Louisiana, the anti-Semitic radio priest Father Coughlin, the racist George Wallace.
The American economy is not, in fact, in the dreadful state the doomsayers claim. Unemployment is half the rate in major European countries. But people do feel menaced, and that is a critical reality.
The danger is increased by the growing disparities of wealth and income in this country. I recently saw an investment policy letter from PaineWebber, the financial house, that foresaw a widening gulf and advised its clients to invest accordingly. In five years, it said, the number of people with a net worth over $1 million excluding residences had "increased a whopping 91 percent."
That way -- toward the rich getting an ever-larger slice of the pie -- lies a resentful society. The other day a woman in California telephoned to say that I did not understand why people were for Pat Buchanan. She said:
"Big business and Government have wed. They don't care about this country. They pledge allegiance to the dollar of any country where they can get the most. None of the other Republicans can see that a few people control the United States of America when it was designed by the people, for the people."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Buying by British and Japanese Doesn't Lift Dollar Significantly

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar was little changed yesterday despite a coordinated effort by the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England to buy dollars, currency traders said .
The Japanese central bank was in the Asian foreign-exchange market earlier this week, traders said, buying billions of dollars. Market participants believe the Japanese want the dollar at no less than 105 yen. 
 Traders said they saw signs yesterday that the Japanese effort was receiving help abroad. The Bank of England was buying dollars between 104.85 and 104.90 yen on behalf of the Bank of Japan, traders said.
But speculators tested those levels, restricting the dollar's gains. Still, without the intervention, the dollar would probably be lower since private sector demand for the dollar was low, said John Rothfield, an international economist at Nationsbank-CRT in Chicago.
Mr. Rothfield said it made sense for the Bank of Japan to leave "orders with central banks in other time zones since their intervention didn't work."
The Japanese and British central banks do not comment on their market activities.
In New York late yesterday, the dollar was trading at 1.4497 German marks, down from 1.4499 marks on Wednesday. It rose to 105.05 yen from 104.98 yen. The British pound rose to $1.5446 from $1.5430.
Coordination between two central banks would not be unusual. The Group of Seven industrial nations have been working since last spring to help the dollar recoup from postwar lows.
Part of the Bank of Japan's effort to strengthen the dollar involves a strategy that allowed investors to borrow yen at competitively low Japanese interest rates and invest in United States and South African securities with higher yields.
But the South African rand's dismal performance last week drove the dollar down world wide. Now traders are reluctant to make the same play, and market participants say this has led to the dollar's slide.
In other currency trading in New York yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.1800 Swiss francs, down from 1.1833 on Wednesday; 4.9838 French francs, down from 4.9968, and 1,570 Italian lire, down from 1,574.

HEADLINE: Counties Reaching for Lilco Tax Accord

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
Summoned to Gov. George E. Pataki's office at the World Trade Center in Manhattan, top officials of Nassau and Suffolk counties said yesterday that they were moving toward resolving a tax refund issue that is the major stumbling block in a complex plan to dismantle the Long Island Lighting Company.
Their joint announcement, after a two-hour meeting, appeared to clear the way for the Long Island Power Authority, the state agency that drafted the takeover plan, to vote next week to open negotiations with the utility's management. 
 Both Thomas S. Gulotta, the Nassau County Executive, and Robert J. Gaffney, the Suffolk County Executive, endorsed the authority's moving ahead -- even as they vowed to continue talks on the tax issue.
"We anticipate we will reach an agreement," Mr. Gulotta said at an impromptu news conference after the private meeting. Mr. Gaffney said that "we want the plan to go forward" to replace Lilco. The plan is expected to cut electricity rates on Long Island by at least 12 percent.
Although the Governor was not present, his deputy secretary, Louis Tomson, helped oversee the meeting. The session was an example of Mr. Pataki's efforts to bring opposing sides together on thorny issues, as he did recently in brokering an agreement between New York City and upstate communities on a plan to protect the city's watershed.
Also taking part in the Lilco meeting was James F. Gill, the Power Authority's chairman. He said the two County Executives "made wonderful progress and I am confident they will work out this problem."
In past weeks, the County Executives have wavered and shifted on the Lilco plan. Mr. Gaffney was silent for weeks before offering qualified support. Mr. Gulotta at first endorsed it but then turned cold.
At issue is an enormous tax-refund liability caused by years of overassessment on the Shoreham nuclear power plant, which never went into service. Those excess tax revenues benefited Suffolk County, Brookhaven Town and the Shoreham-Wading River School District.
Lilco paid the taxes, which were included in electric rates charged all its customers, in Nassau, Suffolk and the Rockaways. Lilco began challenging the assessments in court and so far has been winning.
Suffolk officials have been trying to win an exemption as part of the overall plan to replace Lilco. But Nassau officials, who argue that their residents and businesses paid artificially high electric rates to subsidize low taxes in Suffolk, say that is unfair.
Speaking after the meeting, Mr. Gaffney at first did not mention the tax issue. He spoke of the need to eliminate Lilco, introduce competition and lower the Island's electric rates, now the highest in the continental United States.
Mr. Gulotta stressed those same points, but he did not forget the tax issue. "That one component remains a subject of discussion with Bob and me," he said. "It's a significant issue to Nassau County."
Although Mr. Gill has agreed with Nassau in principle, he is trying to avoid losing the broader objective of the Lilco takeover because of the tax issue. "I don't want people to be distracted by that," Mr. Gill said.
Mr. Gill has entertained one proposal that would charge Suffolk residents one percent more in their electric rates for 30 years, a solution Mr. Gaffney favors.
But Nassau officials say that would provide its residents too little relief and take too long. Suffolk officials say that if they pay too high a penalty, the disparity in electric rates will cause economic dislocation, inducing businesses to move to Nassau.
"I think it is doable," said one of the aides at the meeting, speaking on the condition that he not be identified. Referring to the two County Executives, the aide said: "Bob understands that the 30-year payout is not acceptable to Tom, and Tom understands that Bob can't afford a big rate discrepancy. They're looking for a number that everybody is comfortable with."
The Power Authority's vote next week is only the next in a series of steps. If Lilco agrees on a takeover plan, it would require approval by the authority's board, the stockholders and a panel composed of the Governor; the State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, and the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Bonds Gain on Hope Of Rate Cut

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended moderately higher yesterday, buoyed by a resilient optimism that the Federal Reserve would soon cut interest rates again.
The market's optimism was fed by a sharper-than-expected rise in weekly unemployment claims. The data pointed to mounting weakness in the economy, which market participants expect will compel the Fed to cut short-term rates. 
 While bond prices received a boost from the claims data, some investors took their gains and sold. As a result, the market continued to have trouble sustaining upticks in price.
A certain pessimism also limited gains tied to speculation that the Federal Reserve was in the market yesterday buying short-term securities. While such talk bolstered the short end of the market, analysts said it suggested that central banks might have been responsible for much of the recent buying, not bargain-hunting investors.
Still, there are signs that market participants are optimistic following a four-session selloff that ended Wednesday. James Hale, a fixed-income analyst with MMS International in San Francisco, said that while there was a cautious tone in the market, the worst selling was over. He noted that Smith Barney had recently raised the bond allocation in its model portfolio to 35 percent from 30 percent and cut its cash position by 5 percent.
The price of the 30-year bond ended up17/32of a percentage point yesterday, to 95 20/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.33 percent, from 6.37 percent on Wednesday.
Yesterday's weekly report on unemployment claims from the Labor Department showed an increase of 5,000 initial filings to a total of 391,000 for the week ended Feb. 17, up from 386,000 the week before.
Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities, said the four-week moving average was down by 5,250 claimants, to 383,000, from 388,250 the week before. "With this most recently reported data," she said, "initial unemployment claims have continued to approach the 400,000 level -- to some, a mark of recessionary conditions in the labor market."
She said the market regarded the weekly claims report with greater interest yesterday because Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, cited the data in his testimony before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The market will soon turn its attention again to supply as the Treasury prepares to auction new two-year and five-year notes next week. Many traders say they expect dealers will make more concessions on the notes to attract buyers.
In when-issued trading yesterday, the two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 5.10 percent, and the five-year, 5.45 percent.
The Treasury sold $29 billion of 55-day cash management bills yesterday at an average rate of 5.02 percent, and traders said demand was strong. The Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin, said the sale of the 55-day bills -- to meet the Treasury's short-term borrowing needs beyond the money raised through the Government's regularly scheduled auctions -- was intended to cover Social Security payments and keep the Government running through the middle of March.
Earlier in the month, President Clinton signed legislation allowing the the Treasury to sell the bills even though Congress has yet to raise the debt limit. The legislation allows the Government to pay its obligations through mid-March while the Administration and Congress try to work out an agreement on a budget plan.
Rates at yesterday's auction were higher than those at this week's regular weekly bill auction of new three-month and six-month maturities, suggesting that traders and investors are demanding more compensation while the budget debate continues.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 55-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: Law Knows No City Limits;
As New York's Firms Thin Out, Outsiders Rush In

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
Reed Smith Shaw & McClay, a 118-year-old Pittsburgh law firm, had consciously avoided the costs and competition in New York. Last year it hired an international lawyer, Alan A. D'Ambrosio, away from the New York firm of Schnader Harrison Segal & Lewis and put him in charge of a new Reed Smith office in Manhattan. "We realized that we could never get a reputation in the international arena without a New York office," said David W. Christopher, Reed Smith's chief administrative officer.
Pitney, Hardin, Kipp & Szuch, a 150-lawyer firm in Morristown, N.J., opened a tiny New York office two years ago to serve one domestic client. Now it is expanding that office, in hopes of wooing foreign business. "Offshore clients won't even consider you unless you are in New York," said Clyde A. Szuch, a partner. 
 Linklaters & Paines, the mammoth London firm, used to send lawyers to New York regularly to advise American investors about London-based capital markets. Linklaters now has 25 full-time New York lawyers. "Our business is servicing the capital flow, and now that flow is both ways," said David M. Barnard, a New York-based partner.
At a time when New York law firms large and small are struggling -- and some even collapsing -- under the burdens of huge overheads, defecting partners and squeezed fees, out-of-town firms are gleefully expanding in New York. "It seems every large law firm wants to be here," said Klaus Eppler, president of the New York County Lawyers Association.
Apparently so. According to The New York Law Journal, between 1990 and 1995 the number of lawyers at the 25 largest New York branch offices of out-of-town firms grew by 27 percent, to 1,821; the numbers at the 25 largest homegrown firms shrank 4 percent, to 7,409.
Meanwhile, small branch offices keep opening. The influx is so great that the Association of the Bar of the City of New York is, for the first time, compiling a list of those offices so it can notify them of association services and prod them to do pro bono work. "Now there are just too many for us to keep up," an association spokeswoman said. For their part, old-time New York lawyers profess not to be worried about the competition. "The firms that did not survive had serious management problems and cultural problems," said Jerome C. Katz, a partner in Chadbourne & Parke, a 94-year-old New York firm. "You can't infer from the breakup of a few law firms that the demand for exceptionally good lawyers isn't still very high."
But why are the out-of-towners all coming now? Mr. Katz has an answer for that, too. "Their markets have matured, and lawyers are always searching for new demand," he said. "For us that meant opening four offices overseas in five years; for out-of-town firms, it means opening offices in New York." Perhaps most important, New York -- historically a hub for finance and corporate law -- is finally a nut that can be cracked.
New industries are opening here -- interactive technology is the most visible one -- that have no entrenched connections with local law firms. And international business traffic in and out of New York is increasing exponentially. More foreign banks are lending money to New York landlords, more foreign retailers are opening stores, more foreign investors are buying property and even companies.
All of them need New York lawyers to ease their way, but few have longstanding legal relationships in the city. And when they do, it is generally with a lawyer, not a firm. As recently as a decade ago that was a specious distinction: lawyers and law firms bonded for life. Today, lawyers readily take clients from firm to firm.
Indeed, entire ready-made practices are becoming available, as many New York law firms succumb to an array of strains that collectively apply relentless economic pressure on once-stable practices. Many have invested heavily in new computer systems that among other things can fit an entire law library on a few disks but that ironically enable them to do a client's work more quickly and thus reduce their billable hours. Many are still paying huge rents and salaries they agreed to in the high-flying 1980's. Yet many are being pressed by corporations to do more for less, or lose the business.
The toll has been high. Shea & Gould, once the epitome of legal prestige and opulence, dissolved amid partner bitterness two years ago. Lord Day & Lord, Barrett Smith and Bower & Gardner are gone, victims of high costs and too-rapid expansion. Townley & Updike just went down. Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander & Ferdon is disbanding.
The out-of-town firms are happily picking the carcasses. Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, once firmly ensconced in Philadelphia, picked up nearly 60 partners from Lord, Day & Lord, and now has about 200 lawyers in New York, almost as many as it has at home. Mudge Rose lawyers are at the New York offices of the Los Angeles firms of Latham & Watkins and O'Melveny & Myers, and of San Francisco-based Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe. Orrick, in fact, has built almost its entire 125-member New York office by lifting practices from other firms.
"It is great when you take entire practices because the lawyers are used to working together; they feel stable," said Ralph H. Baxter Jr., Orrick's chairman.
The availability of a juicy law practice can actually tip the scales for an out-of-town firm weighing a New York move or expansion. A few years ago, Orrick found out that the 12-member labor law department of Baer, Marks & Upham was ready to move, and voila, Orrick started a New York labor practice. "If they had been in Washington, we would have done it there," Mr. Baxter said.
Similarly, until recently Reed Smith's growth strategy involved spattering the Middle Atlantic region with satellite offices, the most recent in Princeton, N.J., in 1994. New York was not part of the equation until Mr. D'Ambrosio, whose client roster includes Gucci and other high-profile European companies, said he would join.
"Until then, the idea of New York was a skeleton we'd periodically dust off, talk about fleshing out, then just put back into the closet," said Daniel I. Booker, the firm's managing partner.
Firms like Reed, Smith have discovered that a New York beachhead not only gives them access to new clients but also lets them wrench more business from existing ones.
Dimeling, Schreiber & Park, a Philadelphia management buyout firm -- and a Reed, Smith client -- has often been forced by New York lenders to get opinions from New York lawyers. Now it will steer that business to Reed, Smith. "We save the cost of educating two law firms on one transaction, and we avoid the higher New York law firm fees," said William R. Dimeling, a partner.
The cost differential can be considerable. Mr. Szuch, for example, suggests that a top New Jersey lawyer would charge maybe $350 or $375 an hour, while an associate's time would be billed at $150 to $175. Their New York equivalents, Mr. Szuch says, would be charging at least $100 an hour more.
It is not surprising that many out-of-town firms ship the necessary legal scut work back to the home office, where associates' salaries and office rents are lower than in New York. "That's why we can offer New York law at New Jersey prices," Mr. Szuch said.
And they can measure their growth, hiring lawyers as they need them, and cherry-picking practice areas to avoid those where local legal stars seem to have a lock on the biggest clients.
"We'll stick with our mainstay real estate, international and corporate law practice," Mr. D'Ambrosio of Reed, Smith said. "We won't compete in product liability, intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, or other areas where we can do it cheaper, but not necessarily better."
The new firms also often have more manageable real estate costs. Rents are nowhere near as high as they were in the 1980's, when many New York firms were locked into long-term leases. And today's clients often view fancy offices not as symbols of success, but as signs of ostentation and fee bloating.
Many new firms try to compromise between shabby and chic, and choose either a fancy building or a fancy address. Linklaters is in the "Lipstick building," a smart building on mundane Third Avenue at 53d Street, because "being on Park or Fifth was never important to us," Mr. Barnard said. Orrick last year moved into 666 Fifth Avenue, a nice address for a fairly old, albeit recently renovated, building at 52d Street.
"Our offices look professional, but not opulent," Mr. Baxter said. "Our clients won't think we're spending too much money on overhead, but they won't think they are at a discount center, either."
Of course, not all out-of-town firms are immune to the practices that felled some of their New York predecessors.
Linklaters, for one, plans to recruit a half-dozen or so graduates from top law schools. Mr. Barnard is ready to pay top dollar for them -- and charge top dollar for their services. "The guys who say, 'Hey, we're from Pittsburgh and don't pay our lawyers as much,' are making a statement about how they value expertise," he said.
Reed, Smith's new office is in the Seagram Building, the elegant 52d Street tower on Park Avenue that has some of New York's highest rents. Mr. Christopher insists that while American clients may be glitz-averse, offshore clients are not.
"We know we are paying a premium, but if you want to establish an international boutique, you do want the Park Avenue image," he said. Mr. Booker added, "We see New York as important for marketing purposes in a way that the Princeton office, say, is not."
That attitude, even among firms in less spectacular digs, may give the out-of-town firms their most formidable competitive weapon. Many feel less pressure to meet high costs with high fees because they see their New York offices as marketing tools for the rest of the firm.
"We'd never say, 'All right, New York, your expenses were this but your revenues were that, buck up,' " Mr. Baxter of Orrick said. "New York may send great clients to California."
Still, even with lower expectations, the New York newcomers may still hit obstacles. New York firms, angry at the competition, may stop making lucrative referrals to them in their hometowns. They may grow to the point where their costs simply cannot be absorbed by marketing budgets, and where their partners indulge in the same kind of infighting that killed Shea & Gould.
"When you start merging people who come from different firms, the sense of a cohesive culture frays," warned Barbara Paul Robinson, the New York bar association's president. "The result is not always a marriage that sticks."

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Rise by 5,000

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
The number of first-time claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly rose by 5,000 last week, which analysts said reflected a soft labor market.
The Labor Department said today that claims totaled a seasonally adjusted 391,000, up from 386,000 a week earlier. Many analysts had expected a slight decline. 
 It was the second straight advance and raised the number of new claims to the highest level since 412,000 applications in the week ended Jan. 20. Analysts had attributed the 96,000 jump that week to filings that were delayed when the January blizzard closed many unemployment offices.
The four-week moving average of new weekly jobless claims fell by 5,250, to 383,000; the latest average did not include the week ended Jan. 20.
Analysts usually prefer to track the less volatile four-week average because it smooths out spikes in the weekly reports.

HEADLINE: 16 Child-Abuse Programs Are Facing Shutdowns

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
Sixteen child-abuse-prevention programs in the city's Beacon School network of after-school educational programs could be forced to close next week unless the Giuliani administration spends $1.2 million to keep them open, city officials and social service providers said yesterday. The programs provide counseling, supervision and instruction to more than 2,500 children considered at risk of neglect or abuse.
The Beacon School network is run in conjunction with the city's child-protection agency. Many of the children and families involved in the programs are ordered into them by city caseworkers and the courts. 
 "We have not been ordered to close our doors," said Jim Marley, an official with the Pius XII Community Services, which runs one of the preventive programs at Middle School 45 in the Bronx. "But we will run out of money on Feb. 29. We will be gone after that."
The money for the programs dried up when the state slashed its appropriations for preventive services last year. The people who run the programs said that City Council officials assured them last June that the programs would be kept alive when the Mayor's budget was modified in November. But Council officials conceded yesterday that they had neglected to insure that the money was appropriated during negotiations.
Deciding whether to provide the $1.2 million necessary to keep the programs open could pose an awkward challenge for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. He has said for weeks that protection of the city's children is his top priority. And after a week's worth of disturbing child-abuse cases, Nicholas Scoppetta, the Commissioner of the Administration for Children's Services, has repeatedly said that his agency's budget of $1.2 billion will not be cut.
But the administration, reeling from budget shortfalls, has also indicated that there are limits to its ability to solve a crisis it says has been created by state budget cuts.
First Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers said yesterday that it was far from certain that the city would provide funds to keep the programs afloat through the end of the school year. He said the city had come up with $3.5 million eight months ago for the programs when the state slashed its budget for what are known as preventive services.
"We are in tight economic times," said Mr. Powers. "We are ready to take a look at which of these programs are working." Mr. Powers said that some of the programs might be closed and others asked to accept reduced funds.
The heads of the programs said a decision by the city not to allocate the $1.2 million could have serious consequences for the child welfare agency, which is responsible for 43,000 foster-care children. Indeed, Mr. Scoppetta, appearing at a news conference announcing the indictment of a Brooklyn husband and wife for the brutal beating of their son, conceded yesterday that "the system is in crisis," with caseworkers overburdened and often ill trained.
"The city has been aware of this problem with funding the programs since last October," said Jean Thomases, associate executive director of Good Shepherd Services, which runs a Beacon child-abuse program at P.S. 15 in Red Hook, Brooklyn. "We thought they would take care of it because it seemed to be right in there with their core goals."
Officials with the programs said that since 1992, when the effort began, city officials had regarded the Beacon School programs as models of cost-effective abuse prevention.
At Intermediate School 302 in the Cypress Hills section of Brooklyn, Larry Shweky said that his staff of three social workers was working with 45 families with children who might have been added to the city's foster-care population.
"Teachers who suspect abuse or neglect direct children to us," said Mr. Shweky. "Parents come in and say they fear for their children's safety. And they come because they know us."
Thomas L. McMahon, the City Council's director of finance, said that even a brief gap in financing could close the programs. He said that the City Council, which is to vote on the Mayor's most recent budget modifications on March 7, would seek to persuade the administration to provide the emergency money.
"What the resolution will be, I'm not sure," he said.

HEADLINE: Blunt Talker On Budgets And Deficits

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Perhaps no one in the Clinton Administration gets as fired up as Alice M. Rivlin about eliminating the Federal budget deficit. As director of the Office of Management and Budget since October 1994 and deputy director for 20 months before, she has been a powerful voice for balancing the budget -- and in this her views are strongly akin to those of Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman.
But Administration colleagues took pains to make clear that Ms. Rivlin, nominated yesterday to be the Fed's vice chairman, would not favor policies that took income away from Americans unnecessarily. And, they said, Ms. Rivlin, 64, would bring to the Fed a backbone that is likely to make her as sturdy a point person for the Administration as her predecessor, Alan S. Blinder, although less public about it. 
 Still, Ms. Rivlin holds views on economic growth that sometimes seem closer to those of Mr. Greenspan than to those of Mr. Clinton, who has suggested that the economy might benefit from more economic growth than Mr. Greenspan seems to favor.
Once, for example, Ms. Rivlin criticized the President for wanting to spend billions on public investments -- in part to stimulate economic growth -- rather than using the funds to cut the deficit.
Ms. Rivlin, who earned her Ph.D. in economics at Radcliffe College in 1958, was the founding director of the Congressional Budget Office. She has served as president of the American Economic Association, worked in the Johnson Administration, and was director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution.
Her marriage to Lewis A. Rivlin ended in divorce and she has since remarried to Sidney Winter. She has three grown children.

HEADLINE: GOVERNMENT CUTS MAY CAUSE LOSSES IN LOAN PROGRAMS

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
When President Clinton delivered his State of the Union Message last month, no part was more warmly applauded than his declaration that the "era of big government is over."
To the audience and the President, "big government" meant the huge Federal bureaucracy, with its thousands of programs and workers. But even as the number of Federal workers has begun to shrink significantly for the first time in decades, there has been enormous growth in a largely unnoticed side of the ledger: Federal liabilities. 
 Each time a student or small business takes out a Federal loan, or a home buyer seeks a Federally guaranteed mortgage, or a farmer seeks Federal insurance against crop damage, the Government's liabilities grow. And the list of Federal liabilities, including loans, loan guarantees and insurance, is expanding so fast that by 1998 Federal loan guarantees alone are expected to exceed $1 trillion, up from $600 billion in 1992, according to the Office of Management and Budget. And in 1995 the Government set aside between $180 billion and $300 billion to cover costs and estimated losses on these programs.
"People want the Government to go away, to be less intrusive, less bureaucratic and more efficient," said John A. Koskinen, O.M.B.'s deputy director for management. "But they also want all the guarantees, the insurance, the promises. It's built into the fabric of their assumptions about what their lifestyle is like."
But with this unheralded growth of the Government's liabilities has come major cuts, beginning with Ronald Reagan, in the numbers of inspectors, auditors and regulators to oversee Federal loans, promises and projects. And with less oversight, experts warn, the financial health of the Federal Government's loan and insurance programs is at increased risk.
The Comptroller General, Charles A. Bowsher, said the General Accounting Office's recent audits have found that the Government now has insufficient financial accounting systems and managers to insure that those liabilities are properly monitored. Consequently, he believes the Government cannot afford to further weaken this system of controls as it continues to take on more responsibilities for loans and financial promises.
"When you don't have the management systems in place," Mr. Bowsher said, "you're taking a really big risk in downsizing, especially when there are a lot of things on the liability side of the balance sheet that are going up. You have to extend oversight."
During the 1980's, Government commitments grew, but, in the name of deregulation, Federal oversight was all too often lax, numerous reports show. Eventually, little-noticed Government insurance and credit programs lost hundreds of billions of dollars as the savings and loan industry collapsed, and farm, student and housing loan programs experienced large defaults.
This led to the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, a widely praised law that requires that agencies annually set aside anticipated losses in credit programs.
Mr. Koskinen of the O.M.B. pointed to that law in saying that he did not share Mr. Bowsher's worries. He said he believed that the Government has a better understanding of the cost of credit programs, and that the Administration has appropriate systems in place to do better with less.
He added that overseeing rising liabilities with dwindling resources presents "a risk if agencies don't have enough resources, if they cut willy-nilly."
Indeed, the Clinton plan to reinvent Government has won wide praise for making the Government more in tune to consumers; Mr. Bowsher is one of those who applaud the improved customer relations. Moreover, many of the new loans are aimed at people most in need.
For example, guaranteed loans to small businesses have gone to $25 billion in 1994, from $12 billion in 1990. Loan guarantees for companies doing business abroad have almost tripled over the same time frame.
 
Less Supervision, Mounting Liabilities
Since Mr. Clinton took office, more than 200,000 Federal positions have been cut from the Government payrolls, a point the President repeats time and time again. His Republican opponents on the campaign trail are also championing the cause of a smaller Federal Government. But neither the Republicans nor Mr. Clinton are talking about the potential dangers that can come from shrinking the Government.
There is no Government-wide survey showing exactly which Federal positions have been eliminated under Mr. Clinton. But his plan to reinvent Government specifically targeted supervisory personnel, budget analysts, accountants and auditors.
Meanwhile, the Government's insurance and credit backing programs stood at $7.3 trillion in 1994, up from $4.4 trillion in 1985.
"The United States Government is like a big holding company, a big insurance company that's underwriting all the catastrophes. These entities are like underground rivers, only when it rains do you see them," said Edward J. Kane, a professor of finance at Boston College who in the mid-eighties made the most accurate prediction of the impending savings and loan debacle, which bankrupted a federal deposit insurance fund.
Some of this recent growth in guaranteeing loans stems from the Clinton Administration's emphasis on making Federal credit more accessible to women and minorities. At the Small Business Administration last year, for example, loans to women-owned businesses went up 84 percent, and loans to minority-owned businesses went up 53 percent.
Moreover, traditional business interests, like real estate developers and lenders, continue to benefit from Federal credit programs. The Labor Department is helping Federally insured pension funds invest in urban mortgages; the student loan program is being expanded, and agencies like the Export Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation are doing more to help American businesses operating abroad.
 
Cutting the Staffs That Monitor Programs
The G.A.O. is charged with auditing the Federal Government for Congress and is another tier in the internal controls system. On average, the G.A.O. says it saves the Government $15 billion a year through its audits.
Even though a new law increases the G.A.O.'s responsibilities for oversight, Congress has cut the G.A.O.'s staff by about 30 percent in four years. Mr. Bowsher, the head of the accounting office, said that he was worried that his agency has lost scores of accountants and other technical specialists, but that according to the agency's latest annual report, the G.A.O. has been able to fulfill its supervisory responsibilities by investing in new management systems.
But studies by the G.A.O. show that other parts of the Government generally have been unable to figure out how to build modern computerized systems to manage their risks.
Mr. Bowsher said one bright spot is the improved oversight of student loans by the Education Department.
Another level of Federal oversight consists of inspectors general, who perform somewhat like independent auditors.
The inspector general of the Small Business Administration, James F. Hoobler, has had his budget and number of positions reduced. While Mr. Hoobler said in an interview that the S.B.A. was making significant progress in deterring people from misstating their income on loan applications, he also said the combination of dwindling resources and expanded programs was a risky combination.
"You cannot increase the Government's loan guarantees and cut the personnel for managing them and reduce or hold steady the oversight without increasing the risk," he said, adding, "it is a formula for disaster over time."
 
An Agency Tries Doing More With Less
Philip Lader, the S.B.A. administrator, said his agency was a model for how the Administration has reinvented Government by slimming the agency in partnership with the private sector, producing results by expanding Federal credit opportunities yet protecting the Government's assets. Earlier this month, President Clinton talked about the S.B.A. in an appearance in New Hampshire.
"One of the things I'm proudest of about our Administration and all the work we've done to try and give the American people a Government that costs less and does more is that we have reduced the budget of S.B.A. by about 40 percent and we've doubled the loan volume," Mr. Clinton told the gathering.
The President praised an 18-month-old S.B.A. pilot program, called Lowdoc, in which applicants for loans of up to $100,000 can obtain approval in a few days with only minimal S.B.A. paperwork. The Lowdoc program accounted for 56 percent of the agency's 55,600 loans last year.
Mr. Lader said that "doing more with less increases somewhat the taxpayer's exposure" for the S.B.A., which backs $32 billion in loans, but that one solution has been to rely more on private lenders, whose loans the agency guarantees.
Already those lenders are sounding an alarm.
"Clearly in Lowdoc they pushed it out the door too soon," said Tony Wilkinson, the president of the National Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders. His biggest concern was that the program was begun without guidelines. "They had no program guide detailing what the standards are," he said. "You should have the standards first, then implement the program second." He and others say it is too soon to tell what the loss experience will be on the Lowdoc program.
An S.B.A. spokeswoman said a draft program guide was recently completed.
Acting on lender concerns that default rates might rise as a result of Lowdoc, Mr. Hoobler, the inspector general, recommended reducing Government risk on Lowdoc loans by lowering the S.B.A.'s guarantee from 90 percent to 75 percent Mr. Lader opposed that proposal, but Congress reduced the rate to 80 percent with S.B.A. support.
Under Mr. Clinton, each S.B.A. district office has a list of goals of how many loans it should make each year to various groups. Lenders have been pushed to meet the goals, and some have relaxed their review standards, prompting some S.B.A. officials to complain to Congress, according to agency documents, officials and Congressional aides.
One senior S.B.A. manager, who asked not to be identified, said many of the agency's district offices were finding that Lowdoc's promise of reduced Government red tape had mistakenly led many small banks to think they could reduce their own review of borrowers. This in turn increases the risk of the S.B.A., which guarantees these loans but relies on the banks to evaluate the worthiness of the borrower.
The loan goals are consistent with the Administration's ideas about evaluating Government performance. The President's budget last year listed as a performance measure and indicator of "Well-Being," the "numbers of loans extended for Federal credit programs."
Mr. Bowsher said using quantity, not quality as an indicator of success, was something that worried him.
In fact, the S.B.A. once used numerical goals for its direct lending program in the 1970's, but ended the practice in the early 1980's when officials discovered that their use had lessened standards, causing higher default and loss rates.

HEADLINE: Unemployment-Fund Battle Begins

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
Business and labor leaders in New Jersey began a joint lobbying effort today against a legislative proposal that would use $1.1 billion from the state's unemployment insurance fund over the next four years to help pay for hospital care for the poor.
The state's authority to divert revenues from the Unemployment Compensation Fund expired on Dec. 31. State legislative leaders, who rejected Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's proposal last fall to raise cigarette taxes, proposed last week to continue drawing on the unemployment fund, but to reduce reliance over the next four years until total spending for charity care is included in the state's operating budget by the year 2000. 
 The business and labor leaders, however, argue that the proposal does not end dependence on the unemployment fund quickly enough. They say that many employers have had to pay unemployment taxes at higher rates over the last three years because the state has already diverted $1.6 billion from the fund from 1993 through last December. They also worry that a sharp rise in unemployment in the state could threaten the fund's ability to pay unemployment benefits. In December, the unemployment rate was 7.3 percent, the latest figure available, although new figures are expected to be released Friday.
"When the Legislature imposed this burden on business and labor three years ago, it pledged this would be a stopgap measure that would end in 1995," said Philip Kirschner, senior vice president with the New Jersey Business and Industry Association. "This pledge has been broken."
Mr. Kirschner is working to defeat the measure with labor leaders from around the state. Several busloads of union members arrived at the State House today to meet with their legislators to urge them to oppose the plan. The Assembly's Health Committee approved the measure today, and it is expected to be considered in the Senate next week.
Peter J. Lillo, vice president of government relations for the New Jersey Hospital Association, said that hospital officials were pleased that the Legislature was moving toward a solution. "We feel that this legislation provides proper reimbursement to our hospitals, which have been continuing to provide quality health care without charity care dollars," Mr. Lillo said.
The Senate majority leader, John O. Bennett, a Republican of Monmouth County, said that the groups opposing the legislative solution were jeopardizing health care for the working poor.
"If they are successful in garnering support for their opposition, there will be no charity care solution," Mr. Bennett said. "Hospitals have already missed one check and if we do not act soon, hospital bills for the uninsured will continue to go unpaid, putting their health care at risk."
Under the proposed legislation, the state would distribute $300 million to 84 hospitals, a $100 million cut from last year. Another $100 million would be used to help finance a state-subsidized health insurance program.
This year, the plan would use $387 million from the unemployment fund and $13 million from the state budget's general fund. In 1997, the state would increase spending for charity care from the general budget to $68 million. In 1998, the state would use $168 million from the general fund, then $268 million in 1999, and $400 million in the year 2000.
Governor Whitman would not say whether she would support the bill, but she did say that the legislation was closest "conceptually" to what she had proposed late last year.

Talent Lost to a Failure Called Politics

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
WHAT, other than unrealized Presidential ambitions, could Jesse Jackson and Ross Perot possibly have in common? Sympathetic phone calls to Felix G. Rohatyn, it seems. Independently of each other, those two political mavericks from opposite poles commiserated with Mr. Rohatyn, the New York investment banker and public watchdog, after he was forced to pull out of the running for the No. 2 seat on the Federal Reserve Board.
"They both said, 'We're terribly sorry that you're not going to be there because you could have made a difference, but we understand why you withdrew,' " Mr. Rohatyn recalled in the Rockefeller Center offices of Lazard Freres, where he is the managing director. "Now, these are clearly not men with the same philosophical point of view. It is, I think, a terrible indictment of the system." 
 Many agree, and they include conservative business executives and editorial writers who most days have as much use for his ideas on government activism as they do for tax increases.
Their annoyance goes well beyond personalities or Mr. Rohatyn's ruffled feelings after Senate Republicans made clear that they would block Administration plans to make him the Fed vice chairman. Far more important, and not only to conservatives, is a question that has become all too familiar -- and depressing:
How can we expect talented people to trade velvety positions in business for sojourns in government if they are going to be treated shabbily by politicians even before reaching the front door?
"My friends in the business community, without exception, thought from the beginning that I had been out of my mind to try to do this," Mr. Rohatyn said.
LED by Connie Mack of Florida, the only United States Senator who shares the name of a demolished ball park, the Republicans did not challenge the New Yorker's credentials in high finance or Government fiscal policy. How could they? Besides having guided countless corporate mergers, he was a central figure in pulling New York City back from the fiscal abyss in the mid-1970's.
No, the knock against Mr. Rohatyn was that he didn't share the government-as-devil doctrine of so many Republicans. In his view, that put him in the ranks of Robert Bork and Lani Guinier, other prospects for high office who washed out not for incompetence but for failing "some philosophical litmus test."
At one point, he said, he had sought guidance from a Republican friend, former Sen. Howard H. Baker Jr. Mr. Baker's grim advice: "Before you start, you should have no illusions; this is the ugliest climate that I have ever seen in Washington." Similar words came from another friend, the columnist George Will, hardly a flaming liberal.
"In all the years in which I've watched the political process," Mr. Rohatyn said, "I've never seen so much ideological certainty about things that nobody can really be certain about and so little willingness to engage in dialogue or any kind of a bipartisan effort." Had that climate prevailed in New York two decades ago, with Democrats and Republicans refusing to set aside their differences for the greater common good, the city, he said, would not have been saved from fiscal disaster.
IF he carries any label, Mr. Rohatyn said, it is that of fiscal conservative. But he added: "In this day and age, especially if you're a fiscal conservative, you have to maintain an active role for government because too many people have no other place to turn to, because it is a very rough game, this modern capitalism that we're playing."
What are the issues that weigh heavily on Americans, he asked, answering his own question with a lineup of worries like crime, failing schools, illegal immigration and unfair overseas competition. Who is going to deal with those problems if not government leaders? Bill Gates? Warren E. Buffet?
And obviously, New York has its own share of troubles. It may not be staring bankruptcy in the face, as in the 1970's, but the absence of an immediate crisis doesn't mean the city can ignore what Mr. Rohatyn calls the "very deep-seated, slow hemmorhage" in public services.
"The need for public investment in this country is staggering," he said. Once again, that is where government comes in. "I've never argued for big government," he said. "What I've argued for is effective government."
It is the kind of issue that he had hoped to discuss from the national soapbox the Fed would have provided. But it was not meant to be. Oh well, said Mr. Rohatyn, who in a few hours would take off to Paris on business. Not a bad consolation prize -- Paris for a few days. "There is," he observed, "very much of a life without Washington."

HEADLINE: Rich Nations Urge Action to Cut Dangers of Lead

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 22

 BODY:
Industrialized nations have reached the first international agreement on measures to reduce the dangers posed by lead in the environment.
After a two-day meeting in Paris this week, the environment ministers of 26 nations committed their governments to fight the noxious effects of lead through cutting back use, tightening regulations and working with industries. The group met at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, whose 26 member nations consume 65 percent of the world's lead. 
 The agreements signed here include a political statement and a plan for action, but they are not legally binding and depend on the voluntary cooperation of industry.
They call for phasing out lead in widely used products like gasoline and paint, more recycling, developing substitutes and removing lead altogether from objects used by children or in food packaging.
The agreement sets the stage for binding action at the United Nations, said Carol M. Browner, Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The United States and several European countries had fought for a legally binding document now. But Australia and Canada, the world's leading lead producers, blocked such a move. Although they already have strict domestic rules for lead, the two nations said they did not want to impose restrictions on export industries.
Lead has adverse effects as it accumulates in the body, especially for children and pregnant women. It can lead to anemia, mental retardation and permanent nerve damage.
Although many rich countries have phased out lead as a gasoline additive, global lead use is still increasing, especially in Asia.

HEADLINE: An Adviser to Presidents, Regardless of Party Stripe

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Laurence H. Meyer, a Democrat nominated yesterday to the Federal Reserve board of governors, has been dispensing advice on the economy to Presidents for more than a decade. He gave President Clinton advice on tax proposals during the 1992 campaign, and has worked with the Administration ever since.
Mr. Meyer's consulting firm, Laurence H. Meyer & Associates in St. Louis, operates one of the more sophisticated computer simulations of the nation's economy, and Mr. Meyer in recent years has twice won national awards. 
 "He brings to the board very strong forecasting skills," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, director of the President's National Economic Council, "and these are essential in the judgments the Federal Reserve must make."
Mr. Meyer, 51, holds fairly traditional economic views. Like Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, he argues that the economy may not be able to expand at an annual rate of much more than 2.2 percent over a long period without risking higher inflation. But he says that he might be more willing than the chairman to experiment with higher growth, to test whether there might be capacity not evident in the statistics.
"I am sensitive to the fact that the Federal Reserve historically has kept interest rates up for too long when the economy shows signs of weakening," he said. "And that exacerbates the weakening."
Mr. Meyer, who founded his firm with two partners in 1982, is also an economics professor at Washington University, near his home. Mr. Meyer was born in the Bronx and raised in Queens. He and his wife, Florence, a real estate agent, have two children in their 20's.

HEADLINE: Labor Sees Fiscal Hope in Credit Card Deal

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
To help finance its political activities and its plans to expand, the labor movement is harnessing an unexpected tool: capitalism.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. announced yesterday that Household International, a finance company based in Illinois, had offered to pay the labor federation an estimated $375 million over five years in exchange for being able to issue and service a special credit card to union members. 
 Officials of the labor federation, which has an annual budget of $69 million, hailed Household's offer, saying it could help finance labor's stepped-up efforts to organize workers and support pro-union candidates for political office this fall.
The federation asked finance companies to bid for its credit card business, known as Union Privilege. Labor officials said Household made the best offer, although the federation is giving its current credit card company, the Bank of New York, until next Wednesday to match Household's offer.
Federation officials said the A.F.L.-C.I.O. receives far less money in its current arrangement with the Bank of New York. They said that 2.2 million of the federation's 13 million members held the union credit card offered by the Bank of New York, and that their outstanding balance was about $3.6 billion.
Federation officials said the interest rate that Household would charge for unpaid balances -- expected to be 13.5 percent -- was lower than the more than 17 percent average for other credit cards. Household has agreed to charge the prime rate plus five percentage points.
Denise Mitchell, communications director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said its 54-member executive council had not decided how to spend the money from Household. One option, she said, is to divide the estimated $75 million a year equally between the federation and its 79 affiliate unions.
Financial advisers to the federation said Household was willing to share much of its credit card revenue with the federation because union members are loyal customers with a delinquency rate that is less than half the national average.
As part of his strategy to build a more militant labor movement, John J. Sweeney, president of the federation, introduced some ambitious and expensive plans at the executive council's winter meeting in Bal Harbour, Fla. They include spending $35 million this year to help elect pro-labor candidates, and spending $20 million over 18 months to help persuade workers to join unions. To finance its political plans, the federation is to vote next month on whether to assess an extra 15 cents a month in dues over the next year.
Before ending the Bal Harbour meeting yesterday, the executive council urged subscribers, advertisers and distributors to boycott the flagship publications of the Gannett Company and Knight-Ridder Inc., which own newspapers in Detroit that have faced a strike since July.
To step up pressure on the owners of The Detroit News and The Detroit Free Press, the federation urged a boycott of USA Today, a Gannett publication, and The Miami Herald, owned by Knight-Ridder.
Gannett and Knight Ridder are publishing the papers with permanent replacement workers. Tim Kelleher, senior vice president for labor relations with Detroit Newspapers, which publishes the two Detroit papers, said the union should spend more energy at the bargaining table and less on organizing boycotts.

HEADLINE: Cold War Over, France Plans a Slim, Volunteer Military

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 22

 BODY:
Announcing the most sweeping military changes since development of a nuclear deterrent almost 40 years ago, President Jacques Chirac said tonight that France's armed forces would shrink by about a third and become an all-volunteer force within six years.
To replace the military draft for young men, a hallowed institution since Napoleon, Mr. Chirac called for a national debate about how both men and women could serve France in civilian jobs instead. 
 Mr. Chirac told a national television audience that cutting the 500,000-strong uniformed forces was long overdue five years after the end of the cold war. "We are in a time when expenditures have to be reduced," he said. "We are no longer threatened by an external invader."
Last year the President also said the French military would partly reintegrate into NATO, 30 years after Charles de Gaulle pulled out to protest American domination.
The French military of 2002, Mr. Chirac said, will need only 350,000 people, all volunteers. "At the end of this reform, we will have the ability to deploy 50,000 to 60,000 soldiers abroad, with everything they need," he said. Britain and the United States, where the armed forces are all volunteer, already have that capability. France has only 8,500 troops in its most easily deployable unit, the Foreign Legion.
Speaking in an informal interview after a Government conclave on the military, Mr. Chirac said he was aware that Germany, as the last major continental power with a draft, was concerned about the implications of his decisions.
Perhaps as a sop to German concerns, he announced that 15 short-range Hades missile launchers, which can fire tactical nuclear weapons but are only capable of reaching targets in Germany, would be dismantled.
And he also pledged that the 15,000-strong French contribution to the French-German Eurocorps would remain untouched, though other units now stationed in Germany may be withdrawn as the army slims down from 124 regiments, to as few as 83 by 2002.
Even France's vaunted nuclear deterrent is coming under the budget knife.
Mr. Chirac, denounced around the world for conducting underground nuclear tests in the Pacific right up to last month, said one reason for the tests was to make sure that a new French strategic nuclear deterrent, entirely concentrated in a new class of missile submarines, would work.
The submarine deterrent now consists of five boats that can launch missiles with up to 96 warheads of 150 kilotons apiece. But this year the navy is to get a new class of four submarines with more powerful missiles with a 3,500-mile range.
Mr. Chirac said tonight that the new missiles would replace all of the 18 obsolescent S3-D medium-range land-based rockets now stationed on the Albion Plateau, in the southeast.
He also said France would close its only factory that makes plutonium and weapons-grade uranium, at Pierrelatte, south of Lyon, because the country has enough.
The sprawling French military industry is to be reorganized to meet intense competition from the United States on world markets.
Mr. Chirac said the military draft, in effect since 1905, had become unfair. Only half the young men called ever serve, and women are not drafted at all. Even at its current size, the army cannot absorb all the young men theoretically eligible for service.
"There are two possible courses," he said. "One is to to say that national service is a part of our national heritage and that we should retain it in some way. The other is to create a civilian service that would be open to both boys and girls, volunteers only, with incentives to take part."
He suggested a broad national debate between now and 2002, when the military draft would be abolished -- and the debate has already begun.
A former Prime Minister, Edouard Balladur, a fellow conservative, said a national referendum on the changes would be desirable.
Francois Leotard, a former defense minister who recalled that proposals for an all-volunteer army had stirred national passions five years ago, said, "Conscription has long been the soul of our defense and the expression of a vision of society."
The United States, Britain and Germany have all cut military spending by about a third since the collapse of the Soviet Union, but France has hardly cut back at all.
But now, with Mr. Chirac's Government faced with a need to cut a $59.3 billion budget deficit by next year to qualify to join a common European currency by the end of the century, cutting spending on the military and the vast industrial complex that feeds it may be easier than trying to cut back on social security or health insurance.
The Defense Ministry now employs 600,000 people, including 100,000 civilians. Of the 236,600 uniformed troops in the army, well over half, 132,320, are draftees; 50,000 more conscripts serve in the navy and the air force, and 18,000 in the national gendarmerie.
With unemployment at about 12 percent, Mr. Chirac promised that the cuts would not bring layoffs or uncompensated economic hardship to regions that depend on the military for their livelihood.
French officials said the army could be reduced to about 140,000 over the next five to six years, with smaller reductions for the other forces; parliamentary experts estimated that eventually this could save about $1.2 billion a year.
While Great Britain and the United States have made their forces more flexible for deployments like the NATO mission in Bosnia, France has left its armed forces more or less the way they were during the cold war -- allocated and trained to defend national territory in the event of an invasion, a threat that no longer exists.
"We had to beg, borrow and steal from 47 separate regiments to put together a 15,000-man intervention force during the war in the Persian Gulf," said Pierre Lellouche, a conservative member of Parliament close to Mr. Chirac on military issues, in an article in the daily newspaper Le Figaro.
"At the same time, the British Army, which is less than half the size of the French Army now, managed to deploy more than 30,000 soldiers to the same theater of operations."
By law, French draftees cannot be sent on overseas missions against their will; according to Francois Heisbourg, another expert, who is close to the opposition Socialist party, only one in six draftees accepts such duty, which requires them to sign up for longer tours.
"That and other things mean that the army we now have, with nearly 240,000 people, is less usable for the kind of short overseas deployments that are likely in the post-cold-war context than an all-professional army of 100,000 would be," Mr. Heisbourg said. "The draft provides more people than the army can use or provide with modern equipment, anyway."
Mr. Lellouche said, "The truth is that we do not have an all-volunteer intervention force that is up to our diplomatic ambitions."

HEADLINE: Two New Faces Join Greenspan As Fed Choices

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
President Clinton today renominated Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and filled two other vacancies with appointees considered unlikely to strongly dispute the chairman's slow growth strategy to control inflation.
The decision gives a third four-year term to Mr. Greenspan, 69, who was originally named by President Ronald Reagan in 1987 and whose priority has been to fight inflation by keeping the economy from becoming overstimulated. Mr. Clinton named his budget director, Alice M. Rivlin, as vice chairman, and appointed Laurence H. Meyer, 51, an economic consultant in St. Louis, to a second vacancy on the seven-member Federal Reserve Board. 
 While both Democrats, Ms. Rivlin, 64, and Mr. Meyer, 51, are considered less likely to rock the boat at the Fed than Felix G. Rohatyn, the New York investment banker whom Mr. Clinton originally hoped to name as vice chairman. Analysts said the appointments indicated that Mr. Clinton had backed away from using his appointees to press for a robust public debate on the pace of economic growth.
Mr. Greenspan "has inspired confidence, and for good reason," President Clinton said in an announcement from the Oval Office in the White House. "His decisions have helped us to work toward a period of sustained economic growth."
All three posts require Senate confirmation, and two key Congressional Republicans indicated today that the two nominees would not face the kind of strenuous opposition that caused Mr. Rohatyn to withdraw his candidacy last week.
"Clearly, I would look on these two more favorably than Mr. Rohatyn," Senator Connie Mack, the Florida Republican who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, said. "I would want to review some questions with them at the time of the hearing, but I am favorably inclined."
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, pledged to schedule confirmation hearings "as quickly as possible" and said he was not aware of "any impediment" to their winning Senate approval.
Mr. Greenspan was also said to favor the appointments of Ms. Rivlin and Mr. Meyer, according to Administration officials and Wall Street traders.
As the nation's central bank, the Federal Reserve probably has more to say about the health of the economy than any other institution. It regulates the supply of money and exerts direct control over levers that determine short-term interest rates. The Fed can use its powers to slow down a rapidly expanding economy that in its view threatens to produce higher inflation, or stimulate a lagging economy that might be in or tilting toward recession.
The Administration has long signaled its intention to renominate Mr. Greenspan, a Republican, despite the fact that his cautious policy-making is somewhat at odds with Mr. Clinton's goals of encouraging higher growth and rising wages, issues that have become prominent in the Presidential election campaign.
To do otherwise would have risked roiling the financial markets, where Wall Street traders and major investors have come to see Mr. Greenspan as practically indispensable.
The markets appeared to signal their approval of Mr. Clinton's move. Analysts said the major source of the surge in the stock market today was renewed optimism that the economy will grow moderately without inflation. But some suggested that reports of the impending nominations contributed to the good mood on Wall Street.
Mr. Clinton had hoped to name Mr. Rohatyn as vice chairman of the Fed, replacing Alan S. Blinder, who had spoken out at times in favor of cutting interest rates somewhat more aggressively than Mr. Greenspan.
White House officials had expected that Mr. Rohatyn would have been a more forceful advocate of economic growth and job creation, thereby serving as a stronger counterpoint to Mr. Greenspan's caution. Republicans who now control Congress made it clear they would not support such a candidate.
"There is now a debate, a serious debate in the country, about whether there is a maximum growth rate we can have over any period of years without inflation," Mr. Clinton said last week.
For the last week, the Administration had considered an array of alternatives, including, officials said, allowing Mr. Greenspan to remain as chairman, but without formal appointment until after the November election.
Asked at a news briefing today whether Mr. Clinton had considered not naming Mr. Greenspan immediately to a third term, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the head of the President's National Economic Council, ducked the question. She said only that Mr. Clinton had been forwarded an array of options to choose from.
Ms. Rivlin, director of the Office of Management and Budget, clearly had to be persuaded by the President to become the first woman to hold the Fed's No. 2 position. The post can be seen as a step down from her Cabinet-level job. Earlier this month she vigorously stated her lack of interest in the job, saying she preferred to stay at the budget office to see the year's marathon budget deliberations to their end. "I have a big job here," she said at the time, adding that "no way, no how," would she be joining the Fed.
But as he announced the appointments late this afternoon, Mr. Clinton joked: "I haven't lost all my powers of persuasion. Battered and bloodied as I may be, I can still, once in a while, make a good argument."
Mr. Clinton said he thought his appointments would foster the kind of economic debate he would like to see. "Our objective should be to achieve the maximum sustainable economic growth in our country, consistent with not letting inflation get out of hand," he said.
Administration officials argued today that with Ms. Rivlin and Mr. Meyer joining Mr. Clinton's other Fed appointee -- Janet L. Yellin, a former economist at the University of California at Berkeley -- the President's viewpoint would be well represented on the central bank.
"We now have three like-minded people on the board," an Administration official said, "and they are all independent thinkers. They won't act as a herd, but there will be a significant voice articulating the high cost associated when economic growth slows too much, as well as the perils associated with inflation, when the economy gets too strong."
But Mr. Mack said he expected Ms. Rivlin and Mr. Meyer to be "supportive of a Fed that would be committed to price stability -- low inflation."
Bond market traders, too, shared Mr. Mack's view and suggested that Ms. Rivlin would in the end line up with Mr. Greenspan and be less outspoken than Mr. Blinder, who resigned the vice chairman's post to return to Princeton University.
"She is obviously in the main channel on policy," said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston, a Wall Street bond trading house. "She might be a little more doveish than Greenspan but less outspoken than Mr. Blinder. The key thing is that the Fed governors disliked Mr. Blinder because he was more visible and more argumentative, and that made the bond market nervous."
Although the relationship between Mr. Greenspan and the White House began as a rocky one, his management of the economy has been widely praised and his relationship with Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin has been particularly good.
Mr. Greenspan's tenure has been marked by a reduction in inflation that has kept the annual rise in the Consumer Price Index below 3 percent for each of the past four years. Under Mr. Greenspan, the economy went through one recession, lasting from July 1990 to March 1991, and has grown, by past standards, relatively slowly since then.
By raising short-term interest rates to 6 percent from 3 percent between February 1994 and February 1995, Mr. Greenspan sought to achieve a "soft landing" from a period of faster growth at the end of 1993. There have been recent signs that the Fed may have overdone its tightening, however, raising the prospect of weak economic growth in an election year.

Clinton Renames Greenspan And Fills 2 Fed Vacancies
President Clinton renominated Alan Greenspan to a third term as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and filled two other vacancies with appointees considered unlikely to strongly dispute the chairman's strategy of slow growth to control inflation.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
What Dole Owes Us

BYLINE: By A.M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
"We didn't plan it this way. I didn't realize that jobs and trade and what makes America work would become a big issue in the last few days of this campaign."
Bob Dole blurted that out in the final hours of the New Hampshire campaign, a dreadfully self-destructive but sadly honest confession. It showed that he had handed the primary to Patrick Buchanan -- and how he might possibly find himself again before he is too long gone. 
Mr. Dole did not realize what was happening in the last days because he had not grasped it in the first days -- the anxieties eating at Americans across the whole blessed country.
"Where has he been?" asked Patrick Buchanan. So should we all, particularly those who see Mr. Buchanan, his bigotry, his nut-wing pals and his mean cockamamie nationalism as dangers to America.
Hunkered down, head in shell, in a dreary political hole of his own digging -- these are answers to where Mr. Dole was. Democrat or Republican, planning to vote for him or not, he hurt us all by giving Mr. Buchanan the primary. Pray Mr. Buchanan does not get the nomination, but Mr. Dole has increased his chances. The Senator owes us now.
Mr. Buchanan is an intellectual mediocrity and stands for nothing new. His proposals are numbskull ism. They would push America into a depression of economy and mind, leave us at once without allies and soon without customers. They would do more damage to America than all the left-wing multicultural movements laid end to divisive end.
New? We have seen his kind since the first demagogue picked up the scent of public fear and used it to attain power. I do not know if he studied Fascist and Communist propaganda techniques or just has a natural talent for them.
Any experienced opponent with the wit God gave him could have ripped Mr. Buchanan to shreds. As the leading Republican, Mr. Dole had that responsibility.
He failed because neither he nor his G.O.P. colleagues had the courage to face the issues -- including Mr. Buchanan's bigotry. The Democrats are not showing much stomach for it either. Mr. Buchanan gets a free ride as a symbol of American values, can you believe it.
Like Mr. Dole, other Americans also did not grasp the anxiety issues. For instance: Those businessmen, economists and writers who believe that workers and mid-level executives laid off during prosperity will be downright grateful once they see their invaluable role: today's manure to nourish tomorrow's flowers.
"What makes America work," said Mr. Dole. A lot more is involved than "It's the economy, stupid."
Do the rich, middle class and workers of America have a common interest, or is that sentimental garbage? Will the income of workers and middle class rise along with that of the wealthy? Or will more American pie be stuffed into fewer faces?
If downsizing insecurity makes so many Americans susceptible to a demagogue at a time of 5.5 percent unemployment, how much will his power increase if it becomes 10?
If we accept, as we must, that Americans will be displaced by increasing high-tech productivity, will we simply tell them that some day more jobs will be created and until then, tough on you? Or will we put profits and taxes into raising the entire American economy so it produces more good jobs quickly, not in the distant by-and-by?
Is it conservative or liberal to say that government, business and labor have joint responsibility in making America work? And who cares?
When does bottom-line obsession endanger something more important than profits: trust in a society democratic and intelligent enough not to treat too many people as dispensable lest they think so is the society?
I do not know yet how I will vote. But America deserves a choice between two good candidates. Lamar Alexander has not yet shown the country exactly why he should be President. Steve Forbes could use a few years for public achievements that might qualify him for office, say Mayor or Governor to start.
Praise Senator Lugar for staying in the race; maybe he will come up stronger. But it is Senator Dole who has the clearest duty to face American realities -- including showing Mr. Buchanan, consistently and plainly, as a danger to true American values and ideals. Now or never; that's the decision, Senator.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE NEXT STEP;
Delaware Vote to Test Forbes's Viability

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del., Feb. 22

 BODY:
Even his keenest admirers admit it: Steve Forbes must do a lot better soon or his Presidential campaign will slide quickly into terminal irrelevance.
The Delaware primary on Saturday would make a nice start, thank you. 
 "He has to win somewhere," said Representative Michael N. Castle, the state's leading Republican, who has refrained from endorsing a candidate. "He ought to be able to win here. It's close to his own New Jersey, small and the competition isn't much."
Fourth in Iowa, fourth in New Hampshire, the wealthy publisher is the only big-time candidate campaigning here. His sole active rival is Alan Keyes, the talk-show host and former diplomat. Other hopefuls have avoided this tidy little state as if it were a leper colony, fearful of offending people in New Hampshire who dislike upstarts trying to usurp a bit of the quadrennial political limelight.
But all the candidates' names are on the Delaware ballot, whether they like it or not, and much of the state's political and economic establishment, alarmed by the pitchfork-populist oratory of Patrick J. Buchanan, has rallied around Senator Bob Dole. Flanked by denizens of Chateau Country, as the locals irreverently call the colonies of DuPont heirs and executives north of here, Senator William V. Roth Jr. endorsed Mr. Dole at a news conference on Wednesday.
The Kansas Senator was not there, but his voice was, by way of an amplified telephone call from his plane, flying from New Hampshire to South Dakota. Mr. Buchanan "wants to build a wall around this country," Mr. Dole told people whose well-being is dependent on exports, but "I know where the soul of the party is."
You might call it virtual campaigning.
Lamar Alexander, the former Tennessee Governor, appears to have little going for him here. But Mr. Buchanan is highly popular with the religious right and other social conservatives in downstate Delaware, a land of enormous chicken farms where the accents and the politics have more in common with the rural South than cosmopolitan Wilmington. Some experts put the anti-abortion, anti-gun-control base at about 20 percent.
In addition, the arrival of thousands of Central Americans in the region in recent years to work in the chicken-processing plants has generated the kind of tensions, with local people feeling their jobs threatened, that Mr. Buchanan has exploited in the campaign so far. Housing is now short in some areas, language controversies have flared and social-service agencies are overstretched.
"We have a tradition of moderate Republicanism, fiscally conservative, socially slightly more liberal," said Basil Battaglia, the state Republican chairman. "But this is our first Republican primary, and it's hard to say what will happen. If the Wilmington suburbs don't vote and the southern counties do, Buchanan could surprise us."
Independent polls taken in the last two days show Mr. Dole about 10 percentage points ahead, followed by Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Forbes, with Mr. Alexander farther back.
So Delaware presents Mr. Forbes with an opportunity but also confronts him with a menace. Should he lose here, as the only active contender, running in effect against ghosts, it would open his flagging candidacy to ridicule.
He is giving it his all, campaigning in the Wilmington area on Wednesday night and today, then flying to Arizona for tonight's debate there and flying back -- completing a 5,000-mile round trip -- to campaign downstate on Friday. In a state with only 12 convention delegates and an almost invisible primary, he has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on radio and television advertisements and a half-dozen mailings to Delaware's 137,000 registered Republicans, of whom perhaps 20,000 are expected to vote on Saturday.
Mr. Forbes has spent "the equivalent of Rwanda's national debt," wrote Ron Williams in a burst of hyperbole in The Wilmington News Journal, for commercials "on radio, television, cable, walkie-talkie, shortwave, single sideband, ship-to-shore and Morse code."
But Mr. Forbes has several things going for him besides big bucks. For one, this state is quite accustomed to the sight of a very rich, rather shy Princeton graduate with glasses talking endlessly about tax cuts. It had one as governor for many years, Pete DuPont (now a reluctant Dole supporter).
In addition, people here, like those in other small places slightly off the beaten track, like to be noticed. Voters may therefore reward Mr. Forbes for taking the time and trouble to come to Delaware to campaign and punish those who decided to give it a pass. Reflecting the resentment that many at being snubbed, Representative Castle said in a speech on Wednesday night: "When I signed the Presidential primary bill into law as Governor of Delaware, I never thought it would come down to people not showing up."
People here are seeing and hearing a much more polished candidate than the Steve Forbes who toured Iowa two weeks ago. At a Rotary Club luncheon today in an ornate ballroom of the Hotel DuPont, he gave 400 business and professional men and women the same pitch, almost word for word, that he has been giving for months, pushing for a flat tax, greater parental control of schools and a new retirement plan for young people.
He used the same four jokes he has used from Ames, Iowa, to Manchester, N.H., to New York to Phoenix. Sample: "The Washington diet is where you gain 10 pounds but tell yourself you would have gained 15 if you weren't dieting."
But his timing is better, his delivery more fluent and his feel for an audience improved. His smile seems less pasted-on. And he has added words of derision for Mr. Buchanan, who "would wall us off from the world."
Today at a news conference at New Castle County Airport, south of here, Mr. Forbes named former Senator Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming as his campaign chairman "with executive responsibilities" and promised to stay in the race until the convention in August, something he has plenty of money to do. He left vague the future roles of Carter Wrenn and William Dal Col, top aides who have been criticized for strategy and execution of the campaign to date.
"This race may not be decided in the early primaries," he said hopefully. "We're entering a new phase. It's going to go on longer than most."

Radio Talk Show Host Fears For True Conservatism's Fate

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
Patrick J. Buchanan's candidacy for the Republican nomination has not simply stirred concern at the highest levels of the Republican Party. It has also alarmed Rush Limbaugh, the talk radio host who functioned as a kind of national precinct captain for the Republican electoral revolution of 1994.
Over the last few days, as Republicans and conservatives struggled over the meaning of Mr. Buchanan's victory in the New Hampshire primary, many of them hashed it out by calling Mr. Limbaugh's show. And Mr. Limbaugh was trying to walk a careful line: warning Republican leaders not to antagonize Mr. Buchanan's supporters (which has some overlap with the Limbaugh audience) but criticizing Mr. Buchanan himself as not a true conservative. 
 "I'll tell you something, you are being manipulated in a way that I find very bothersome," Mr. Limbaugh told Buchanan supporters on Wednesday. "Pat Buchanan is not a conservative. He's a populist."
Because of his protectionist stance on trade, "Pat Buchanan wants to engage in policies that expand the role of government in people's lives," Mr. Limbaugh said. The radio commentator argued that the level of government intervention necessary to guarantee individual jobs simply did not comport with the tenets of conservatism.
Mr. Limbaugh said in an interview that he was speaking "as a commentator and not part of the Republican establishment." He also said his primary concern was the fate of conservatism, not the Republican Party establishment. But he said he worried that party leaders were under-estimating "how large, how passionate and how upset with the establishment this group of people is."
Alluding to the criticism of the Buchanan campaign coming from party luminaries in recent days, Mr. Limbaugh added, "It's too risky for the Republican establishment to start insulting voters."
Still, the conservative commentator was experiencing for himself the tensions and strains that have afflicted the Republican Party in recent days. After his comments about Mr. Buchanan, Mr. Limbaugh said he came "under assault" from critics who asserted he had lost touch with regular people and the economic anxiety swirling at the grass roots.
He was also getting angry E-mail and calls, he said, from Buchanan supporters who asserted that all he cared about was tax cuts and other economic issues.

HEADLINE: After New Hampshire, People vs. the Party?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Pundits tell us that the results of the New Hampshire primary equal a vote for President Clinton because Patrick J. Buchanan cannot possibly win the Republican nomination. In other words, the Republican Party -- not the American people -- will have the last word on who will be the Republican nominee.
They would do well to recall that in the fall of 1994, as President Clinton forced a lame-duck Congress to stay in session to vote on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Senator Bob Dole's office reportedly received more than 2,000 calls in a day, almost all urging him to vote no or to delay the vote until after newly elected members of Congress had beenseated. 
 In response, Mr. Dole was quoted as saying, "Bill Clinton needs to do a much better job of explaining these trade agreements to the American people."
The next day the Republican leader voted in favor of the GATT. Since then, of the 700,000 Americans employed in the garment industry, 100,000 have lost their jobs.
Democrats were free to state that they voted as they did because Mr. Clinton is their leader and they must present a united front.
But Bob Dole had no such excuse. Now he states (front page, Feb. 20), "I didn't realize that jobs and trade and what makes America work would become a big issue in the last few days of this campaign."
Wasn't it such ignorance that doomed the candidacy of George Bush?
Patrick J. Buchanan, on the other hand, has been extolling his brand of economic populism for years.
A magnificent drama is about to unfold before our eyes. Act I has just ended in New Hampshire.
The episodes to follow will answer these questions: Does government of the people, by the people and for the people still exist? Or is America's election process just a facade, all smoke and mirrors? The world is anxiously awaiting the denouement.

HEADLINE: Agency Is Both Fiscal Watchdog and Lame Duck

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Douglas A. Criscitello sits in a dingy, barren, borrowed office in the New York City Municipal Building. He has, for the moment, little more than a telephone, a desk and a stack of resumes, but he is presiding over the birth of a municipal agency that two mayors and most of the city's other elected officials have been trying for six years to kill.
Mr. Criscitello is the first director of the Independent Budget Office -- an agency voters approved in 1989 as part of the city's new Charter. It is intended to serve as an objective, nonpartisan monitor of the city's dauntingly complex, often deliberately obscured budgets. 
 Not only is he the first director, he may also be the last.
Even before Mr. Criscitello can hire a single assistant, three of the city's four top elected officials -- Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi and the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone -- are pledging to abolish the agency once and for all. Only the Public Advocate, Mark J. Green, has supported the agency, now only five days old. He, in fact, loaned the office space.
The rest of the government, having failed in court to delay the agency out of existence, now plans to ask the State Legislature to erase the Charter provision that called for it. Failing that, they may ask the voters to drive a stake through it in a ballot referendum possibly as soon as November.
Meanwhile, the officials are appealing the latest in a string of court rulings against them. The last one ordered the city to stop stalling and let the agency come to life. All of this for an agency whose budget -- $2.6 million for a full year -- is less than 0.00008 percent of the city's overall $32.6 billion budget.
The Mayor's senior aide, First Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers, said even that small sum would be "better spent on children or the elderly." Besides, he added, the city already suffers from a plethora of fiscal monitors, from the city's Comptroller to the state's Financial Control Board. (Those monitors, it is worth noting, often criticize the Mayor's fiscal policies.)
"We believe it's unbelievably redundant and wasteful of taxpayer dollars," Mr. Powers said, expressing a fervent wish for the agency's quick demise.
So much for a warm welcome.
In fact, with all the forces aligned against it, the agency's fate is now no more certain than it was before -- despite the earnest presence of Mr. Criscitello, a 34-year-old public policy type who knew when he accepted the post that it would be an uphill battle just to keep his agency alive.
"I can't worry about that," Mr. Criscitello said, sounding as if he worried just a little bit nevertheless. "My mission is to do a good job. If we can prove the I.B.O. adds some value to the city's budget process, then there will be no debate about its future."
For the agency's defenders, Mr. Criscitello's mere presence is nothing short of a municipal miracle.
After the city's new Charter created the agency in 1989, Mayor David N. Dinkins, joined by the Council's leaders, said he absolutely would not pay for it. It took a lawsuit in 1991 and a series of decisions and appeals that went all the way to the state's highest court in 1994 to make the new Mayor, Mr. Giuliani, relent -- for now anyway.
"The office arrives at just the right moment," said Gene Russianoff, one of the office's few defenders. He is a senior attorney for the New York Public Interest Group, an advocacy organization that, with three others, filed the lawsuit against the city. "There are all these sweeping and controversial changes being proposed in the city's budget, and many of us are having a tough time participating in the process. The whole point of the I.B.O. is to even the playing field."
For the moment, however, Mr. Criscitello is the Independent Budget Office.
He has no staff, not even a secretary. He cannot hire one either, because the agency will not have a budget until at least next month, when the City Council votes on an appropriation that the Mayor grudgingly submitted under the orders of the State Supreme Court.
It may also take some time to get a permanent office, although the Department of General Services has promised him another temporary suite on Chambers Street. The current office, such as it is, is on the 10th floor of the Municipal Building, down a warren-like hallway in a pre-renovation state of disorder and decay.
All of this has put Mr. Criscitello's first paycheck in almost as great a state of uncertainty as the first of the agency's mandated analyses on Mr. Giuliani's $31 billion budget proposal. And it does not seem very likely to get any easier.
"I'm not able to move as boldly as I'd like," said Mr. Criscitello, who served most recently as the acting chief financial officer for the Small Business Administration in Washington.
He was chosen after a highly politicized search led by Mr. Hevesi, Mr. Vallone, Mr. Green and Borough President Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx. He emerged as the choice, officials said, largely because he was an outsider -- unbeholden to the political powers that be.
To the agency's supporters, that makes him independent; to its opponents, that makes his office easier to kill, since fewer powers would likely rush to its defense.
Despite all that, Mr. Criscitello envisions a grand role for the new agency, like that of the Congressional Budget Office or the Office of Legislative Analysts in California's Capitol.
He hopes to build a respected office -- with a staff of 30 or so -- that provides line-by-line analyses of where taxpayer dollars go, offers alternatives and, perhaps most of all, educates the public on the intricacies of municipal budgeting.
"I want to provide objective, even-handed analysis," he said. "It's analysis that may benefit the Mayor. It may benefit the Council. It may benefit neither. Hopefully, it will benefit the public."
But it is not going to be easy. The agency's first report, as mandated by the Charter, is due on May 15. It is supposed to be a full-blown review of the Mayor's executive budget to be released in April.
Mr. Criscitello acknowledged that he might not make the deadline.
 
The Birth of a Fiscal Monitor
 
Approved as part of a new City Charter, the Independent Budget Office is opposed by city officials and was allowed to open only under orders of the State Supreme Court. But it still has no budget.
 
1989 As part of the Charter revision, voters approve the Independent Budget Office as a nonpartisan alternative to the Mayor's Office of Management and Budget.
 
1990 An advisory committee selects candidates for director, but no one is appointed.
 
1991 Mayor David N. Dinkins and the City Council appropriate $3 million for the agency but later erase its funds, citing a budget crunch. A coalition of civic groups files suit to force the city to comply with the Charter.
 
1992 A State Supreme Court judge rules that the city violated the law by not creating the agency. Mr. Dinkins and the Council appeal. At the same time, the Council Speaker unsuccessfully approaches the State Legislature about revising the Charter to eliminate the agency.
 
1993 The Mayor and Council lose the appeal, but appeal again to the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals.
 
1994 The Court of Appeals rejects the city's arguments and orders the city to obey the Charter. Having lost in court, the City Council adopts and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani signs legislation delaying financing for the agency. That sparks a new lawsuit.
 
1995 The Mayor and Council, now joined by Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, lose again in court. The Mayor's office grudgingly agrees, under court order, to finance the agency by February 1996.
 
1996 A new advisory committee selects Douglas A. Criscitello as the agency's first director. He starts on Feb. 20, even though the Council has not yet appropriated a budget. The Mayor, Comptroller and Council Speaker pledge to abolish the agency once and for all through state legislation or a referendum.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar's Early Gains Evaporate After U.S. Bond Prices Decline

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar finished lower against most leading currencies yesterday, erasing earlier gains in Asia and Europe, after news of unexpected strength in American home construction pulled down the price of Treasury bonds.
Some of the dollar's fall was a result of foreign investors pulling out of Treasury securities and taking their money home. But market analysts also said currency traders had been expecting the dollar to weaken. 
 "There's a lot of profit taking," said Hillel Waxman, chief foreign exchange dealer at the Bank Leumi Trust Company. "There's been a shift in sentiment."
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 104.77 Japanese yen, down from 105.05 yen late Thursday. The dollar also fell to 1.4470 German marks from 1.4497 marks.
The British pound slipped to $1.5410 from $1.5446.
The dollar rose sharply in early trading after the Bank of Japan again tried to support the dollar and Germany issued money-supply figures that encouraged speculation about a cut in interest rates there.
But shortly after American trading began, the Commerce Department said housing starts rose 4.4 percent in January, a stronger performance than had been expected for a month when there were severe winter storms in much of the country.
That led to a selloff in the bond market and gave currency traders an excuse to take profits before the weekend.
The data on housing starts came 90 minutes after a Commerce Department report that the American economy expanded 2.1 percent last year, the weakest performance since the last recession. The report had little effect on the dollar.
Traders said that during Asian trading there were signs that the Japanese central bank was trying to pull the dollar to 105 yen for the fourth time this week.
With the Bank of Japan apparently determined to keep the dollar from sliding, traders have been gambling that they can make money by pushing the dollar lower, then wait for the Japanese central bank to offer to buy at a higher rate.
The Bank of Japan is afraid that a lower dollar would translate into weaker profits for those Japanese companies that make much of their money in dollars, analysts said. They added that such concerns are particularly urgent now, as Japanese companies approach the end of their fiscal year on March 31.
"The question is: Will they throw in the towel before the 31st?" Mr. Waxman said.

HEADLINE: New Weakness Seen In New Jersey Jobs

 BODY:
New Jersey lost a significant number of jobs last month as the state's unemployment rate remained above the national average, suggesting continued sluggishness in the economy, according to new data. 
 Using a new method to estimate unemployment, New Jersey's joblessness rate was 6.5 percent in January. Officials revised the December rate downward, easing concern that a spike in unemployment had signaled a sudden downturn.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: BOB DOLE;
Dole Says Buchanan Is Extreme In Outlook

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: MEDFORD, Ore., Feb. 23

 BODY:
Bob Dole asserted his independence from religious right leaders today as he continued to criticize Patrick J. Buchanan's views.
At a speech this morning at a high-tech electronics plant in Wilsonville, Ore., the Kansas Senator branded Mr. Buchanan's views "extreme," despite pressure from Ralph Reed, executive director of the Christian Coalition, and other movement conservatives sympathetic to Mr. Buchanan's candidacy, to soft-pedal his comments. 
 "I don't work for anybody in Washington," Mr. Dole told reporters after the speech. "I'm the candidate; they're not."
A conference in Washington this morning of the Conservative Political Action Committee -- always suspicious of Mr. Dole's commitment to their cause -- seemed to lay bare the escalating rift within Republican ranks over the Presidential contest.
Mr. Reed said in a speech at the conference that name-calling and negativism "are not the traits of leadership, they are the trappings of demagoguery."
David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union, told reporters at the same conference that Mr. Dole was insulting Mr. Buchanan's followers and ran the risk of "enraging" them. "Pat Buchanan is not Bob Dole's problem," he said. "Bob Dole's problem is that he has not to this date given voters a reason why they ought to want him as their President."
And Gary Bauer, president of the Family Research Council, said in a telephone interview, "When you throw around that rhetoric, it makes it very hard to patch it all together after San Diego."
Asked in Oregon if he was worried about alienating Buchanan supporters, Mr. Dole said: "I'm not going to alienate anybody -- unless they feel women are somehow inferior or that we ought to expand rather than contract the availability of nuclear weapons." He was referring to previous statements by Mr. Buchanan.
Later, as he toured a Salvation Army warehouse here, where food was being distributed for flood victims, Mr. Dole suggested that his staff was looking for further documentation of Mr. Buchanan's positions, apart from those on women and nuclear weapons, that would show what Mr. Dole considers his extremism. "We're checking," Mr. Dole said. "There'll probably be some others before the day is out."
In the closing days of the campaign for Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, Mr. Dole stepped up his criticism of Mr. Buchanan and described his "extreme" positions in television commercials. As he was losing the primary on Tuesday night to Mr. Buchanan, Mr. Dole signaled the rhetorical direction of his campaign, declaring that the race was now a "struggle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party." He has repeated it several times since, saying at one point, "The party belongs to us."
When word first reached the Dole campaign plane late Thursday night en route to Oregon from Colorado that the conservative right wanted the Senator to ease up his criticism of Mr. Buchanan, Dole aides suggested he would.
Later when his plane landed in Portland, Mr. Dole appeared to be calculating his course and responded to questions by drawing a semantic distinction. He said that he had never used the word "extremist" to describe the commentator himself but had used only the adjectival form of the word to describe Mr. Buchanan's views. "I'll probably use it tomorrow," he said.
Mr. Dole and his aides have realized that since they lost New Hampshire, Mr. Buchanan's views have proved a useful foil and helped Mr. Dole focus his own message as someone who could hold the party together. Moreover, the campaign has been criticized in the past for capitulating to the right, and some inside the campaign believed it was important for Mr. Dole to stand firm this time.
At the same time, Mr. Dole has shaded his message to reflect the economic anxiety of middle-class Americans that Mr. Buchanan has successfully tapped. And while he fiercely rejects Mr. Buchanan's calls for protectionism, he also suggests that retaliatory trade practices would be okay.
"We don't have to be run over by Japan or anybody else to protect our markets and get access to their markets," Mr. Dole said in Wilsonville this morning. "My view is, if we don't have access to their markets, they shouldn't have access to our markets."
And again at a fruit-packing plant here, he said, "I don't think the jury is in yet on Nafta," referring to the trade agreement that Mr. Buchanan is criticizing but that Mr. Dole, as the Senate majority leader, worked to pass.
"He's touched a nerve," Mr. Dole told reporters, "and we need to address it."

HEADLINE: REACTOR ACCIDENT IN JAPAN IMPERILS ENERGY PROGRAM

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 23

 BODY:
Two months after an accident at its prototype reactor, Japan's program to use plutonium to provide a virtually inexhaustible supply of energy is at a crossroads, and could be in danger of collapse.
Even the most optimistic officials think it will take three years to restart the fast-breeder reactor, where the leak of dangerous sodium coolant occurred in December. Some other analysts think that the reactor, which is in the city of Tsuruga on the coast of the Sea of Japan, will never be activated again. 
 Japan has spent three decades developing fast-breeder reactors, which produce more nuclear fuel than they consume, in an effort to rescue itself from its near-total dependence on imported oil and uranium.
So intent has this resource-poor country been on achieving energy independence that it has stuck with the breeder, which uses deadly plutonium as fuel, even as the United States and most other industrialized countries have abandoned such reactors, judging that they contribute to the spread of nuclear weapons, are too technologically daunting and no longer make economic sense.
But the December accident, as well as a ham-handed attempt to cover it up, has undermined public confidence in the Government's assurances of safety and brought into the open serious opposition in Japan itself to the vast and expensive project. Nuclear proponents and opponents agree that this political damage will take longer to repair than the damage to the reactor itself, named Monju after the Buddhist divinity of wisdom.
"It's not an engineering but a social problem now," said Dr. Yoichi Fujiie, a member of the Atomic Energy Commission, which sets nuclear policy.
For project engineers, who have thought they were working in the national interest, the doubts of their countrymen have come as a severe shock. "The social problem is so big, which we never thought of 20 to 30 years ago when we started designing Monju," Tadao Aoki, a mechanical engineer who has spent 23 years on the project, said as he led a visitor through the reactor recently as crews worked to clean up the mess from the leak.
Japan is not likely to pull the plug on the plutonium energy program outright. There is too much pride and investment for that. The Government has not changed its long-term goal of developing breeders, arguing that the rapid growth of other countries in Asia will eventually exhaust the world's supply of oil and uranium, even if it takes longer than they once thought. And officials point out that virtually no radiation was released during the accident.
But the program could die from attrition, or be changed into a research project to preserve the accumulated technology.
"The usual way is to postpone and postpone and postpone until there is nothing left," said Dr. Jinzaburo Takagi, executive director of the Citizen's Nuclear Information Center, an antinuclear group. Indeed, in the two months since the Monju accident, delays have been announced in two other key pieces of the plutonium program.
Still, some officials say that once the furor from the accident dies down, the project could resume, since the Japanese public in general tends to go along with government plans. And since the target date for developing commercial breeders had already been postponed until 2030, a delay of a few years now will not be that serious.
Breeder reactors offer a self-sustaining source of energy. Even as they generate electricity, they produce more plutonium than they consume by converting some uranium in the fuel to plutonium.
By contrast, a conventional light-water nuclear reactor burns uranium and uses it up, producing some plutonium as waste product. Japan intends to obtain plutonium for its breeder reactors by reprocessing the waste from its conventional reactors. This reprocessing is now being done for Japan in France and Britain, although Japan is building its own reprocessing plant.
The setbacks to Monju are not entirely welcomed by nuclear opponents. With Monju now unable to burn the plutonium that is being prepared for it, Japan's stockpiles of the deadly material will grow -- from about 11 metric tons to 25 tons by the end of the century, Dr. Takagi estimated. That would increase the risk that some of the material could be diverted to make nuclear weapons and violate Japan's pledge not to hold more plutonium than it needs.
The Monju accident has undermined public confidence not only in the breeder reactor but in conventional nuclear power as well. And with the market for their products dying at home, Japan's manufacturers of nuclear power plants are now seeking business elsewhere in Asia.
In recent years, Japan's plans have aroused uneasiness abroad. Some Asian nations worry that Japan might one day use its plutonium to make weapons, which Japan vociferously denies. The breeder program would also require many shipments of plutonium from France and Britain, and the first such shipment three years ago aroused world ire.
The project has also faced growing economic problems. When the breeder program was conceived in the late 1960's, it was thought that uranium for conventional nuclear plants would soon run out. But uranium is now cheap and abundant, and plutonium is becoming available from weapons being dismantled after the cold war.
"All the claimed advantages -- security, political and economic -- that appeared initially to favor plutonium use have changed," said a recent report by three scholars at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "Yet the rationales and main elements of the Japanese plutonium program have not changed."
Officials announced last month that the projected cost of Japan's own nuclear waste reprocessing plant had doubled to 1.6 trillion yen, or about $16 billion. The project will be redesigned and scaled back, and its operation will be delayed by three years, until 2003.
Perhaps that is just as well because with Monju down, Japan cannot easily use the plutonium. Indeed, to keep its plutonium stockpiles from getting out of hand, Japan had been planning, starting this year or next, to burn plutonium in conventional light-water reactors. But governors of three prefectures that are home to 60 percent of Japan's nuclear plants are now opposing that plan, so it will be delayed.
Monju had just begun producing electricity in August. It was still operating at only 43 percent of its 280-megawatt capacity when the liquid sodium used as a coolant began leaking from the secondary cooling system on the evening of Dec. 8.
Japanese investigators say the accident was caused by a broken temperature sensor. The sensors are long rods covered with a stainless steel casing that protrude into the flowing sodium. Vibrations caused by the sodium flow wore out the casing, and it broke off.
Officials say that only about one metric ton, about 2,204 pounds or one cubic meter, out of the 270 tons of sodium in the pipe leaked. But even that small amount of sodium caused more damage than expected.
The extremely hot sodium, which can explode if it comes in contact with water, warped a carbon steel floor and reacted with the moisture in air to form a corrosive mist and powder. Some of the mist spread outside the plant and to other rooms through an air duct that was directly below the leaking pipe.
But even more attention has focused on what happened after the leak. The Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation, the Government-owned company that runs Monju, took more than 90 minutes to shut down the reactor, failed to promptly notify some local officials and concealed videotapes of the accident.
One 14-minute videotape showed men in silver space suits exploring the room in which sodium compounds hung from the air ducts like icicles. The floor was covered with powder like fine snow, so that the men left black footprints. Part of a covering on a pipe was burned away.
But the tape released to the public was reduced to one minute, showing only a small pile of powder on the floor in an otherwise pristine-looking room.
On Jan. 12, the company that runs the reactor conceded at a news conference that top officials had taken part in the cover-up. One of the men conducting the news conference was Shigeo Nishimura, a company official taking part in the internal investigation of the cover-up.
Late that night, Mr. Nishimura jumped to his death from an eight-story Tokyo hotel, leaving notes saying he was tormented by the discomfort his investigation was causing his colleagues.
The company is now due for an overhaul, with several officials already having been replaced. Today anti-nuclear activists petitioned prosecutors to file criminal charges against four company executives for falsifying reports on the accident.
This was not the first time the company had engaged in clumsy public relations. It was criticized by Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary for making an animated video in which a character claimed that it is safe to drink plutonium.
In Japan, the nuclear industry has never had to explain much to the public. One serious accident at a plant in Tsuruga in 1973 was not made public for three years.
Localities accepted nuclear plants because they brought taxes, employment and special payments from the central Government and utilities. In Tsuruga, a city of 65,000 about 220 miles west of Tokyo, property taxes from Monju and several other nuclear plants will amount to about $100 million next year, or one-fourth of the city's budget.
Still, even before the Monju leak, plans for two new conventional reactors in normally pro-nuclear Tsuruga have been frozen because of concerns about earthquake safety, and most localities in the area have passed resolutions urging a freeze or scrapping of Monju.
"If a referendum were held, I'm sure 80 percent of the people would oppose Monju," said Hiroyuki Uchiike, owner of a seed shop in Tsuruga.
The same is true throughout Japan. The country has 49 nuclear plants, which provide 30 percent of its electricity. But there are only a handful more under construction because localities will no longer accept the plants.
Still, the future of the breeder program might be decided not by the public but by the electric utilities, which are becoming edgy about the potential high costs of plutonium power.
Last year the electric companies rebelled against the Government and killed a plan to build another type of plutonium-burning reactor, saying it was too expensive and unnecessary.
Yuichi Hayase, general manager of the nuclear power department of the Federation of Electric Power Companies, said the utilities are still backing the breeder program. Mr. Hayase said the breeder would cost no more than a conventional nuclear reactor, a figure nuclear opponents scoff at.
The utility industry will soon have to put its money where its mouth is. It is supposed to pay for the next breeder after Monju, a $4 billion, 600-megawatt "demonstration reactor" that is scheduled to be completed in about 2005. But the industry has not yet found a site for it, so this plant, too, is likely to be delayed.

HEADLINE: Rate Jitters Drive Down Bond Prices

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bond investors seemed to catch another case of interest rate jitters yesterday, sparking a selloff that sent prices lower and yields sharply higher.
By the close of the New York market the 30-year bond had fallen a full point to a price of 9420//32 and a yield, which moves in the opposite direction, of 6.40 percent, up from 6.33 percent yesterday. It was the second time this week that long-term interest rates had touched 6.40 percent, the highest they have been since last October. 
 Yesterday's bond slump capped a week in which the outlook for short-term interest rates and, therefore, economic growth, changed several times, leading to volatile trading that also spread to the stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average swung wildly yesterday from a 51-point surge in the first half-hour of trading to a 48-point fall in the afternoon, only to finish with a 70-point rally that propelled the Dow to a new high. For the day, the Dow was up 22.03, to 5,630.49. [Page 37.]
"Historically increasing volatility after long moves in the market suggest that the market is close to a turnaround," said Ricky Harrington, a senior vice president and technical analyst with Interstate /Johnson Lane in Charlotte, N.C. "This market -- the equity market -- in terms of the Dow has been without a correction of more than 3.5 percent since November 1994."
The selloff in the bond market yesterday was touched off, analysts said, by a unexpectedly strong jump in housing starts in January, which rose 4.4 percent. That surge could indicate that the economy, after nearly standing still in the last three months of 1995, is beginning to pick up again. If that is the case, then there would be less chance of the Federal Reserve's trimming its short-term interest rate target again soon. And that view -- combined with concerns about growth pushing inflation higher -- worried investors enough to prompt the day's selling of both short- and long-term Treasury securities.
But given the shifting views recently, investors and analysts could change their minds quickly, especially because there does not appear to be any near-term threat of a sharp rise in inflation. But the uncertainty over the outlook is likely to continue until there is a clearer picture of the strength of the economy now and that data will not be out until March and April.
Ken McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, a market research firm, said, "The remarkable rebound in housing starts for January appears to be a bit of a fluke, but the general strength in housing does suggest that consumer spending will increase more solidly in the first half of 1996 than it did in the fourth quarter."
Housing starts tend to generate growth in consumer spending in the future as the houses started by developers are eventually sold and consumers than fill them with new goods. Thus appliance sales, furniture sales tend to follow housing activity and that is what appeared to bother the market.
Traders also said that bond prices sank after reports of selling activity yesterday by some large funds. Fidelity and and Morgan Stanley, traders said, were the names most often mentioned. The long bond also appeared especially sensitive to any bad news as traders and investors awaited next week's inflation reports. The producer and consumer price indexes will be released on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.
Fidelity said it generally does not comment on short-term trading. But Morgan Stanley's government trading desk in an advisory sent to its clients indicated it was time to sell. "We believe that investors should challenge the positive assumptions embedded in the U.S. fixed-income markets, the advisory said, "and now feel there is significant upside risk to U.S. economic growth and inflation over the next few months."
"The real issue today, which may need further explanation, is the talk of adjustments in the asset allocations of some large firms," said Thomas E. Donne, vice president and a senior portfolio manager at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio. "The stock market has accelerated quickly, and putting some people to wonder whether the bull market in equities is coming to a head and should they take profits and shift elsewhere. There has been a tremendous flow of cash into stocks."
Mr. Donne says there are a lot of asset allocators trying to decide which market they want to be with, and a lot of money that still has not been committed is at stake.
Whether next week will be as volatile as this week is hard to tell, but if the inflation reports are very positive the market could rally.
Last Tuesday morning investors seemed to be worried that the Federal Reserve would not cut short-term rates again soon. This helped send prices down and yields higher even before the afternoon testimony on the state of the economy by the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan. And when he did speak, investors and analysts became more alarmed -- and sold more -- as they interpreted his remarks to mean no rate cut soon.
But on Wednesday the market took the opposite view, as it collectively decided that the Fed chairman, in his second day of testimony in Washington, was signaling that the central bank would move again as long as inflation remained in check.
Yesterday that view switched one more time.
The report that the economy grew only nine-tenths of a percent in the fourth quarter last year helped lift the bond market before the housing report.
"Even though G.D.P. was good from the bond market's perspective," Mr. Donne said, "lower inflation and slow growth is still a look back at numbers that have already largely been discounted into the market."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Germans Are Gripped by the Return of Fugitives

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Feb. 23

 BODY:
Germany's most famous fugitive came home today from a Miami jail, looking more like a scared tourist than the wheeler-dealer who fled the country 22 months ago, leaving behind the ruins of a real estate empire and $3.5 billion in bad debt.
Jurgen Schneider and his wife, Claudia, walked off a Lufthansa Boeing 747 at 8:35 A.M., accompanied by German border police, after flying from Miami to Chicago and then to this city, Germany's financial capital. The German Government picked up the $5,842 tab for their two first-class tickets. 
 After waiting for hours in below-freezing temperatures, scores of camera crews taped Mr. Schneider's 15-second descent of the airplane steps. Paunchy, balding and wearing a light blue shirt, khaki pants and navy-blue jacket, he ducked into a green police van without saying a word to the waiting press.
Looking pale and drawn, the 61-year-old Mr. Schneider turned around and glanced at his wife in the van behind him. Husband and wife were then driven off to appear before a federal judge and were remanded to prison to await a formal indictment and trial on charges of falsifying documents, embezzling funds and causing the collapse of his real estate empire.
For a nation that had been transfixed by the couple's flight from German justice 22 months ago and their capture last May in Miami, and that had indulged in endless theorizing about their connections to people in high places, the Schneiders' arrival at the Frankfurt/Main International Airport amounted to a disappointing anticlimax.
The German press had thrown enormous resources into covering the return of the once thin and debonair entrepreneur who, only two years earlier, had made the rounds of Frankfurt high society in a tuxedo and toupee, hobnobbing with the rich and powerful.
RTL, Germany's largest private television station, paid a Lufthansa pilot to tip it off to the flight that the Schneiders would take, then bought all remaining tickets to prevent its archrival, SAT.1, from sending its reporters on the plane. Unfortunately for RTL, it bought tickets for the wrong flight, then had to scramble to get its journalists on the right one.
The mass-circulation newspapers made the Schneiders' flight to Germany the big story of the day. "Hello, Mr. Schneider, Your New Home," declared the banner headline of Bild Zeitung, showing a picture of a jail cell.
The reason for all the interest goes beyond just the sheer magnitude of the scandal, although that alone was worth plenty of attention. After all, the $3.5 billion in unpaid debt that Mr. Schneider left was more than triple the losses of about $1 billion incurred by the British trader Nicholas Leeson in the celebrated case of Barings P.L.C. early last year. And while Mr. Leeson's activities drove under a venerable British merchant bank, the demise of Mr. Schneider's real estate empire ruined hundreds of ordinary German contractors and other small-business people.
On a deeper level though, some analysts said, the German obsession with the Schneiders' disappearance and capture reflects a distrust of the high and mighty and a delight at seeing them get their comeuppance. In the land that coined the term Schadenfreude, or taking pleasure in someone else's troubles, the sight of Mr. Schneider returning in captivity gives some cause to celebrate.
"There is always a fascination with people who seem to have everything going for them, and then all goes wrong," said Richard Reid, chief economist at the Union Bank of Switzerland's Frankfurt office. "This is a society that tends to lean toward the cult of personality. Schneider was once someone who could do no wrong. Now he is fallen from grace."
This Schadenfreude takes on a special edge these days, when the German economy is under severe strains. Unemployment is at record postwar levels, with big corporate layoffs announced almost weekly. Germans struggle under high taxes, the economy has come almost to a standstill and most fear that beloved Government programs will eventually be slashed.
At the same time, the Schneider case is certain to focus attention on one of the institutions that Germans love to hate, Deutsche Bank A.G., Germany's largest bank and the symbol of the German corporate establishment.
Deutsche Bank was Mr. Schneider's largest creditor, and in the wake of the 1994 collapse, many accused it not only of encouraging high-flying real estate speculation, but also of paying insufficient attention to such a huge real estate operation.
Though the Schneider trial is not likely to start until 1997, it is certain to be one of the most celebrated in recent years, particularly because of the insights it should provide on how Deutsche Bank did business right after German reunification. In those heady days, the Government and investors poured billions of dollars into the former East Germany to rebuild it.
A number of scandals over fraud, mismanagement and misappropriation of funds have emerged, but the Schneider case is by far the biggest.
Mr. Schneider's lawyer, Christoph Ruckel, said his client would probably mount what could be called a David versus Goliath defense, placing most of the blame with the management of Deutsche Bank.
Such an approach is likely to resonate with the man in the street. While most Germans interviewed believed Mr. Schneider was guilty, they also felt the bank bore a lot of blame.
"Schneider could not have done all this by himself," said Gregor Schultz, a civil servant in Frankfurt. "I mean the negligence of the banks is fairly obvious."
Added Gundula Zischner, a bookkeeper in Wiesbaden: "I think the banks have their share of the guilt in what happened with Schneider. But he is certainly a crook."

HEADLINE: Service for 8 In Job Corps Fills Some With Anger

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: HARPERS FERRY, W.Va., Feb. 23

 BODY:
Families of four of the eight Job Corps trainees killed last week in a Maryland train crash joined the victims' classmates here today for a memorial service that paid as much tribute to the Job Corps program as to the dead.
After the hourlong service, at the Harpers Ferry Job Corps center, where the victims had been in training, some trainees said the emphasis had been all wrong. And Charon Rothmiller, a cousin of one of those killed, felt so strongly about it that she spontaneously asked during the middle of the service whether she could speak. 
 "They wanted to sugar-coat it," Ms. Rothmiller told reporters later. She said she wished the service had focused more on who the victims were than on the Job Corps itself.
"They wanted to sugar-coat it," she repeated, "and I couldn't let them do that."
The eight trainees remembered today were among 16 who were on a commuter train that plowed into Amtrak's Capitol Limited outside Washington last Friday night. Officials say seven of them died in a fire caused by the crash, the other on impact. Three crewmen on the commuter train were also killed.
Eager to honor those eight trainees, officials from the Labor Department, which oversees the Job Corps, asked administrators at the Harpers Ferry center to arrange a service for today. At least one center official, Jennifer Mobley, the youth programs coordinator, objected, insisting that the victims' families had not had sufficient time to arrange for funerals. In fact, only one funeral had been held by today, and families of four of the dead were not represented at the service.
More than 300 people attended the service, held in the gymnasium. They included most of the center's trainees, who are learning to become carpenters, bricklayers, nurses' aides and clerical workers, and also scores of local, state and Federal officials with some connection to the Harpers Ferry center, other Job Corps sites or the national program.
But for a good deal of the service, speakers focused as much on the character- and skills-building benefits of the program as on those killed, leaving some listeners to conclude that eight deaths were being used as a political tool even though the $1-billion-a-year Job Corps has been spared the budget ax in Congress.
"I don't give a damn about government organizations," said one trainee, Cliff Wilfong of Clarksburg, Va. "The focus should have been the students."
Mary Silva, the acting national director of the Job Corps, who attended the service, was asked later about that and similar criticism. "I didn't hear any of that personally," she replied. "The families I spoke to were filled with comfort. They said they felt it was wonderful."
The eight trainees who lost their lives were Carlos Byrd, 18, of Baltimore; Diana Hanvichid, 17, of Woodbridge, Va.; Claudius Keesoon, 20, of Landover, Md.; Thomas Loatman, 23, of Vienna, Va.; Lakeisha Marshall, 17, of Capital Heights, Md.; Ka'ris Rudder, 17, of East Elmhurst, Queens; Dante Swain, 18, of Baltimore, and Michael Woodson, 17, of Philadelphia.
All were cited by name at the start of the service, when one candle was lighted for each. And Ms. Silva mentioned them in reading letters from President Clinton and Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich.
But Senator Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland was the only speaker who described any of them, noting Ms. Marshall's smile, for instance, and Mr. Keesoon's dream of serving in the military.
In an emotional address that included a strong pitch for continued financing of the Job Corps, however, Senator Mikulski mentioned only seven of the eight trainees, omitting one from her own state, Mr. Byrd, who had been studying health occupation trades.
Ms. Mikulski won a standing ovation when she praised the national program's job placement rate for exceeding Harvard's. But the Senator's personal tributes left Ms. Rothmiller -- a cousin of Mr. Woodson, the Philadelphian who was killed -- unsatisfied.
Ms. Rothmiller, herself a 26-year-old graduate of a Jobs Corp center in Philadelphia, asked to speak after Ms. Mikulski and, given permission, took the next few minutes putting events of recent days in painful human terms.
She described fitful nights of sleep, and nightmares of fire and burning bodies. Some of the victims were burned so badly in the fire that followed the collision that their bodies could be identified only through genetic testing or dental records. Ms. Rothmiller said Mr. Woodson's mother, Veronica Woodson, was still too anguished to attend the service, doubly grieved by "knowing her son is never going to come home and that the casket has to be closed."
Speaking to reporters later, Ms. Rothmiller told of how disappointed she had been with what she had heard.
"I got a little upset," she said. "There was not enough said about the families. They all said they were giving us their deepest sympathies. But that's not enough, and nobody added anything. I had to do something."

HEADLINE: The Overselling of Carlos Salinas

 BODY:
It was 1988 and everyone believed that it was morning again in Mexico. Carlos Salinas, a young, articulate, American-trained economist, had just been elected President of Mexico. He promised a brave new era of privatization, free trade and cordial relations with Washington. The old days of debt crises, money-losing state enterprises and anti-yanqui nationalism would be banished. Surrounded by like-minded technocrats with Ivy League connections, President Salinas would yank Mexico out of Latin America and drag it into the first world.
Washington believed. Wall Street believed. Media cheerleaders believed. Eventually, most of Mexico believed. But things did not work out quite the way all those believers thought they would. 
 
Mr. Salinas did align Mexico's economy far more closely with that of the United States, capping that achievement with the North American Free Trade Agreement. He sold off hundreds of publicly owned companies, including the phone company, the national airline and leading banks, using some of the proceeds to reduce foreign debt.
By stemming the red ink from these companies, while using pro-government unions to keep wage settlements low and short-term foreign borrowing to keep the peso high, Mr. Salinas dramatically reduced inflation. For most of his term, international confidence in the Mexican economy soared and living standards, at least for the upper and middle classes, rose.
But almost as soon as he left office, much of his economic achievement unraveled. Reckless short-term borrowing had set up the peso for a precipitous fall. Foreign lenders took fright. Growth ground into reverse and living standards sharply declined. It has taken Mr. Salinas' less flashy successor, Ernesto Zedillo, more than a year to halt the slide.
Mr. Zedillo is also an American-trained technocrat, and he has been carrying out an even more far-reaching agenda of reforms than his predecessor. But no one in Washington, Wall Street or Mexico City is now in any mood to tout new Mexican miracles.
Carlos Salinas was a genuine economic reformer. But he was also a privileged product and protector of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. He never challenged the PRI's taste for electoral fraud. In fact, PRI shenanigans may have given him his narrow victory margin in that 1988 presidential race. Mr. Salinas declared that his principal mission was to fix the economy and that cleaning up the political system could and should be put off to another day.
The United States business community, delighted with his economic policies, happily bought his line. The Bush and Clinton Administrations, eager to lock in Mexican economic reforms by getting Congress to ratify Nafta, ignored or downplayed issues like electoral fraud, corruption and police tolerance of narcotics trafficking. Nafta gives American companies fairer access to Mexican markets and will continue to encourage the modernization of Mexico's economy. But Washington foolishly promoted it as a fast-acting cure-all that would instantly add jobs, lower trade deficits and prevent cross-border migration. Worse, Nafta became an excuse for overlooking America's equally strong interest in Mexican democracy.
Ignoring Mexico's political problems became harder after an armed peasant rebellion broke out in Chiapas in early 1994 and even more difficult after two of the country's leading political figures were assassinated later that year in cases that are still under judicial investigation. With Salinas business associates no longer protected by a friendly Government, Mexicans are learning that many were corrupt, pocketing fabulous sums from privatization and favoritism. Even worse, the former President's brother, Raul Salinas, has now been imprisoned on charges of commissioning political murder.
Mexico has learned some hard lessons from the Salinas episode; Washington must learn the same lessons. Supporting economic reforms in countries like Mexico obviously makes sense. But to do so uncritically, without paying attention to political reform, does not serve our interests or theirs.

Duckman Going on Leave
 
Lorin Duckman, the Brooklyn Criminal Court Judge who has been under harsh attack recently for his handling of two domestic violence cases, will take an unspecified amount of time off from his duties on the bench, a spokeswoman for the state court system said. For nearly two weeks Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Gov. George E. Pataki and other officials have called for the removal of Judge Duckman because of his decision to release from custody a convicted rapist who went on to kill his former girlfriend at a Queens car dealership. [Page 23.]
 
Dragnet Smashes a Gang
 
Taking aim at the network of alien smugglers who have brought hundreds of illegal Chinese immigrants to New York in recent years -- and who often use kidnapping, torture and extortion to bolster profits -- Federal prosecutors said that they had smashed a violent organized-crime gang that had terrorized Chinatown for years. In a series of arrests, the authorities said they had captured 35 reputed members of the gang, known as the Fukienese Flying Dragons, including its top commanders in America. [23.]
 
Here Today . . .
 
Douglas A. Criscitello is the first director of the week-old Independent Budget Office. He is also its entire staff. The brand new agency, approved by voters in 1989 as part of the City Charter, is intended to serve as an objective, nonpartisan monitor of the city's dauntingly complex budgets. But not so fast. Many city officials would see it vanish. [25.]
 
Hypnosis for Taming the Pain
 
Hypnosis is quietly enjoying a period of prolific use. Psychotherapists use it to try to snuff out phobias and addictions, while dentists employ it to tame the terror of drilling and filling. And Hospitals from Mount Sinai to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center are finding hypnosis valuable for beating pain. [23.]
 
You are getting sleepy . . . [26.]
 
Trading Handcuffs for Briefs
 
After 20 years, a police officer turned Legal Aid lawyer. "Cops and defense lawyers know the system is mighty flawed," he says, by way of reconciling his two careers. About New York by David Gonzalez. [23.]
 
6 Indicted in Drug Case
 
It was one of those modest but bustling family businesses, investigators said, in which the owner's mother minded the shop and a brother-in-law, a New York City police officer, made deliveries on his days off. Their merchandise, the authorities said, was Colombian cocaine. [24.]
 
Police Officer Is Dismissed
 
The New York City police officer whose drunken exhibitionism in Washington became a national symbol of misconduct within the Police Department has been dismissed from the force, police officials said yesterday. [25.]
 
REGION
 
Second-Guessing a Tax Cut
 
With New York in the throes of a fiscal crisis, the politically unthinkable is happening: Union leaders, municipal officials and Democratic legislators are openly advocating delaying or scaling back an income-tax cut scheduled to take effect in just five weeks. [1.]
 
Privacy Versus Public Safety
 
When Joseph Rossillo pleaded guilty to the statutory rape of a 16-year-old relative, he became the first newly convicted person in New York to register under a new law that allows communities to track the whereabouts of convicted sex offenders. The law has prompted a debate over privacy and public safety. Some critics contend that the law is too broad, effectively painting all sex offenders with the same brush. [1.]
 
New Jersey Still Losing Jobs
 
New Jersey lost more than 28,000 jobs last month as the state's unemployment rate remained above the national average, suggesting continued sluggishness in the local economy, according to data released by state and Federal officials. [27.]
 
Double Deckers on the Way
 
Riders of the Long Island Rail Road had mixed reactions to a proposal to close 13 of the railroad's least used stations to cut costs and to prepare for the arrival of 114 double-decker diesel cars next year. [27.]
 
Woman Charged in Fatal Arson
 
A 36-year-old Yonkers woman who neighbors said had been evicted last month has been charged in an arson fire that killed two toddlers at her former apartment building. The woman, Vilma Valcarcel, was charged with criminal solicitation. An official said investigators believed she asked a teen-age boy to start the blaze. [27.]
 
Bye-Bye Love
 
"I feel like the frog that was kissed by the princess," Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato said at the news conference last year in which he also said he expected to marry his princess, Claudia Cohen, the millionaire gossip reporter. But now the two have gone their separate ways. [24.]

HEADLINE: Economy Slowed in Late 1995 As Growth Rate Dipped to 0.9%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 23

 BODY:
The economy grew at a meager annual pace of nine-tenths of 1 percent in the final three months of 1995 as consumers kept a tight grip on their wallets, Government spending fell and investment by business slackened, the Commerce Department reported today.
For all of 1995, the output of goods and services advanced 2.1 percent over the previous year, the smallest gain since 1991, when the gross domestic product fell 1 percent. 
 Going into this election year, the Clinton Administration conceded that economic weakness might continue through the early months of 1996. But White House officials contend that springtime should bring a reawakening of growth.
Joseph E. Stiglitz, the President's chief economic adviser, noted "several kernels of good news for 1996" in the unexpectedly dismal numbers. He pointed to evidence that business efforts to reduce the stock of unsold goods, which depressed growth during much of 1995, appear to be near an end.
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, told Congress this week -- before the Government's figures were compiled -- that the economy was going through a "significant soft patch." He said the risk of continuing subpar performance prompted the Federal Reserve's last round of rate cuts on Jan. 31 and he said that further doses of monetary stimulus might be required if conditions continued to deteriorate.
But Mr. Greenspan predicted that the stumbling economy, nearing its fifth anniversary of expansion, was more likely to rebound than to slide into recession. The next meeting of the central bank's policy-making Open Market Committee is scheduled for March 26.
In a separate report today, the department said that builders broke ground on new homes at a surprisingly solid pace in January, largely offsetting a previously unreported skid in December.
Investors seemed torn in interpreting the contrasting sets of figures, with bond prices, after a brief rally, sagging throughout the day. Stock prices, as measured by the Dow Jones industrial average, gyrated nearly 100 points before closing with a moderate gain. [Page 37.]
The partial shutdown of the Government late last year also acted as a drag on the economy, which was just 1.4 percent higher in the October-December period than in the corresponding 1994 period.
Interpretation of both reports was made more difficult by furloughs of Government statisticians and other workers and by the January blizzard that made the housing figures particularly suspect.
"This report is somewhat incomprehensible," Joel L. Naroff, a senior economist in Philadelphia for the First Union Corporation, said of the housing report. "The blizzard of the century apparently did not deter builders in the Northeast," where houses were started at a pace 5.6 percent faster, seasonally adjusted, than in December. Activity in the Northeast, however, remains far below that of any of the other three regions.
For the country as a whole, housing starts ran at a pace of 1,446,000 in January, 4.4 percent above the December pace. But starts in December, at a 1,385,000 pace, were 5 percent below November.
Analysts also noted that the January rebound was dominated by apartments and other multifamily buildings, a category that moves erratically.
The initial estimate for fourth-quarter gross domestic product -- the value of the total output of goods and services within American borders -- showed that expansion slowed to a pace one-quarter as rapid as the 3.6 percent recorded during the July-September period. The 3.6 percent figure was a revision from an earlier estimate of 3.2 percent. As for the sluggish fourth-quarter pace, it was about half as much as had generally been expected.
While analysts paid the figures somewhat less attention than usual since they were delayed a month by the partial Government closing, a common observation was how decisively consumers, who account for two-thirds of G.D.P., had pulled back.
Personal spending climbed at a pace of just eight-tenths of 1 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with 2.8 percent during the summer.
Everett M. Ehrlich, Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs, said it was still too early to predict whether the current quarter, which runs through the end of March, was likely to show any significant strengthening.
But Mr. Stiglitz, the White House economist, saw at least a few favorable portents in the figures. "The slowing of the rate of inventory investment suggests that most of the long-awaited inventory correction is behind us," he said in a statement. The pause in consumer spending, along with marked growth in incomes, he added, has raised the savings rate and this, combined with soaring stock prices, "should allow consumers to resume their spending."
Besides pinch-penny spending by consumers and scaled-back building of inventories, the fourth-quarter G.D.P. was characterized mainly by buoyant exports, a second consecutive quarterly gain in the building of single-family homes, an advance in fixed investment and a sharp decline in Government spending.
The department estimated that the furloughs of Government workers subtracted about one-quarter of a point from G.D.P. and added that amount to the price index for gross domestic purchases, reflecting the fact that Government workers were paid for not working. The price index rose at a 2 percent rate compared with 1.7 percent in the third quarter.
Some analysts contend that international trade, which was a major factor in sustaining growth during the fourth quarter, may fade as a contributor to economic output. "I'm negative on the export sector," said Fariborz Ghadar, director of the Center for Global Business Studies at Pennsylvania State University.
Expressed in current dollars, G.D.P. rose at a 2.7 percent rate in the fourth quarter, according to today's report, down from 5.8 percent in the third quarter.
The housing report showed that starts last year totaled 1,350,500, or 7.3 percent below the 1994 level. This was the first annual decline since 1991.
For January, permits issued for new homes moved opposite to starts, declining 7.1 percent from the December pace.
Data included in the gross domestic product for the fourth quarter of 1995 follow, with all dollar amounts in billions at seasonally adjusted annual rates. Data are computed using the new "chain weighted" system, which tries to accurately reflect real changes in the economy by accounting for inflation in a continuous manner. Percentage changes are from the previous quarter at seasonally adjusted annual rates.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Still Exceeds U.S. Average

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 23

 BODY:
New Jersey lost thousands of jobs last month as the state's unemployment rate remained above the national average, suggesting continued sluggishness in the local economy, according to data released by state and Federal officials today.
Using a new method to estimate unemployment figures, officials calculated New Jersey's jobless rate at 6.5 percent in January. They revised the December rate to 6.6 percent, from 7.3 percent, easing concern among some economists that an apparent spike in December unemployment figures had signaled the beginning of a sudden downturn in the state economy. 
 Economists and analysts said that the latest employment data showed that New Jersey could expect slower job growth this year as corporate layoffs continue. For example, the impact of the decision by AT&T, the state's largest employer, to eliminate 7,000 jobs this year has yet to ripple through the state's economy.
The national unemployment rate was up to 5.8 percent in January, from 5.6 percent the month before, officials said today. New York State and Connecticut are scheduled to release their figures for January next week. December's unemployment rate was 6.4 percent in New York and 5.1 percent in Connecticut.
The Federal Government acknowledged that its previous monthly reporting methods, based on a sampling of 2,300 households in New Jersey, sometimes produced distortions in the data. Even so, the apparent sharp rise in New Jersey's unemployment rate from November to December worried regional economists and the administration of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, because overall job growth had begun to slow in the final months of last year.
State officials said today that January's data, which showed a loss of 28,200 jobs, were skewed by severe snowstorms, which forced many businesses to close or call in fewer workers.
"That is a very large number, but the events in January were so extreme, we really have to wait for another month to see if we are witnessing a deterioration or what I expect will be a bounce back," said Joseph Seneca, chairman of the New Jersey Council of Economic Advisors, and a professor of economics at Rutgers University.
Officials used the new methodology to calculate unemployment rates for all of 1995, which produced monthly projections that were slightly different from those under the old formula. But after further adjustments, the state's average unemployment rate under either method would be 6.4 percent last year, said John L. Wieting, regional commissioner for the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics.
As a result of Federal budget cutbacks, the Bureau of Labor Statistics no longer issues monthly unemployment data based on monthly surveys for the 11 large industrial states, including New York and New Jersey. While the surveys sometimes produced fluctuations in unemployment figures for those states, they allowed the Federal Government to promptly report employment data, which economists used to project economic trends, Mr. Wieting said. Now, the Federal Government will use a statistical model for the 11 industrial states similar to models being used in all other states.
In New Jersey, the model is based on payroll data from 12,000 employers and unemployment claims, along with a smaller monthly survey of households. "The result of this modeling approach is less volatility in the estimation of monthly labor force unemployment levels for the state," said Mr. Wieting, who traveled to Trenton today to join New Jersey labor officials in releasing the new unemployment figures.
Governor Whitman said that she had requested Mr. Wieting's attendance at today's news conference so that New Jerseyans would understand that the Federal Government was using a new formula to determine unemployment rates.
"I didn't want it to look like we were trying to play with the numbers now that there is this new system," Mrs. Whitman said.
But Democrats suggested that the Whitman administration was seeking more optimistic forecasts. Bernard F. Kenny Jr., the assistant Senate minority leader and a Democrat from Hudson County, said: "The Whitman administration's 'new math' doesn't mask the fact that nearly 300,000 New Jerseyans are out of work, the state leads the nation in announced layoffs and our unemployment rate is significantly higher than the U.S. rate."

HEADLINE: ALBANY'S TAX CUT FACING CHALLENGE

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 23

 BODY:
With the state facing its potentially worst fiscal crisis in years, a growing number of labor leaders, municipal officials and Democratic legislators are openly advocating what was once considered politically unthinkable: delaying or scaling back an income-tax cut scheduled to take effect in just five weeks.
What has made the groundswell of support for modifying the tax cut particularly surprising is that it involves not just New York City legislators but also more conservative lawmakers from central and western New York. Democrats from those regions are considered the most vulnerable to Republican challenges this year, and therefore least likely to support rolling back the tax cut, which would typically reduce a family's taxes by $19 a month but would cost the state $1.7 billion. 
 Gov. George E. Pataki, who pushed the tax-cut plan through the Legislature last year after making it a centerpiece of his campaign, has repeatedly said that he would oppose any efforts to scale it back. So have Speaker Sheldon Silver of the Assembly, a Democrat of Manhattan; and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican of Rensselaer County.
"We made a commitment to voters, and we have to keep that commitment," Mr. Silver said recently, echoing a phrase used by the others.
But critics of the tax cut are preparing a major lobbying campaign to pressure the leaders to reconsider the tax cut in future budget negotiations. The fight is likely to mirror similar debates between 1990 and 1994, when the Legislature postponed income-tax cuts five times because of state fiscal problems.
The second phase of a three-year tax-cut plan enacted last year is to take effect on April 1. Under that plan, new withholding tables will be mailed to employers in early March showing that a family of four making $50,000 a year will get back $226, or $19 a month, from the 1996 phase of the tax cut.
Until now, almost no one, including even liberal Democrats, has been willing to openly discuss freezing or scaling back the tax cut, in large part because this is an election year when Republicans are planning to attack Democrats across the state for tax-and-spend policies.
But the state is facing a $4 billion shortfall for the fiscal year that begins April 1, and that gap will grow as much as $2.5 billion more if the Federal Government does not enact major changes to welfare and Medicaid programs -- actions that have grown increasingly likely.
Mr. Pataki has proposed closing the $4 billion shortfall with a broad array of reductions to health care, welfare and educational services. And he has said that he will have to deepen those cuts significantly if he does not get the policy changes he needs from Washington.
Consequently, an increasing number of lawmakers are asking: Do New Yorkers really want a tax cut typically worth $19 a month if it means large reductions in government services in exchange? The alternative, postponing the second phase of the tax cut, would provide the state $1.7 billion in additional revenue, enough to close almost half the anticipated shortfall and, in the view of some, tone down the annual budget fight between the Governor and the Legislature.
"This is controversial, but if we did it we could close the budget down in a matter of days," said Assemblyman Scott M. Stringer, a Democrat of Manhattan who has introduced legislation to reduce the size of the tax cut. "Once you did this, there would be nothing left to fight over."
Republican legislators are more circumspect about the tax cut, saying they believe the state can overcome its fiscal problems by cutting health and welfare programs more. Still, some of them say they would welcome a debate over the tax cut, provided the Governor or the Democrats raise it first.
"If things get worse and Washington backs out on their pledges to change Medicaid and it throws us into another $2.5 to $3 billion hole, then you have to look at everything," said Senator Robert J. DiCarlo, a Republican of Brooklyn.
Mr. Stringer and his allies contend that the state, by reducing services and cutting aid to local governments, has already forced local school districts and municipalities to increase property taxes. Additional state tax cuts will cause those local taxes to rise even more, they say.
"The reality is that people have not seen a reduction of taxes," said Edward C. Farrell, executive director of the New York State Conference of Mayors. "They've seen an increase in property taxes. We think it makes a lot of sense to discuss delaying or rolling back the income tax cut."
But proponents of lower taxes say they are confident that only a tiny handful of legislators will be willing to oppose a tax cut in an election year, particularly when Mr. Pataki is expected to veto any changes to the tax-cut plan. Still, they also say that if the Federal budget impasse continues through the elections, the political tide could shift quickly.
In an indication of the growing legislative concern about the tax cut, even Democrats who represent districts where Mr. Pataki won in 1994 have begun questioning the tax cut. Assemblyman Richard J. Keane, a Democrat from the Buffalo area, for example, said he believed that his constituents would rather forego the additional tax cut than see their property taxes increase or tuition at state colleges rise.
"People want to believe we've got a gold mine in the backyard and can give them increased spending and tax cuts, too," he said. "But once it hits home what it will cost them in terms of reduced services or higher property taxes, then their song changes."
The Governor has said that the tax cut will spur economic growth and job creation by putting more spending money in people's pockets. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has agreed with that argument.
Mr. Pataki also contends that the plan reduces taxes more for low- and moderate-income people than for the wealthy. By 1997, 452,000 lower-income New Yorkers would no longer pay state income taxes under the plan, state tax officials say.
But several major labor unions are taking issue with his arguments in a statewide lobbying campaign. They include the Civil Service Employees Association, the Public Employees Federation and the New York State United Teachers, which together represent over half a million government workers who, their officials fear, could lose their jobs.
In newsletters, letters to legislators and television and newspaper advertisements, the unions have attacked Mr. Pataki's budget as cutting services for the middle class while cutting taxes for the wealthy. They have also circulated studies showing that 40 percent of the 1996 tax cut will go to the wealthiest 5 percent of the population.
"You don't go buy a new Mercedes when you can't balance the books, and that's what they are doing here," said Danny Donohue, president of the Civil Service union. "To talk about a tax cut when you're talking about a deficit budget is ridiculous."

HEADLINE: U.S. Chicken in Every Pot? In Russia, Apparently Not

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 23

 BODY:
A nasty little skirmish between Russia and the United States is brewing here over a threatened trade barrier.
But this fight is not about manufactured consumer goods or high technology, but about American chicken, which has flooded the Russian market. 
 To the frustration, and considerable anxiety, of American companies, the Russian Government has threatened to ban further American poultry sales effective March 19.
The threatened move, which American poultry producers protest amounts to protectionism, comes at the same time Russia has agreed with the International Monetary Fund on a $10.2 billion loan to further the country's efforts to develop a free-market economy. The loan was made with the strong support of the White House.
Today, the White House voiced its opposition to the Russian ban. "We take this issue very seriously," said David P. Johnson, a White House spokesman, adding that the Administration was raising the issue with senior Russian officials.
In an odd twist of international trade and domestic politics, among the biggest losers in an import ban would be Tyson Foods of Springdale, Ark., which has been a longtime supporter of President Clinton.
American producers exported more than $500 million in frozen poultry to Russia last year, and Tyson accounted for roughly a third of that.
But a spokesman for Tyson, which has annual sales of $5.5 billion, said today that its sales in Russia were "relatively insignificant."
The ostensible reason for the Russian Government's warning is health -- a seemingly strange concern in a country with a generally lax record in observing safety standards, where virtually every able-bodied man and woman smokes.
Today, no less an authority than the Veterinary Department of the Russian Agriculture and Food Ministry said the ban was needed to protect consumers here against infected poultry until the United States improved its standards.
But the real agenda, American producers contend, is old-fashioned protectionism.
Agitated Russian producers, whose birds, Russian consumers say, have no match for their American competition in terms of quality and price, have repeatedly complained that the United States is trying to destroy the Russian poultry industry and capture the market. And now American companies fear the Russian producers are striking back.
"We are treating it as a trade issue, rather than as an inspection or food safety issue," said Toby Moore, a spokesman for the United States Poultry and Egg Export Council, an industry trade association in Atlanta. "We firmly believe that there is a political motivation behind it. It's getting kind of weird."
American chicken was not always considered a threat to the Russian motherland.
The first big invasion of frozen poultry came during the Bush Administration, when Washington provided loan guarantees to American exporters to stimulate the sale of dark meat to Russia.
The export proved to be very popular with Russian consumers, who dubbed them Bush legs.
After the demise of the Soviet Union, American poultry exports continued to soar. Russian poultry production, meanwhile, fell 40 percent, the result of rising grain prices and declining subsidies.
Astoundingly, a third of all American exports to Russia is poultry, American officials say.
But while Russian consumers have been generally very pleased with the quality of the American poultry, there have been problems.
Conagra Inc., the world's fourth-largest food processing company, sold some spoiled chicken to Russia last year, American officials said. The poultry had thawed and then been refrozen. Conagra officials could not be reached for comment.
That dispute was worked out, but the episode appeared to have given protectionist-minded Russian producers here the opening they were looking for.
Russia demanded, and received, the right to conduct inspections of American poultry processing plants. And Russians specialists later complained that health and safety standards in the United States were wanting, citing the problem of bacteria and chemical residues in the meat.
Vyacheslav Avilov, the chief Russian veterinary inspector, believes that "U.S. experts do not make necessary analyses that would guarantee the product's quality, which is why Russian consumers take risks when buying the poultry," the Russian news agency Interfax reported today.
To the further consternation of the Americans, the Russians have also decided to effectively double the tariff on imported poultry.
Some American poultry executives say that the dispute, in part, represents a misunderstanding of how the capitalist world raises and processes meat.
They say the Russians are accustomed to a rigid system of government oversight, however laxly it might be enforced, and simply do not understand how American companies can take steps to police themselves.
"We are optimistic that any differences can be resolved so there will be no disruption in product flow," the National Broiler Council, a Washington-based trade group, said in a statement.
But American officials, invoking cold war images of stonewalling Soviet diplomats, are less encouraging and complain that Russian officials have not been forthcoming in recent talks held in Washington and Moscow.
"Every time we try to address some of their concerns, they pull up another list," said an American official, who asked not to be named.
The Clinton Administration has been hoping that the Russians would suspend their threat to ban the poultry while negotiations continued. But so far, the Russians are holding firm.
"There are some hints of flexibility, but we are not yet at resolution," added another American official close to the talks.
If the confrontation continues, the United States has a number of possible recourses, including arguing that the Russian action is inconsistent with Moscow's bid to join the World Trade Organization.
Some experts, however, believe there is an important countervailing force here that may lead to a softening of the Russian position: namely Russian customers.
Russian consumers favor the American birds, which despite the dire warnings of the Russian Government, have come to symbolize quality. And they vote, too.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: TRADE;
President Shows Political Muscle on Visit to California

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: SANTA MONICA, Calif. Feb. 23

 BODY:
 In a state crucial to his re-election prospects, President Clinton today displayed the political power of incumbency.
As aerospace workers in Long Beach whooped and cheered and waved minature American flags, he announced that he was seeking Congressional approval to buy 80 more C-17 cargo planes, a move the Administration said would create 4,700 jobs there. 
 Proclaiming that "we have to break down walls, not build them up," Mr. Clinton also used his appearance at the McDonnell Douglas plant there to underscore the benefits of free trade and set himself apart from the views of Patrick J. Buchanan, the Republican Presidential candidate, who has appealed to workers with a message of protectionism and economic nationalism.
Mr. Clinton, who did not mention Mr. Buchanan by name, made his remarks hours before he met here with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan, the former Trade Minister, to prepare for the President's state visit to Tokyo in April.
During the hourlong get-acquainted session between the two leaders at a Santa Monica hotel, Mr. Clinton identified areas in which the United States wants to see more progress in opening Japanese markets: semiconductors, insurance, photographic film and civil aviation.
But throughout the day, Mr. Clinton also cited the 20 trade agreements his Administration has reached with Japan as signs of an improving trade relationship.
"In California, more than a quarter of a million jobs depend on trade with Japan," he said earlier in Long Beach, speaking to thousands of aerospace workers. "For the first time in history, rice farmers in California can sell rice in Japan.
"If you want your country to lead for peace and freedom and prosperity, the answer is neither to be uncritically in favor of free trade, nor to be pulling up the rug and closing our borders. The answer is to be for trade that is free and fair so everybody has a fair chance to grow in the global economy."
With his stop at the plant that manufactures the C-17, Mr. Clinton began a marathon two-day swing through California and Washington State. It was his 22d visit as President to California, the state with 54 electoral votes, which Mr. Clinton has ministered to through earthquakes and floods, recession and the disruption caused by military base closings. The trip, six weeks before the primaries in California and Washington, was paid for by the Clinton-Gore re-election campaign.
Mr. Clinton himself fought to save the C-17 cargo plane from Congressional critics who had complained of cost overruns and production line delays. The Air Force now has two dozen C-17's in its cargo fleet and Mr. Clinton used one in January for his trip to Bosnia.
Mr. Hashimoto's visit came as America's relations with Japan emerged as an issue in the Republican Presidential race. In a debate on Thursday night, Mr. Buchanan said that Japan was worried that he might become President. If elected, he said, he would tell the Japanese Prime Minister that unless the two countries worked out the balance of trade he would "unilaterally" end Japan's trade surplus. Another Republican Presidential candidate, Former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, has also vowed to be tough on trade with Tokyo.
As he began his session with Mr. Hashimoto tonight, Mr. Clinton pointed to the declining trade deficit with Japan as evidence that the trade pacts and policies he has pursued are working. At the same time, the President acknowledged ongoing problems in opening up Japan's markets to American products. "We are moving in the right direction," Mr. Clinton said. "Other countries should do as well."
In their brief meeting, described by United States officials as warm, the two leaders also discussed security concerns, which became a major issue between the two nations after a schoolgirl was raped on the island of Okinawa in September. Three United States servicemen are on trial for the crime, which caused an outporing of resentment against the United States military presence.
While the United States has said it would consider relocating some troops elsewhere in Japan, Mr. Clinton tonight reaffirmed that the United States would maintain its force levels in Asia, Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord said.
Mr. Hashimoto, who as Trade Minister helped bring about the United States-Japan agreement on auto trade, sidestepped a question from reporters about whether he feared Mr. Buchanan. "Concerning the election," he said, "that's a decision the American people have to make."
But Mr. Clinton said, "Let me say that I hope that the Japanese Prime Minister would never be afraid of any American President. We have a partnership." As Mr. Clinton spoke, Mr. Hashimoto feigned fright.
But at the plant today, the workers barely reacted to Mr. Clinton's comments about trade, instead brightening with enthusiasm when he praised the military cargo plane they build.
Regaling his listeners with the story of his flight into Bosnia last month on a C-17 to visit American troops, Mr. Clinton said the plane had ferried not only him but two Army wide-bodied cargo carriers, Humvees, lots of bags of mail, 210 cases of Coke and 5,000 Hershey bars.
"And there was a lot of room to spare," he said. To roars of laughter, he added, "Not only that, even with all the press and politicians there, the plane carried all the hot air that we could generate in that flight."

Jobless Rate Exceeds Average

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY 

 BODY:
New Jersey lost thousands of jobs last month as the state's unemployment rate remained above the national average, suggesting continued sluggishness in the economy, according to data released yesterday. Using a new method to estimate unemployment figures, New Jersey's joblessness rate was 6.5 percent in January. Officials also revised the December rate to 6.6 percent, from 7.3 percent, easing concerns that a spike in unemployment had signaled a sudden downturn. [Page 1.]

HEADLINE: Dorothy Maynor, 85, Soprano and Arts School Founder, Dies

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

 BODY:
Dorothy Maynor, a highly regarded soprano recitalist who founded the Harlem School of the Arts, died on Monday at the Chester County Hospital in West Chester, Pa. She was 85 and lived in Kennett Square, Pa.
Miss Maynor, whose career helped open the way for black artists like Marian Anderson and Leontyne Price, possessed a voice that the New Grove Dictionary of American Music describes as "a soaring, belllike soprano capable of exquisite musical effects, supported by a sincere and ardent temperament." She took New York by storm in a sold-out recital at Town Hall in 1939 and pursued a successful recital career. 
 Although she committed more than 100 operatic roles to memory, she never appeared on an opera stage; there were no such opportunities for a black artist in the late 1930's and the 1940's, when she was in her prime. (Miss Anderson, the first black singer to appear at the Metropolitan Opera, did not make her debut there until 1955.)
Miss Maynor was born in Norfolk, Va., and as a child she sang in the choir of her father's church. She entered Hampton Institute (now Hampton University) in Hampton, Va., intending to become a teacher of home economics, but she also joined the renowned Hampton Choir, with which she toured Europe in 1929. On the advice of the choir director, R. Nathaniel Dett, she changed her major to music and earned a bachelor's degree in 1933.
After being awarded a scholarship, she studied choir direction at the Westminster Choir College in Princeton, N.J., where she received a second bachelor's degree in music and choral conducting in 1935. While on tour in New England with the school's choir, she was encouraged by several wealthy benefactors to pursue a concert career. Three years of private study in New York followed, with Wilfried Klamroth and John Alan Haughton. At this time she changed the spelling of her name from Mainor.
After hearing her sing at the 1939 Berkshire Symphonic Festival at Tanglewood in western Massachusetts, the conductor Serge Koussevitzky reportedly jumped up and down, shouting: "It is a miracle! It is a musical revelation! The world must hear her!" Koussevitzky, who called Miss Maynor "a native Flagstad," immediately used her in recordings with the Boston Symphony Orchestra.
She made her formal debut at Town Hall in Manhattan later that year, on Nov. 19, in a widely anticipated event that was sold out more than a week in advance. Olin Downes, reviewing the concert for The New York Times, hailed her as "one of the most remarkable soprano voices of the rising generation," called her voice "phenomenal for its range, character and varied expressive resources."
Miss Maynor began touring extensively in the United States, often appearing as a soloist with leading orchestras. She made her Carnegie Hall debut in 1940 with the New York Philharmonic, conducted by John Barbirolli. In the late 40's she toured Latin America and Europe. She often performed at benefits to aid the war effort and black causes.
She sang at the Presidential Inaugural galas for Harry S. Truman in 1949 and Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953. In 1952, by special permission of the Daughters of the American Revolution, she appeared as a soloist with the National Symphony Orchestra at Constitution Hall in the first commercial appearance there by a black artist since Miss Anderson had been barred from performing at the hall in 1939. (Miss Anderson subsequently gave benefit performances at the hall.)
Miss Maynor recorded popular arias and songs for RCA Victor. Although she never appeared on the opera stage, she recorded the role of Leonore in "Fidelio" under Arturo Toscanini.
In 1963, she retired to work with her husband, the Rev. Shelby Rooks, at St. James Presbyterian Church at West 141st Street and St. Nicholas Avenue in Harlem, where he was pastor. That year she founded the Harlem School of the Arts. The school offered classes in music, ballet, modern dance, drama and art to poor children for minimal fees, sometimes as little as 50 cents a lesson, and lent or rented instruments to students who did not own one.
"In most schools, if you don't have a piano, you can't take lessons," Miss Maynor told one interviewer. "But we say, 'Good, you come here and practice.' " She served as executive director of the school until 1979 and also taught there. In 1977 she raised more than $2 million to build a new facility for the school, which originally served 20 children and now has more than 1,000 students.
"What I dream of is changing the image held by the children," she said on another occasion. "We've made them believe everything beautiful is outside the community. We would like them to make beauty in our community."
Her work with the school is recounted in "Dorothy Maynor and the Harlem School of the Arts: The Diva and the Dream" (Edwin Mellen Press, 1993), by William F. Rogers Jr.
She received honorary doctorates from many schools, including Howard University, Westminster Choir College, Oberlin College, Carnegie-Mellon University and Bennett College in Greensboro, N.C..
In 1975, she became the first black member of the Metropolitan Opera board.
She is survived by her husband.

HEADLINE: Film Redux In Europe: Action!;
New Signs of Life After a Long Decline

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
At the big Shepperton Studios west of London, work progresses on "101 Dalmatians," a version with live actors of Walt Disney's animated classic. At nearby Pinewood Studios, cutting was just finished of "The Michael Collins Story," a tale of Irish independence by Ireland's brightest young director, Neil Jordan. In Berlin, a $230 million investment is well under way to revive the old Babelsberg Studios that produced classics like Fritz Lang's "Metropolis" and "The Blue Angel," with Marlene Dietrich.
After decades of decline, film making in Europe is reviving. Investment in film production, while still about one-third that of the United States, is edging up after several flat years. The number of films produced in most European countries is now climbing: In Britain, 81 feature films were produced in 1995, up from 70 in 1994; in Germany 84 films were made last year compared with only 57 in 1994. And on a continent struggling with unemployment rates double those in the United States, the production of films and audiovisual products last year employed more than 850,000 people, compared with 630,000 a decade earlier. 
 Yet Europeans call the blessing a mixed one. For what is sparking the growth is investment by the big American film studios like Walt Disney and Warner Brothers, a unit of Time Warner. Now, Europeans increasingly fear the American presence could crush domestic productions.
"By the year 2010 films and multimedia and television will be the largest single employer in Europe," said Jeremy Thomas, one of Britain's leading independent film producers and the chairman of the British Film Institute. Yet America's film industry, he cautioned, is increasingly behaving "like when you have a predator fish in a pond."
But while European intellectuals may bemoan the fact that American film distributors control the biggest chunk -- roughly 90 percent of major European film markets like Germany and Britain -- investment in film making continues to flow.
Last year, for example, Shepperton was bought for $18 million by the British film directors Tony and Ridley Scott, who began a $15 million modernization. This year, Warner Brothers will open a new film animation studio in London; in Germany, Warner will open its $270 million Warner Brothers Movie World film studio theme park and recently announced plans for another in Britain, to cost $344 million. At Babelsberg, a new $4.5 million sound studio, financed in part with German Government funds, is attracting international clients like Turner Entertainment, a unit of the Turner Broadcasting System.
Most of the studios' newfound activity stems from the arrival of American film makers in ever larger numbers, and the reason, according to Roy Button, the director of Warner Brothers Productions at Pinewood, is cost.
"England has changed phenomenally in the last four to five years," Mr. Button said as he sat beneath posters for recent Pinewood productions like Sylvester Stallone's "Judge Dredd."
He estimated the cost of producing a film in Britain to be about 35 percent lower than in the United States, in part because of favorable currency exchange rates, but mainly because of weakened labor unions, a legacy of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Studios are thus able to employ fewer people, and pay lower fringe benefits. In Spain and Portugal weak local currencies sharply reduce the cost of film making when calculated in dollars.
Most industry experts say part of Europe's film revival is also a result of the overhaul of European cinemas, led in part by American companies like Warner Brothers Theaters and American Multi-cinema, which is fast replacing single-screen movie houses with multiplex theaters. American Multi-cinema is owned by AMC Entertainment Inc.
"There's a big market all over Europe, east and west," said Joost Bert, whose Brussels-based theater chain Kinepolis opened a 4,200-seat, 14-screen multiplex in Metz, France, last March and is building another in Lille, in northern France, with 23 screens and 7,600 seats.
The new wave of film theaters has reversed the trend in movie viewing. In Germany, admissions reached 124 million last year, compared with 102 million in 1990. In France, Europe's largest film-viewing market, admissions in 1995 were 130 million, compared with 122 million five years earlier. In Britain, admissions in 1995 were 115 million, compared with 97 million five years earlier.
Recently at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France led a fresh attempt to counter American dominance by imposing quotas on American television programming. Yet the French zeal is increasingly questioned by industry experts and government leaders in other countries, including Britain, Germany and Italy, who are concluding that to compete culturally, Europe must compete commercially.
Business is arguing with money. This week, the Kirch Group, one of Germany's biggest media conglomerates, clinched deals to buy American film material from Columbia Tristar, a Sony subsidiary, and from Hearst Entertainment. The deals are believed to be worth more than $700 million.
"It is hard to mix business and culture," said Mr. Thomas of the British Film Institute. "Business is going to win."
At this point, Britain is leading the way.
Though Britain's film studios enjoyed a brief renaissance in the early 1980's with box office hits like "Chariots of Fire" and "Gandhi," by the middle of that decade they were faltering. In 1989, Britain's studios produced only 30 films and four years later the most venerable of the studios, Elstree, built in 1924, where Alfred Hitchcock directed the first British talkie, "Blackmail," closed. By last year, however, the number of films made in Britain had risen to 81 and studio space was so tight that Eon Productions transformed a former airplane hangar near London into a temporary sound stage to film the latest James Bond thriller, "GoldenEye."
"We're right on the crest of a wave," said Paul Olliver, the studio manager at Shepperton, where Walt Disney recently made "The Muppet Christmas Carol."
The boom at Britain's studios is a result, in part, of government action. In 1993, Ireland enacted tax rebates for film production, and by last year the number of films made in Ireland rose to 20, including hits like "Braveheart," Mel Gibson's Scottish epic, from one film four years earlier.
Not everyone, of course, is able to cash in on the American presence, and in the meantime many European studios, like Munich's Bavaria Studios and Rome's Cinecitta, which is owned by the Italian state, are staying alive with television work. But while Bavaria is turning a profit, Cinecitta, once the terrain of giants like Federico Fellini, has suffered from lackluster government management and is losing more than $6 million a year. Plans to revive the studio by selling it to private investors have been hamstrung by Italy's never-ending political crises.
If Italy is looking at privatization to lure investment, Germany is pouring subsidies into Babelsberg.
In 1992, Babelsberg was bought for $150 million by the French conglomerate Compagnie Generale des Eaux S. A. from the German Government agency responsible for privatizing the industries of formerly Communist East Germany. Jurgen Schepers, the director of marketing, whose office looks out on what is probably Europe's biggest construction site, boasted of how Babelsberg last year attracted a television pilot called "Star Command," produced by Paramount, and "The Ogre," a feature film starring William Hurt that was directed by the German director Volker Schlondorff. Yet Babelsberg had pretax losses in 1995 of $6.2 million, on revenues of $32 million, and does not expect to break even until 1997 at the earliest.
Of course, whether Babelsberg ever becomes profitable will depend largely on its ability to attract lucrative film productions, including some from the United States.
Encouragement comes from European television. If American series and soap operas long ruled the European airwaves, European-made products are increasingly competing. Indeed, Babelsberg's recently completed $25 million television center is busy turning out popular German programs like the soap opera "Good Times, Bad Times" and a hospital drama along the lines of "E.R." called "Dr. Bruckner" that compete head on with American shows.
"Our goal is to be a European studio," Mr. Schepers said. "The trend is rising toward our own film identity, one with our own style."

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day last Saturday about an increase in European film production misidentified the German company that recently agreed to buy American films from Hearst Entertainment. It was ZDF, the German television network, not the Kirch Group.

Posters That Once Stirred a Nation

BYLINE: By RITA REIF 

 BODY:
Long before Glasnost, Merrill C. Berman, a New York investor, had pioneered in the collecting of Soviet propaganda posters. In 1975, when such posters were still considered anathema in the West, he ignored the advice of a museum curator who, he says, told him to "focus on Russian film posters and forget the political ones."
When a Paris dealer offered him 30 Russian posters, he couldn't resist. As an undergraduate at Harvard, he had studied 20th-century economics and European Government and never lost interest in Soviet history. Besides, he added, the posters were visually compelling with their bold colors, mix of photographs, striking typography and heroic images of leaders and workers. 
 "I was moving away from Art Nouveau and Art Deco posters and was searching for something with more meaning," he said. "The Russians were very advanced in their use of photo-montage, abstract forms and typography. Words and pictures were combined to communicate and indoctrinate. I soon became obsessed with these kinds of images."
Now Mr. Berman, 57, owns several thousand posters and related ephemera, one of the pre-eminent private collections of Soviet graphic material in the world. It is part of his larger collection of 20th-century Modernist design works -- books, posters, photocollages and photomontages in a variety of styles: Austrian Secession, Bauhaus, Dada, de Stijl, Art Deco, Pop and abstract.
An exhibition featuring 120 of his Russian pieces, "Building the Collective: Soviet Graphic Design, 1917-1937, Selections From the Merrill C. Berman Collection," is on view at the art gallery in Schermerhorn Hall at Columbia University through March 30.
Like most collectors, Mr. Berman says he cannot remember a time when he was not acquiring something, starting with the baseball cards and coins that he bartered as a boy. As a teen-ager, he collected American campaign memorabilia.
In the late 1960's and early 70's, Mr. Berman bought 20th-century paintings. "After the bear market of 1973-74, I had a developed eye, and not as developed a pocketbook," he said. "So I sold the art and began buying 20th-century Modernist graphics."
He was searching for such graphics when he happened on the Russian posters in Paris. "You couldn't look for these posters because no one had these things then," he said. Mr. Berman bought 20 more Soviet posters when they turned up in The Hague a few years later. By 1980, as Russian Jewish immigration to the West increased, the market awakened and he has bought steadily ever since.
Eventually, Soviet propaganda art began to attract the attention of dealers and museums in New York. Mr. Berman lent posters to both the 1992 show "The Great Utopia: The Russian and Soviet Avant-Garde, 1915-1932" at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and "Russian Jewish Artists in a Century of Change: 1890-1990," which closed last month at the Jewish Museum.
The show at Columbia was organized by Leah Dickerman, a graduate student in art history, who also edited and wrote part of the catalogue ($35), published by Princeton Architectural Press. Mr. Berman met Ms. Dickerman in 1994 at the opening of a poster exhibition at the Sander Gallery in Manhattan. That show featured the frequently witty news and propaganda posters produced by Rosta, the Russian telegraph agency.
Ms. Dickerman, a consultant to the Rosta show, had visited the Soviet Union several times and knew that Mr. Berman owned many Russian posters. After viewing his collection, she proposed doing the current exhibition.
AMONG HIS FINEST PIECES, SHE SAID, ARE posters made during a period of rapid industrialization, beginning in 1928, under what was called the Soviet's first five-year plan. "There was such a radical rethinking, and many Russian artists began to work in graphic design for the first time in that period," she said. "That meant there was a whole new social role for artists."
Mr. Berman's posters include some by artists who were little known in the West, including Viktor Deni and Dmitri Moor, two pre-Revolutionary cartoonists whose works depicted capitalists as greedy fools in top hats. He also owns works by masters of the period, Aleksandr Rodchenko, El Lissitzky and Gustav Klutsis. A Rodchenko poster shows a plane aloft with a message urging citizens to buy stock in the state-run airline.
Among his prized posters are several by the Brothers Georgii and Vladimir Stenberg, including one showing workers and soldiers reading the literary journal Novyi Mir (New World). Another, depicting a fragmented industrial site reflected in a man's eyeglasses, was used to promote "The Eleventh," a film celebrating the 11th anniversary of the 1917 revolution.
As dated as the political messages on these posters may seem, the graphics are still fresh today. Witness the the neo-Constructivist ads for Stolichnaya vodka that recall Stenberg's style.
