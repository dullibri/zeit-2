HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Fast-food marketers worry about contests after a rigging scandal.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
ADVERTISERS and agencies are trying to determine how the disclosure that promotional games at McDonald's restaurants were rigged during the last six years -- costing customers the chance to win more than $13 million in cash and prizes -- will affect the growing use of contests and sweepstakes to woo consumers.
 The question to which they anxiously await an answer is whether the widespread publicity generated by the arrests of eight people charged with conspiring to rig the games will cause Americans to wail the 2001 equivalent of "Say it ain't so, Joe!" That was the plaintive cry of a young fan when the baseball player Shoeless Joe Jackson was accused of conspiring to fix the 1919 World Series. 
 Promotional games have become increasingly popular as a way to draw attention to products, services, restaurants, even media. Their appeal is their ability to scratch the primal itch in almost everyone to have fun, and to get something for nothing.
According to the Promotion Marketing Association in New York, an industry trade organization, advertisers spent $1.5 billion on games in 2000, up 9 percent from 1999, and the spending in 1999, $1.38 billion, represented an increase of 15 percent from 1998. 
So nagging doubts about the honesty of such games raised by the arrests, disclosed on Wednesday by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, could cripple their business-building potential. That is particularly a concern in competitive fields that have relied on promotions to stimulate sales -- like fast food, the McDonald's market.
"I don't know if there's anybody as dependent as fast food on promotions," said Peter Breen, editor at Promo magazine in Stamford, Conn., an industry trade publication owned by Primedia. " 'Crutch' is an apt term."
"They've really painted themselves into a corner," he added. "Even with this, I couldn't imagine them testing to see if they don't need promotions anymore."
The timing of the news of the fixing of the games -- including the popular annual giveaways by the McDonald's Corporation centered on Monopoly and a sweepstakes based on the ABC quiz show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" -- is unfortunate as well. That is because marketers traditionally step up sponsorship of such promotions in uncertain or tough economic times.
Indeed, the jingle-writing and boxtop-collecting contests and sweepstakes prevalent from the 1930's through the 1950's have become legendary on Madison Avenue. They even inspired movies like Preston Sturges's "Christmas in July" (1940), in which a clerk is tricked into thinking he has won the $10,000 grand prize in a slogan-writing contest sponsored by a coffee company.
The damage done by the rigging of the contests could undermine the effectiveness of other promotions that may be produced if the economy remains sluggish.
After all, the scandal in the 50's surrounding rigged quiz shows like "21" led to the genre's exile from lucrative slots during network prime-time television schedules for four decades.
"It's not good for the industry," said a top executive at a leading promotional marketing agency, because it jeopardizes the basic premise of contests: that sponsors "make a promise." The executive spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the pending legal issues raised by the arrests.
"Consumers who have been eating Big Macs for 200 days in a row to play a game can say, 'I've been saying for years I haven't been able to win these contests, and now here's proof why,' " the executive said. "They're now going to say, 'Don't give me a game.' "
Claire Rosenzweig, the executive director of the marketing association, said she did not think the McDonald's case would undermine confidence in the games because "this is an extremely rare occurrence."
In addition, Ms. Rosenzweig said, promotional games "are heavily scrutinized and regulated, and self-regulated as well because companies have security measures in place." "I'm sure companies will take a look to see that all measures now in place are the best they can be," she added.
Executives at other fast-food marketers sought to reassure consumers. "We feel very comfortable" with security procedures, said Rob Doughty, a spokesman for the Burger King Corporation in Miami, a division of Diageo.
Besides, "we don't have games as often" as McDonald's does, he said, and when Burger King does sponsor games, they tend to focus on prizes like free menu items rather than cash or cars.
Amy Sherwood, a spokeswoman for Tricon Global Restaurants in Louisville, Ky., said her company, which operates the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell chains, had "reviewed our own procedures, guidelines and safeguards" for games even though "we don't do many sweepstakes."
Rather, she added, "we're much more focused on food, our core products like KFC's chicken in a bucket and new products."
Bob Bertini, a spokesman for Wendy's International in Dublin, Ohio, said the McDonald's case "would not have an effect on us."
"Unlike a McDonald's, with national promotions everyone gets behind, we have two local promotions a year," he said, and franchisees and company-owned restaurants can choose whether or not they will participate.
Also, Wendy's tends to prefer "instant-win incentives" like games in which customers peel off stickers on food packages or beverage cups, he added, rather than the "collect-and-win" type of game favored by McDonald's. In the latter type of game, customers earn the prizes by collecting, for example, full sets of stamps representing groups of properties on the Monopoly board.
The suspects whose arrests were disclosed by the F.B.I. included an employee at the security department of Simon Marketing, which had been one of three companies holding lucrative contracts to handle promotional assignments for McDonald's. 
On Wednesday, McDonald's dismissed Simon Marketing, which is part of a 26-year-old company based in Los Angeles named Simon Worldwide. The companies worked together for almost two decades.
McDonald's was the largest client of Simon Worldwide, formerly known as Cyrk, accounting for 65 percent of its $768.4 million in revenue last year.
Yesterday, Philip Morris, the second-largest client of Simon Worldwide, accounting for 9 percent of its revenue, dismissed the company, Allan Brown, chief executive at Simon Worldwide, said in a statement.
Simon Worldwide was also dismissed by other clients, he added, but he did not identify them.
The company has hired a Los Angeles law firm, O'Melveny & Myers, to review how Simon Marketing administered the games for McDonald's, Mr. Brown said. "The steps we have taken to get to the bottom of this matter demonstrate that we are doing the right thing under these difficult circumstances," he said.
Already, one lawsuit has been filed against McDonald's, based in Oak Brook, Ill., and Simon Worldwide. The lawsuit, filed in Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago, seeks damages for customers it says were defrauded by the rigged games.
In newspapers on Wednesday, McDonald's ran full-page ads, labeled as "An Open Letter to McDonald's Customers," in which Jack Greenberg, the company's chairman and chief executive, wrote that "nothing is more important to us than your trust." The ad was produced by the Chicago office of DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, which has been the lead American agency for McDonald's since 1997.
Frankel in Chicago, owned by the Publicis Groupe, is a leading candidate for landing the promotional marketing duties that Simon Marketing had handled for McDonald's. 
Frankel is the McDonald's retail merchandising agency of record, responsible for everything in stores, like displays at cash registers, menu boards and designing packaging.

HEADLINE: Variety of Retailers Say Sales Will Remain Slow for Rest of Year 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Kmart and other retailers said yesterday that sales would remain slow for the rest of the year, reflecting consumers' increasingly cautious spending patterns.
 The Kmart Corporation, the second-largest discount chain after Wal-Mart Stores Inc., also reported a narrower fiscal second-quarter loss. The Limited Inc., Intimate Brands Inc. and Men's Wearhouse Inc. each reported sharply lower profits. 
 While they face different pressures, retailers are generally offering discounts as sales growth slows, resulting in declining profits. 
That such disparate retailers reported similar soft sales "speaks to the breadth of the slowdown," said Carl Steidtmann, director of consumer research for Deloitte Research, part of the accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche. "I think this will be a weak fall and a weak Christmas."
Kmart said that sales for the quarter ended Aug. 1 fell 0.9 percent, to $8.92 billion from $9 billion in the period a year earlier. It said earlier this month that sales at stores open at least a year rose 1 percent in the quarter. The company, which is based in Troy, Mich., posted a loss of $95 million, or 19 cents a share, in contrast to a net loss of $448 million, or 93 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
Excluding a pretax $92 million charge to buy the 40 percent of the Internet unit BlueLight.com that it did not already own, Kmart posted a loss of $22 million, or 4 cents a share.
That matched Wall Street expectations, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.
Debt the company must pay within a year rose to $116 million from $38 million, and long-term debt rose to $3 billion from $1.7 billion.
For a year, Kmart has been shifting its business to attract new customers and generate steady sales growth by focusing on food and drinks, makeup and hygiene products, the kind of things that customers repeatedly and consistently buy.
But it had said that shift would include a reduction in inventories. Instead, inventories rose to $6.9 billion from $6.6 billion in the quarter a year earlier.
"The changes have yet to bear any financial rewards," said Susan K. Jansen, an analyst at Lehman Brothers.
Regardless of its particular pressures and strategies, Kmart's results suffered from problems common to many retailers.
"We continue to reduce our reliance on advertising, and, with the lowering of prices on 20,000 items as part of our BlueLight Always program, face deflationary pricing conditions," Charles C. Conaway, the company's chairman, said in a statement.
Shares of Kmart fell $1.13, to $10.97, on the New York Stock Exchange.
At Limited, the company reported net income of $34.4 million, or 8 cents a share, compared with $77.6 million, or 17 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Those results matched Wall Street's expectations. Sales fell to $2.2 billion from $2.3 billion. Limited's stock fell $1.27, to $13.93 a share.
Intimate Brands, a Limited spinoff best known for its lingerie chain, Victoria's Secret, said its net income was $68.9 million, or 14 cents a share, compared with $99.8 million, or 20 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales for the quarter, which ended Aug. 4, fell to $1.15 billion, compared with $1.2 billion in the quarter a year earlier.
The Limited still owns 83.9 percent of Intimate Brands, and both companies are based in Columbus, Ohio. Analysts had expected Intimate Brands to earn 12 cents a share, according to First Call. Shares of Intimate Brands fell $1.22, to $13.39.
Men's Wearhouse, based in Houston, reported net income of $10.3 million, or 25 cents a share, compared with $16 million, or 38 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. The results matched analysts' reduced estimates. Sales edged up 0.9 percent, to $297.2 million, from $294.5 million. Its shares fell $1.10, to $24.
"The general softness in U.S. apparel sales will likely continue through the third quarter of 2001 and possibly through the end of the year," George Zimmer, the company chairman, said in a statement.
Eliot S. Laurence, an analyst for Jefferies & Company, said the apparel retail business still had a few pockets of strength, including logo T-shirts, men's fashion denim, and fashion denim and knit tops for girls. But the broad areas of weakness, including most men's clothing and all sorts of basic items that fluctuate little with changing fashions, are not likely to improve this year, he said.
"If you have a closet full of basics already, and you're worried about your job, you're not going to squeeze a little to get a fourth turtleneck," Mr. Laurence said.

HEADLINE: Marquee Firm In California Cuts Lawyers 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
Cooley Godward, one of the San Francisco area's highest-flying law firms during the Internet boom, told employees yesterday that more than 10 percent of the firm's lawyers would be laid off.
 The cutback -- affecting 85 of the 645 lawyers as well as 50 paralegals and other members of the support staff -- was one of the first publicly acknowledged and economically driven staff reductions at a big law firm in about a decade. It is also the latest and perhaps the most prominent sign that law firms are vulnerable to the economic slowdown. 
 In an memorandum distributed yesterday, Stephen C. Neal, Cooley Godward's chairman and chief executive, said that "with no foreseeable resurgence in the economy, we are making personnel reductions" throughout the firm. 
Poignantly, the announcement comes just weeks after Vault Inc., which runs a Web site that allows employees to post messages about their workplace, ranked Cooley as the best firm in the country for lawyers and their staffs to work.
"When the downturn hit, it left us with too many" lawyers, Mr. Neal said in a telephone interview. "In response to what was in retrospect a huge spike in demand for our services in 1999 and 2000, we hired and built up capacity."
But the buildup was in anticipation of a continued business boom, he continued, and because that business has failed to materialize, Cooley has too many lawyers and too little work.
"It's easy to say in hindsight that we should have known," Mr. Neal said. "But nobody in the world knew."
He said that morale was a factor in the decision, because associates with no work would not develop in their careers and were unlikely to stay at the firm.
Mr. Neal said that no partners were let go and that members of the firm decided not to cut salaries to retain people.
Cooley Godward will still take on about 85 law school graduates this fall. Their starting salaries will be $125,000 a year.
According to The American Lawyer, an industry magazine, Cooley's profit per partner -- a critical measure of a firm's success -- came to about $905,000 last year.
Layoffs at law firms are not new, and under these economic circumstances are not surprising, said Jim Cotterman, a principal at Altman Weil, a consultant to law firms.
"We've seen this before," Mr. Cotterman said, "and the results that we're seeing now shouldn't be surprising, given that we know what happened the last time there was a slowdown after a period of intense activity."
In the late 1980's, he said, firms raised salaries as the economy grew, just as they did recently. But then in the early 90's, many firms let people go -- and had a tough time both luring law school graduates and, when the economy recovered, enough experienced lawyers.
"They spent the better part of the last decade," he said, "working out of the increases in associate compensation that they had going into the decade. Now we're back where we started from."
News of the layoffs spread quickly yesterday as associates in Palo Alto, where the firm is based, sent copies of the memorandum by e-mail to friends throughout the country. Associates elsewhere reacted with a mixture of relief that they were not similarly affected and fear that their jobs might yet be at risk. 
"It's totally scary," said an associate at a big New York firm who insisted on not being identified. One reason to go to a big firm, the associate said, is stability: most young lawyers think that law firms will be immune to the condition of the economy because they will be cushioned by bankruptcy-related work in slow times and buoyed by corporate transactions during booms.
Another associate at an East Coast firm said, "It makes me feel like my bonus is going to be low." On the other hand, he said, he felt "relatively secure" because the San Francisco Bay Area firms were overly dependent on the technology industries.
At least Cooley openly stated that the layoffs were related to the decline in the economy, said Sheri Michaels, vice president for recruitment at Mestel & Company, a search firm serving law practices. Some firms have laid off associates in recent months but insisted that only poor performers have been affected, Ms. Michaels said.
"Which one is telling it straight?" she asked rhetorically. "I'd rather have Cooley. At least you know what the facts are."
Ms. Michaels said that the layoffs would probably affect Cooley's recruiting at law schools in the short term, but that the impact in future years was difficult to predict. "Their business has been tied to one particular industry," she said. "If that market comes back, the layoffs won't hurt them."

HEADLINE: Initial Jobless Claims Rise as Unemployment Benefits Surge 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 23 

 BODY:
The number of workers filing new claims for jobless benefits rose last week and an increase in those continuing to receive payments suggests that the laid-off employees are having trouble finding work.
 "So few new jobs are being created that nearly all of the newly laid-off are finding themselves unemployed," said Steven A. Wood, chief economist at Financial Oxygen Inc. in Walnut Creek, Calif. "These data suggest that payroll employment is likely to be negative for August." 
 In a separate report, a survey of economists by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia forecasts slower growth and higher unemployment this year and next than expected.
Initial jobless claims rose 8,000, to 393,000, in the week that ended Saturday from a revised 385,000 the previous week, the Labor Department said. The four-week moving average of claims, which smooths out volatility in the weekly numbers, rose to 378,750 from 372,000.
The number of people collecting unemployment benefits surged to 3.18 million during the week ended Aug. 11 from 3.05 million the week before. That is the highest since 3.21 million in September 1992.
The report showed some signs that the pace of payroll trimming might be starting to ease. Last week was the fifth in a row that first-time claims stayed below 400,000. Filings had begun exceeding that level in mid-April.
"That claims are still far below 400,000 is quite compelling," said Lara Rhame, an economist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company in New York. "The economy is so far able to manage this slowdown."
The number of workers continuing to receive benefits, while at a nine-year high, represents a smaller percentage of the work force than it did then. In 1992, when the country was pulling out of the last recession, there were 129 million workers. The civilian labor force has expanded to 142 million this year.
The Philadelphia Fed report showed that economists expected the unemployment rate to average 4.6 percent this year, higher than the previous projection of 4.5 percent. The monthly rate has been either 4.5 percent or 4.4 percent since April. The rate will climb to 4.9 percent next year, the economists say.
The economy probably will have expanded 1.7 percent this year, down from a forecast of 2 percent in May, the survey found. The expected 2.6 percent growth rate for 2002 is down from 2.8 percent in the last survey.

SHARES OF AIRTRAN FALL 17 PERCENT AFTER PROFIT WARNING

BYLINE:  Reuters 

 BODY:
 Shares of AirTran Holdings fell 17 percent yesterday after the company issued a profit warning. 
AirTran, a low-fare carrier based in Orlando, Fla., said it was feeling pinched by the economic downturn, price competition and discounting. In June, Delta Air Lines introduced competitive business fares at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport, where AirTran Airways has 151 daily departures. AirTran flies on the East Coast to 34 cities. The company said its third-quarter profits would range from 2 to 6 cents a share. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call had forecast 5 to 20 cents a share. Shares of AirTran fell $1.22, to $5.96.

HEADLINE: The Incredible Shrinking Surplus 

 BODY:
The surplus seems to have vanished while Washington is on vacation.
 The relentlessly optimistic Bush administration, which released its latest budget projections this week, had to struggle mightily to produce even a tiny nub of a surplus -- $1 billion this year outside of Social Security, based on overoptimistic forecasts and convenient omissions. The Congressional numbers due next Tuesday are likely to be even less heartening. Except for the money in the Social Security trust fund, which both parties have vowed to use for debt reduction, the cushy surpluses of last spring have melted away in the heat of the summer. 
 All this happened in a political vacuum, with Congress off on recess and President Bush himself vacationing in what is now ordained as the Western White House. But the administration is doing no one a favor by pretending that the situation can be solved by a little restraint on the part of House and Senate appropriations committees. In the real world, there is no way Mr. Bush can protect the Social Security trust fund surplus and his recent tax cut program. The sooner Congress is forced to face reality, the better.
The administration still insists that over the next few years it will take in a few billion dollars more than it spends, while saving the Social Security surplus -- but not the Medicare surplus -- for debt reduction. After a few years of close calls, the administration says, the surplus outside of Social Security will begin to blossom again, growing to $575 billion over the next 10 years.
To maintain faith in the surpluses of the future, President Bush is making some far-fetched assumptions. The White House assumes that, adjusted for inflation, the economy will grow by 3.2 percent in 2002. Popular private forecasters beg to differ. The survey of 33 analysts by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia comes in at 2.6 percent; The Economist's survey of 16 major investment banks and consultants averages 2.7 percent; and the Blue Chip Economic Indicators consensus of 53 sources says 2.8 percent.
In addition, the updated budget implicitly assumes that Congress is not going to do anything about the alternative minimum tax. If the targeting of the tax is not fixed by 2004, up to 35 million taxpayers, many from the middle class, will be subject to this onerous levy by the end of the decade. The chances are minimal that legislators will allow their constituents to be hit by something they will certainly perceive as a big tax increase. 
Money to renew investment tax credits and finance additional defense spending, both of which the administration supports, is also left out of the budget. These three initiatives alone could eat up the entire surplus outside Social Security and cast the rest of the government into the red. Washington has a tradition of ignoring policies in the "expected but not budgeted" category, but never to this extent.
Mr. Bush has been telling the nation that the only thing it has to fear is a spendthrift Congress. Both parties have expensive items on their agendas -- a prescription drug program for the elderly, heavy spending on aid to agriculture and the inevitable highway construction programs. It is unrealistic to believe that the president, who seems unwilling to drop any of his own big-ticket priorities, like the missile shield, is going to be able to persuade members of Congress to give up theirs.
Despite what the administration wants the public to believe, surplus funds collected by Medicare and Social Security will almost certainly be tapped to pay for the president's tax cut and general spending for the foreseeable future. If this money were instead used to pay down more of the government's debt, it would lower the cost of borrowing to pay the retirement benefits already promised to today's workers. The only other way to supply these benefits would be through higher taxes. The budget needs more breathing room, but the White House's huge tax cut threatens to smother it.

HEADLINE: RUMSFELD INSISTS BUSH WON'T PARE SPENDING REQUEST 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 23 

 BODY:
Responding to calls on Capitol Hill for paring back the administration's Pentagon budget request, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld said today that President Bush would insist that Congress approve all of his proposed $18.4 billion increase in military spending for the coming year.
 "We need every nickel of that," Mr. Rumsfeld said at a Pentagon news conference. "The president has indicated that defense is a top priority for him, and he intends to be assisting to see that the full $18.4 billion tab that is up there is passed." 
 Shrinking federal budget surpluses prompted two powerful Democrats, Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, and Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, to announce this week that they would not support Mr. Bush's request to add $18.4 billion to his original Pentagon spending plan for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
Each senator asserted that paying for the full Pentagon increase would mean dipping into surplus Medicare and possibly Social Security money, which most lawmakers in both parties have declared off limits. 
"He's not proposed any way to pay for it," Mr. Conrad said on Wednesday of the requested increase. "That means the money will come right out of the trust funds for Medicare and Social Security if his proposal were to be adopted."
The dueling remarks set the stage for a battle next month over the shape and size of the proposed $329 billion Pentagon budget. Many Democrats are already using the dwindling surplus to advocate cutting the administration's requested $8.3 billion budget for missile defense.
But it is not just Senate Democrats who are objecting to the size of the Pentagon budget. A number of senior Republicans in the House have also expressed concerns about how to balance military spending against competing demands for money for education and health care.
Representative Jim Nussle, an Iowa Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, said he was troubled at having to support a major increase for the armed services when the Pentagon has yet to complete a review of its long-term needs. That review is not due to reach Congress until late September. 
Mr. Nussle said Mr. Rumsfeld was asking Congress to pass a budget based on "guestimates." He added: "That's unacceptable if they are planning on getting more. We're not just going to throw money at defense again."
Echoing an argument made by defense secretaries through the decades, Mr. Rumsfeld asserted today that security was a national imperative and not just another discretionary spending program. 
"The defense is a priority that's distinctive, and the president has indicated that," he said.
On Monday, Mr. Bush told a veterans' group, "Let us have responsible spending from Day 1 and put the national security and education of our children first in line when it comes to the appropriations process."
But Mr. Nussle argued that military spending should not be held sacrosanct. "The defense request is no different from a number of other requests out there," he said. "As we've reminded President Clinton, we will cheerfully remind President Bush that we hold the purse strings."
Mr. Bush's original budget proposal called for increasing the Pentagon budget to $310 billion, up from $296 billion in 2001. The president later asked for an additional increase of $18.4 billion.
But a provision of the budget resolution says that the budget committee chairmen in both houses cannot approve military spending increases that use surplus Medicare money. 
New projections released by the White House on Wednesday showed that Mr. Bush's tax cut and the economic slowdown had whittled the surplus outside Social Security system to virtually zero. That means that the government will spend nearly all of the surplus generated by part of the Medicare system. 
"The president's tax cut is so big that it stops additional money going for any of the president's priorities, including defense, education and prescription drugs," said Thomas S. Kahn, Democratic staff director of the House Budget panel. "He's basically created a fiscal straitjacket."
Gordon Adams, director of security policy studies at the Elliot School of International Affairs at George Washington University, said the new surplus projections would leave less money for the 2003 Pentagon budget, when the administration had hoped to place its stamp on major weapons programs. "The cruel dilemma for the Pentagon is not 2002, but 2003 through 2009," Mr. Adams said.
Mr. Conrad's opposition will complicate the administration's ability to win approval for the $18.4 billion increase. But the White House can also seek to delay, cut or restructure other programs to free money for the military.
One likely target for the Democrats will be proposed spending for missile defense, which Mr. Bush wants to increase by $3 billion. Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee recently tried unsuccessfully to shift $1 billion from missile defense to conventional military programs. Senator Byrd suggested he might try something similar. 
"We don't have to keep campaign promises that we don't make, and ought to be very careful about launching into the unknown with a missile defense system that hasn't been tested," Senator Byrd said.
Despite the Democratic pledges to cut the military increase, Mr. Rumsfeld said he expected to prevail. 
"The need is so serious and so real, and the president's commitment is clear," he said. "I've generally found that there are always some people who are against defense spending at any level. And yet when the votes tend to be done, they seem to find a majority to support a strong national defense. And I suspect that that will be the case this time."

HEADLINE: Levy Says $200 Million May Have to Be Cut a Week Before School Opens 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
The budget brinksmanship between the Board of Education and City Hall reached a new peak yesterday as Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy warned that he might announce budget cuts of up to $200 million next week, just a week before students return to school.
 Mr. Levy's warning prompted City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone to lobby Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for the release of additional financing for classroom programs. Mr. Vallone said that the money had been promised if Mr. Levy made substantial administrative cuts this summer and that he believed that the restructuring plan outlined by Mr. Levy last week met that requirement. 
 It was not clear that Mr. Vallone's efforts to broker an agreement were successful. Mr. Vallone portrayed the mayor as moving closer to agreeing to provide more money and said he expected Mr. Levy to present a list today of classroom programs that would get the new money.
But the mayor's office insisted that the only agreement reached yesterday was to review a list if Mr. Levy submitted one and warned that it would review any administrative cuts skeptically. 
In addition, the mayor's office raised conditions that have not been heard in the last several rounds of the budget fight. Anthony P. Coles, a deputy mayor for education, said the mayor hoped that Mr. Levy's plans for additional classroom programs would include the private management of some low-performing schools, an idea that was voted down at five schools in the spring, and the trial use of vouchers in at least one district, which would send children to private schools with public money. .
Mr. Vallone commended parts of Mr. Levy's restructuring plan, particularly the $40 million a year Mr. Levy said would be saved by changing the board's procurement systems. Mr. Vallone added that he has been waiting for more than two months for Mr. Levy to list the classroom programs that would be financed with the money saved by the restructuring.
Mr. Levy has been warning for most of the year that the board faced a budget shortfall if large parts of the budgets outlined by the mayor and Gov. George E. Pataki were adopted. Mr. Levy has said the board's $11.5 billion budget left it $120 million short in city money and $170 million short in state money.
Even after the $100 million in annual administrative cuts outlined by Mr. Levy last week, the board is still $190 million short, the chancellor said. That is the money Mr. Levy says will be required to continue the programs it had last year. 
Although the board's budget increased by nearly $200 million in the fiscal year that began July 1, Mr. Levy says that required cost increases and the effect of inflation mean that the board's spending power is significantly less than it was last year. A cut of $200 million in the board's budget would be equivalent to less than 2 percent of its financing.
Mr. Giuliani scoffed yesterday at the notion that the board could not find that amount of savings. But Mr. Levy said that after his administrative cuts, the only places left to turn were after-school, sports and arts programs; professional development; and weekend programs for academic enrichment.
Mr. Levy said it might not be possible to avoid cutting classroom programs to close the budget gap.
"Classes begin the first week of September," Mr. Levy said in an interview. "It's already late to be planning a budget for a system this large. Next week is the last possible moment to give superintendents guidance on their budgets without causing them untoward disruption."

HEADLINE: Giuliani's Budget 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Charles R. Morris (Op-Ed, Aug. 17) applauds Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's resistance to repeating the "lavish spending" of the years under Mayor Edward I. Koch. The common perception that Mr. 
Giuliani has reined in spending results from misleading city budget reporting practices that omit increased spending on debt service and do not adjust for the transfer of one year's surplus to the next. 
 Accurately reported, New York City spending grew 6 percent a year from fiscal year 1997 to 2001, while inflation averaged 2.3 percent. In a comparable period (1985 to 1989) under Mr. Koch, spending grew 6.7 percent a year while inflation averaged 4.5 percent.
New Yorkers should not believe that the recent growth in the number of police officers and teachers was accomplished with budget restraint.

HEADLINE: Selling a New Armed Forces 

BYLINE:  By John Hillen; John Hillen is chief operating officer of Island ECN, an electronic trading network in New York. He was a defense adviser to the Bush campaign and is co-author of "Future Visions for U.S. Defense Policy."

 BODY:
Since the Vietnam War, the American defense debate could be characterized as Republicans wanting more of the same (tanks, ships and planes) and Democrats wanting less. There were some important differences between the parties over questions of intervention and strategy, peacekeeping and war fighting, but when it came to military programs and hardware, the political divide was simply a matter of scale.
 George W. Bush, when he was still Texas governor, tried to change all that in a September 1999 speech, calling for a revolution at the Pentagon. It was a speech that said, quite simply, we don't need more or less of the same defense, we need a very different defense. 
 But now George W. Bush's plan to transform the military is coming back to haunt the Pentagon and, in particular, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. As a candidate, Mr. Bush proposed the biggest changes in our military forces since the 1930's -- strategic and bureaucratic initiatives meant to move the Pentagon away from an industrial-age outgrowth of our World War II and cold war forces (those magnificent tanks, ships and planes) and toward a leaner, longer-range and more precise force intended to deter and combat the threats of the future.
This transformed military would use advances in computing and information technology to pack more punch than today's forces do, but in very different form. Large and slow-moving aircraft carriers would give way to submarines and other stealthier ships that would deliver much more than a carrier's worth of precision-guided munitions. F-22 aircraft meant for dogfights would give way to long-range bombers and to unmanned aircraft not limited by a human being in the cockpit. Large and cumbersome Army divisions full of tanks and artillery would give way to smaller, lighter, more lethal and more agile formations. All this force would be stitched together by real-time, space-based information systems and applied in new ways.
The military knows this change is coming. Its own planning documents and "vision statements" all refer explicitly to these changes in warfare. But putting the vision into action means short-term pain and wrenching change, neither of which the Pentagon handles well. Moreover, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that even with dramatically increased defense spending the Pentagon will, over the next decade, still be unable to afford sustaining and improving the cold war force.
Now Mr. Rumsfeld is backed into a corner; the political (and economic) bill for trying to bring this agenda to fruition has come due. If Mr. Rumsfeld legitimizes the Pentagon's status quo responses -- more tanks, ships and planes, slightly improved -- to his proposals, he undermines Mr. Bush and keeps the Pentagon in a spiral of steadily deteriorating readiness, rapidly rising equipment replacement costs and increasing strategic irrelevance. If he pushes the president's agenda forward, he faces the iron triangle of Congress, the uniformed chiefs of the armed services, and the defense industry (which, to little notice, roundly criticized Mr. Bush's defense platform during the campaign).
Judging from his recent remarks on the very small percentage of the military that he would change, Mr. Rumsfeld has decided to move slowly. To those who doubt that one can have a revolution in slow motion -- with cautious bureaucrats managing the change -- it looks as if he's throwing in the towel.
But the Pentagon can still be transformed along the lines President Bush laid out in his campaign. Like any radical shift in a big institution, this change would have to be accomplished with a mixture of cunning, compromise and ruthlessness.
The first step would be to fire some generals and admirals. No group in Washington resists change more effectively than the uniformed services, which control more than 85 percent of the Pentagon's budget with little effective civilian oversight. So far, Mr. Rumsfeld has seemed to expect the military leaders who grew up in the old system to be his agents of change. That would not happen in any organization, and certainly not in the military.
Mr. Rumsfeld needs to reach down into the ranks and bring up leaders who can help make the transformation. In his first year as chief of staff, George C. Marshall retired 55 generals and over 400 colonels from the Army as he attempted to remake the force just before World War II. Marshall knew he had to change the Army of World War I to one that could take on Hitler's military innovations, and he knew he couldn't do it with leaders who grew up in the horse cavalry.
Mr. Rumsfeld should also work hard to encourage experimentation, not only with new weapons but also with new war-fighting concepts and new forms of organization. The military has been bemoaning its risk-averse culture for a decade but has done nothing to correct it. Few officers will take unusual assignments or publish controversial ideas. There is a bland corporateness about military culture these days, and no one will risk failure. Yet our military history shows that experimentation -- despite the unavoidable failures that will occur -- leads to dramatic change and success. Mr. Rumsfeld should thrust some mavericks into the limelight.
The old saw is that the military prepares to fight the last war. Under current doctrine, the United States is prepared to fight two: the Korean War and Desert Storm. Almost all of the Pentagon's energies are directed at refighting those wars in basically the same way with the same (if updated) systems. While there is no doubt that America should retain the capability to triumph in such conflicts, it should not shoehorn its efforts into outdated war plans. The pressing military need of the next 25 years will be to get to the future of warfare before the other guy.
Mr. Rumsfeld's biggest mistake so far has been to let others emphasize the costs of losing the cold war force before he articulated the security benefits and other advantages of military reform. For both the defense industry and Congress, he should demonstrate the likely industrial and technological byproducts from creating new kinds of forces and weapons systems. In the era of the cold war military, for example, research for defense purposes developed the use of satellites for communication and created the Internet. Why did the Pentagon start with the bad news?
Finally, Mr. Rumsfeld needs solid White House support. He cannot operate in isolation from politics. After all, we don't have a military for its own sake -- it is simply the means to ensure American security. President Bush needs to lay out a national security plan that describes what we hope to accomplish in the world, against what obstacles, in concert with which friends -- and with what kind of military. And because this military transformation will happen over a 20-year period, the president will need to stretch his vision out to encompass a few decades. Only then will the transformation of the armed forces make practical and political sense.

 Re "Bush Projections Show Sharp Drop in Budget Surplus" (front page, Aug. 23): 
 President Bush's supporters should see from a graph accompanying your article that the drop in the projected federal budget surplus from $810 billion to $484 billion in 2011 because of the tax cut shows that the tax cut was an economic disaster for all of us. 
Even those of us who are not economists see the fallacy of squandering an inheritance (the budget surplus and a positive state of mind among investors that could have produced long-term stability) for short-term political gain through pie-in-the-sky election propaganda about boosting the economy through tax refunds.
Let's hope that enough American consumers and investors can keep the country afloat until more responsible leaders come to power and return common sense to public office.

HEADLINE: Back-to-School Retailer Blues; 
Consumers Now Seem to Be in Belt-Tightening Mode

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
Families have been out in force these days at the Briarwood shopping mall in Ann Arbor, Mich. Last week, swarms of young girls and pre-adolescents surrounded the displays of trendy clothes and accessories. But many parents were carefully searching out sales and other bargains.
 Jo Ellin Gutterman, shopping with her daughters, Noa, 9, and Zoe, 13, said the economic slowdown had convinced her to do some things she did not bother with when the economy was in better shape. 
 "We are actually using coupons arriving in the mail," she said. And the family is taking advantage of online promotions: they go to a Gap store, try on clothes they like, and then order them over the Internet, where they are often cheaper. 
Many retailers are bracing themselves for one of the rockier shopping seasons in years as parents and children, teenagers and college students head into stores this month looking for sneakers and shirts, electronic organizers and wide-ruled paper -- all in preparation to go back to school. And industry experts say there is no immediate upturn in sight.
In recent years, many people have stopped buying every sweater and sock they would need for the year in one fell swoop, in favor of buying gradually over several months.
But August still occupies a special place on the retail calendar as the time when stores unveil their fall merchandise and find out whether they have hits on their hands, or merely stacks of stuff that will have to be marked down before anyone will buy it.
This year, though, with a soft economy, the burst dot-com bubble and job cutbacks either announced or feared at many companies, retail experts are anticipating slower sales gains -- except in stores known for deep discounts. And even there, consumers are showing an unusual degree of caution, buying carefully and hunting for sales.
July same-store sales figures fell for most department stores and specialty stores, with single-digit sales growth going to discount stores like Wal-Mart; Costco; T.J. Maxx, a unit of TJX; and Payless ShoeSource.
The federal tax rebates being issued this summer were supposed to inspire people to spend more. But one expert says the effect of the rebates has been minimal at best.
"From what I've seen, back-to- school looks like it is off to a slow start," said Burt Flickinger 3rd, a consultant with Reach Marketing in Westport, Conn. "It looks like consumers are cutting back, trying to use last year's backpacks. In notebooks and other items, they are really shopping the specials much more so than in other years."
Michael P. Niemira, an economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, said the rebate was starting to have some effect on retailers. He predicts that this fall's sales will not be any worse than last year, although there will probably be more promotions to draw customers into stores. But he said there are some indications that consumers may hold off on spending the bulk of the tax rebate for now and wait until the holidays get closer.
Even teenagers, who once headed straight for specialty chains like Abercrombie & Fitch, Pacific Sunwear of California and Gap, appear to be cutting back and shopping a little more in discount stores, according to a back-to-school survey conducted earlier this month by American Express. This year, 39 percent of teenagers described themselves as bargain hunters, compared with 32 percent a year earlier. And they report that they are spending $23 less, on average, than last year.
Some stores, worried about anemic back-to-school shopping this year, are changing how they manage inventory levels. Many have cut back their orders to avoid having too much merchandise on their hands. And experts expect no change in the situation until next year.
"A lot of the retailers are looking through their brands now, trying to understand the cash-flow cycles for each one," said Darrell Rigby, a retail consultant with Bain & Company in Boston. "They are getting very sophisticated about the economics of the products that they move. The ones that aren't moving, or end up needing huge markdowns in order to move them, will be the first to go."
The weak economy is the main source of worry for retailers. But they are also troubled by lackluster products in many areas, including apparel, toys and entertainment, experts said. Customers of the Gap said they wanted more fashion, so the company complied. But sales still went down.
Wal-Mart has found some success in apparel with products like the clothing line linked to Mary Kate and Ashley, the Olsen twins of television and movie fame. But in general, the retail industry is suffering from a lack of hot products, said Seth M. Siegel, co-chairman of the Beanstalk Group, which licenses various entertainment and corporate properties to retailers. The group licensed Mary Kate and Ashley to Wal-Mart.
Fashion trends seem cautious, said John D. Morris, an analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison. "For a while, the designer was dictating to the consumer," he said. "Now we're coming out of that. Teens and college students are saying they want simplicity, they want honesty. They want to take a break from the technology revolution, and everything that's been forced on them."
The biggest style trend for the fall is denim, hardly a revolutionary concept. Denim is appearing in different washes, including potassium, which creates a bright sheen, and with embellishments like painting and embroidery. 
As for toys, "there is no entertainment property like the Ninja Turtles or the Power Rangers," Mr. Siegel said, "and no Tamagotchi or Furby or actual toy property that makes a person want to go to the store today."
Hopes are high for the movie version of "Harry Potter," expected in theaters in November, but toys and other tie-ins to the movie are not expected to sell especially well, Mr. Flickinger said. "The second half of the year and Christmas will be one of the softest in years," he predicted. The fourth quarter of the year generally accounts for roughly two-thirds of all toy sales.
No clear winner has emerged at the movies, either, Mr. Flickinger added. And toy makers have been reluctant to license products tied to coming movies because they have been disappointed by low demand for products like "Star Wars" toys, which failed to generate big sales after the prequel to the initial Star Wars trilogy came out last year.
Some stores are trying to create a big trend. At Target, a discounter known for quirky and stylish products, executives have developed a line of products inspired by SpongeBob SquarePants, the Nickelodeon cartoon series centered around the underwater antics of an anthropomorphic sea sponge. The products, meant to appeal to the teenagers and 20-year-olds who have turned out to be fans of the show, include pajamas, T-shirts and stuffed versions of SpongeBob, the main character.
"They are certainly interested in bringing the teen audience into the store," said Cyma Zarghami, executive vice president and general manager for Nickelodeon. "Bringing in properties that have a cool factor to them helps drive that younger demographic."
Sally Mueller, senior marketing manager for Target, said that the SpongeBob line, which will be exclusive to Target among the discount stores until next spring, is expected to draw in younger boys and girls as well.
Some stores hope to entice consumers with new ways of shopping, like buying online and then picking up the products in nearby stores. Sears, Roebuck, whose sales at stores open at least a year fell 3 percent in July, is reorganizing its Sears.com Web site to accommodate shoppers who said they liked ordering from their computers, but disliked the hefty shipping charges.
Under the new system, they will be able to research and order items, ranging from washing machines and exercise equipment to baby blankets and power tools, and either pick them up in a Sears store or arrange for home delivery, said Dennis Honan, vice president and general manager for Sears Online.
But whether these enticements will draw many consumers to spend at a more robust pace remains a point of debate. While consumer spending has continued to grow, providing the main bulwark for the ailing economy, it has definitely softened. And Mr. Rigby, the Bain consultant, does not think consumer demand will pick up broadly until next year.
But "when, I really don't know," he added. "So much of it depends on whether consumers continue their spending patterns. If they do, it could be early in the year. If they get frightened by all of the layoffs, it could slip later in the year."

AustralianEconomy Shows Its Resiliency

BYLINE:  By BECKY GAYLORD 

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, Aug. 24 

 BODY:
While most industrial countries are slowing down or worrying about a slowdown, Australia is surprisingly buoyant, the latest economic statistics show. Analysts say the economy here will go on outperforming that of its trading partners for the rest of the year at least.
 Almost every sector is looking up. Home building is on the rise; consumer spending is strong; corporate profitability is improving. Exports are booming, making the trade deficit narrower than it has been in decades. 
 When Australia's economy contracted in the fourth quarter of 2000, its first down quarter in a decade, it proved to be a pause, not a downturn. The causes were mainly domestic, and fleeting, most notably a broad revamping of the country's tax system, including introduction of a general sales tax, which briefly depressed consumer confidence.
But this year, all systems have been go. The economy grew 1.1 percent in the first quarter of 2001 even though businesses were running down inventory in warehouses and store shelves, and economists expect second-quarter figures, due in mid-September, to be strong as well.
Australia's treasurer, Peter Costello, noted in a radio interview this week that Australia's economy had slackened from the buoyant conditions of the late 1990's. "But we're still growing, and we're growing faster than the United States and faster than Japan and faster than Europe," he said.
Two factors straight out of a macroeconomics textbook seem to have done the trick: A timely application of fiscal and monetary stimulus, and the good fortune to have a weak currency at a useful moment. Together they have "firewalled" Australia, insulating it to an extent from slumps in demand elsewhere, said Glenn Maguire, chief economist at Societe Generale's Australian unit.
The effects of interest rate cuts and election-year spending by the government of Prime Minister John Howard are easy to see in the construction industry, among the most vibrant here. Government grants for first-time home buyers helped produce a 30 percent surge in approvals for new homes in May and June. The Australian central bank expects other categories of construction to accelerate, too.
More broadly, consumer confidence has recovered from the dip last year and a new report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development found generally strong balance sheets and profitability in corporate Australia, especially among exporters, whose products gain a big edge from the low exchange rate. While the Australian dollar has rallied in recent weeks, trading at 53.46 United States cents today, it is down from a high of 59.27 United States cents a year ago. 
Economists say Australia is humming along now in part because its experience of the 1990's boom years was more subdued than in the United States, and did not produce any major imbalances that needed correcting. Neither business investment nor the stock market ran wild. "We didn't get to the same heady highs in the tech boom, so we didn't have to go to the depths" on the way down, said Craig James, chief economist at Commonwealth Securities.
To be sure, there are pockets of trouble, notably from offshore. And the cost advantage of a cheap currency will not be enough to sustain exporters if global economic growth turns really sluggish; miners and manufacturers will suffer if global demand contracts sharply. The main threats to Australia's growth prospects now come from abroad, the central bank reported. 
On the other hand, if global growth picks up as some forecasters hope, the conditions that are now sheltering Australia from the global slowdown could instead cause the economy to overheat, igniting inflation. For the moment, though, the danger seems remote. Those factors, Mr. James said of the stimulants, "are shoring us up, rather than pushing us into overdrive."

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Rose in July, CushioningIndustrial Slump 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 24 

 BODY:
Americans bought new homes at the fastest pace in four months in July, helping ease the damage to the economy from slumping orders for factory goods, the government said today.
 The Commerce Department reported a 4.9 percent rise in sales, to 950,000 houses at an annual pace, the most since March. The increase was the second consecutive one and surprised analysts, who had expected sales to drop. 
 A decrease of 0.6 percent in new orders for durable goods, also reported by the Commerce Department, came as no surprise. Still, the 2.6 percent drop the previous month was larger than expected and the level of orders excluding the volatile transportation category was the lowest since January 1997.
"Demand for housing products remains very strong," said Pete Correll, chief executive of the Georgia-Pacific Group, the second-biggest maker of forest products like paper, packaging, lumber and plywood. At the same time, "some of our businesses are the worst I've seen in 30 years."
Analysts expected new-home sales to fall 0.3 percent, to 919,000 houses at an annual rate, from June's previously reported pace of 922,000. New homes account for about 15 percent of all houses sold.
The median price of a new home fell to $168,300 from $172,400 the previous month.
A decline in borrowing costs has underpinned demand. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage dropped to 6.91 percent this week, the lowest in almost five months, according to Freddie Mac, the No. 2 buyer of mortgages in the United States.
As for factory orders, decreased spending on computers and semiconductors held them down in July.
Excluding motor vehicles and other transportation equipment, orders fell 1.4 percent in July after decreasing 2.1 percent in June. July orders other than for transportation equipment were valued at $129 billion, the lowest level since January 1997.
The July level of orders for all durable goods, at $182 billion, is the lowest since July 1998.
Orders for chips fell 26 percent in July and were down 56 percent from a year earlier. Orders for computers and related products fell 4.1 percent last month after falling 4.9 percent in June and were down 28 percent from July 2000.
Factory orders for transportation equipment rose 1.3 percent in July after falling 3.8 percent the previous month.

Stocks Surge After Cisco Says Business Is Stabilizing

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
Stocks soared yesterday with technology issues leading the way after the computer networking giant Cisco Systems said it saw signs that its business was stabilizing.
 Investors were also encouraged by a government report that said sales of new homes rose more than expected in July. 
 That sentiment contrasted to Wall Street's glum reaction on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates for the seventh time this year and reiterated the possibility of continued economic weakness. Stocks fell sharply that day but regained their footing the following day and ended the week modestly higher. 
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index climbed 73.83 points, or 4 percent, to close at 1,916.80 yesterday. For the week, it gained 2.7 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 194.02 points, or 1.9 percent, to 10,423.17, bringing its gains for the week to 1.8 percent.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 22.84 points, or 2 percent, to 1,184.93, bringing its gains for the week to nearly 2 percent.
Each of the three major gauges reached its highest level since July 12, the day Microsoft said its second-quarter revenue slightly exceeded analysts' estimates.
The rally in technology issues was touched off in part by Cisco, which jumped $1.49, to $18.25, after it said on Thursday that it was reorganizing into 11 technology groups -- its biggest makeover since 1997 -- to streamline and focus its marketing and engineering operations.
John T. Chambers, the chief executive of Cisco, also said that the company was on track to meet its projections for revenue in the first quarter.
"This was like manna from heaven for all of the tech companies," said Alfred E. Goldman, the chief market strategist at A. G. Edwards & Sons. "For them to say they're stabilizing their business, that was a big positive. It is the queen bee in the Internet sector."
Other telecommunications-networking stocks rose along with Cisco. Juniper Networks jumped $1.08, to $17.28; Alcatel picked up $1.45, to $17.50; Lucent Technologies gained 37 cents, to $7.02; and Nortel Networks rose 42 cents, to $7.07. 
The American Stock Exchange's networking stock index surged 17.43 points, or 6 percent, to 308.10.
JDS Uniphase, which makes fiber optic telecommunications equipment, climbed 64 cents, to $7.66.
As it has done for much of the week -- after an industry association said orders for chip-making equipment were stronger in July than Wall Street expected -- the semiconductor sector continued to show signs of strength. Linear Technology rose $2.82, to $42.43; Advanced Micro Devices gained 70 cents, to $15; Intel climbed $1.41, to $29.08; and Altera advanced $1.48, to $29.61. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange's semiconductor stock index rose 34.54 points, or 6.2 percent, to close at 594.91. 
Microsoft advanced $2.93, to $62.05, after the company announced that it had completed development of its Windows XP operating system, which is scheduled to go on sale on Oct. 25. In addition, a federal judge was assigned to decide the penalty Microsoft should face for violating antitrust laws. 
Other software makers gained as well. Veritas Software rose $4.17, to $35.49; PeopleSoft advanced $1.95, to $37.15; and Novell gained 44 cents, to $4.74.
I.B.M. led the Dow industrials higher, climbing $3.99, to $106.99.
Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing rose $2.26, to $110.61, and Home Depot gained $1.95, to $49.94. Boeing increased $1.46, to $53.63; Alcoa climbed $1.22, to $39.25; and Citigroup jumped $1.51, to $48.30. 
The Commerce Department provided investors with some unexpected good news about the economy, reporting that sales of new single-family homes rose 4.9 percent, to an annual rate of 950,000 in July.
Economists had expected new-home sales to fall 0.3 percent, to 919,000. July's increase was the fastest pace of growth since March 2000 and the biggest one-month jump since December 2000.
Orders for durable goods in July, meanwhile, met analysts' expectations. Orders for the goods -- relatively expensive, long-lasting items -- slipped 0.6 percent, to $182 billion, the Commerce Department said.
While analysts welcomed yesterday's rally, some cautioned that it might not be sustainable, since the last week in August is usually a slow one and the biggest economic news next week -- the first revision of the nation's gross domestic product for the second quarter -- is expected to show that the economy either experienced no growth or contracted in that period.
"We've all become skeptics of every rally that we've seen in this market," said Francis D. Gannon, senior equity portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management. "Next week is going to be a very quiet week in this market with not much happening. The fear right now is that number could be negative. Actually hearing or seeing it in print for the first time, psychologically, is going to be big for a lot of people."
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday. The 10-year Treasury note fell 11/32, to 100 21/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.92 percent from 4.87 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond dropped 18/32, to 98 31/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.45 percent from 5.41 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Arena Debate Complicates Governor Race In New Jersey 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Aug. 23 

 BODY:
It was perhaps inevitable that a plan to build a new arena in Newark for the New Jersey Devils and New Jersey Nets would run into fiscal, public policy and political obstructions. After all, the issue of government aiding wealthy sports team owners with lucrative deals and incentives has left a bad taste in many communities -- and this deal had to work for the whole state of New Jersey. 
 But few could have predicted just how complicated New Jersey's arena politics would become once it veered into the thicket of gubernatorial politics. 
 This week, Republican candidate Bret D. Schundler called for a statewide referendum on the proposed arena, saying that he feared it could end up costing taxpayers statewide should it run into financial problems. The arena's cost, now set at $385 million by the state and the YankeeNets, the teams' owner, would be financed by the state, the private developers and local government. 
The proposal to hold a referendum has led to a collision between Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco, a Republican, who sees an arena as a key legacy of his time in office, and Mr. Schundler, who has no love for Mr. DiFrancesco and considers opposition to the arena as a potent pocketbook issue in his race against the Democrat James E. McGreevey. 
Most analysts predicted that a statewide referendum on the plan would very likely doom it, as voters who oppose the project and see it as a vehicle for wealthy team owners to soak taxpayers would be more motivated to turn out than would those who were supportive or even neutral.
It has all upped the ante on the Newark arena deal, which has generally enjoyed bipartisan support thanks to Mr. DiFrancesco's efforts. 
It also means a sharper look at plans to replace the Continental Airlines Arena in the Meadowlands complex, where the teams now play, with a Disney-like family entertainment and sports complex, and at proposals for direct aid to a proposed sports complex at Rowan University in South Jersey that was being sought by Jack Collins, the Republican speaker of the Assembly, as the price of his support for the Newark arena.
Dennis E. Gale, executive director of the Joseph C. Cornwall Center for Metropolitan Studies at Rutgers University in Newark, said that until Mr. Schundler spoke this week, "no one has stepped forward to suggest that this is a bad, three-cornered deal for the state."
Others have expressed concern after Mr. Schundler's call for a referendum and his insistence that any project costs not be borne directly by state taxpayers. Assemblyman Richard H. Bagger, the Republican chairman of the Assembly appropriations committee, which is scheduled to consider the measure in a special session early next month, said that he, too, is now concerned about the proposal's fate and expects the committee to rigorously review all its aspects. 
"As things are added to this to get broader support, it makes it harder for some others to support it," Mr. Bagger said. "I am concerned about this and plan to have a watchful eye on each thing that is proposed."
It was against this backdrop that Mr. DiFrancesco, in a hurriedly arranged ceremony, took the offensive against Mr. Schundler and today signed into law a bill that would facilitate new development in Newark that would help generate the sales-tax revenue to allow the proposed arena to support itself.
Under Mr. DiFrancesco's original proposal for both the Newark arena and any replacement development at the Meadowlands that was approved by the Senate in June, the financing would be aided by tax-exempt bonds issued by a state-created entity. Those bonds -- worth $190 million in the case of the Newark arena -- would be repaid by revenue generated by an increased sales tax at the arena and in the adjacent area. 
To promote economic activity around the arena, Mr. DiFrancesco signed a bill today that would provide tax incentives for Atlantic City casinos to invest in entertainment, retail or housing development in urban areas throughout the state. That bill would immediately trigger a planned $20 million investment by the Tropicana Casino in a housing and retail complex here that city officials say will make downtown Newark a 24-hour city once again.
"All of this fits nicely with the Newark arena," said Mr. DiFrancesco in an interview after signing the bill into law. "Those who question whether the funding plan for the arena is realistic are just plain wrong. Even if nothing else happens in Newark, there will be enough generated by the arena to cover the bonds."
Mr. Schundler has insisted that he is not against the arena for Newark. He is, however, skeptical about the acting governor's insistence that it will not add to the state's debt burden and wants assurances that a bailout at the expense of state taxpayers would not be possible. At the very least, he said voters should be asked directly if they are willing to foot the bill if things don't work out. 
In pressing this point, Mr. Schundler has called upon his Democratic opponent, Mr. McGreevey, to explain his support of the arena proposal and show a similar concern for what voters may or may not want to do.
But David P. Rebovich, a political scientist at Rider University, said that Mr. Schundler has done more to discomfit Mr. DiFrancesco than he has to challenge Mr. McGreevey. So far, the Democratic candidate has simply reiterated his support for the arena and said that he accepts the acting governor's assurances that it will not be a burden on state taxpayers.
"It is the Republican establishment's goal to put the arena in Newark," Mr. Rebovich said, "and at a time when he should be shoring up support among fellow Republicans, Mr. Schundler has decided to continue the tack from the primary of engaging that establishment in a fight. At some point, Republicans are going to see him as endangering their legislative majorities in both houses." 
To be sure, there is some sentiment in the state against a Newark arena. 
An unpublished poll of New Jersey voters conducted in July by the state Republican Committee found that 65 percent of those polled disapproved of a new arena financed by sales-tax revenue generated at a new sports complex, said Stephen Salmore, a professor of political science at Fairleigh Dickinson University. He said that it would not be hard for a determined core of opposition to mobilize this sentiment.
Mr. Rebovich disagreed. He said that while the nation is still on the cusp of economic good times, the arena issue and a number of others being pressed by Mr. Schundler resonate intellectually but not practically with voters.
Meanwhile, Mr. Schundler has angered urban Democrats like Mayor Sharpe James of Newark, who supports Mr. McGreevey, and has left fellow Republicans in Essex County who support the arena, like County Executive James W. Treffinger, with little to say.
Mr. James, reached over ship-to-shore communications from a Caribbean cruise, accused Mr. Schundler of fiscal gimmickry in a number of programs while he was mayor of Jersey City and said that his call for a referendum "divides us, rich from poor, urban from suburban." He said he could not remember any more divisive moves by past gubernatorial candidates, either Democrats or Republicans.
Mr. Treffinger was in town, but he was repeatedly unavailable this week to comment on the issue.

HEADLINE: India-U.S. Fight on Basmati Rice Is Mostly Settled 

BYLINE:  By SARITHA RAI 

 BODY:
A Texas company's attempt to patent a type of basmati rice became a touchstone for anti-globalization protest in the 1990's. But the long-simmering issue was largely settled this week, when the United States granted a narrower patent to the company, Ricetec of Alvin, Tex.
 The United States originally granted the patent in 1997, touching a nerve in India, leading to a challenge by the Indian government and igniting demonstrations against what was termed a piracy of emerging nations' indigenous products. 
 After this week's decision, the Indian government said it saw no reason for further dispute. The new patent is limited to a few variants of the rice and will not hamper export of its own basmati product, the government concluded. 
Still, scientists in India are complaining about future problems while evaluating the impact, and opposition politicians are agitating for further action.
The protests in the late 1990's were led by Vandana Shiva, who called Ricetec's claim to basmati rice absurd. She termed the limited scope of the final patent largely a success. But, she warned, "the battle against Ricetec is just the beginning of India's battle against bio-piracy and theft of indigenous plant wealth."
For most Indians, the basmati controversy went beyond the economic impact of one product. Basmati, an aromatic rice used in virtually every Indian kitchen, is considered a national heritage. The long-grain rice, whose grains remain petal-soft and separate after cooking, grows in the Punjab region in the north, and across the border in Pakistan.
In 1997, the United States initially granted a broad basmati patent to Ricetec, which developed several strains of rice marketed under various names as similar to basmati. Of the 20 claims made by the company, most related to the rice plant, with others covering the grain and farming methods.
The American decision created an uproar as bitter Indians expressed frustration that successive governments had let India lose claim to basmati, which had never been trademarked. India and its rival Pakistan said they would fight the patent, calling it a threat to the economic survival of thousands of farmers in the subcontinent. More than 50,000 people demonstrated in front of the United Sates Embassy against the patent.
At the World Trade Organization conference in Seattle, India protested the agreement on trade-related intellectual property rights, which had led to a spate of patents for western companies, including for basmati rice. Another coalition denounced the basmati rice patent at the Seattle meeting, and called on W.T.O. members to accept that the rights of farmers and communities precede intellectual property rights.
At the Summit of the Americas in Quebec, activists protested against the prospect of intellectual property protection that would work to the advantage of multinationals involved in genetic engineering of agricultural products -- like basmati developed over hundreds of years -- at the expense of small farmers in developing countries.
For years, India largely ignored any claim or legal protection for growers and marketers of basmati. A bill has been introduced to recognize produce as belonging to a specific geographical area, but it is still pending before a panel of the Parliament. Given that basmati is not patented by geographic location even within India, the country's international patent appeal appears weak.
For over two decades "basmati" has been used in the United States to describe long-grain aromatic rice grown domestically. This usage went unchallenged by India, so much so that the patent claims were under the plea of "long usage" provided for in trade-related intellectual property rights.
The premium grain stacked up in American supermarkets under brand names like Calmati, which comes from California, and Texmati and Kasmati, which are marketed by Ricetec.
Indian basmati exporters dismiss these varieties as basmati imitations. The distinct aroma and the texture of basmati comes from the Indian soil irrigated by waters from the Himalayan rivers, they say.
India urged the United States Patent and Trade Office in April 2000 to re-examine certain Ricetec claims that India felt posed a threat to Indian basmati exports to the United States. In hundreds of pages of scientific evidence, India argued that its basmati varieties already had the characteristics claimed as unique by Ricetec.
India protested Ricetec's claim to the term basmati, and insisted that the appellation should be reserved for rice grown in a specific region in India. The argument is much like the one that has been used successfully to limit Champagne to France and Scotch whiskey to Scotland.
Ricetec subsequently withdrew some 15 claims. The American patent office just issued a patent on the claims dealing with three strains of the rice developed by the company.
While the government said it was satisfied, opposition politicians stalled proceedings in the Indian Parliament demanding that the government challenge the patent.
On Tuesday, the commerce minister, Digvijay Singh, tried to pacify members of Parliament, saying Ricetec had received only a varietal patent so it could sell its rice as a superior strain of basmati. India could also develop its own different strains of basmati, he said.
Ms. Shiva, the protester, saw the narrowing of the patent as a significant accomplishment. "What remains is a farmers' battle, because Ricetec's strains have been bred from traditional Indian and Pakistani basmati varieties," she said. Activists will continue to urge the government to pursue a trademark battle for the basmati name.
But scientists, including Dr. S. A. Siddiq of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, remain skeptical about India's ability to thwart piracy of traditional basmati strains. "India exports a million tons of basmati a year, and India is complacent because the Ricetec patent does not hinder that," Dr. Siddiq said.
The issue goes beyond mere protection of trade and export of the rice. "The basmati patent came so suddenly that India has just woken up to the threat to its traditional plant wealth," Dr. Siddiq said. "We have to get our laws in place." 
Ms. Shiva says that allowing multinational companies to patent indigenous produce and knowledge is a theft and has resulted in the revoking of a European patent for the traditional Indian neem tree. Patent fights are on for medicinal turmeric and tamarind.
"Granting exclusive patent rights amounts to stealing economic options of daily survival from the developing world," Ms. Shiva said.

HEADLINE: Alaska Governor Declares Part of Fishing Industry a Disaster 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: JUNEAU, Alaska, Aug. 24 

 BODY:
Gov. Tony Knowles declared western Alaska's commercial fishing sector an economic disaster today, a step toward seeking federal aid for the industry. 
 State officials compared the fishing industry -- suffering from dwindling numbers of salmon and low prices -- to the Midwestern farm failures that prompted federal crop supports to help growers weather poor markets. 
 "We think that would be appropriate in Alaska as well," said Lt. Gov. Fran Ulmer, who made the announcement for Governor Knowles, who was traveling to Canada.
Governor Knowles, a Democrat, plans to ask President Bush for federal "transition" money for coastal and inland communities from Bristol Bay to the Norton Sound, which rely heavily on commercial fishing. The region, which begins about 300 miles west of Anchorage, also includes the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers.
No dollar figure was provided.
Farm-raised salmon from countries like Chile and Norway have flooded international markets in recent years, driving down prices for wild salmon. Alaska commercial fishermen have received 40 cents a pound on salmon this year, down from a peak price of $2.11 in 1988.
At the same time, the sockeye salmon harvest in Bristol Bay has fallen to 14.2 million fish so far this year, half the number of 10 years ago. Federal efforts to conserve sea lion populations have limited the catch of some fish species.
The state will also seek more Bureau of Indian Affairs money for tribes in the region.
Commercial fishermen who met with the governor on Aug. 8 said they could not hold on much longer.
"There's a number of fishermen who didn't come back to fish this year," said Andy Golia, a Bristol Bay fisherman. "There's a lot of folks out there who depend solely on fishing. Jobs are very limited in the villages."

HEADLINE: Hughes Plans to Cut 10% of its Work Force 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: EL SEGUNDO, California, Aug. 24 

 BODY:
Hughes Electronics, owner of the DirecTV satellite-broadcasting service, said today that it would reduce its American work force as much as 10 percent to cut costs in the slow economy.
 Hughes, which employs about 7,900 workers in the United States, said it would take a charge in the third quarter for the job reductions. 
Hughes also repeated its forecast for $450 million to $500 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. 
 "It's a really sluggish economy and we're heavily into consumer businesses," said Richard Dore, a spokesman for the company. "DirecTV has not been getting the number of new subscribers it has in the past and we just need to get our costs under control." Hughes, a unit of General Motors that trades under a separate tracking stock, said on Thursday that it planned to eliminate an undisclosed number of jobs. Affected employees will be told by the end of next month. The bulk of the job cuts will come from DirecTV, Mr. Dore said.
Hughes will not know how big a charge it will take until it determines how many jobs will be cut, he said. 
Hughes, which is based in El Segundo, Calif., is discussing a possible sale to or merger with Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation or with the No. 2 satellite-TV operator, EchoStar Communications.

HEADLINE: Race for Bookkeeper in Chief: Dull but Significant 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
Anyone who runs for the office of New York City comptroller must dare to be dull. After all, few voters would hire, say, the Rev. Al Sharpton to be their accountant or Gov. Jesse Ventura to manage their pension funds.
 Which helps explain why the battle to be bookkeeper in chief has not exactly been exciting. In one corner, there is Herbert E. Berman, known universally as Herbie, the haimish head of the City Council's Finance Committee. And in the other corner is William C. Thompson Jr., known as Billy, the pleasant former president of the Board of Education. 
 Each is a longtime political insider with a head for figures. Each uses the word "utilize" a lot. And each agrees with the other on almost every issue. 
But the lack of drama does not mean that the comptroller's race is unimportant, especially now that the city's economy is beginning to skid and tax revenues look likely to shrink. The comptroller will have to be the bearer of any bad economic news to the new mayor, the new City Council and the public -- as well as paying the bills, borrowing the money and checking out the contracts signed by the city.
The comptroller "will be particularly important as the city heads into a very difficult period economically," said Harrison J. Goldin, who held that job during the city's fiscal crisis in the 1970's. He has not yet endorsed a candidate for his old job.
The city's fiscal watchdog, he said, "spends every waking professional moment thinking about the adequacy of city resources to meet needs and how to manage decreasing revenues in light of escalating expenses." (Comptrollers do tend to talk that way.)
To the extent that the candidates disagree on anything, it is on the outlook for the city's economy and budget. Mr. Thompson takes the gloomier view. "It's time to put up the caution flags," he said recently. "One of the greatest worries is that the next administration is going to have to turn around and give us budget reductions."
The timing of recent tax cuts was poor, Mr. Thompson said, and the city should have used its budget surpluses to pay down debt, rather than rolling them over to spend the next year. That is an implicit criticism of Mr. Berman, who as longtime chairman of the Finance Committee approved city budgets.
Mr. Berman, for his part, says his intimate knowledge of the city's finances is one of his strengths, and accuses his rival of spreading doom and gloom. "Why traumatize the economy and lay off people when that may not be necessary, as long as you are watchful and cautious?" Mr. Berman asked.
Besides, he has said, there will be plenty of time for city officials to react: "It will take two to three years for any economic downturn to impact the city of New York." 
The comptroller's race will be decided by the Sept. 11 primary; no Republican is running in the general election. 
Both Mr. Berman and Mr. Thompson get a bit hot under the collar when explaining why they did not discover one of the biggest fiscal problems of the year, that the school construction program is billions of dollars over budget.
Mr. Thompson says that when he left office in March, the overruns were still believed to be small; Mr. Berman says that school officials lied to him and the Council about the extent of the red ink.
But on most issues, their views are similar. Both say the city should pay its bills faster. Both contend that the comptroller's audits of city agencies and contracts should somehow attract more publicity.
Mr. Berman was originally unenthusiastic about Mr. Thompson's proposal to devote 1 percent of the city's $85 billion in pension funds to housing programs in the city. But recently he decided that he favors putting as much as is prudent into such programs as long as the investments are guaranteed. Mr. Thompson also wants to use 1 percent of the pension fund for economic development.
In fact, the city pension funds have already invested about $840 million in projects to add jobs and housing in the city, according to the office of the current city comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, who is running for mayor. 
And even in a city the size of New York, it can be hard to find investments that are sufficiently safe, have a high enough return, help the city economically and are not being done by the private sector, said Jon Lukomnik, who was deputy comptroller in charge of pension management and is now managing partner of Sinclair Capital.
"It's easy to do it badly, hard to do it well," he added, "but it is possible." 
Of course, the most obvious difference between the two candidates has nothing to do with the economy or the budget. It is race. Mr. Thompson is the only black running for citywide office this year; Mr. Berman is white.
Mr. Thompson said he expected race to be one factor that voters considered; Mr. Berman has been working to collect endorsements from black leaders, most notably from C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president. Mr. Thompson also has a long list of endorsements, starting with David N. Dinkins, the former mayor.
Skin color aside, the two men do look and sound very different. Mr. Thompson is dapper and favors hand-tailored suits; Mr. Berman's penchant for matching his tie to his shirt sometimes makes him look like a slightly rumpled Regis Philbin.
Mr. Thompson speaks slowly and calmly, often using the pronoun "one" instead of "you"; his signature phrase is "at the same point" -- rather than "on the other hand." Mr. Berman's words, delivered with a strong Brooklyn accent, tumble out so rapidly that they sometimes trip him up; he ends up saying things like, "Let me interrupt myself."
But in many ways, the candidates have a lot in common. Both are from Brooklyn: Mr. Berman from the southern part of the borough near Coney Island, Mr. Thompson from Bedford-Stuyvesant.
Both are wired into the political establishment, Mr. Berman through the Thomas Jefferson Democratic Club in Canarsie, Mr. Thompson through his family. (His father was a justice in the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court and a leader in the Brooklyn Democratic Party.)
And both have spent decades working for the government. Mr. Thompson, 48, worked as a staff aide to Frederick W. Richmond when he represented Brooklyn in Congress, and then spent a decade as deputy to Howard Golden, the borough president.
He was appointed to the school board in 1994, and was elected president in 1996 with the backing of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Since then, he has supported himself by working as a consultant.
He is also a director of Keyspan Energy and a director of a small private financial firm run by a Michael. W. Geffrard, a former deputy city comptroller who resigned in early 1995 during an investigation of his efforts to buy an apartment.
Mr. Berman, 67, was elected to the City Council in 1975 and became chairman of the Finance Committee in 1990. Until last year, he also maintained a private law practice.
One of the most influential councilmen, he is steeped in the ways of local government; his campaign office is just a pigeon flap from City Hall.
Indeed, if you want to get a rise out of the generally genial Mr. Berman, ask him whether he is a prisoner of the City Council or, to be blunt, a hack. Rapidly he reels off his accomplishments, his management of the budget, his involvement in programs to add police officers and push economic development outside of Manhattan.
"If that's a hack response," he says, "I guess I'd be proud of being a hack."
To irk Mr. Thompson, bring up the evidence that suggests to some critics that he does not pay enough attention to details to be a good comptroller. Like his failure to pay some taxes on time, which he says occurred while he was in the process of a difficult divorce almost two decades ago. "I don't think people are going to hold 1983 or 1982 against me," he said recently.
And he declined to discuss allegations raised by The Village Voice that he failed to take required licensing exams on time when he worked for a brokerage firm trying to drum up municipal-bond business with the city.
"I've gone over that," he said, adding that regulatory authorities had not been in contact with him since he left the brokerage business in 1996. A spokeswoman for Mr. Thompson said he followed the rules of his firm.
Meanwhile, as the election approaches, the comptroller candidates spend most of their days doing the two things that all candidates must do. One is dialing for dollars; as of Aug. 6, Mr. Berman had raised $1.5 million to Mr. Thompson's $1.1 million.
The other thing they are doing is showing up wherever potential voters might be found, trying to stir up a little interest in the battle of the bookkeepers. 
Mr. Thompson, for example, recently blew into the Elders Jubilee awards brunch in Harlem and was photographed with Raymond Thompson (no relation), who had just been awarded a rubber plant for reaching 102.
A few days before that, Mr. Berman campaigned at a senior center for Ukrainians on the Lower East Side with Councilwoman Margarita Lopez, who kept calling him Ber Herman rather than Herb Berman even as she sang his praises.

HEADLINE: Fox Trying to Give Mexico Bigger Role on World Stage 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Aug. 24 

 BODY:
When Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, came here this month, he declared that Mexico has become "a major political force in the world."
 A bit of British decorum? Perhaps. But President Vicente Fox is bent on raising Mexico's political profile, not just in the United States but everywhere, striving to bulk up his country's influence in world affairs and ending a history of self-imposed and sometimes haughty isolation. 
 He will strike that theme again when he returns to Washington for a formal state visit starting on Sept. 4, addressing a joint meeting of Congress, a platform rarely given foreign leaders.
"We have matured enough to go out in the world and take part in what is happening there," Mr. Fox has said, "regardless of whether we like it or not, whether or not it suits our interests." In the past, he said, "perhaps we were a bit isolated, because we were ashamed about not having reached full democracy." 
Now, said Mr. Fox's foreign minister, Jorge Castaneda, Mexico is ready "to punch above its weight." That is a boxer's boast, meaning that the world's 10th-biggest nation, 100 million strong, will contend with the globe's heavyweights, matching strengths and wits in the arenas of foreign policy, free trade and international investment.
"It is part of an effort to create a new perception of Mexico in the world," said Jeffrey Davidow, the United States ambassador to Mexico since 1998. "Mexicans have always felt that they were never appreciated on the world stage."
Plenty of skeptics say that this is all about image -- Mr. Fox's, not Mexico's -- and that all this diplomacy is too grandiose for a country with enormous domestic problems to confront. "The president's image is a marketing image that is cultivated through the mass media, a powerful image that plays well," said Francisco Labastida, the candidate of the long-governing party whom Mr. Fox defeated in the presidential race last year. "But I think that what Mexicans really need is a solution to real problems, not perception management."
Mexico today is much like the United States that President Franklin D. Roosevelt described in 1937, one of the darkest years of the Great Depression, with "one-third of a nation ill-housed, ill-clad and ill-nourished." Tens of millions of Mexicans lack decent schools, decent work and the hope of a decent future for their children. 
But President Fox figures that if he can build bridges beyond his borders, money will flow back in the form of foreign investment, helping to build roads and jobs and maybe, someday, a stronger nation. So he and his foreign minister have more than one reason to change the perception of Mexico. "Certainly, to the degree that Mexico is seen to be a world player, an actor on the world stage, it gets more attention, including on the world's markets," Ambassador Davidow said. "If they can convey the image of a stable democracy, they can get the foreign investment they need."
The past sense of shame and isolation that Mr. Fox mentioned underlay an ugly stereotype of Mexico that the ambassador said Mexicans had all too readily accepted.
"Fox and Castaneda are saying, 'Wait a minute, we're not that little guy in the serape and the sombrero -- we are a pretty important country,' " Mr. Davidow said. 
He agrees with that assessment, given Mexico's quarter-trillion-dollar annual commerce with the United States, its growing global trade links and Mr. Fox's stature as the first president to have defeated the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which controlled Mexico since 1929.
And Mexico's perception-management plan has a real foundation, Mr. Davidow said. "Mexico has opened up to the world," not only through trade and culture, he said, but with "the profound political change" evinced by Mr. Fox's election.
Nowhere is that change more evident than in Mexico's relations with the United States. The "special relationship" the United States once shared only with Britain now extends to Mexico. The two countries have plenty of arguments, but they are talking together as never before on issues that unite and divide them, Mr. Davidow said.
While Washington remains Mexico's most important ally and occasional adversary, Mexico's ambition goes far beyond friendship with the United States. That relationship alone will not win an invitation to the world's bargaining table. "If the rest of the world sees us as they have seen us, as a country only obsessed with the U.S., it'll be difficult to take us seriously," Mr. Castaneda said.
"Mexico is now perhaps able and willing to play a role on the world stage that it has not always been able to play in the past," he said. "A new world order is being constructed, and it'll be built with us or without us. We want to be a part of it."
President Fox spent much of his first nine months in power playing that part, traveling to Europe, Asia and the Americas, first and foremost drumming up money. 
Foreign direct investment in Mexico is expected to double this year to $27 billion, from $13 billion in 2000. That includes Citigroup's planned $12.5 billion purchase of Banamex, Mexico's second-biggest financial institution. Government economists attribute much of the growth to Mr. Fox's international campaign for investment and to a "democracy bonus" derived from his election.
Mr. Fox has also solicited votes from leaders like President Jiang Zemin of China for Mexico's bid to win a United Nations Security Council seat. The Council has five permanent members with veto power: the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia, the greatest nations left standing after World War II.
Other nations serve rotating two-year terms on the 15-member Council; Mexico wants one of those seats. It has not served on the Council in two decades but is likely to win a seat in October, Mr. Castaneda said.
The Security Council is in theory responsible for resolving the world's biggest crises -- war, genocide, poverty, injustice, inequality -- but in practice has often dissolved into a dissonant debating society.
Mr. Fox has proposed a range of international roles for Mexico to play on the Council and abroad. Migration, crime cartels, drug syndicates and trade disputes are among the top problems facing the world, and Mexico can offer a degree of hard-won experience in dealing with them.
Mr. Fox has said Mexico's soldiers, who have no known foreign enemies, may serve as international peacekeepers. He has offered up ideas, sometimes quixotic, on everything from settling the drug war in Colombia to reunifying the Koreas.
More concretely, he proposes new economic bridges throughout North and South America and across the oceans to Europe and Asia. He envisions the Western Hemisphere as becoming economically borderless, like the European Union, with Mexico in a seat of power second only to its neighbor to the north. Some of these visions come from Mr. Castaneda, whom newspapers here and abroad often caricature as a former leftist egghead with a big ego.
They sometimes fail to mention that his father served as foreign minister two decades before him, that his books have helped shape the intellectual history of Latin America and that his feisty diplomacy has won over skeptics like Senator Jesse Helms, the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who pronounced himself "mighty impressed" by Mr. Castaneda.
More important, he has had a big political influence on Mr. Fox, whose party stands to the right of center but whose ideas sometimes lean to the left.
The power that Mr. Castaneda says Mexico will use in the international community certainly is not military. And it cannot be monetary, given the economic cold wave gripping North America.
"It's soft power," he said.
This means using culture, not coercion; ideas, not smart bombs; attraction, not force, to win friends and influence enemies. It can address transnational threats -- ecological, economic, epidemic -- through cooperation, not confrontation. It is also a sort of self-promotion intended to convince other countries that Mexico's interests are their own.
Soft power may not always get hard results. But it may prove useful for Mexico as it sets out to change its image in the world, if not to change the world. "You don't set the world's agenda," Mr. Castaneda said. "What role you play, whether you're forced to play roles, depends on the course of events."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Bush Comments on Military and Money 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's news conference yesterday in Crawford, Tex., where he introduced Gen. Richard B. Myers as his nominee for chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as recorded by Federal News Service Inc.:

Opening Statement
 When I took the oath of office and assumed the title of commander in chief, our military faced significant challenges. I'm proud to report that thanks to the leadership of Secretary of Defense Don Rumsfeld, the work of -- and the work of our military and civilian leaders, as well as the cooperation of the United States Congress, we're making progress. We've increased pay for our servicemen and women and funded improved military housing and medical benefits. I've asked Congress to provide our military an increase of $39 billion over the original 2001 appropriations. That'll be the largest increase in military spending since Ronald Reagan was the commander in chief. It's money -- this is our money our military needs, and money our budget allows. . . . 
 Today I name a new chairman of the Joint Chiefs, one of the most important appointments a president can make. This appointment is especially so because it comes at a time when we need great leadership. Secretary Rumsfeld and I thought long and hard about this important choice, and we enthusiastically agree that the right man to preserve the best traditions of our armed forces while challenging them to innovate to meet the threats of the future is Gen. Richard B. Myers. General Myers is a man of steady resolve and determined leadership. His is a skilled and steady hand. He is someone who understands that the strengths of America's armed forces are our people and our technological superiority, and we must invest in both.
I'm also pleased to announce that Gen. Pete Pace, commander of Southcom, will serve as vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs. General Pace is a proud marine and represents a new generation of leadership and military thinking.

Questions and Answers

Q. How realistic is it for you to expect Congress to move forward with your defense priorities when there's so little money in the budget outside of Social Security? And is it perhaps naive to expect Congress to just roll over and abandon their priorities?

A. Well, I would hope that a Congressional priority is strong national defense. And it'll be very interesting to kind of get a feel for the Congressional priorities this fall. And one of the early tests will be to see whether or not the leadership will give us a defense number early in the process. And that's what I've asked the Congress to do. I did so in Independence, Mo. I repeat it today -- that if there -- if in -- and we hear a dialogue on the Hill about the importance of national defense. If that's the case, give us a number at the beginning of the process, not at the end. And my point is going to be, to the United States Congress and their constituents, that national defense ought to be a funding priority and I expect it to be; I expect it to be in '01, '02 and '03.

Q. So you're using a veto threat as a way of bringing a hard line in ----

A. Well, my first -- wait. You put the word "veto" in my mouth. I have said that I will work for fiscal sanity in Washington. And one way for a president to affect the fiscal condition of our government is to express displeasure when certain budgets get busted. And so far, we haven't had that. And that's why I praised Senator Byrd and Congressman Young. We've had a couple of supplementals, and as the Washington-watchers will tell you, the supplementals have been restrained, they've been within the budget guidelines, and I appreciate that very much. There's been some fiscal sanity thus far. . . .

Q. The administration's budget projections show these fairly thin surpluses outside of Social Security for the next several years. And the budget that you've been discussing, of course, does not include missile defense, does not include a number of the conventional weapons transformations that your team even produced here today is going to be working on. Would it be reasonable to dip into Social Security and into the Social Security funds to pay for missile defense and to pay for the military transformation? Or is there any other contingency you can imagine that would make it worthwhile to go into the Social Security funds?

A. I've said the only reason we should use Social Security funds is in case of an economic recession or war. Secondly, our budget does call for missile defense expenditures. If I'm not mistaken, I think it's to the tune of $8 billion. And you might recall as we left town, there were some members of the United States Congress saying that that was way too much expenditure on a missile defense program, and they would, what, like to divert that money to other, other programs, some within the defense budget, some with outside -- outside the defense budget. And so we do -- we do make -- and we've also increased research and development by a significant amount of money. But I think the thing that's important to know is that Secretary Rumsfeld is taking a long look, addressing, assessing all the threats, or the perceived threats that could face our country, and how we address those threats. . . .
And so, one of the things you'll hear us talk about is the need to develop an effective missile defense system, and we do have money in the budget for that. And there's going to be an interesting dialogue over whether it's too much. We're going to stand our ground, and say the $8 billion -- I believe it's $8 billion, if I'm not mistaken -- is the right amount of money. And, you'll see, Dave, as well, as you look at other parts of the defense budget request, particularly the '02, and then the add-on to '03, which we haven't laid out yet. There's a lot of money for research and development, which is absolutely necessary, and one of the reasons Dick Myers is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs nominee is because he's had a lot of experience in space, for example. That's an area that we need to explore and know more about. . . .

Q. You've talked about limits on spending. If your wish came true that the federal budget is again awash in money, what would your priorities be?

A. Education, defense and making sure the taxpayers had ample money to make choices for themselves. You know, I think one of the things we've got to recognize is that our government should fund priorities, but we always got to remember where the money came from. I can't tell you how proud I am to be traveling around the country and people say, "Thanks for the $600." Now there are some cynics who say 600 doesn't mean anything to a working family in America. That's not what I hear. I hear it means a lot to people.

Seasoned Trial Court Judge Assigned to Microsoft Case
The government's landmark antitrust case against Microsoft was assigned to Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, a seasoned trial court judge and a Clinton appointee to the federal bench, to determine how to penalize the company for abusing its monopoly power.
 The selection of Judge Kollar-Kotelly to replace Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson marks an important point in the antitrust case. Two months ago, an appeals court removed Judge Jackson, but upheld many of his April 2000 findings that Microsoft had repeatedly violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. Shares of Microsoft rose $2.93, to $62.05. Page A1. 

The Case of the Missing Cattle
Farmers, investors and bankers in several Midwestern states, as well as a few intrigued law enforcement officials in Missouri are interested in the whereabouts of 200,000 head of cattle. If the missing cattle do not turn up soon, it may mean that up to $125 million was spent on phantom livestock. A1.

New-Home Sales Ease Falling Orders
Americans bought new homes at the fastest pace in four months in July, with sales rising 4.9 percent, helping ease the damage to the economy from slumping orders for factory goods, which dropped 0.6 percent. C4.

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT ASSERTS SHRUNKEN SURPLUS MAY CURB CONGRESS 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex., Aug. 24 

 BODY:
President Bush said today that there was a benefit to the government's fast-dwindling surplus, declaring that it will create "a fiscal straitjacket for Congress." He said that was "incredibly positive news" because it would halt the growth of the federal government.
 In a 45-minute news conference in a community hall next to an RV park here, Mr. Bush avoided specific answers to several questions about how he would find the money for his next big initiatives, from missile defense, to overhauling the military, to reforming Medicaid, without dipping into Social Security surpluses that both parties have declared off limits. And he made it clear he would not re-think his tax cut, saying, "I can't tell you how proud I am to be traveling around the country and people say, 'Thanks for the $600.' " Excerpts, Page A10. 
 At the same time, Mr. Bush talked in some detail about the economic slowdown, which he called a "correction," and left open the possibility that he might dip into the Social Security money if a further economic stimulus was needed.
"I've said that the only reason we should use Social Security funds is in the case of an economic recession or war," Mr. Bush said.
It will be a long while before there is any certainty about whether the economy has bottomed out or is headed toward a recession. In the meantime, Mr. Bush said that he was intent on getting Congress to follow his spending priorities, passing large increases for the military and for education and putting everything else on hold.
"If Congress goes off on a spending spree in other areas, it's going to create a competition for defense dollars," he said, adding later, "and there's going to be a battle."
Mr. Bush's news conference was his first extended session with reporters since arriving at his ranch here early this month. By putting down a strong claim for military spending and also by hinting, even in a vague way, that Social Security might not be untouchable, Mr. Bush seemed to be pulling together the strands of an emerging strategy for what could be difficult fiscal times ahead. 
He spent much of the session on military issues, including formally announcing the nomination of Gen. Richard B. Myers to serve as the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Man in the News, Page A10. 
A fighter pilot during the Vietnam War, General Myers is a soft-spoken but influential figure in the Pentagon, who will now be thrown into the middle of the battles to find the billions of dollars it will take to build even a modest missile defense system. Mr. Bush said today that he chose the Air Force general in part for his expertise from running the United States Space Command in Colorado. But General Myers, a Kansas native, is also deeply familiar with China's rise as a military power and North Korea's nuclear capability, both subjects that occupied him in the mid-1990's when he commanded American forces in Japan.
"This is going to be great," General Myers told the president today.
Another four-star general, Peter Pace of the Marines, who currently runs the Southern command covering Latin America and the Caribbean, will take General Myers's current post as vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs. Neither is expected to encounter difficulties during confirmation hearings in the Senate. 
Mr. Bush appeared more relaxed today than at any news conference during his seven months in the presidency. Perhaps it was the informality of the atmosphere: a community hall that had clearly suffered some neglect over the years in this one-stoplight town. Perhaps it was the scant attendance: there were barely enough people to fill two rows of folding chairs. 
So Mr. Bush bantered about dragging reporters into the 100-degree heat of his adopted Texas town, and insisted that even if politics were getting nasty again in Washington, "It's a great tone here in Crawford."
"You know what they're interested in?" he asked reporters, talking about his neighbors here. "Their families, whether it's going to rain, interested in the price of fuel, they're worried about insurance rates -- they're not too bad in Texas."
"They're not worried about the partisan squabbling that has kind of sullied the Washington scene at times," Mr. Bush said. 
In his comments today, and in asides to elementary school students and reporters here in Crawford on Thursday, Mr. Bush appeared to be laying out his strategy for autumn.At its simplest, it boils down to this: Mr. Bush will battle for increased spending on the military and education, and he will argue that every other proposal must be decided after the military budget is set. In effect, this would preserve Mr. Bush's priorities while making others appear as if their initiatives are responsible for dipping into the Social Security surplus.
Mr. Bush and his advisers, many of whom were in Texas today for a review of military transformation with Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and General Myers, know full well that both Democrats and Republicans will object. The Democrats say there is nothing sacred about the military budget, and question many of Mr. Bush's increases there. The Republicans passed a budget resolution in the spring that includes a far more generous prescription drug benefit for the elderly than Mr. Bush proposes. 
If any of those programs were passed by Congress and signed by Mr. Bush, they would dip into the Social Security surplus unless they were paid for by cuts in other programs. But Mr. Bush made no mention today of the differences within his own party, and he sidestepped the question of how he would find the money to pay for missile defense and the transformation of the military so that a new generation of weapons can be introduced.
He noted that the budget does have money for missile defense research, about $8 billion. But military experts note that it is only seed money for testing and that any major program, of the kind envisioned by his Pentagon planners, would cost multiples of that amount. 
Mr. Bush did talk openly about the economic downturn in the United States, saying, "We had an anemic 1 percent growth over the last 12 months." He added that there was "no question the economy's slowed down." But he insisted that as tax rebate checks got into the hands of consumers next month, and as interest rate cuts set in, the economy would bounce back.
In an age of suddenly scarce resources, though, he insisted that Congress must adjust its spending attitudes. "The surest way to make sure that the recovery doesn't happen in a meaningful period of time or a reasonable period of time is to overspend," Mr. Bush said. He said his job was to "make sure we keep fiscal sanity in the budget."
Mr. Bush spoke with the air of a man who knew he was headed back into the battle. He has only six days left at his ranch here before returning to Washington on Thursday.

St. Petersburg and the Rise
of Modern Russia.
By W. Bruce Lincoln.
Illustrated. 419 pp. New York:
Basic Books. $35.
 St. Petersburg, Petrograd, Leningrad, St. Petersburg -- each successive name suggests its own era in the history of what the Russians still regard, alongside Moscow, as their second capital. When the time came to rename the city after the end of the regime that Lenin had founded, the most logical choice would have been Petrograd -- the Russified form of "Peter's City" that it bore from 1914 to 1924, with connotations of democratic and revolutionary hope. But Boris Yeltsin, with the semi-czarist instincts of a former Communist apparatchik, preferred the older name.
During the two centuries between the city's founding in 1703 and the revolution of 1917, St. Petersburg symbolized the schizophrenia that Peter the Great injected into Russia's culture. Moscow, home of the Slavophiles, looked inward. St. Petersburg, center of the Westernizers, faced outward: It was, W. Bruce Lincoln writes here, "at one and the same time Russia and not Russia. . . . It represents both the best of Russia's efforts to borrow from the West and a vision of what Russia can become." 
Lincoln was distinguished research professor of Russian history at Northern Illinois University up to his untimely death last year, just after completing "Sunlight at Midnight." This final work, following a long series of colorful histories of Russia and its rulers, is a fitting testament to his literary skill, as he weaves social and political history together with the development of the architectural environment that framed the human story of St. Petersburg. No other world city, save possibly Paris, has such a close tie between its architecture and its history. The one drawback here is the lack of good maps. As a result, one really has to have been to St. Petersburg to appreciate this account fully.
Lincoln focuses on the events of the 18th and 19th centuries, when St. Petersburg was taking shape. He evokes vividly the unconscionable gulf between the life of the city's imperial and aristocratic patrons of the arts, on the one hand, and, on the other, the misery of the masses who were drawn in to work on the wondrous construction projects and then in the growing new industries. One sees the recurring Russian instinct for pursuing noble aspirations by expending human resources regardless of the cost.
Lincoln is less interested in the postrevolutionary era. Lenin's removal of the Russian government from what was then Petrograd to Moscow in March 1918, impelled by a feared German offensive, proved to be a decisive inward turn for Russia. Nevertheless, Petrograd -- later Leningrad -- endeavored to keep its identity as a Westernizing outpost. Its Communist leaders, from Grigory Zinoviev in the 1920's to Andrei Zhdanov in the 1940's, tried to uphold the ideal of international revolution, while its intellectual figures, from Aleksandr Blok to Anna Akhmatova, tried to sustain the city's cultural heritage and its place in the international avant-garde. What does command Lincoln's attention in this era is the German siege of World War II, which he recounts in all its heroism and horror.
ST. PETERSBURG began to come into its own once again after 1991. Resuming under Yeltsin its role as Russia's window on the West, it became a center of Western-style reform notions. From the city has come Vladimir Putin, the first native Petersburger to lead Russia since the time of the czars, with his entourage of free-market gurus and secret police agents. Unortunately, the city itself has not done well under the post-Communist dispensation. It has become the epicenter of Russian crime and corruption, and it has suffered an appalling collapse in the maintenance of its architectural and artistic heritage. 
Lincoln wonders, "Can St. Petersburg recover from the trauma of the Soviet experience?" One wonders now whether it can recover from the trauma of the post-Soviet experience.

Signs the Government Requires

 BODY:
 Q -- Our building manager recently sent our board a roundup of the myriad signs that must be posted in our six-story co-op. Our intimate building, which has done fine for 75 years without these notices, is beginning to resemble a hotel with all this signage. Is there no distinction between a 24-unit building and a large apartment building regarding these signs? . . . Susan J. Trammell, Manhattan.

A -- James G. Samson, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that under current federal, state and New York City law, as many as 32 different signs may have to be posted in residential multiple dwellings in the city.
 "New York City alone requires as many as 20 different signs," Mr. Samson said, explaining that different regulations require different signs to be posted at different locations. "Some are near the front door, some are in the lobby, some are near the mailboxes and some are in the hallways and landings," he said.
In fact, he said, a recent signage requirement imposed by the city makes landlords responsible for ensuring that a fire emergency instruction placard is affixed on the inside entrance door of every apartment in a multiple dwelling.
He said the reason the managing agent is making the board aware of the requirements is probably because a building owner -- or a co-op or condominium association -- can be fined for failing to post a required sign. "Penalties can range anywhere from $10 for failure to post the janitor's residence sign to several thousand dollars a day for failure to display a petroleum bulk storage registration certificate" near the heating-oil tank, he said, adding that the city's Administrative Code does not provide a way for smaller multiple dwellings to get a waiver or exemption. "And since approaching state and federal agencies for an exemption will likely be time consuming and probably futile," he said, "compliance is usually a lot easier."

Landlord Billing For Uncollected Rent

Q -- I live in a 60-unit apartment house and am a rent-stabilized tenant. Several years ago, several tenants filed a rent-reduction claim against our landlord because there were several violations in the building. After many hearings and appeals, the Division of Housing and Community Renewal ultimately reduced our rent. Since that time the landlord has accepted my reduced rent checks and renewed my lease. However, he has continued to bill me for what the rent would have been if there hadn't been a reduction. He now shows a past-due rent of over $13,000. My question is, when I die is my estate responsible for this back rent? . . . Sylvia Abrams, Brooklyn.

A -- Lucas A. Ferrara, a Manhattan lawyer who is an editor of the Landlord-Tenant Practice Reporter, a newsletter for lawyers, said that based on the information provided, the landlord would not be able to collect the so-called past-due rent.
Mr. Ferrara said that when a landlord fails to provide essential or required services to a rent-regulated tenant, the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal has the power to issue an order reducing the tenant's rent. After the order is issued, he said, the landlord cannot collect future rent increases until the agency restores the rent and any allowable increases. 
Since the landlord has renewed the lease while continuing to accept the letter writer's reduced rent payments, he said, it is unlikely that the agency has issued an order restoring the original rent and increases. 
"'It appears the tenant is being billed for the rent differential as if no reduction order has been in place," he said. "And if that's the case, those moneys are not recoverable either from the tenant or her estate." Even if the state agency restores the previous rent, he said, it is not retroactive, and the amount the landlord considers past due is not recoverable.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
Museums in a Quandary: Where Are the Ideals?

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 

 BODY:
NOT long ago, a genial, soft-spoken museum curator, who will remain anonymous for obvious reasons, was talking over lunch about the National Museum in Nairobi. Corrupt officials in Kenya, he said, had used the museum to seize private property, asserting that the lands held archaeological remains that belonged in the museum; then the officials or their cronies built houses for themselves or used the property for commercial development.
 Ramon Lerma was listening to this and described his situation working as an assistant curator at a small museum of modern Filipino art in Quezon City, the Ateneo Art Gallery, the first museum of modern art in the Philippines. His problem is raising money in a country where, he said, 70 percent of the population barely scrape together one meal a day. He wondered, What is the argument for raising money for art as opposed to food? 
 The occasion was a meeting in Austria of about 70 people, mostly curators and museum directors, from nearly 35 countries. The topic: museums in the 21st century. The organization: a think tank called the Salzburg Seminar, founded by Harvardians during the cold war, no doubt with help from the C.I.A., but now run independently, mostly for political and economic conferences but occasionally for cultural discussions. It is housed at the paradisiacal Schloss Leopoldskron, the estate owned by Max Reinhardt, the Austrian theater director and founder of the Salzburg Festival. More famously, the schloss is where "The Sound of Music" was filmed.
Museums, it was presumed by everybody there, have never been more important, and in a way that is true. They haven't. But they are also suffering an identity crisis, and not just because "museum," like "school" or "corporation," now encompasses a universe of places so different in size, budget and orientation that it's hard to say what links them. The usual phrase today is secular cathedral: they have become cathedrals for a secular culture, storehouses of collective values and diverse histories, places where increasingly we seem to want to spend our free time and thrash out big issues (the religious debate over "Sensation" in Brooklyn, the atomic bomb argument at the Smithsonian, multiculturalism, taxes and public morality). We put our faith in few traditional institutions these days, but the museum is still one of them.
Its purview extends beyond objects to ideas. The Tenement Museum in New York, the Robben Island Museum in South Africa, the Holocaust Museum in Washington, the Jewish Museum in Berlin: it hardly matters what they contain, if anything. They are our new theaters of conscience, memorials to suffering, choreographed places of ritual genuflection, where we go to contemplate our fallibility and maybe even weep a little while admiring the architecture. They offer packaged units of morality, unimpeachable and guiltlessly entertaining. They presume to bring us together, physically and spiritually.
Togetherness is a fresh concept in the museum world. Museums were conceived in the 19th century as places to improve public taste, to educate the middle classes. Self-improvement and commerce went hand in hand in the early history of museums, especially in the United States and Britain. According to the liberal Victorian social ideal, museums cultivated good citizens who would then share in the general prosperity of a properly functioning democracy. Enlightened citizens became acquisitive participants in a flush economy. Museums served the public good, in other words, which meant they were good for society and, in the process, good for business.
But they were never places of consensus. When the Smithsonian got itself in hot water a few years ago over an exhibition about the Enola Gay, it faced a new situation: a public divided over the atomic bomb, with the museum expected to mediate the debate. The old top-down view of museums, whereby curators and scholars dictated to a passive audience through tendentious displays, had somehow given way to the notion of a democratized museum. What the Smithsonian presented in its exhibitions was now supposed to represent a consensus view, an absurdity but a widespread presumption.
When people talk today about democratized museums, they don't just mean more popular shows and more access to the collections. They mean that museums are expected to practice collective bargaining over civic priorities -- or else they must face the consequences. Brooklyn, having failed to do so with "Sensation," suffered, if not at the box office then in terms of public relations, first for offending some Roman Catholics, then for seeming to pander to a rich collector who owned the works. Never mind that other museums pander all the time. Marc Pachter, director of the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, pointed out at the seminar how people complain about "Sensation" and about history at the Smithsonian but, being quixotic, not about natural history museums, where biodiversity, natural selection and the greenhouse effect are taken for granted. Still, the expectation of public accountability prevails.
Democratization is what the political left long argued for at museums: down with elitism, question authority. Cultural theorists like Pierre Bourdieu and Michel Foucault, starting in the 1960's, supported this argument, casting doubts on the benevolence of a range of institutions previously viewed as benign and progressive: hospitals, universities and libraries as well as museums. These institutions came to be viewed as disciplinary enforcers in class and race wars.
This was an especially big switch for museums. As Neil Harris, an American historian of museums, wrote in the journal Daedalus not long ago: "The exaggerated tirades of an earlier day, created by those who persistently labeled museums morgues, mausoleums and charnel houses, institutions dead to the world around them," gave way to "assignments of responsibility for sustaining the class structure, spreading racism and protecting the canonized narratives of Western civilization."
Sensitive to these new, almost flattering attacks, museums felt compelled to deconstruct some of their authority by acknowledging the fallibility of their own curatorial decisions -- that should have been obvious to everyone anyway -- and gradually authority became equivocal.
Is it any wonder, by the way, that museums therefore came to view architecture as a solution to their problems? Architects naturally wanted to build the new cathedrals, but museums wanted architects too, partly because just about the only aspect of the museum over which institutional authority had not yet totally eroded was the outside of the building. The popularity of the Tate Modern last year proved that the impact of spectacular architecture can pretty much drown out even the most substantial complaints about exhibitions and collections. Bilbao has become the ultimate dream of museum entrepreneurs. You don't even need a collection. You can borrow one. The goals are now civic luster and economic improvement -- decent goals but, aside from the aesthetics of the building itself, not artistic ones. The hollow shell has become an operative metaphor for newly skewed priorities.
In the way that politics frequently works, left and right have met around these issues of populism and spectacle. As usual, both sides claimed to speak for the people, while condescending to them. Conservatives argued that museums ought to support themselves and not beg from taxpayers, unless museums could be more demonstrably responsive, and responsible, to the broadest public. It was de facto populism, not leftist populism, with the left's stress on diversity, and it resulted in the equivalent of Grandma Moses exhibitions to cater to so-called popular taste and American values. If it didn't mean more of those shows, it meant market-driven initiatives: more anodyne Impressionism extravaganzas, displays about Jacqueline Onassis at the Metropolitan, and Steve Wynn's profitable art gallery in the lobby of his Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas, a marketing coup, which set the stage for the Guggenheim and Hermitage's opening a joint museum across the strip at the Venetian Hotel in October.
And now the National Museum of American History, which is part of the Smithsonian, has accepted $38 million for a program to honor notable Americans, paid by a businesswoman named Catherine Reynolds, who says she fancies herself the new Brooke Astor and is connected to an organization called the American Academy of Achievement. The plan is that a committee -- mostly chosen by Mrs. Reynolds and including George Lucas, Mike Wallace and herself, she suggested -- will vet recommendations for honorees, with the museum director having the final decision. Mrs. Reynolds mentioned Oprah Winfrey, Martha Stewart and Dorothy Hamill as well as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. among the people she pictured honoring, causing Smithsonian curators to write to the Smithsonian's board: "Will the Smithsonian Institution actually allow private funders to rent space in a public museum for the expression of private interests and personal views?"
But what else would you expect? As Mr. Harris put it: "Museum directors could legitimately claim bewilderment at being told, simultaneously, to avoid the public trough and stand on their own two feet, but not to resemble too closely the commercial world that, after all, had to show a profit."
The new populism has increased the mythology of attendance. How do museums prove their worthiness to corporate and government sponsors today? By drawing more people through the turnstiles, and more kinds of people. Those with the purse strings demand it. Peter Weibl, the director of a museum in Graz, Austria, specializing in electronic art, talked at the seminar about the illogic of this concept. Attendance is considered a measure of public service by funders, government funders especially, who, without thinking the issue through, simply figure that the more people who visit museums, the more public-minded the museums must be, never mind that attendance has nothing necessarily to do with enlightenment. Museums, having therefore been instructed that success is to be measured by attendance, then organize Monet and van Gogh shows, which guarantee big box-office returns, so they can declare themselves successful. The tautology is absurd.
The question should not be how many people visit museums but how valuable are their visits. Attendance at a museum is different from attendance at a ballpark or a movie. Partly the difference is that baseball and Hollywood are for-profit businesses while museums are educational institutions, although the more people the merrier at museums; to borrow a useful turn of phrase, museums are equal-opportunity elitists. But museums have not yet learned how to measure precisely the quality of the experience they offer -- what their visitors are getting out of their visits aside from gifts in the gift shop and sandwiches in the cafeteria. The Getty Trust sponsored some expensive interviews in the 1990's, asking what visitors liked about museums, which displays they found instructive, what kinds of promotion worked better than others. But those were preliminary studies. Time and again in Salzburg, whenever curators and directors talked about the need to boost attendance, which was almost all the time, the question that hung in the air was, money aside, to what end?
It was chastening to be reminded that not everyone has the luxury to fret about Giorgio Armani's gowns at the Guggenheim or an attention-craving Briton adorning the Virgin Mary with elephant dung or a $38 million gift for a hall of fame or the downside of five million people visiting the Tate. Money and civic responsibility, like everything else in life, are matters of perspective. Mr. Lerma's Philippine museum barely scrapes by. Dollar-starved museums in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere today quietly try to charge big money to Western museums who want to borrow art, breaking the old gentlemen's agreement that museums share collections for the betterment of scholarship and the public good. From their perspective it is about maximizing assets (and who can blame them?). To Western museums, it's extortion. Either way, it's a slippery slope. Fewer serious exhibitions, which can't hope to recoup their costs. More exhibitions based on the bottom line.
AND depending on where you come from, government money for museums is a public virtue or a burden. If you are from certain countries in South America, where new governments coming into power toss out the people who worked in museums under the previous administration, insuring perpetual chaos, private money holds out the promise of independence and stability. If you are Lam Yui Tong, the principal assistant secretary of culture in Hong Kong, you went to the seminar to consult about your plan to cut back on your own local government's support for your own museums, because you are searching for means of leverage over curators who don't even spend all the money you give them, and you hope that a strategy of denial may compel more streamlined and forward-looking operations. It was revealing that at the seminar, tutorials in management and finance were packed while almost nobody signed up for a session about ethics, which had to be canceled.
So what defines a museum now? Museums are at a crossroads and need to decide which way they are going. They don't know whether they are more like universities or Disneyland, and lurch from one to the other. 
Their priorities need restating. They are neither universities nor Disneyland. Are museums places to show things people didn't know they wanted or may not think they want to see? Yes, but they are also entertainment palaces. This is fine. Culture is entertainment, partly, and museums betray the public and their purpose if they aren't seriously amusing.
The museum is a safe place, too, a virtue that shouldn't be underestimated. Museums are havens and gathering spots in an increasingly diffuse urban culture, heirs to the old arcades of Paris, which were spectacles of iron, marble and glass in a society of flaneurs and voracious desire, places to browse, flirt and kill time. Critics who lament the proliferating cafes and shops in museums today are right only up to a point because they fail to recognize the social beauty of what the essayist Walter Benjamin, recalling the arcades, called "dream houses of the collective." Basic to flanerie, he added, was "the idea that the fruits of idleness are more precious than the fruits of labor." Go to the Met today and you'll see what he meant.
But beyond leisure and entertainment, our perception of a museum, and its moral value, still has to do with our desire for sacred space, even if we are reluctant to put it that way. Museums exist to offer us something that we can't find anywhere else: an encounter, whether with an object or idea (or even with something on the Internet if we consider virtual museums) -- an encounter we deem true and authentic in a place respectful of this private transaction. Otherwise, museums are just fancy storage facilities and gift shops.
This sounds obvious but evidently isn't. It entails less equivocation, less democracy, less blurring of the line between commerce and content, and a reassertion of authority on the part of museums, which must restate their convictions about esoteric beauty, the ethical import of aesthetics and the special, if intangible, power of the things they possess. The goal is not for every museum to become another Frick. It is to use the excellent new tools available -- technological, didactic -- to become more effective and more affecting places. Between the university and Disneyland is not a morass of compromise but a realm of rational entertainment, a concept harking back to the Enlightenment. Rational entertainment requires a standard of quality on the part of museums. Quality has become a dirty word, an antidemocratic concept, according to museum critics, but quality, and the ability to explain it eloquently, are still what separate museums from shopping malls. Museums need to reclaim the idea of quality because it is what people want when they go to museums: to be told what they should value, so that they can then decide for themselves whether or not to agree -- which is how a free democracy really works. Standards change, values evolve, but without them at any given moment, we are lost.
Benjamin, a genius, was wrong about one thing: the age of reproduction has not diminished the aura of the original object as he predicted. The aura has increased. More people than ever are going to museums to find the singular object or experience in a cookie-cutter civilization.
Call it wonderment. Museums grew out of the old wonder cabinets. The roots are still deep. This has nothing to do with populism or consensus-building or taxes or corporate-style branding of cultural conglomerates and everything to do with curiosity, which is what makes us human. It is a curiosity that serves the pleasures of the spirit. The deepest curiosity. We go to museums to remind ourselves who we are.

Women Who Took Up Art When Most Women Didn't

BYLINE:  By DEBORAH WEISGALL; Deborah Weisgall writes from Boston about the arts.

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
THIS city's most famous female painter is fictional: Amy March, Jo's beautiful, blond, spoiled younger sister. For the girls in "Little Women," all artistic ambition was possible: Jo would become a writer, Amy a painter. 
 In "Little Women," art imitated life. Louisa May Alcott published her novel in a time and place -- Boston in 1868 -- of unusual opportunity for women. The city's economy and culture were flowering; Boston's prominent ladies, many of whom had been active abolitionists, had the means to pursue their own passions and the conscience to help less privileged women do the same. Louisa's sister, May Alcott Nieriker, was among the first generation of Boston women to become artists. Many were famous and successful in their day and as formidable as their more enduring literary sisters. 
 Most, however, are forgotten now.
A fascinating exhibition "A Studio of Her Own: Women Artists in Boston 1870-1940," which is on view at the Museum of Fine Arts until Dec. 2, demonstrates that these artists fell into obscurity both because they were women and because they lived in Boston. By the 1930's, the city that once advocated advanced social and artistic ideas seemed hopelessly stagnant to the avant-garde. 
The exhibition's organizer, Erica E. Hirschler -- the curator of American paintings at the museum -- has not only restored women to their proper place in the history of Boston art; she has also restored a portrait of a city and revealed new and subtle aspects of its singular and resolutely realist aesthetic.
The show and its catalog, which Ms. Hirschler wrote, examine the careers of more than 40 women, interweaving discussions of their work and their lives.
Most of these women were well-born. Along with the means to afford instruction and studios of their own, they inherited significant social and familial obligations. For most, their time was not their own.
In an interview at the museum, Ms. Hirschler talked of being struck by how familiar these experiences would sound to women today. "These artists struggled with the feeling that you should be both an artist and a wife and mother," she said. "Many never married; many married late." Several entered into "Boston marriages" -- unions with other women.
At issue was not opportunity or education; Boston's great teachers -- William Morris Hunt, William Rimmer, Edmund Tarbell, William Paxton, Philip Hale -- were happy to teach and encourage women, although in the 19th century art classes for men and women were held separately (with higher fees for women) and life-drawing classes threatened to topple moral standards. Most of Boston's female artists also studied in Europe; May Alcott Nieriker even published a self-help manual: "Studying Art Abroad and How to Do It Cheaply," filled with advice on where to buy rags and sturdy shoes. But certain subjects -- children, flowers, domestic scenes -- were considered women's themes, as were media like watercolor. It was the rare review that did not discuss a woman's art in terms of its masculine or feminine qualities.
The real problem was mixing art with life. Three generations of women who were artists in Boston formed a thriving, supportive community, but their stories are often fraught with compromise. Sarah Choate Sears married one of the richest men in Boston when she was 19, in 1877. For a while she produced bold and elegant flower studies, then in the 1890's she took up photography; her young daughter served as her convenient subject in intense and eloquent images.
Sears counted F. Holland Day, Alfred Stieglitz, Mary Cassatt and John Singer Sargent among her friends; she sponsored Maurice Prendergast's first European trip, and, unlike most of her Boston contemporaries, she was attracted to modernism. She joined the Photo-Secession in New York, introduced Cassatt to Gertrude Stein, and bought works by Cezanne, Braque and Matisse.
But she stopped working in 1904 to take care of her husband in his final illness; after his death, she managed the family finances. In 1925 she began drawing again, vivid, bright flowers, exploding with pent-up ideas. It is hard not to wonder what would have happened had she not missed out on 20 years.
Elizabeth Boott married the painter and teacher Frank Duveneck over her father's objections. She was 42; her son, born a year later in 1887, consumed her time, but she managed to paint a large watercolor for the Paris Salon jury. The day it was accepted she caught pneumonia and died a week later. Boott's friend Henry James wrote to her father that her death relieved her from "perpetual struggle and disappointment."
Sarah Wyman Whitman also married late, when she was 46, in 1886, and then to a man who pretty much left her alone; she had no children. Her pastel landscape "A Warm Night" is gorgeous with summer's slow dusk, its heat and haze and a low, full moon. It had hung in storage since Whitman left it to the museum in 1904.
For Whitman and her contemporaries, the Arts and Crafts movement, which proclaimed the parity of the fine and decorative arts, offered a means to obtain equal footing with men. Women designed books, posters, textiles and exquisite jewelry. Whitman produced distinguished work in stained glass, including an elegant fire screen that juxtaposes blocks of clear glass with colored elements. She also designed Celia Thaxter's classic book, "A Summer Garden," for which Childe Hassam painted the illustrations.
These women often married artists. They had, of course, less important careers, even though at least one contemporary critic suggested that they, in this case Elizabeth Vaughan Okie Paxton and Lilian Westcott Hale, were better painters than their husbands. But Ms. Hirschler points out that men and women painted in the same manner. Boston artists, male and female, wanted beauty; they sought to represent beautiful objects in the real world, to capture the transience of light and shadow, the texture of silk and skin. They did not care for violent emotion; they did not want modernism.
Elizabeth Paxton, many of whose works are lost, painted ravishing still lifes of moments in time -- a finished breakfast tray, a bedroom with shoes and sheets in sensual dishabille. In "The Mannequin," from around 1920, a wooden store model is draped in a silk jacket almost identical to the jacket that the woman wears in William Paxton's "New Necklace." Figurines and Chinese jars appear in both paintings, too, but in "The Mannequin" they're jumbled together as if in a shop, and a price tag dangles from the jacket. Mrs. Paxton's wooden figure stands as wry commentary on the live model in Mr. Paxton's luxurious interior -- the estate sale, beautifully rendered.
IN their self-portraits, however, Boston female artists did not seek to make themselves beautiful. Elizabeth Paxton emphasizes her long nose, somewhat receding chin and her muscular arm holding a paint brush. What would her husband have done with her elegant neck, luscious complexion, lustrous eyes?
Ellen Day Hale bursts like a harpy from a voluminous black cloak; she catches the asymmetry of her face, her boy's cropped bangs, her uncompromising eyes. Maria Danforth Page paints herself looming behind a portrait of her husband; he sits in front of a mirror, so that she, an apparition, paintbrush in hand, is context, he the subject.
These women were declaring themselves artists, emerging from their womanly selves. They painted their quandary, but they did so skillfully, elegantly and, to the larger world, with increasing irrelevance. Paxton's "Mannequin," set against what was going on in Europe and New York, seemed backward. In 1930, Katherine Lane Weems cast meticulously realistic bronze rhinoceroses while Picasso was making a bull's horns from bicycle handlebars.
Ms. Hirschler notes that those Boston painters interested in modernism simply moved away from the city, which was easier for men to do. Some women, like Gertrude Fiske, ventured to paint a landscape defined by telephone poles or the tawdry carnival rides at Revere Beach. Boston was too small a town, and the old ideals held. In 1939, Margaret Fitzhugh Brown founded the Boston chapter of The Society for Sanity in Art.
Today's postmodernism has abandoned a progressive, linear view of art, and the works of these women can once again be valued on their own terms. The Museum of Fine Arts show offers another powerful argument against progress. The catalog begins with a quotation from the painter Cecilia Beaux: "I predict a moment when the term 'Women in Art' will be as strange sounding a topic as the title 'Men in Art' would be now." Now was 1915. Even in 2001, a time of extraordinary opportunity for women, the title "A Studio of Her Own: Women Artists in Boston 1870-1940" does not sound strange.

A Long-Timer's Solution to Boredom: Be a Barnum

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW GUREWITSCH; Matthew Gurewitsch writes about the arts for The Wall Street Journal and other publications.

 BODY:
THAT'S why I loved it. So lurid and preposterous." Such is the verdict of Jo March, supplier of sensational fictions for The Daily Volcano, after her maiden outing to the opera. Still, she has a complaint.
 "Couldn't they print the words on a banner," she asks, "unspool it in front of the stage, so you could read what they were saying as they sing it?" 
 Friedrich Bhaer, her earnest escort, replies, "It never would work, Miss March." 
No need to ask whose side David Gockley would take when Jo pleads for an unscrolling banner. As general director of the Houston Grand Opera for the past three decades, Mr. Gockley has made it his business to press beyond the status quo. How charming, therefore, to hear the exchange between Jo and Bhaer from the stage of Mr. Gockley's company. Of course, as readers of Louisa May Alcott's classic "Little Women" will have noticed, though the characters are hers, the scene is not. It is the invention of the American composer Mark Adamo, whose first opera, after Alcott, was written (to his own libretto) on commission from the Houston Grand Opera. On Wednesday, the Houston production of Mr. Adamo's "Little Women" reaches a national television audience by way of the Thirteen/WNET series "Great Performances" on PBS. As is now routine, the telecast will be titled, as was the show in the opera house.
Titles, perhaps more than any other single factor, have helped "de-demonize" opera (Mr. Gockley's phrase) for hitherto resistant contemporary audiences, so you can bet he loves them. Mr. Gockley is no elitist. Hired as the Houston Grand Opera's business manager in 1970, he rose to the general directorship two years later, still in his late 20's. Under his aegis, a sleepy regional company with a full-time staff of seven, 20 performances of five productions per season and an annual budget of $550,000 has grown into an organization with 120 employees, 60 performances of nine productions per season and a budget of nearly $22 million.
Cook up an idea for broadening the reach or heightening the impact of opera, and he will make it work. Like impresarios everywhere, he understands the necessity of developing new audiences. What he understands better than most is the necessity not only to pique their curiosity but also to capture their loyalty, which often entails serving them in ways that may frighten old-timers.
"Being in one place so long, I need to find ways not to get bored," said Mr. Gockley, a native of Philadelphia, still boyish at 58, on a recent swing through New York. Truth to tell, he sounded slightly bored. He speaks slowly, with long pauses and a faraway look in his eye, as if collecting his thoughts from some Martian twilight zone. As a result, quite a few new acquaintances have formed a first impression of the man (quite false) as closed and cold. "I'm always working at the margins," he continued. "Sometimes I'm criticized for straining the main operations of the company for the sake of what's new and marginal." In the process, the margins move farther out, and the field that is opera keeps expanding.
Over the years, Mr. Gockley's efforts have no doubt struck one or two of his more conservative constituents as lurid and preposterous, not necessarily in Jo March's honorific sense. Behind a corporate Brooks Brothers facade that has long served as protective coloring in his dealings with the city's rich and powerful, he has worked the wiles of an operatic P. T. Barnum, ceaselessly plying audiences new and old with his own buzzy elixir of art and showmanship. He does not stand on dignity. More than once at company parties, staff members have tossed him into a swimming pool.
For the sake of art, he has donned Mozartean silks and powdered wig and a Davy Crockett coonskin cap. In the opening weeks of the Houston Astros' new Enron Field, he walked his 11-year-old son, Adam, onto the mound to throw a first pitch. He has taken Scott Joplin to Broadway, "Nixon in China" to Scotland and "Show Boat" to the Nile. In the teeth of the oil recession of the 1980's, he built the $72 million Wortham Theater Center, a space-age home for the company, complete with auditoriums of 2,400 seats (the Brown) and 1,100 seats (the Cullen), without a penny of public financing.
How did he do it? "Houston has an inferiority complex," he says. "It won't support an also-ran. Houston Grand Opera is the jewel in the cultural crown. That's something the city would support."
But Mr. Gockley's influence transcends his company. In ways seldom acknowledged, his vision has shaped the destiny of opera in America.
A separate essay could be written, for instance, on how Mr. Gockley's preferences in direction and design have infiltrated American opera. The original staging of "Nixon in China," by Peter Sellars, comes to mind, as does the Robert Wilson "Parsifal" (imported from Europe). But it is not only the highest-profile projects that count. The Houston Grand Opera has found a steady secondary market for sales and rentals of its shows. Two of the Cincinnati Opera's four festival productions this summer originated in Houston: Francesca Zambello's "Madama Butterfly" of 1988, already something of a classic; and the "Magic Flute," with which Maurice Sendak's brilliant moonlight career as an opera designer began more than 20 years ago.
Yet inevitably, the handiest measure of Mr. Gockley's spirit of enterprise is his tally of new operas. Last year, the company published an impressive special report, "An American Voice: Houston Grand Opera Celebrates 25 World Premieres," covering the period from 1974 to 2000. Thomas Pasatieri's "Seagull" (after Chekhov) led the way, with Frederica von Stade and Evelyn Lear in the starring roles. Since then, Houston has unveiled new operas by several Americans, including Leonard Bernstein, John Adams, Philip Glass, Meredith Monk, Tod Machover and Carlisle Floyd. But Michael Tippett of England and Daniel Catan of Mexico are on the honor roll as well.
Though hardly the first of the Houston Grand Opera commissions to have an afterlife on other stages, Mr. Adamo's "Little Women" may well go down as the most fortunate of all. Fiercely true to Alcott's spirit as he understands it, Mr. Adamo has treated the letter of her novel with the ruthlessness that distinguishes the artist from the mere adapter. Scored for 10 soloists, an orchestra of 18 and an offstage chorus of two sopranos and two altos, it was tailored to the modest resources of the company's finishing school for young artists, the Houston Grand Opera Studio. In Stephanie Novacek's portrayal of Jo March, Mr. Adamo's heroine, a star was born. Two performances of "Little Women" by students in March 1998 were plenty to persuade Mr. Gockley that the new work deserved a broader hearing. He promptly shoehorned it into the main company's 1999-2000 season, keeping the cast (students no longer) virtually intact.
The story continues. Already, "Little Women" has been picked up by companies in Kansas, California, Colorado and Virginia, with productions to follow in Nebraska, Minnesota and Indiana. Next summer it reaches the Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, N.Y., in a co-production that moves to the New York City Opera in 2003. No doubt there will be other stagings. Star-caliber young mezzos for years to come are sure to find Jo irresistible, and the opportunities for the rest of the cast are juicy, too. Mr. Adamo, meanwhile, is working on a second Houston Grand Opera commission: "Lysistrata, or The Nude Goddess," an explosive farce of sex and politics, after Aristophanes. Beyond that looms an Adamo "Dracula," also for Houston.
Like virtue, the injection of durable home-grown work into the repertory of companies in this country and abroad is (largely) its own reward. But at this stage in the evolution of the form, the main business of any large opera company is the conservation of a mainly European past. If performances of standard repertory at the Houston Grand Opera often seem especially satisfying -- carefully cast, thoughtfully directed, stylishly designed -- the engagement with the contemporary is one reason, as Mr. Adamo points out.
"For a company to commit so much to new work reflects on how you're supposed to see old work," he says. "New work needs to be fresh, communicative, aware of where we've been and where we're going. Houston is the only company that uses new work as a prism through which to view everything else it does."
Early in his tenure, Mr. Gockley got behind the standard audience-building efforts, sending docents (he called them "Aidas") and touring performances into the schools. More ambitious developments more recently promise to be at least as far-reaching. A fact sheet on the company's 46-year history points with pride to its Plazacasts: live feeds from the stage to a giant outdoor screen. The series, now annual, began in 1995 with Rossini's "Cenerentola," starring Cecilia Bartoli. The first such venture by an American opera company, it drew a crowd of 3,000, far more representative of the city's demographics than the audience in the house.
Titles? Everyone has those now. But who else has "Operavision"? No one, according to Mr. Gockley. When viewers in the balcony complained that they couldn't read the supertitles over the proscenium, Mr. Gockley gave them something extra: a system of monitors that display not only running titles but also close-ups of the singers. Mr. Gockley now has one stationary overall camera and two close-up cameras rolling at every performance.
Let Luddites complain that Operavision turns opera into a sporting event. (As if! Does baseball predate television?) Mr. Gockley shrugs. "For the young audiences who can't afford tickets downstairs, video screens are very normal," he says. "They're used to that."
In 1998, appealing to audiences in the tens of thousands, Mr. Gockley unveiled the Multimedia Modular Stage, patterned on the stages used by traveling rock acts. So far, "Carmen," "I Pagliacci" and "Madama Butterfly" have received the stadium treatment in productions that integrate electronically amplified performance, reasonably complete and in the operas' original languages, with live close-ups and recorded video material, both still and moving.
Once again, Mr. Gockley's package is proving its appeal beyond his adopted city. In June, the Houston Grand Opera visited the cavernous Mann Center, in the sylvan outskirts of Philadelphia, with a revival of "Carmen," the original modular stage attraction. Gawky, cat-eyed, got up in a puffy party skirt, Suzanna Guzman inhabited the title role with casual, gritty conviction, her voice part smoke, part velvet. As Escamillo, the toreador, Kevin Short, blazed onstage as if he were Shaft, delivering his big number like the international hit it is.
To eyes and ears accustomed to the opera house, the whole affair felt less like music theater than like a pop concert. Attitude often trumped action, and pictures swamped the performers.
It worked, in a way. But is this, God forbid, what all opera is destined to come to? Or a new mutant, a point of entry for some, for others the whole shooting match?
"For me," the impresario replied on that muggy night, "live opera in the opera house will always be the core experience." Still, don't be surprised if companies around the nation follow him to the great outdoors.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Manhattan; 
Prebuilding Office Space to Attract Small Businesses

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
WITH demand for office space in Manhattan softening, landlords are paying more attention to smaller businesses, which collectively account for a substantial chunk of the office market.
 According to Peter Turchin, a managing director of Insignia/ESG, the real estate services company, leases of less than 10,000 square feet accounted for 1.4 million of the 6 million square feet of office space leased in Manhattan so far this year. 
 One tactic some building owners and managers are using to make their properties more attractive to smaller tenants is prebuilding offices, to help entice tenants with the prospect of saving them the time, inconvenience and expense of converting raw space into usable quarters. Brokers say that prebuilt space commands premium rents, to reflect the owners' investments, and that space in move-in condition rents more quickly than empty floors.
Real estate executives also say prebuilding space, particularly in older buildings, gives an owner an opportunity to present the property in the best possible condition, particularly if most of its offices were built many years ago. 
Many landlords routinely demolish existing office space when a tenant moves out, particularly if the tenant occupied a lot of space and the offices are battered and old fashioned. They market the raw space to prospective new tenants and, typically, make their contribution toward the cost of building new offices -- called a build-out allowance -- part of the lease negotiations.
The tenant then has to select an architect to design the interior and hire builders to get the necessary permits and do the actual work, which can take three to six months.
Prebuilding space is an effective marketing tool, said George P. Fabian, general manager of the Fisk Building on 57th Street and Eighth Avenue, particularly with smaller companies that do not have architects to produce renderings of what space will look like when built. "Most tenants cannot envision what space will look like when it is built," Mr. Fabian said. "Built space is a big marketing plus, and it always was." 
Prebuilt space is analogous to the finished offices being offered for sublet by failed or shrunken dot-coms and telecommunications companies. Such space has the attraction of being ready for quick occupancy. The difference is that the sublets are being offered by companies trying to get out of their lease obligations, while the prebuilds are being done by landlords on speculation.
There is an active prebuilding program under way at the Fisk Building, whose address is 250 West 57th Street. This is appropriate because the building specializes in small tenants, many of them in the media and entertainment business.
"TO many landlords, small tenants are a headache," Mr. Fabian said. "I have 320 tenants, so I have 320 potential headaches."
But, he added, having many small tenants, rather than a few large ones, is a form of insurance in economic downturns since the departure of any single tenant will have little impact on the building's income. "With big-space tenants, you can lose 10 percent or more of your income if a single tenant moves out," he said. "That gives them negotiating power."
The building, completed in 1921 for the long vanished Fisk Rubber Company, a tire maker, is updating its vacant spaces, which range from a few hundred square feet on the upper floors to 7,150 square feet on the third floor, which has been assembled for a larger tenant.
The renovations will include new carpeting, paint, a dropped ceiling and modern light fixtures. One space has a column squarely in the middle, but Mr. Fabian said tenants will simply have to live with it. "This could be a very functional four-person office," he said.
There are size limits on office prebuilds, said Richard Coles, a senior vice president of Emmes Realty Services, which is constructing offices at properties it owns at 535 Fifth Avenue, 545 Fifth Avenue and 19 West 44th Street.
"Spaces from about 800 square feet to about 4,000 square feet are ideal for prebuilds," he said. "Over about 5,000 square feet, the tenant has an architect and a builder and is comfortable with building out its own space."
Because small spaces have a limited number of possible layouts, Mr. Coles said, the prebuilds typically conform to a formula. "We put in as many partner offices as possible, a conference room, a kitchenette, a phone and copier room, and reserve the rest of the space for workstations."
Having the offices available for almost immediate occupancy "is a competitive advantage for a landlord," he said, particularly in the current market with effective rents trending down. A year ago, when rents were rising, tenants were eager to sign up for space well before their existing leases expired to lock in a rental rate before it went higher. Today they hold back as long as possible in hopes of signing at a lower rate.
"Tenants today think they can improve their position by waiting," Mr. Coles said. "As a result they don't have as much time once they make their decision, and that's why a prebuild program can be very successful."
Another small-tenant building with an active prebuild program is the Lincoln Building at 42nd Street and Madison Avenue, which specializes in law firms. (Both the Lincoln and Fisk Buildings are owned by partnerships headed by Peter L. Malkin of Wien & Malkin, hence the similar strategy.)
A typical tenant in the Lincoln Building is a lawyer who realizes he is not going to named partner at a major law firm and is striking out on his own, said Kevin Driscoll, the building's general manager. Tenants like this are interested in offices they can occupy quickly to start establishing their own practices.
"We are prebuilding offices on the lower floors of the building ranging from 1,200 to 4,000 square feet," Mr. Driscoll said. "We have done seven so far -- we'll do 10 by the end of the year -- and most have been rented during construction."
He said the renovations include new windows for the 71-year-old building, new lights and tenant-controlled air-conditioning. Mr. Driscoll said the improvements cost about $60 a square foot and the offices rent for $50 to $55 a square foot on short-term leases of three to five years. Although the leases suit tenants who may expand their operations or merge with someone else in a few years, he said, the alterations are expected to last for 12 to 15 years.
A principal advantage for a small company in leasing prebuilt space is that it does not have to dip into its own capital to finance construction, said Marc R. Shapses, a senior managing director at Julien J. Studley, a real estate services company specializing in representing tenants.
"When you rent prebuilt, you are on a pay-as-you-go basis," Mr. Shapses said. "You do not have to tie up your credit at the bank, and you pay for it in tax-deductible rent."
Although most prebuilt projects are concentrated in Midtown, some owners of buildings downtown are taking this approach as well, real estate executives say. All of the vacant space in the twin buildings at 111-115 Broadway at Cedar Street is going to be prebuilt, according to Adam Foster, a senior managing director of Insignia/ESG.
The buildings, which are owned by Capital Properties, have about 40,000 square feet that are vacant or about to become so. They are being developed as prebuilt spaces of 2,000 to 6,000 square feet, Mr. Foster said. These offices command a rent premium over raw space and, perhaps more important, rent quicker, providing the owner with an early cash flow, he added.
More important, he added, prebuilding offices can show the possibilities of the buildings, which opened at the turn of the last century, in 1905 and 1907. "Many of the existing offices are old fashioned and tired," he said. "This is a chance the show the building in the best light. The quality of the space will reflect the quality of the building."
Landlords offer prebuilt space to small tenants because the businesses' owners are typically in a position to make quick decisions about signing a lease without the lengthy discussions that can take place among layers of management in larger companies. 
"A 4,000-square-foot tenant does not need board approval," said Insignia/ESG's Mr. Turchin.

HEADLINE: Hamburger: A Few Bucks. Getting There: $100 or So. 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOEPPEL 

 BODY:
IT may not have much cachet among the Hamptons jet set, but Belle's Cafe, a Caribbean-Cajun spot in Westhampton, has something that even the most chic East End restaurants don't: a close-up view of Gabreski Airport's 9,000-foot runway and a clientele of hungry pilots, some of whom travel hundreds of miles just for a few slices of Belle's french toast. 
 Across the street from the Montauk Airport is Rick's Crabby Cowboy, a casual restaurant that serves everything from lobster to hamburgers, and where one popular pilot offers waitresses rides in his single-engine Cessna instead of a tip. 
 Recreational pilots love flying, particularly to find good food -- the "$100 hamburger," given the travel costs involved. 
"With inflation, a hamburger is now closer to $150," said Spencer Kagan, 55, a judge from Marblehead, Mass., who counts Belle's as a particular favorite. "Pilots need destinations to go to, rather than just burning holes in the clouds. So many airfields have great restaurants. We have fun and you meet great people, crazy like we are." 
Mr. Kagan doesn't think much of Belle's ambience, but that is not the point: it's the omelets, french toast and esprit de corps. On a clear weekend morning, he and several friends will rent a single-engine Cessna, fly down for an early breakfast and be back in Massachusetts by noon.
Owen Carr, 41, a former resident of Huntington who also lives in Massachusetts, frequently flies to Long Island to visit family and, of course, to have lunch.
His six-seat Bonanza cruises down the scenic Hudson corridor in about 40 minutes and arrives at Republic Airport, where he and his passengers amble over to the 56th Fighter Group, a popular restaurant with a World War II theme, equal parts eatery and museum. P-47 Thunderbolt and P-40 Warhawk fighter planes can be seen from the back of the restaurant, monuments to a bygone era of aviation.
The 56th, with an eclectic, modestly priced menu, also draws locals, veterans and aviation enthusiasts. Patrons can wear headphones to eavesdrop on flight activity from the air-control tower just outside.
"You won't find these kind of restaurants in your average downtown," Mr. Carr said. 
That's why, four years ago, 28-year-old Doug Fields of New York took Brenda, now his wife, to the 56th on their first date. The young pilot said a fly-in dinner date is a sure way to impress a girlfriend -- and discover if she shares a passion for flying. In the case of Brenda, it was apparently a successful maneuver. 
Pilots like Mr. Fields and Mr. Carr appreciate the importance of good service and easy access to airport dining. Many airports provide pilots with courtesy cars they can borrow for a few hours if there is no restaurant on site or within walking distance.
Pilots can get mini-reviews about fly-in food worldwide on the Web, at www.100dollarhamburger.com. Restaurants are awarded a maximum of five burgers, based on quality, service and location. Both the 56th and Belle's received four burgers.
Beyond the food, Belle's offers entertainment on Sundays, where there is live jazz to go with the french toast. 
Some of the entertainment takes place even before the pilots get to the retaurant. When Mr. Carr lands at Gabreski, his plane is greeted by a "middle-aged man on a bicycle" who direct the craft to its parking spot and offers fuel and aviation maps.
Mr. Fields recalled landing one evening at Grabeski to find a deer blocking the runway. "I thought to myself, I hope it moves, or else I'll be having venison for dinner," he said.
Several pilots agree that for natural beauty, Montauk Airport has the others beat. As a plane approaches the runway, sand dunes appear majestically on the horizon.
Only a block from the Montauk airport is Rick's Crabby Cowboy. Every third Sunday, a group of pilots who call themselves the Breakfast Club fly in for a few hours, devour their eggs and bacon, then fly out.
"It baffles me as to why some people fly so far just to have breakfast," said Mandy Nolan, an assistant manager at Rick's. "Most of these people have a lot of money, they eat what they want, and are big tippers," 
Wes Grady, 56, a lawyer from Dutchess County, used to fly regularly to Montauk for seafood, to Cincinnati for chili and to Oshkosh, Wis., to meet friends. Recent back surgery has kept him out of the cockpit for more than a year, but he is planning his comeback, both in the air and at the luncheon table.
"We could drive down to McDonald's for burgers, but that isn't much fun," Mr. Grady said. "A pilot will fly for any reason and the 100-dollar burger gives us a good reason to get in the air."

HEADLINE: Architectural Trend Still Stirs Passions 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD WEIZEL 

 BODY:
WHEN David Paterson bought his modest, but open and airy modern-style house in Guilford more than a decade ago, he had no idea that its construction in 1964 had been part of a frenzied architectural movement known as the "International style" that had its origins in pre-World War II Europe.
 Mr. Paterson, a longtime golf pro at Yale University and former director of its golf programs, said he was immediately drawn to the Wingate Road House built by the late Connecticut architect Lauren E. (Pachy) Meyers because of its simplicity and light, and the surrounding woods that could be viewed from anywhere in the two-level structure. 
 The house was built as part of a development of a dozen modern-style homes located in a wooded area overlooking Long Island Sound. About half of the Wingate homes are considered "International," special even among modern homes because of a pristine symmetrical style, flat roofs, an emphasis on large glass windows and austere inside space designs. Most homes of the International style are designed to blend into the natural environment, built in wooded areas and often in natural rocky hillsides. 
Mr. Paterson said that while he had lived in his 2,400-square-foot house since 1990, he had only recently begun to realize how significant the International style movement was and how big a role Connecticut played during its peak era in the 1940's and 50's when many architects around the country came here specifically to design those houses.
He said he began to understand the significance when the former owner of the house who sold it to him tried to buy it back a few years later.
"I love it too much to sell it back," Mr. Paterson said. "I don't know where I would find another one quite like it."
In fact, architectural experts say Connecticut is among several states where the largest concentration of International style houses was built. They said that's because of the state's vast natural woodlands, its close proximity to the New York City architects who designed the homes, and the presence of the Yale University School of Architecture, where prominent architects schooled in the style had studied.
They said that while hundreds of the homes were undoubtedly constructed in Connecticut, including in New Canaan, Stamford, Darien, Ridgefield, Wilton and Orange, there are no exact numbers on how many were built or how many remain.
"Growing up in a miserable, old stone house in Scotland where the winters are dark and dreary and it gets dark by 4 in the afternoon, I was immediately taken with this house because of the massive windows that let in all this wonderful light, even during winter," said Mr. Paterson, president of the Wingate Association. "I didn't buy it because I was following any movement or anything like that, I bought it because I loved the simplicity of the interiors and the extraordinary view of the landscape."
Indeed, that is what attracted many to buy and even design and construct their own International style homes. It is what motivated the architect Philip Johnson in 1949 to build one for himself what has become Connecticut's most well-known International style home -- the "Glass House" on a 40-acre parcel in New Canaan.
"I've lived in this house for more than 50 years and the longer I'm here the more I realize that you have to live in a glass house to truly appreciate Connecticut," said Mr. Johnson, 95. "That's impossible from a regular house."
Ten years ago, Mr. Johnson gave the property to the National Trust for Historic Preservation with the understanding he could stay there and that it would become a museum after his death. The house is already on the National Register of Historic Places.
While Mr. Johnson is not involved in the growing movement to save International style houses -- he said he prefers to spend his time designing new buildings -- others like Richard Bergmann, an architect from New Canaan, have taken up the cause because they said the houses must be preserved.
Some, like Mr. Paterson's Guilford neighbors, Terrence and Lissa MacLaren, are not just passionate about the Wingate Road house they live in, they are also determined to preserve as many of the International style homes as they can because they said the houses represented an important architectural era they are convinced is on the brink of a revival.
Mr. MacLaren compared his three-level, 3,500-square-foot house to a work of abstract art. It is built into a heavily wooded rocky hill overlooking Long Island Sound and was designed by the internationally renowned architect Bruce Arneill of Old Saybrook. Mr. MacLaren and his wife said they particularly enjoyed the living room, which includes upper wall windows called clerestories that allows them to "watch the clouds float by."
"I had been fascinated by the International style house for more than 20 years and when this came on the market a few years ago I knew I had to have it," said Mr. MacLaren, a lawyer who writes law books and has lived in the Guilford area for more than a decade.
The MacLarens have been so taken with their Wingate Road home they are planning to build a similar one in the Arizona desert, where they will relocate as soon as they find a buyer for the house.
That, however, isn't always easy, according to the man who designed it. Mr. Arniell, who said he also came to Connecticut from the Midwest 40 years ago to study architecture at Yale University, said International style homes are not for everyone. 
No one knows that better than Henry F. Miller, a former Yale architect, who is still passionate about the International style house he built in 1949 in Orange.
It was a decade after the 1939 "world of tomorrow" World's Fair in New York and just a few years after the end of World War II when wild anticipation awaited the public viewing of Mr. Miller's "House of Tomorrow," as it was named in a New Haven Register headline. The public viewing drew nearly 4,000 people on May 15, 1949.
By the end of that year more than 25,000 people would pay 10 cents, which went to a local charity, to view the two-level International style rectangular structure with its flat roof and movable walls built into a natural hillside and designed to blend into its 2 1/2-acre woodlands parcel off Derby Avenue.
"At that time I truly believed we would see this style become one of the most popular not only in the United States, but throughout the world," said Mr. Miller, who is a retired architect and also taught at Yale. 
"While the style did become somewhat popular for a while during the 1950's, it never quite caught on the way I had expected -- I guess because most people are used to living in cozy capes or large colonials and never quite embraced this more unique and modest style," said Mr. Miller, whose house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in April.
Vincent Scully, the Sterling Emeritus Professor of Art History and School of Architecture at Yale University, also designed an International style home in Woodbridge around the same time as Mr. Miller and lived in it for years. He said he recalls the passion for the style among some people in the late 1940's and early 50's as "something of a frenzy or madness" they were convinced would catch on with the masses.
"After years of economic depression and war, we were embraced by a strange kind of enthusiasm that everything had to be new and we were certain this style home was the answer because it embodied modesty and simplicity and was built to blend in with the natural surroundings," Mr. Scully said. "Of course, it never quite happened that way as most Americans instead came to embrace the materialism of larger colonial style homes and mansions. Still, I think we created something quite remarkable at the time."

HEADLINE: LONG ISLAND VINES; 
Heading West

BYLINE:  By HOWARD G. GOLDBERG 

 BODY:
Vincent A. Galluccio, the owner of Gristina/Galluccio Estate Vineyards in Cutchogue, plans to establish a California label and a line of California wines.
 The label, to be called Galluccio Family Winery, will probably be based in the Napa Valley, where Mr. Galluccio hopes to buy into an existing winery. 
 Mr. Galluccio expects to use both operations to complement each other in nationwide marketing.
Very few Long Island wines are sold nationally in sizable quantities. Mr. Galluccio hopes to have Gristina/Galluccio wines distributed in 15 states by the end of 2002.
Shortly after he bought Gristina in August 2000 and began increasing its output, Mr. Galluccio started signaling coast-to-coast ambitions by placing Gristina/Galluccio ads in national wine magazines. He expects to go into other media in the future.
In addition to New York, "Gristina wines are currently available in Connecticut and in Napa and Los Angeles," he said. 
"Distribution goals include Florida, New Jersey, Illinois, Minnesota, Georgia and the Carolinas."
Mr. Galluccio intends to discontinue the production of three low-priced wines on the North Fork and to have them made in California and carry California identities. They are the rose of cabernet; Avalon, a riesling made with Finger Lakes grapes; and Garnet, a red blend, whose name will change.
"We're moving the value-tier wines" -- a trade euphemism for low-priced -- "out of Long Island because it is not economical to make them here," he said. "I want to concentrate on making only premium wines at Gristina."
The shift toward premium wines is partly anchored in Mr. Galluccio's recent hiring of Michel Rolland, Bordeaux's best-known "flying winemaker," as a Gristina/Galluccio consultant. He said he had not discussed any role in California with Mr. Rolland.
Mr. Galluccio said that Gristina's winemaker, Charles Girard, would oversee the winemaking in both places.
"Long Island will be the jewel in the crown," Mr. Galluccio said. "If California were the jewel, it would be 'me too.' "

HEADLINE: Rebuilding Careers Out of the Ashes 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTINE DIGRAZIA 

 BODY:
THE special emergency office created to help workers who lost their jobs when the Latex Foam Products factory in Ansonia was destroyed by fire May 14 has been dismantled. Concerned calls from local companies offering to interview displaced workers have dwindled. A special job fair featuring 26 prospective employers was held in June and no others have been scheduled.
 But in the three months since shocked Latex Foam employees watched their livelihoods disappear, about 59 percent of the 190 employees thrown out of work have found new jobs. Community groups and churches have rallied to raise and donate money so workers can pay for food, rent and utilities. The company has said it will rebuild the plant, but has not decided where, although Peter DeMarco, the chief operating officer, said the preference would be to remain in the state, maybe even rebuilding in Ansonia. 
 State labor officials and various job-assistance agencies continue to struggle to find ways to keep workers' spirits up, but said it has been a roller-coaster ride. 
"They've gone through all the stages similar to the grieving process when you lose a loved one: shock, anger, sadness," said Nancie Gray, vice president of marketing and special events for the Greater Valley Chamber of Commerce, one of the job fair's sponsors. "Everybody is handling it differently."
The company's 10-acre plant site on West Main Street in Ansonia still contains scattered piles of twisted metal and charred Latex products. Fire officials said the fire appeared to have started when an oven used to dry wet Latex caught fire. 
Most of the displaced workers are receiving unemployment compensation for 26 weeks, or until they find new jobs. The luckier ones have been receiving severance pay based on the number of years they worked at the factory. Others, according to Carol Sundlin, director of the State Department of Labor's Job Center, are coming in regularly to use the Ansonia office's telephones, computers and fax machines to search for jobs. But others aren't looking at all because they're waiting to see whether Latex Foam will rebuild its factory in the Naugatuck Valley or move out of state.
"I did think more would have returned to work by this time," Ms. Sundlin said. "They have received more help than the average unemployed person. We have bent over backwards."
Part of the problem may be that unemployment is on the rise in Connecticut -- its 3.2 percent unemployment rate is still among the lowest in the nation, but initial unemployment claims were 60 percent higher in July of this year over the same period in 2000. National unemployment claims figures suggest the country's fragile labor market is struggling.
Jim Bradshaw, 34, is part of that struggle. He was a material handler at Latex Foam and was able to find another job about a month after the fire using a revamped resume.
"I didn't have an updated, professional resume before the fire," Mr. Bradshaw said. "I had to create a new resume. The Job Center people helped me make it look real nice and professional. I didn't realize I was that good! I was a lead man for six years and they really played that up big."
He was hired by Spectrum Plastics in Ansonia, one of the local companies represented at the job fair in June. But within weeks he was laid off.
"I saw it coming," said Mr. Bradshaw, who is looking for work again. "I knew the ax was going to fall and it did." He's now working full time as a gas station attendant in a station in Trumbull.
Cory J. Thomas, 24, has had better luck. Like Mr. Bradshaw, he found work through the job fair, but he still has the job.
Mr. Thomas, who had worked at Latex Foam for seven years, was 18 when he dropped out of Ansonia High School and found his first full-time job making cosmetic powder puffs at the factory. Mr. Thomas said he later graduated from Shelton High School and rose through the ranks of machine operator and packer at Latex Foam to become a "team leader," supervising workers in the plant's mattress department.
"I was very comfortable," said Mr. Thomas of New Haven. "Anytime a job opening came up that paid more money, I would jump on it."
In the weeks after the fire, Mr. Thomas jumped on any job opportunity that came his way. He received career counseling and resume-building advice from labor department staffers and created his first professional resume, a concise chronological listing of jobs at Latex Foam that show the upward progression of his career. He placed numerous calls to prospective employers and faxed many resumes.
"If I leave the house at 9 a.m. to go job-hunting, I'm not usually back until 4 p.m.," Mr. Thomas said.
On a Saturday morning shortly after the fire, an upbeat and confident Mr. Thomas spent two hours visiting 17 out of 26 company booths at a job fair at Ansonia High School for the displaced workers.
"I'm going to either fail or succeed here today," Mr. Thomas said as he prepared to stop at the first booth. "I'm happy they are offering this opportunity. Usually, when you send in a job application, you don't get to meet anybody at the company. I like this face-to-face meeting. You get an immediate response."
Indeed, Mr. Thomas was greeted enthusiastically at a number of booths. But no one was more enthusiastic than Patsy Rubbo, general manager, and Marty Kellaher, vice president of sales, at J&L Molding of Wallingford, a manufacturer of plastic molding components for companies such as U.S. Surgical Corporation and Johnson & Johnson.
Mr. Rubbo and Mr. Kellaher said they were looking for candidates to fill three positions. "We're looking for people that seem to have good attitudes, good work ethics and good potential for future growth," Mr. Rubbo said. He pointed to notes he had made on the top of Mr. Thomas' resume: "Good attitude. Hard worker." Mr. Rubbo said: "We noticed Cory has had ever-increasing responsibilities at Latex Foam, which shows constant improvement. He's always had part-time jobs and schooling, so he's constantly trying to better himself. He just shines."
Mr. Rubbo said that there was no immediate opening for Mr. Thomas, but that he and Mr. Kellaher thought he had the potential to manage a new third shift the company is considering.
Two weeks after the fair, Mr. Thomas said he had received calls from six employers, four from companies represented at the job fair including J&L Plastic, and two from his own job search.
"Money-wise, they're all a little more than what I was making," Mr. Thomas said. "For a while I didn't hear from anybody, then all of a sudden, everyone was calling."
Mr. Thomas has since been hired as a full-time cable installer at Tele-Media of Southwestern Connecticut in Seymour.
"I'm really sorry the plant burned down, but if it didn't, I wouldn't have ventured into something else," he said. "All in all, I would never want to go through this again."
Bardhyl and Vjollca Ajoka, a young married couple who moved to the United States from Albania a year ago, also lost their jobs when the plant was destroyed. The Ajokas received a job offer in the weeks since the fire, but instead chose to receive unemployment compensation benefits and concentrate on their dream of getting an education in computers. Mr. Ajoka said that while the fire that ended their eight-month stint on the same shift as foam-mattress cutters was a "tragedy for the business," it was not a catastrophe for the couple, who are permanent residents hoping to become United States citizens.
Mr. Ajoka said they had no immediate worries about being evicted from the house they rent for $550 a month in Ansonia because their landlord, a fellow Albanian, has told them not to worry for now and pay what they can. The Ajokas, who were teachers in Albania, are receiving a total of $152 a week in unemployment compensation, Mr. Ajoka said.
In the meantime, the couple has completed about half of a 54-hour computer-training program at the Waterbury branch of Hartford's Goodwin College, where they will attend classes for nine weeks. Their education in basic Microsoft Windows, Word, Excel, PowerPoint skills and how to navigate the Internet is being paid for by a federal back-to-work program administered by Job-Link in Bridgeport, said Mary Jane Mulvey, a skill development counselor.
Goodwin College has worked hard to make sure the Ajokas fit in, said Peter Travers, director of the college's "One-2-One" training program. Because the couple has only one car and because they prefer to attend classes together, the school has arranged for them to alternate with their instructor between classes and computer labs.
"Bardhyl will be in class for three hours, while Vjollca will be in a practice lab, then vice versa," Mr. Travers said. "They want to get back to work as quickly as possible. Then, when they find work, they want to continue to go to school. They have a hell of an uphill battle. They will have a tough time finding work because of cultural differences." Mr. Travers added that he thought the couple had "a tremendous amount of courage."

Housing for Artists -- and a Spur for Downtowns

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to housing, artists who have not achieved star status may find themselves living in the 21st-century equivalent of the proverbial garret. 
 But growing enthusiasm about the reuse of neglected and abandoned buildings across the country has been providing opportunities for such properties to be turned over to artists as live-work space, financed by a patchwork of public, corporate and private money. Such ventures are seen as contributing to the revival of troubled downtown districts. 
 In Connecticut, the latest on a short but expanding list of properties designated for conversion for artists' use is in Bridgeport, where the 100,000-square-foot former Read's department store, built in 1925 and abandoned 20 years ago, is to be reconfigured into 63 live-work units for visual artists, writers and musicians.
Together with the renovation of a rundown 75,000-square-foot hotel and shopping arcade, Read's will form the nucleus of a block of shops, restaurants and offices bounded by Cannon, Main, John and Broad Streets. More important, the artists and their families are expected to bring round-the-clock vibrancy back to a downtown that is moribund after 6 p.m. 
Read's is the latest project to be undertaken by Artspace Inc. of Minneapolis, a nonprofit agency that opened in 1979 as a housing referral service for displaced artists. Today it provides long-term live-work space for artists at below-market rates in 12 buildings that it owns and operates around the country.
"ALL our projects are in substantial, usually historic, buildings converted from some other use," said Sarah Parker, communications manager for Artspace. 
Each building has a waiting list for tenants, and the Bridgeport project, according to an Artspace survey of artists within a 30-mile radius, will draw from 45 Connecticut towns, from Westchester and from New Jersey. Interest generated by word of mouth has also come from Rhode Island, Vermont and Texas. There have been inquiries from three times as many artists as there are units. 
Read's is an important piece of a development strategy conceived by the city seven years ago, said Michael Freimuth, Bridgeport's director of development. "We were looking for a niche in the region," he said. "We focused on arts and entertainment, education, government and intermodal transportation to bring people into the city." 
To that end, Housatonic Community College moved downtown from the outskirts in 1997; the Ballpark at Harbor Yard, home of the Bridgeport Bluefish baseball team, opened in 1998; and the Polka Dot Playhouse was relocated in 1999 from a forlorn location at Seaside Park to a handsome theater remodeled from a bank building on State Street. In addition, an ice hockey arena near the ballpark is nearing completion, and a new Superior Courthouse and Juvenile Courthouse and Detention Center are to be built by the state. A high-speed ferry is planned to Stamford and New York; it is to be linked on land with the rail line and improved bus service.
Saving Read's from demolition was the unexpected result of the city of Norwalk's rejection two years ago of an Artspace plan to convert a former lock factory into artists' units. The building has since been redeveloped as offices and retail stores under the name Norwalk Art and Technology Center, which reflects the building's partial use in the past for artists' studios.
Seeking another venue to replace the Norwalk site, C. William Kraus, an independent consultant who was Artspace's volunteer negotiator, was referred to Robert Halstead, property dispositions manager for Bridgeport's tax-delinquent and foreclosed properties. Mr. Kraus was squired around to several sites, and Read's, with its 4.6-foot-wide-by-8-foot-high windows, 12- and 18-foot-high ceilings, solid brick exterior and concrete-over-steel construction, was the indisputable choice.
A proposal for the conversion was presented to State Senator William Finch, president of the Bridgeport Economic Development Corporation, which was in charge of developing that block. Impressed by the idea and by Artspace's reputation, Senator Finch said, "We lobbied the City Council and the mayor hard, and we were able to convince people who came to public hearings that Artspace tenants reflect the local population, and that as many minority businesses currently in the arcade will be retained as possible."
Read's $11.5 million conversion is to be designed by Crosskey Architects of Hartford. The exterior will look as it did in 1925, down to the wide green awnings that roll up in winter. The brick will be repointed and the windows restored. Each residential unit will be different -- some square, some rectangular, some L-shaped but all facing the outside. Doors will be four feet wide to accommodate artists' needs, and broad interior spaces will become informal galleries on each of the five floors. A 4,000-square-foot public gallery on the street floor will house major exhibitions.
Twenty one-bedroom units will contain 1,100 square feet each, 24 two-bedroom units will have 1,300 square feet and 19 three-bedroom units will measure 1,600 square feet. "We want the artists to have plenty of room to be creative," said William Crosskey, head of the architectural firm. 
Rents, pegged to artists' incomes, will range from $260 to $820 a month, according to Sarah Constant, president of Mission First, a Washington-based group that is Artspace's financial consultant and development manager, working as a liaison with architects, contractors, environmental and historic consultants.
THE city gave the Bridgeport Economic Development Corporation $2.5 million to acquire five parcels on the block by eminent domain: Read's; the hotel and arcade; a vacant parcel; a small parking lot; and the Pollock Building, which will be demolished. Ownership of Read's will be transferred to Artspace for $1 when the conversion is completed.
Two months ago, the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority approved a low-interest mortgage financing loan of $2.74 million and low-income and historic tax credits of $8 million. In addition, more than $540,000 has been raised privately from the Greater Bridgeport Area Foundation, the Bridgeport Special Services District, the Melville Foundation, the Chase Manhattan Bank, the Southern New England Telephone Company, the Culpepper Memorial Foundation, the Edward C. Moore Foundation and United Illuminating. Bridgeport Economic Development expects to supply final designs and construction pricing within six to eight months, enabling the tax-credit deals to be closed. Meanwhile, environmental remediation of asbestos, lead paint and the residue of a colony of pigeons will begin in the fall, Ms. Constant said. 
Read's was considered for artists' housing five years ago by Peter Shapiro, a Hartford banker, and his partners, but the city was not amenable to the idea. Urged to open a similar project in Hartford by his daughter, a singer in Minneapolis who lived in an Artspace building there, Mr. Shapiro and his group found an 84,000-square-foot former factory on Asylum Street. Tai Soo Kim Partners, Hartford architects, renovated the abandoned 1910 building into 43 live-work artists' apartments at a cost of $6.5 million. It opened in 1998 as a for-profit enterprise and is fully rented. 
Based on the Hartford area's median income of $54,858, rents are calculated at 60, 50 and 25 percent of the median. "We get a developer's fee of around 8 to 10 percent of the project cost," Mr. Shapiro said, "and minuscule profits from rents, which we draw on for promoting art exhibitions in the 3,500-square-foot street-floor gallery." 
His second project, in a former 100,000-square-foot factory in Norwich, opened in March and is 90 percent full. Rents, at 60 percent of the median, range from $214 to $775 for one to three bedrooms. Twelve market-rate units out of 58 units are priced from $695 to $925 for one to three bedrooms. 
"We have been approved to proceed in Willimantic," Mr. Shapiro said, "and New Britain has expressed interest." While Artspace of Minneapolis is not directly involved in his ventures, he said, "Artspace serves as a stem cell for all these projects around the country."
In 1989, Sharon T. Griffis, director of the Griffis Art Center in New London, opened Sapphire House, a 1929 private residence that she restored for artists, and a separate building used twice a year when an internationally known artist, writer or composer is invited for a residency. It is equipped with cable, phone, library, computer and other amenities. Sapphire House has 10 one- and two-bedroom apartment-studios, some with 30-foot-long rooms, renting for $450 to $650 a month including utilities. 
The enterprise was financed with about $1 million in private funds, Ms. Griffis said. "We are nonprofit, so we don't pay taxes, and we are self-sustaining through rents, gallery sales and donations," she said. "We haven't had a vacancy for two years."

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY & CO.; 
In a Nutshell Lies One Firm's Fruit

BYLINE:  By DIANA DRAKE 

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
To get to the Cardolite Corporation, you have to navigate this city's manufacturing strip along Doremus Avenue, trundling over railroad tracks, hoping to avoid the misplaced nails and groaning 18 wheelers common to the gritty industrial district.
 Welcome to the nuthouse. 
 Cardolite -- which employs 70 people and has around $20 million in annual sales -- manufactures chemicals derived from the liquid in the shell of a cashew that are used in epoxy, coatings, friction, printing, rubber, wood and specialty polymer industries.
Focused on enhancing and expanding the use of the oil, the company imports about 10,000 tons of nutshell liquid a year, mostly from Brazil and India. Nearly half of Cardolite's business is done overseas -- in Asia and Europe.
"It flowers once a year and after it flowers the fruit comes out," explained Anthony Stonis, who owns Cardolite has been in the business for 16 years. "After the fruit comes out, the seed comes outside it. That's the cashew nut." 
Other than providing a tasty party snack, the nut, or more specifically the oil that surrounds the nut, is a crucial commodity to the specialty chemical industry. The black liquid found between the nut and the cashew shell is known as cashew nutshell liquid in the chemical industry. The unique properties of cashew liquid, which has its roots in New Jersey with a chemist named Mortimer Harvey and a company called Irvington Varnish, make it especially reactive with other chemicals.
Compared with a company like Dupont, which had annual revenues last year of $28.3 billion, Cardolite is one of the smaller businesses. And these days, life is not so easy. "Trying to keep our niche and not be a big company is difficult," Mr. Stonis admitted. "These are very challenging times."
Indeed, the specialty chemical business is often a barometer of the economy in general.
"If the economy gets sick, the specialty guys get a cold first," explained Hal Bozarth, executive director of the Chemical Industry Council of New Jersey, which is based in Trenton.
Mr. Bozarth, whose group is made up of 100 members, said New Jersey had always been home to several specialty chemical companies as against the larger manufacturers, which are situated primarily in Texas and Louisiana.
The specialty chemical business, which employs about 90,000 workers in New Jersey alone, has for last few years been going through what Mr. Bozarth refers to as "a major upheaval" as an increasingly global market has led to more competition.
"You have increased competition and a flat economy," said Mr. Bozarth. "All companies like Tony's are struggling to stay competitive."
In May, for example, Rohm & Haas, a Philadelphia-based chemical company, announced that it planned to close a part of Morton International, a speciality dye and marker producer that had operated in Paterson since 1946, resulting in the loss of 90 jobs.
And the cashew nutshell liquid industry, while highly specialized, has become more crowded in recent years as larger companies like Vantico, a division of Ciba Specialty Chemicals, recognized the profit potential. For the most part, however, Cardolite and Palmer International of Skippack, Pa., dominate the American market, importing the lion's share of the 20,000 tons of liquid produced annually for North America.
While Cardolite supplies much of its chemicals to the epoxy coatings industry for use in the boat-building business, Palmer focuses primarily on friction particles for the automotive sector, though each company at times competes directly with the other in both areas.
Stephen T. Palmer 3rd, chief executive of Palmer International, a family-owned business that employs 100, described Cardolite as well respected in the industry and a leader in the epoxy business. "Global competition has meant tremendous pressure to lower costs," Mr. Palmer said. As for his own business, Mr. Palmer began funneling resources into new product development.
Mr. Stonis, too, emphasized the necessity of research and development. Customers like Vijay Datta, technical director of ICI Devoe Coatings in Cleveland, praised Cardolite's research efforts.
"Nobody has as much in-depth knowledge of the chemistry of nutshell liquid as Cardolite," said Mr. Datta, a pioneer in the development of products using cashew nutshell liquid whose company buys Cardolite's chemicals to make coating for industrial maintenance uses on bridges and storage tanks. "Other people are just catching up to get me-too products."
Still, several years ago Mr. Stonis realized that innovation alone was not enough to stay ahead of the increasing competition in Cardolite's epoxy line.
"When Vantico snagged a major client of ours, the writing was on the wall," said Mr. Stonis. "We decided unless we do something it's a house of cards."
In a risky move, Cardolite significantly lowered its prices in hope of maintaining its lead. As a result, he said, prices are today 60 percent of what they were five years ago.
"We figured if we make these products more competitively priced, more people would switch to them and use them over other technologies," he said. "That has happened, not as much as we hoped, but it has happened."
Life as president of a specialty chemical company has been a series of tough strategic decisions in the past 10 years, none of which has made Mr. Stonis regret the decision he made in 1985 to buy Cardolite from 3M of St. Paul, Minn. At the time Mr. Stonis, a chemical engineer, was managing a plant in Antwerp, Belgium, for Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, for whom he had worked since 1969. Mr. Stonis was eager to move up from plant manager, having lobbied for and missed three promotions as managing director of a 3M subsidiary.
"The message to me was, 'It's over, Tony. This is you. Plant manager for the rest of your life,' " he said.
But Mr. Stonis had other plans. He had worked for 3M's cashew nutshell liquid plant in Newark in the 1970's and saw the potential -- especially for the cashew-derived epoxy curing agent developed by 3M in 1972. When he heard the operation was up for sale he watched the progress, figuring it would be snapped up in months.
After two years passed and the business was still on the market, word began to trickle out that 3M was ready to make a deal with anyone who showed interest. Mr. Stonis stepped forward and, in an example of a leveraged buyout popularized in the 80's, agreed to a deal in which 3M would finance $1 million of the $3 million needed to buy the plant and get it running, and Mr. Stonis would have to find the other $2 million.
After countless rejections Mr. Stonis finally won the ear of Fidelity Bank of Philadelphia. But days before the agreement for a working capital loan was to close in December 1985, a skittish Fidelity Bank said it would only proceed if 3M agreed to a short-term guarantee, which it did.
Suddenly Mr. Stonis had what he had wished for, the top position at a $7 million business with about 50 employees. Now what? Anybody could have done well from 1985 to 1990, admitted Mr. Stonis. The business had a strong market position and lots of momentum.
"We just took orders and made stuff," he said.
But by the early 1990's, Cardolite had to become more aggressive if it was to advance to the next level. Mr. Stonis hired an independent chemical consultant, Tom Hartley, to help him figure out how to expand the business. Mr. Hartley showed Mr. Stonis how to shift his management style from a production and manufacturing role to a more customer-focused approach. In turn, Cardolite has become more market-driven.
These days Mr. Stonis spends about 40 percent of his time traveling to countries like India, Brazil and Vietnam, where the production of cashew nutshell liquid is growing.
"It takes a guy like Tony Stonis to succeed in this industry," observed Mr. Bozarth. "He's on the cutting edge of technology and is always out there looking for new customers. He's much closer to the ground than a Dupont executive would be."

DATELINE: MILLBURN 

 BODY:
ONE look at its New American menu and its hip, Deco interior, and you can see the kind of restaurant Martini is trying to be. Every town could use one, and Millburn especially so -- not only for its own affluent, food-smart residents but for the before- and after-theater crowds that flock to the Paper Mill Playhouse, a few hundred yards up the road.
 Martini looks out at Main Street through many-paned windows, and it makes a cheery, bustling first impression. You're greeted by an amiable, black-clad host. If you like, she'll steer you to a table in a loud and lively front room dominated by a bar and a big martini glass of blue neon. If you've made a reservation, you'll be taken to a track-lighted dining room where the noise is muted and the focus seems to be on serious food. 
 In either room, the server brings a menu with a long list of martinis apparently named during a terminal attack of the cutes: the Yoohoo-tini, the Woo Woo-tini, the Bellini-tini and many more. Despite their names, these drinks (at least the few we sampled) are hearty and restorative. Unfortunately, things go downhill pretty rapidly from there.
When I first visited Martini, on a Sunday afternoon after a Paper Mill matinee last month, I was pleasantly taken aback by the chef's name on the menu: Pat Kotsonis, who had done a terrific job last year with Maize, the new restaurant near the Performing Arts Center in Newark. And our first appetizer, four big ravioli encasing lobster, scallops, spinach and shiitake mushrooms under a mantle of good tomato sauce, bore the Kotsonis imprint. They were aggressively flavored with tarragon, but the herb didn't obscure the star ingredients. Even the chewy, saffron-scented pasta made a contribution.
But that was the high point of our two visits. Whether or not Mr. Kotsonis was actually in the kitchen that Sunday, nothing else came near the level of those ravioli. And by the time of our second visit, a few weeks later, his name had vanished from the menu. Lee Jorge, a co-owner, told me that Mr. Kotsonis had moved on and that a team of young chefs was now running the kitchen.
If these people are a team, they need to start playing like one. While another appetizer of fried calamari and an entree of crab cakes were both decent if forgettable, the big production number on our first visit -- a special of red snapper over a black-bean salsa -- was a mess. The salsa, with accents of banana, pineapple and red onion, left a pleasant glow, but the fish, dusted with spices and spread with what might have been chipotle mayonnaise, was amazingly devoid of flavor or texture. And pizza and macaroni and cheese, fun food featured on the front-room menu to appeal to diners like the two 15-year-olds in our party, were tough and characterless.
The star of our second visit, this time on a Friday night in the dining room, was the Martini seafood tower, a gigantic martini glass filled with crushed ice, shrimp, raw clams and oysters, and the tail and claw of a small lobster. It looked impressive, even a little daunting, but when we unpacked it, it proved to be mostly glittery promise. Though the clams and oysters were briny and assertive, the shrimp and lobster had a slightly damp texture that suggested time in a freezer. The texture, however, wasn't as troubling as the price: $32 for an appetizer that barely served two. Tuna tartare, more modest and reasonable at $9, was a better choice. 
Steak, at $28 the most expensive of the main courses, delivered the most value. Billed as sirloin aged for 21 days, it lacked the flinty tang of aged beef. But it was generous and well prepared, and the topping of blue cheese and onions held our attention. By contrast, spaghetti primavera had all the excitement of a home economics lesson, a sodden pile of pasta, tomato sauce and miscellaneous vegetables that couldn't be redeemed by its few stalks of fresh, springlike asparagus.
The kitchen's uncertain relationship with seafood was on display in a highly touted special, salmon with blueberry sauce on a cake of wild rice. Blueberries, it turns out, are not a bad foil for salmon; the flavors played off gently against each other, and rosemary and peppercorns supplied distinct accents of their own. Too bad the fish was overcooked and dry. Shrimp and scallops -- again, their texture made me suspect they'd been thawed -- sat atop a pile of "risotto." (The quotation marks are the menu's; it's not clear what they signify, other than gumminess.) 
For dessert, a big plate of fresh and well-chosen berries needed nothing more than sweet whipped cream and a spoon. Fruit soup, served on our first visit but not in evidence on the second, was said to have been infused with 20 herbs; all we could pick out were two spices, clove and cinnamon, and a lot of sugar. Still, it was bracing. 
Chocolate souffle, light and moist, came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and some fresh raspberries. It was fine, but it would have been finer if the server hadn't delivered its accompaniment of chocolate sauce 10 minutes after the rest of the dessert -- to the wrong, and baffled, diner. Strawberry shortcake benefited from sweet, lemon-scented shortbread, fresh whipped cream and a welcome, unexpected kick of fresh basil and balsamic vinegar. If only the berries had been fresh, rather than macerated and soggy. And lemon tart was a heavy, eggy production that wasn't worth the calories or the $8 price tag. 
Martini is clearly a restaurant in transition, a new place struggling to find its footing against a brace of competitors. It is trying to please a lot of people with a lot of different formulas. Maybe it's trying just a little too hard. If it found a clearer focus, it would find a ready audience.

Urban Development

BYLINE:  By Ellen Tien 

 BODY:
This fall, even apartment dwellers on the lowest floors can enjoy views of the New York City skyline at street level, in the form of painted and beaded clothing and accessories, jewelry and, yes, fragrance bottles.
 At Shop Noir, an airbrushed Manhattan collection includes cotton dresses ($300), canvas fisherman hats ($90) and metallic leather handbags ($195) studded with rhinestones and emblazoned with the ultimate urban outline, reminiscent of the graffiti-art craze of the 80's. 
 To achieve a skyline waistline, Olive & Bette offers a black leather belt with a decorated buckle ($250). In a more architectural vein, the bottles for the most recent fragrance lines of DKNY and Christian Dior were both inspired by silhouettes from the city horizon. 
And at Saks Fifth Avenue, the skyline fairly skyrockets, with a $160,000 diamond bangle bracelet by Memoire Paris, a $5,000 necklace by Jennifer Eden Montgomery and a $3,960 beaded wedding gown by Helen Morley, designed to commemorate the opening of her new bridal boutique in the store.

HEADLINE: IN BRIEF; 
Forecasting Winner To Receive Pace U. Award

BYLINE:  By Stephanie Rosenbloom 

 BODY:
It may be 18 months before the economy rebounds from the current slowdown, in the view of Maria Fiorini Ramirez. She speaks with authority, as the winner of The Wall Street Journal's forecasting survey for the first half of 2001. 
 Ms. Ramirez, who heads her own consulting firm in Manhattan, is a 1972 graduate of Pace University, which has campuses in Westchester and New York City. In December, she will receive the university's Lubin Alumni Achievement Award. 
 Ms. Ramirez, 51, said she never considered going to college anywhere else. 
"There is no other university as close to the financial center," she said, referring to Pace's Manhattan campus. "If you want to hear the heartbeat of the financial community, Pace is closest to it." Pace was also closest to Ms. Ramirez's home in Brooklyn, enabling her to work and earn her degree and not lose too much time commuting. She graduated in three and a half years with a bachelor's degree in business administration and economics.
Her current economic forecast?
"We are in the grinding stage for the next six months to a year and a half before things get better," she said, predicting that tax revenue at the state and local levels will grow at a slower pace and corporate earnings will begin to rise in the early part of next year. 
Ms. Ramirez lives in New Jersey, but she and her husband have thought about moving to Westchester.
"We almost bought a house in Westchester in the 70's -- and in the 70's I thought it was expensive," she said with a laugh. "Of course, that would have been a good investment!"

A COLD CASE
By Philip Gourevitch
Farrar, Straus & Giroux
($22, hardcover)
 The Four-One precinct, when Rosenzweig started out as a patrolman there, had one of the highest crime rates in the world. "A fun place to work," he said. But he quickly found that many of his colleagues thought it was more fun to let the criminals work for them. The New York City Police Department back then was what he politely called "interesting" -- rife with men who regarded the badge more as a license to corruption than as a bond to public service and who took as their motto the infamous quip attributed to former mayor William O'Dwyer: "A cop who doesn't know how to make a buck out there shouldn't be a cop." 
 It wasn't as if everyone in the Four-One station house was on the take, but Rosenzweig, whose after-tax pay came to $95 a week, heard officers boasting that they collected as much as a thousand dirty dollars a month and that they never spent unpaid overtime hours in court because they hardly ever arrested anyone.

TALK STORIES
By Jamaica Kincaid
Farrar, Straus & Giroux
($23, hardcover)
Just the other day, we tried having our lunch while watching a Theatre at Noon production of Maria Irene Fornes's play "Dr. Kheal" at St. Peter's Church, which is on East 56th Street, and this new way of having lunch was far better than anything else we had tried.
There are two shows put on every weekday -- one at a quarter past 12 and the other at a quarter past one. We took the early show. We got to St. Peter's at noon sharp, taking our lunch along, as we had been given to understand we should do. At the door, we learned that there was no admission charge but that donations were invited. We made out donation, walked in with a sandwich (ham salad) and a soft drink (ginger beer), and hoped for a good time. We got a good time.

MAMBO MONTAGE:
The Latinization of New York
Edited by Agustin Lao-Montes
and Arlene Davila
Columbia University Press
($24.50, paperback)
Despite perceptions of segregation as a Southern phenomenon, New York City staged a significant part of the U.S. segregation drama throughout the 20th-century era of Jim Crow baseball, 1906-1950. More Major League and Negro League organizations called New York City home than any other North American city. Latinos appeared on each of the city's Major League teams before the breaking of baseball's color line in 1947: The New York Yankees, the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Dodgers. 
Their appearance on these teams started with Cuban-born Angel Aragon's brief stint with the Yankees in 1914; players such as Adolfo Luque, Miguel Angel Gonzalez and Jose Rodriguez followed during the 1910's. Latinos' first regular participation in black baseball circuits occurred in 1906 with the appearance of the Cuban Stars.
Over the nest four decades, Latinos appeared on several Negro League clubs that called New York City home: the Brooklyn Royal Giants, the Lincoln Giants, the Cuban Stars, the New York Black Yankees and the Brooklyn Eagles -- which moved to Newark after the 1935 season. Home of these different big league clubs, New York City served as a primary point of entry for Latinos into North American professional baseball.
Upon examination, the history of the New York Cubans and the social interactions of Latinos in Harlem unveil the manner in which the "Latins from Manhattan" were exposed to the social and economic realities of race and segregation in a northern city. . . .
Harlem was home to not just African-Americans but also Antiguans, Trinidadians, Puerto Ricans, Dominicans and Cubans. . . . Together they forged an "intra-racial ethnic community" that served as a creative center for black culture. In writing Harlem's poetry or stories, as did Countee Cullen or James Baldwin; . . . collecting black cultural artifacts, as did bibliophile Arturo (Arthur) Schomburg; or playing professional baseball, as did Rodolfo "Rudy" Fernandez, Harlemites blurred the binary notion of home and diaspora.

LIVING AT THE EDGE

of Grand Central Station
By Tina S. and Jamie Pastor Bolnick
St. Martin's Press
($24.95, hardcover)
After a few days in Bellevue I'm starting to feel really good. My arm still hurts and I still have the infection, but my stomach is getting used to being full again, I'm rested, my mind is clear of drugs.
It's kind of enlightening. Because when you're living with crack you're oblivious to everything but crack and how to get it. And when you've been off it three or four days, you start seeing things around you, taking in everything that's happening. Things that other people take for granted. Eggs and toast in the morning, and how good ice water tastes when you're thirsty. A funny show on TV that makes you laugh. Something nice a nurse says. Hot showers and feeling clean all over.
It's like somebody's pulled off your blinders. You see the sun come up, you see the sun go down. You know there are days and then nights and then days again, it's not all one long day until you come down off your binge.

HEADLINE: The Nation: The Yo-Yo Economy; 
Is That a Bounce or a Thud We Just Heard?

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
YEARNING for prosperity to return, the nation's forecasters grasped at shreds of good news last week as harbingers that the economy has finally hit bottom and is even beginning to bounce back.
 Retail sales were up slightly in July. Home construction turned in another strong month. Factory production stopped falling. Energy prices fell. And wages, despite all the recent layoff announcements, continued to rise a bit faster than inflation for millions of Americans. People seem to have money to spend, and the tax rebate checks could be a spirit-lifting bonus. 
 "There are hints in the data that suggest that we have hit bottom and we are starting to turn the corner, although the data are not yet convincing that this has happened," said Kenneth J. Matheny, senior economist at Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis forecasting firm. "Still, there is no reason to give up hope."
If Mr. Matheny's optimism sounds tortured, it is. Optimism these days requires a belief that the current slowdown, now 13 months old, is essentially no different than the previous downturns and recessions since World War II. There is considerable evidence, however, that it is different -- just different enough so that no forecaster, optimist or pessimist, can know when the bottom has been reached or what will happen next. Traditional forecasting fails to apply.
"The weakness in the economy has evolved in ways that do not respond very much to interest rate cuts, which are our standard cure," said Edward McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. 
The standard postwar downturn has been relatively short and sharp. Within a period of two years or less, a growing economy sinks rapidly into recession and bounces back. Rate cuts by the Federal Reserve produce the rebound, mainly by encouraging households to borrow and spend. Businesses then follow suit, investing in new equipment to meet the rising demand. Sometimes the rate cuts also help banks shake off losses from bad debts. That happened in the early 1990's.
This time, however, banks are healthy and consumers have barely flagged in their spending. The slowdown that started in last year's third quarter came mainly as a result of a rapid cutback in business investment in machinery, computers, software, buildings and the other tools used to produce goods and services. Corporate America, having suddenly lost faith in the profitability of its investments, flinched. What had been a spectacular boom in investment turned into a spectacular bust -- not only in high-technology industries but in many others as well.
"I do not think that we have had a slowdown since World War II that has been so completely dominated by the cutback in capital spending as this one," Mr. McKelvey said.
That is understandable: With profits shrinking, why invest in added capacity, particularly when the nation's companies can already produce much more in goods and services than the population is willing to buy. The frenzied overexpansion that made the late 1990's so prosperous is gone. The Fed's interest rate cuts -- a full 3 percentage points since early January, including a quarter-point cut last Tuesday -- are not likely to bring on more investment, not while excess capacity is such a problem.
Still, consumers continue to spend, helped by the rate cuts, and the economy avoids a recession. Instead of the usual pattern of strong growth-recession-strong growth, in rapid V-shaped succession, a third way may be emerging. The economy has been bouncing along the bottom for a year now, growing at an annual rate of well under 2 percent, which is not enough to raise profits and stop layoffs.
BOUNCING along the bottom indefinitely, caught between healthy growth and recession, would be a new American experience in the postwar decades. Like most forecasters, the Bush administration is counting on a bounceback. The administration announced last week that the budget surplus will come in at $600 million, excluding Social Security, in the current fiscal year -- but only if economic growth rises soon to an annual rate of more than 3 percent. Without that much growth, tax revenues would be insufficient to preserve the surplus.
Most forecasters are reluctant to acknowledge that this slowdown is different. They are counting on the national economy to return to its old ways. Their optimism assumes, in fact, that the old patterns will re-emerge and that economic growth will rise to more than 3 percent in next year's first quarter, from almost zero now. 
The hope is that the Fed's rate cuts will sustain consumption and housing activity. An extra push will come from the tax rebates and falling energy prices, which put more money in people's pockets. But for these good things to happen, four assumptions are essential.
One is that stock prices, having leveled off since April, will not plunge again, shrinking family wealth in the process and thus discouraging spending. The second is that housing prices, which have risen through the slowdown, will not reverse course, also reducing family wealth. The third is that inventories of unsold goods have finally shrunk sufficiently to encourage merchants to reorder in large enough quantities to lift industrial production. And fourth, corporate America will reverse the plunge in capital spending.
That fourth assumption, in particular, is a big one. Even Mr. Matheny, whose optimism reflects that of most forecasters, hedges his bets: "I'd say that the timing of a rebound in equipment investment is somewhat uncertain."
In such an iffy economy, accurate forecasting -- always something of an oxymoron -- is even iffier. And sudden improvements can be misleading.
Small changes in inventories, for example, can have a brief multiplier effect on economic growth. Rather than order new merchandise in the first half of the year, companies sold $54 billion worth of goods already on their shelves. In a $10 trillion economy, that sell-off deprived the nation of half a percentage point in economic growth. If in the second half, however, corporate America replaces the $54 billion in stockpiled goods, then the stepped up industrial production necessary to replenish shelves would add half a percentage point to overall economic growth. 
That rapid swing would make Mr. Matheny's forecast of a rebound seem prescient. The tax rebates might even encourage businesses to replenish merchandise for Christmas. But then what? Sustained growth requires constant encores, and pessimistic forecasters like Mr. McKelvey do not see any in the wings. On the contrary, he sees obstacles.
The private sector -- households and businesses -- is overloaded with debt. Worried consumers are gradually buying fewer autos and other big-ticket items, despite the rate cuts, according to the University of Michigan's latest consumer confidence surveys. And profits keep shrinking, hardly an incentive to revive capital spending.
"We could be in for a long period of weak growth," Mr. McKelvey said. "Not necessarily contraction, but a weak economy that bounces along the bottom."

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Volkswagen EuroVan, Chevrolet Avalanche and Pontiac Aztek; 
Have Tent, Will Travel

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: HIGHLAND, Mich. 

 BODY:
ONE of the most magnificent sunrises I've seen was over the Shenandoah Valley, through my car's windshield. I was returning to Syracuse University from spring break in Florida. Having driven virtually nonstop from Daytona Beach, I couldn't go another mile by the time I reached Virginia. I pulled off and caught a few hours' sleep behind the wheel of my 1970 Opel Kadett, then awoke to see the sun peek gloriously over the mountaintops.
 Sleeping in my car was not my first choice. I was broke. A student on scholarship with college loans mounting, I couldn't afford a hotel room. This was the only way I could spend spring break on the beach. 
 Some years later, I was a reporter covering Detroit's automobile industry. It was the early 1980's, and Detroit was in the depths of the worst recession in decades. News reports showed people in soup lines and families sleeping in their cars. 
Now, in 2001, people are living in nouveau castles and driving sport utility vehicles three times the size of my first car. And, again, they are sleeping in their vehicles.
This time, they want to. Automakers are encouraging the trend, offering tents, mattresses and coolers that let city dwellers turn their vans, sport utilities and pickup trucks into weekend quarters on wheels.
This summer, my family put some of these sleepmobiles to the test. After a couple of weekends, I was grateful to be back in my cozy bed at home, but I had to concede that the vehicles I tested were more accommodating than my cramped old Opel.

CHEVROLET AVALANCHE Accompanied by my two children and an adult friend, I drove the Avalanche to a rustic state campground near this town northwest of Detroit. Though not a long drive from my house in the suburbs, it was a pleasant one.
The Avalanche combines the spacious, comfortable cab of Chevrolet's full-size Suburban with a short pickup bed that can be expanded by folding the back seat and opening a panel, called a midgate, at the rear of the cabin. Though large, the Avalanche is surprisingly maneuverable and unexpectedly quiet. I could see the four of us traveling cross-country quite comfortably.
The Avalanche has the added advantage of being able to carry a ton -- actually, about 1,300 pounds -- of stuff. We crammed in a dazzling array of gear: our own eight-person tent, sleeping bags, coolers, air mattresses, luggage and groceries. In the bed, under a hard three-piece tonneau cover that locks, it was safe from thieves and storms.
The tonneau panels are so light that one person can remove them. We also took out the glass and folded the ingenious midgate. With the midgate open and the rear seats folded, we had loads of camping space.
The Avalanche that I drove -- very well-equipped, at $37,000 -- also had camping accessories that are sold through dealers: a $230 tent and a $190 cooler that plugs into the truck's power outlet (and converts to a food warmer at the touch of a switch).
Thanks to a lesson from representatives of Chevy and General Motors' Service Parts Operations, we got the tent up within 15 minutes, a little less time than it took to put up our regular tent. An elastic band at the top of the tent fits snugly over the cab, tucking into a gap at the back of the roof. The rest of the tent pulls over the pickup bed with the zippered door at the tailgate. The tent takes its shape from collapsible poles that slide into loops and clasps similar to those on any camping tent. To hold everything in place, straps hook into the wheel wells; others, under the tailgate, snap together.
There was just one shortcoming: we had to inflate our air mattress at a gas station. The Avalanche's designers thought of nearly everything, including clever locking bins, but they didn't include a built-in air compressor -- a feature on some lesser G.M. vehicles that do not come with tents.
When the last cinders of our bonfire were out, we plugged the cooler into a power outlet near the trailer hitch. Two of us climbed into the back of the Avalanche. The tent's high ceiling and the large opening into the cabin gave our quarters an airy feel.
We learned too late that one should park on flat ground. I awoke in the night to find I was rolling downhill. By daylight, it was obvious we had parked on a slope.
Aside from that, we had a comfortable night. The cooler worked well -- too well. We poured milk with ice crystals onto our Cheerios. But the device took a lot of power; after breakfast, we found that we'd drained the Avalanche's battery and needed a jump. Chevrolet should consider putting a heavy-duty battery in the Avalanche, and a clear warning that the cooler-heater should be plugged in only for short periods.

VOLKSWAGEN EUROVAN On our next trip, we brought two friends of my 13-year-old daughter, Lauren, and a Volkswagen EuroVan MV. The quirky EuroVan recently got a much-needed infusion of power and a $5,000 price cut, making it more competitive with mainstream minivans.
The model we tested had the Weekender package, which turns the EuroVan into sleeping quarters for four adults for $3,235 more than the $28,315 base price.
The package adds a pop-up camper top, which creates a sleeping area up above for two, and a two-person bed down below, which is made by folding the rear seats. The package also includes window screens, curtains and a folding table between the second row of rear-facing seats and the third row of front-facing seats.
True outdoors enthusiasts might consider another EuroVan model, the $38,971 Camper by Winnebago. It has a sink, an L.P. gas stove, water tanks and a furnace.
The EuroVan's upright, boxy shape makes for a cavernous interior, though most minivans use their space better, with more storage compartments. But the vast space proved beneficial in loading a half-dozen sleeping bags, a portable grill and the belongings of six campers -- including three teenage girls who don't travel light.
Fortunately, the campsite was nearby. The EuroVan's seats are far too upright, and permit too little adjustment, for long journeys. But the vehicle is convenient for carrying people and things. The girls folded down the table to play checkers throughout the weekend.
The roof is pushed up from inside, which takes some muscle but can be done in seconds. It closes quickly, too, though you have to tuck the canvas sides under the metal cover.
We were glad it was so easy to drop the top, given that we had to move fast when nature called for our rookie teenage campers. They refused to use the outhouses nearby, insisting on being driven to "real" bathrooms with flush toilets, mirrors and outlets for hair dryers.
That night, I bunked in the upper compartment with my nine-year-old son, Tom. Climbing up there requires some agility. You have to stand on the seat armrests and pull yourself up. That isn't a problem for monkeylike children but it can be a challenge for out-of-shape middle-aged women. Tom and I positioned ourselves with our feet toward the back of the van where the roof slants and the space narrows. Our heads looked out above the front seats.
My son fell asleep instantly, but I lay anxiously awake in the tight space. I considered climbing down and taking the bed that can be made from the seats, but I didn't want to wake my son. And I remembered my last camping trip in a EuroVan; I awoke that time in a claustrophobic panic. So I unzipped the canvas side panels, gazed at the stars and breathed deeply until I fell asleep.

PONTIAC AZTEK Our bright yellow $30,000 Aztek came with the $195 camping package, which includes a tent and mattress. These packages are proving popular, and are now included in about a quarter of the 2,500 Azteks sold each month.
Indeed, a group of Aztek owners on the East Coast recently used the Internet to organize a camping expedition. Other "Teks," as they call themselves on the Net, are planning camping trips in other regions.
While not nearly as big as the Avalanche, the Aztek -- which is based on G.M.'s minivans -- still holds a respectable amount of cargo, certainly enough for an overnight trip for three people. Its ride is comfortable, and it has some cool features. A separate set of stereo controls in the cargo area, plus speakers angled toward the rear, are perfect for tailgate parties. The tailgate itself has molded-in seating and cup holders. The center console, which lifts out, doubles as a beverage cooler.
We were rushed on this trip and didn't head to the campground until dusk. Then we unzipped the package containing the tent and found that we had no directions, no picture, no diagram. Nor had we received a demonstration. As a now-experienced camper, I figured I didn't need one.
But I did. I couldn't figure out how to attach the tarp or where to put the single collapsible pole. Our Aztek came with an optional pull-out drawer in the cargo area, which is convenient for carrying groceries in its compartments, and for keeping the deflated mattress and folded tent handy for a spontaneous trip.
But the drawer's presence raised a significant question: Should I toss the mattress on top of the drawer, or remove the drawer? If I removed it, what would I do with the mounting hardware underneath? If I left it in place, it might rip the mattress.
In frustration, I wadded the tent into the back of the vehicle and went home. (Fortunately, we were less than a half-hour away.) Later, Pontiac representatives provided a demonstration and easy-to-follow directions. Indeed, raising the tent is simple once you saw it done.
But some of the moves are not intuitive. The drawer, for instance, is removed for camping, as is the hardware beneath it (by simply pushing a couple of buttons). The hatch should be partly closed while you put the tent over it and tuck its edges in the doors. You raise the roof by lifting the hatch. The straps, which hooked into the wheel wells and buckled under the open tailgate, were similar to those of the Avalanche.
We never got to sleep in the Aztek, but the quarters looked pretty similar to the Avalanche's -- just tighter.
Having closed the chapter on our camping expeditions this summer, I could see the allure of these tented vehicles. They can be set up quickly. They are comfortable. If it's hot, you can temporarily switch on the air-conditioning; in the cold, you can briefly turn up the heat. In rain, you don't wake up in a soggy sleeping bag on the ground. And you can keep the mosquitoes and other critters where they belong -- out of the car.

INSIDE TRACK: There's no place like home.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Fewer Cars On the Lot, But Not Yet A Recovery

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
FOR many months, most economists have had a reassuring explanation for why the American economy has been slowing down: Companies had bloated inventories of unsold goods and hardly needed to produce more.
 That suggests that the economy will rebound sometime in the second half of this year, once businesses raise production to restock their warehouses. 
 But even though inventories have dropped, the economy has not yet bounced back. It seems to have other, deeper problems requiring more inventory cuts for a rebound, especially in autos. 
"We kidded ourselves for several months that it was an inventory adjustment," said Jacques A. Nasser, the chief executive of Ford Motor, at a conference of auto analysts on Aug. 8. At a luxury car show in California last weekend, Mr. Nasser said he saw nothing that could prompt an economic recovery in the next 12 to 18 months. "We keep asking ourselves what will it be, what action will happen in the economy that will stimulate confidence in buying again, and we just don't see it," he observed.
Yet inventories have been drawn down considerably. Many economists now expect that when Commerce Department officials revise their figures on Wednesday for the nation's economic output in the second quarter, they will decide that inventories dropped even faster than the previous estimate of $26.9 billion. That downward revision could even lead to a revised calculation for second-quarter economic growth to zero -- or even to a slight contraction. 
The unrevised figures already show that manufacturers' inventories dropped by 4 percent from February to June, a precipitous fall that brought them back to late 1999 levels. By the end of June, manufacturers had stocks equal to just 1.29 months of sales, the seventh-lowest monthly ratio in the last decade.
That indicates that while the warehouses of telecommunications companies may still be stuffed with unwanted fiber optic cable gear, and while some automakers may have too many sport utility vehicles, other manufacturers can see bare floors at their distribution centers.
Nor is the improvement in inventories limited to manufacturers. Retailers' inventories are now back to the level of late 1999. Only wholesalers' inventories are still fairly high, and even they have edged down somewhat from a peak last winter.
But inventories are sustainable at 1999 levels only if sales do not fall below the strong levels of that year. The sector to watch is autos, whose troubles could ripple across the economy.
Automakers will not announce their August sales until Sept. 4, but executives have already begun guiding Wall Street to expect sales at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 16.1 million cars and light trucks. That would be the lowest rate since last December, when it dipped to 15.8 million, prompting Detroit to idle many assembly plants for a week or two at a time.
As General Motors pointed out in an unusual statement on Tuesday, this year is still likely to be the third best in the industry's history, after 2000 and 1999. But G.M., Ford and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler have been bleeding market share steadily and increasingly need a market closer to 17 million to keep their factories running at full throttle.
At the end of July, the auto industry had total inventories equal to 56 days of sales, only a day more than is normal for that time of year. But that average obscures the fact that low inventories at foreign automakers were offsetting large and growing inventories at Ford and G.M. in particular, and to a lesser extent at Chrysler, said John Casesa, an auto analyst at Merrill Lynch.
That mismatch among companies can pose economic difficulties. Foreign automakers tend to rebuild inventories by shipping extra parts and vehicles from overseas -- most of their American factories are already running full tilt. Detroit manufacturers adjust to large inventories by trimming output in the United States.
"Investors are being too optimistic about the inventory and production outlook for the industry," Mr. Casesa said.
The Federal Reserve, an early adherent to the inventory correction theory, is now tiptoeing away from it. When the Fed pushed down interest rates on Jan. 31, it said that "manufacturing production has been cut back sharply, with new technologies appearing to have accelerated the response of production and demand to potential excesses in the stock of inventories and capital equipment."
Last Tuesday, when it cut rates for the seventh time this year, the Fed did not mention inventories. Instead, it blamed weaker business investment here and slower economic growth overseas.

HEADLINE: A Lavender Haze Rises Over Manhattan 

BYLINE:  By CATHY HORYN 

 BODY:
DO you clench your jaw?"
 Do I clench my jaw? This was an understatement. No dentist has ever looked in my mouth without drawing this conclusion. Only now these words were coming from someone who had no interest in my pulverized dentition. Evelyn Hathaway was pressing a thumb against the back of my neck, around the hairline, where years of jaw clenching were evidently discernible to her touch. 
 Ms. Hathaway is a masseuse at a new day spa downtown called Maximus. Up to that point, Ms. Hathaway had behaved like any other professional accustomed to kneading the tired limbs of New Yorkers. She was pleasant. She covered me with a warm blanket. She dimmed the lights, which splashed different colors on the glass walls every few minutes, in an effect the owner of the spa, Richard Calcasola, called "lumination enhancement." She asked me if there was any special ache I wanted her to take care of. She said this with impressive certainty, like a hit man.
Settling in for what I assumed would be a soothing if routine massage, I shut my eyes and mentally made out a grocery list: eggs, milk . . . maybe some of that nice hummus at Dean & Deluca. . . . 
"Do you clench your jaw?"
If you haven't noticed, a rash of new day spas has erupted in New York recently, each promising new attractions to catch the eye of jaded beauty consumers. In the last year alone there have been Ajune, a spa opened by a plastic surgeon, and Skin Care Lab, opened by dermatologists. Cleo II, a chain of nail salons, is expanding into spas that offer late-night services. The Greenhouse spa offers Indian-inspired treatments like chickpea powder foot exfoliation. The Stone spa specializes in hot stone massage. Even the 92nd Street Y opened a spa featuring beauty treatments early this summer. And there's no end in sight. 
Maximus, an ultra-design 6,000-square-foot hair salon and spa in SoHo, opened about two weeks ago. The Brigitte Mansfield European Spa, in Union Square, began dispensing caviar-laced treatments last April. There is the Eden Day Spa, in TriBeCa, which opened in June, and in a few weeks, John Masters, a hairdresser who specializes in organic beauty treatments, will offer spa services at his new salon, also in SoHo.
Until 1996, when Marcia Kilgore opened Bliss, on Broadway near Prince Street, most of the so-called day spas were uptown, in semi-dotty places like Elizabeth Arden, where they generally excelled at providing decent service in an atmosphere of hushed Hungarian-magic-creme mystery. Who knew what those hair-netted European ladies were dabbing on your face? Just the notion of having a facial seemed exotic. "These days, if you live in New York and you haven't had a facial, it's odd," said Ms. Kilgore, who opened her first business, Let's Face It, in 1993.
Of the nearly 5,700 spas in the United States, including well-known resort spas like Golden Door and Canyon Ranch, more than 75 percent are day spas, according to the International Spa Association. Since 1994, the number of new day spas across the country has increased 127 percent, making it one of the fastest growing segments of the spa industry, which had revenue last year of $5 billion. 
But even in sebum-rich, stressed-out New York, is there enough demand to keep all the loofah scrubbers happy? Naturally, the owners of the newest day spas think there is. "What Bliss did for the entire industry is put the word 'day spa' on everybody's Rolodex," said Mr. Calcasola, who also owns spa-salons in Merrick and Westbury, on Long Island. "There is demand if you are professional and you don't treat spa as an ancillary service. It is a business. You can't just jump on the bandwagon and suddenly become Mary Jane's Beauty Box and Spa."
Amy Astley, the beauty director of Vogue, thinks there's plenty of demand, and points to the continued popularity of Bliss, where a Saturday appointment for a facial is a two-to-three-month wait. (Ms. Kilgore plans to open a London spa in early November and expects to open three or four spas around this country in the next few years, as well as 150 QuickBliss locations, for manicures and pedicures.) "Even in a slow economy, I think a lot of people, especially New Yorkers, will give up something else before they give up their beauty treatments," Ms. Astley said. "They still think, I live and suffer in New York, therefore I deserve to pamper myself."
Now that everyone wants in on the action, you have to wonder how good all these places are going to be. Day spas now have to come up with slicker packaging and elaborately creative treatments to distinguish themselves. And they must compete for talented technicians. Last week, I tried three of the latest additions to sample some of the new tricks in state-of-the-art pampering. 
Maximus seems well run, with a slight high-tech advantage over the other new rivals. The big leather chairs in the shampoo area of the salon have motorized massage features, and I noticed that a toilet seat in the spa locker room offered this function, too. Mr. Calcasola has set up a marble "steam bar," so patrons embarking on facials can pause for a few minutes to have their pores opened by a mild blast of steam and oxygen while an attendant mixes a suitable "face cocktail" of cleansers and toners. The spa itself looked spotless, and the design was sterile chic: concrete floors, white-curtained glass walls and white porcelain sinks on cabinets.
Simona Rusu, who has performed facials and various water therapies for 20 years, took me into the water room at Maximus for Mr. Calcasola's piece de resistance -- the water journey. This is a three-part excursion, beginning with a full-body salt scrub, then a hose-down with warm water from overhead jets. This was a little like lying under a rain gutter in a downpour. After that, I climbed into a tub of furiously bubbling water and soaked for about 10 minutes. The third phase -- a shower room where water falls on you at the rate of 80 gallons a minute -- still had a few kinks in it, so I couldn't experience that.
Maximus has a straightforward menu of spa services, including a deep-treatment facial ($90) and the all-in-one water journey and full body massage ($140).
Both the Eden and Brigitte Mansfield spas offered service that seemed to be no more than adequate. Eden is spacious, decorated with long billowing curtains dividing a lounge area where customers can have pedicures and reflexology treatments ($75) while watching projection television. 
But the staff, while eager to please, seemed young and disorganized, and I had to pad around in my robe and slippers for a moment until someone took charge of me. Also, the place seemed clean enough, but when I peeked into the water therapy room, I noticed a sink collapsed on the floor and the tile floor itself scuffed with dark marks. This wouldn't entice me further.
At Brigitte Mansfield, the masseuse who gave me a hot-stone massage was competent, but, with only two years of massage experience, she lacked Ms. Hathaway's know-how and sense of confidence. The spa itself, on a fourth floor overlooking Union Square, is all-white, thickly carpeted and has large treatment rooms.
Ms. Mansfield, a former model who developed her own line of caviar-based skincare products, said she wanted a spa that emphasized traditional European recipes, like a creme-fraiche body wrap or a mustard powder foot bath. "I want treatments that work," Ms. Mansfield said. She agreed that Lower Manhattan, particularly SoHo, was now saturated with spas, but said she believed that by offering a soothing atmosphere and extra-large rooms, she can offer an alternative to places like Bliss. "I feel like Bliss has become a factory -- there's no personal care," she said.
Ms. Kilgore said she was not concerned about a glut of spas. "I worry about myself and my own business, and not really about everyone else," she said. Still, she finds it intriguing that so many new spas are emphasizing space and relaxation, and such things as nature music, waterfalls and light therapies. "I just can't get into that," Ms. Kilgore said. "We're a little more tongue in cheek than that. People don't come to a spa expecting to have an ephiphany." She added: "Anyway, we're not trying to be so ethereal about it. When you make a spa superfancy, then people don't know how to act. It gives them -- it gives them spa performance anxiety."

It's Time to Look Beyond Conventional Wisdom on the Dollar

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
WITH the dollar down 8.3 percent in the last month and a half against the euro and off 4.4 percent against the yen, some money managers are saying investors should take the hint.
 "You want to own international stocks instead of U.S. stocks when the dollar is falling," said Richard G. Pell, chief investment officer at Julius Baer Investment Management. 
 Indeed, a drop in the dollar's value means that returns from abroad are improved when they are translated into dollars, just as foreign returns are reduced when the dollar rallies. And some data indicates that dollar movements play a big role in investor returns. 
But if investors are shifting abroad just because the dollar is weakening, it is not a good bet.
The dollar has helped foreign markets outperform the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index many times. In the 27 years since the dollar was allowed to float freely in foreign exchange markets, the Morgan Stanley Capital International index of developed stock markets outside the United States and Canada has outperformed the S.& P. 500 in 13 of them. In 8 of those 13, a declining dollar was adding to American returns. "In the world of statistics, that is a pretty strong pattern," said James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis.
Separately, the dollar has increased gains or reduced losses from abroad 13 times since the end of 1973. The average boost has been 11.5 percentage points in the performance of the developed market index, which is known as EAFE, for Europe, Australasia and the Far East. For example, the EAFE local-currency gain of 25.4 percent in 1985 jumped to 53 percent after the dollar's decline was factored in. The most recent positive swing was in 1998, when a local EAFE gain of 10.6 percent grew to 18.2 percent in dollar terms.
The average negative effect of the dollar, when it has been rising, has been 7.9 percentage points. The biggest negative swing in the EAFE index came in 1984, when an 18.4 percent gain, in local currency, shrank to 5 percent in dollar terms. In 2000, the 8.5 percent decline in the index turned into a 15.2 percent plunge, in dollars.
But there are caveats that indicate it is better to invest abroad when you think foreign stocks will outperform the ones you can buy at home.
The biggest dollar declines have been set off by political decisions. Three of the eight dollar declines that helped the EAFE outperform the S.& P. 500 came when the United States and its industrial allies actively sought to force the dollar lower against other major currencies after the Plaza agreement in 1985. The Clinton administration also talked down the dollar against the yen in the early 1990's. But this kind of easy-to-play dollar decline is not likely to occur again any time soon.
There were five years when the dollar was rising and reducing American gains but when the EAFE still outperformed the S.& P. 500. In addition, there appears to have been some correlation recently between a weakening dollar and weaker performance in foreign stock markets.
These two facts suggest that over the last decade the dollar has often been an indicator of economic health around the world. If that is the case, a stable or rising dollar could mean foreign markets are going to be better performers. Although the dollar rose smartly in 1999, reducing returns from abroad by 6.4 percentage points, the EAFE still climbed 25.3 percent, outdoing the 19.5 percent gain in the S.& P. 500.
NICHOLAS P. SARGEN, global market strategist for J. P. Morgan's private clients, says it is important to consider why the dollar is falling. If the euro were getting stronger -- and the dollar weaker -- because analysts were revising upward their economic outlook for Europe, that would be good for stocks, and the weaker dollar would bolster returns for Americans.
But he thinks the dollar is falling because the outlook for the United States economy is a little bleaker, which could be bad for American and foreign stocks.

Here's One Treaty That the Bush Team Loves, to Death

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
RICHARD ARMITAGE, the deputy secretary of state, is known as a blunt-speaking, down-to-earth public official. He minced few words in Australia recently, and hit a nerve surprisingly raw for a country considered one of the United States's most dependable allies. 
 The Bush administration has irritated many allies with its aversion to treaties, especially the Kyoto Protocol on global warming and the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. Mr. Armitage, however, raised hackles as he singled out a treaty that the administration is partial to: the Australian-New Zealand United States Treaty, or Anzus, a mutual defense pact signed at the start of the cold war. 
 So partial, in fact, that the deputy secretary felt compelled to remind Australians that Americans would die to fulfill it -- and that Washington would expect an equal sacrifice. 
Blending what Australians interpreted as condescension and old-fashioned militarism, Mr. Armitage declared: "I'm not sure all our friends here in Australia understand the significance of an alliance to Americans. It's not a matter of political convenience or economic interaction, although some of that, inevitably.
"But for us, an alliance is an obligation, if necessary, to fight and die for each other. That's what it means. That's why an alliance is submitted to the U.S. Congress. It has to be debated. Because we're talking about, for the U.S. side, our sons and daughter fighting and dying if Australia comes under attack. And by the way, we're talking about Australian sons and daughters who would be willing to sacrifice their lives to help defend the United States." (New Zealand's children are safe: that country dropped out of the treaty because it objected to Washington's nuclear policies.)
Now, Mr. Armitage likes Australia. He travels there relatively frequently, and has often expressed affection and admiration for the country. And Australians generally admire the United States. They cite common characteristics -- independence of spirit, absence of the British class system, love of sports and the outdoors. But -- usually beneath the surface -- there is also a streak of resentment at being bossed around by "the Yanks." Memories of Australia's painful involvement in Vietnam, prompted by a request from Lyndon B. Johnson, still rankle. 
Australians worry that the United States may someday make a similar request over Taiwan. In fact, Mr. Armitage, visiting as a private citizen two years ago, angered Australians by suggesting that Washington would expect them to fight alongside Americans to protect Taiwan if the Chinese invaded. 
And his recent comments were widely interpreted as another preview of a call to arms over Taiwan -- even though he also said that the "threat assessment" on the likelihood for such a conflict "has actually receded a fair amount."
SO the momentum of an anti-Armitage backlash gathered rather quickly. Leading the charge was a former prime minister, Malcolm Fraser. A conservative, Mr. Fraser said in the newspaper The Australian that years ago, American officials "would not even dream of telling Australia publicly what we must do."
"That such people are now prepared to tell Australians this," he wrote, "represents a fundamental change in Anzus." 
He went on to suggest that Australia reduce its efforts to maintain a strong relationship with Washington, and replace it by a greater emphasis on improved relations with Asian nations. 
Mr. Fraser was actually being quite polite. Irritated by the Bush administration's heavy hand, he suggested Australia should withdraw from Anzus altogether. That was, coincidentally, about a month before President Bush's announcement last week that America would, at some point, withdraw from one of its own scorned pacts: the 1972 ABM Treaty.

HEADLINE: New York's Drug Laws 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Your Aug. 23 editorial "Full Employment Prisons" points out that upstate legislators whose districts derive economic benefits from large prison populations may oppose reforming New York State's drug laws. 
 But there is also reason for optimism. Despite this year's messy budget talks, Gov. George E. Pataki and the State Assembly have presented proposals to reform these drug laws, which are the country's harshest. If all concerned work in good faith toward a law that substantially reduces the number of nonviolent, low-level drug offenders in prison -- 22,000 last year -- comprehensive drug-law reform should pass this year.

The Dark Side of the Global Economy

BYLINE:  By ALISON SMALE 

 BODY:
IN Eastern Europe, traffickers ship girls through the Balkans and into sex slavery. Russians launder money through tiny Pacific islands that have hundreds of banks but scarcely any roads. Colombian drug barons accumulate such vast resources that they can acquire a Soviet submarine to ship cocaine to the United States.
 In the decade since the Soviet Union fell, there has been an explosion of international crime, which governments are just beginning to fight. And yet, on reflection, it is clear that the globalization of crime is a logical outcome of the fall of Communism. 
 Capitalism and Communism, ideologies that served as intellectual straitjackets for Americans and Soviets, allowed them to feel justified in using unsavory proxies to fight their cold war. When those alliances dissolved, those proxies sought other outlets to maintain -- or improve -- their positions. The transformation of apparatchiks into gangsters or money-launderers in the former Soviet republics and the Balkans is just the most familiar example.
Angola presents another. Its civil war was cast as a struggle for democratic or Communist domination, but it rages still, financed by revenues from the very oil and diamonds that once intrigued the superpowers. (The diamonds are smuggled throughout Africa by a network run by, according to United Nations reports, a former Soviet army translator.) 
Another significant boost for international crime came not from proxies, but from principals. In the Soviet Union, the authorities themselves often scrambled for new sources of income and power as the Communist Party's grip loosened, blurring the lines between officials and those who operated beyond the law. 
This was by no means the first such fusion in history, but it was the first in a country with so vast a military arsenal. In the past decade, much of the American engagement with the old Soviet bloc has been an effort to stop military equipment and weapons of mass destruction -- or the knowledge of how to make them -- from passing to unfriendly regimes, terrorists or criminal networks. 
The end of the cold war also brought a burst of international financial growth. But wealthy nations' push toward a new, more open global economy -- through the growth of communications and the lowering of trade and financial barriers -- also produced a global casino in which money could be moved around easily and instantly. If it was the fall of the Berlin Wall that spurred the relatively unrestricted movement of people, it was the growth of that casino that enabled the criminals to hide and move their ever-expanding holdings.
Today, the power of immensely wealthy criminals to overwhelm weak states is one of the real challenges faced by the Bush administration. A recent report -- prepared by the National Intelligence Council, a body of senior intelligence officials working alongside the C.I.A., and with outside experts -- ranks it among the new threats to American security.
Of course, traditional organized crime was there all along. It just got bigger. 
When the Soviet Union collapsed, most of its institutions imploded, said Stephen Handelman, author of "Comrade Criminal: Russia's New Mafia" (Yale University Press, 1995). Criminal groups that had sprung up in the dying days of the Communist system "took up where the government left off," he said. "The Mafia did not spring wholly formed from the earth in 1991; it was always there, and had a close connection with government officials." 
Shady characters in East and West wasted no time establishing links after the Wall came down. Members of the well-established Italian and the newly minted Russian mafias began meeting in Prague, Budapest, Vienna and Berlin. The police observed, but were virtually powerless to act; a telling image of the early 1990's was of impoverished police in burned-out east European sedans giving vain chase to the sleek Mercedes favored by the newly monied.
THESE criminal groups, Mr. Handelman said, penetrated local, regional and then central government. Meanwhile, the West was shoveling over aid, hoping that Communist societies would be reborn as free-market democracies and that the newly rich would invest at home. Instead, the old intelligentsia was impoverished and became susceptible to bribes. The new middle class and the hugely rich, to avoid bad banks and impossible taxes, stashed money abroad. "We thought: 'We'll give them money, and eventually it will trickle down,' " Mr. Handelman said. "It ended up trickling out." 
That cash is hard to trace. Cyprus, for instance, became a banking haven for Russians and for the Yugoslav regime of Slobodan Milosevic. The island's government is now looking harder at the origins of the money in its numerous banks, but tracing Mr. Milosevic's funds has proven close to impossible. And, noted Mr. Handelman, "if Cyprus shuts down, the Russians will just go to Vanuatu, or London, or New York." 
The report that warned of the power of wealthy criminals, Global Trends 2015, gives some idea of the scale of the illegitimate economy: narcotics trafficking remains the overwhelming king, with annual revenues estimated at $100 billion to $300 billion. Automobile theft in the United States and Europe, by comparison, nets $9 billion, and the fast-growing trade in smuggling people $7 billion, according to the report. The Center for Public Integrity in Washington estimates that every third cigarette exported is sold on the black market.
There are less tangible costs, too. The 2015 report estimates that corruption costs about $500 billion a year -- 1 percent of the global economy -- in slower growth, reduced foreign investment and lower profits.
On this shadowy stage, politicians struggle to identify crimes, to punish and control. The United Nations has adopted conventions against new crimes; a task force of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development publishes an annual list of money launderers. And the European Union is beginning to define the crime of trafficking in human beings and to pool resources to fight the criminals who smuggle in as many as 500,000 people a year. 
Thomas Bodstrom, justice minister in Sweden, which led the union for the first half of this year, is most concerned with the enforced prostitution of tens of thousands of women trafficked mainly from the poor east of Europe. In Sarajevo, he met a woman who said she had been "sold" 18 times. 
"I think it surprised all of us that it was actually slavery going on in Europe," he said. "Bosnia has just been in a war -- there is not the same possibility to have authority. But what can we say in Europe? In Sweden? Or in Holland? They are selling people." How many people, smuggled by whom? Mr. Bodstrom was disarmingly frank. "The truth," he replied, 'is that we don't know."

Life in Technology Stocks Helps the Market

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Encouraged by relatively positive projections from the technology sector, investors shook off some jitters from early in the week, when the Federal Reserve indicated that the economy might be worsening.
 The negative outlook expressed by the Fed on Tuesday, when it lowered the target for short-term interest rates for the seventh time this year, hurt stocks that day and kept investors cautious. 
 But on Friday, after Cisco Systems said its decline in sales was stabilizing, investors reacted as though the worst might be over for stocks. The Nasdaq composite index gained more than 4 percent for the day, and all of the major indexes made up for losses earlier in the week.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 182.39 points, or 1.78 percent, to 10,423.17. The Nasdaq gained 49.79 points, or 2.67 percent, to 1,916.80, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 22.96 points, or 1.98 percent, to 1,184.93.
 Long-term bond prices fell, pushing up yields, as investors shifted money into the stock market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, a barometer of interest rate trends, rose to 4.92 percent from 4.83 percent the previous week. MICHAEL BRICK

The Enduring Legacy of the South's Civil War Victory

BYLINE:  By DAVID BRION DAVIS; David Brion Davis is the director of the Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance and Abolition at Yale University.

 BODY:
THE United States is only now beginning to recover from the Confederacy's ideological victory following the Civil War. Though the South lost the battles, for more than a century it attained its goal: that the role of slavery in America's history be thoroughly diminished, even somehow removed as a cause of the war. The reconciliation of North and South required a national repudiation of Reconstruction as "a disastrous mistake"; a wide-ranging white acceptance of "Negro inferiority" and of white supremacy in the South; and a distorted view of slavery as an unfortunate but benign institution that was damaging for whites morally but helped civilize and Christianize "African savages." 
 The current national debate about slavery and its role in American history is finally forcing not only a discussion of reparations, but, more important, a re-examination of the long-accepted message conveyed by respected white scholars whose textbooks on slavery, the Civil War and Reconstruction were still being assigned to college students in the 1950's and even later. It was the message reinforced at countless Memorial Day celebrations, where white Union and Confederate veterans shook hands and recalled their collective heroism, while survivors of the 200,000 black Union soldiers and sailors crucial in helping win the war were not welcome. It was the message bestowed on the white veterans by Woodrow Wilson, the first Southerner elected president after the Civil War, during the huge 50th reunion at Gettysburg in 1913. 
 Consider that Wilson's most beloved film was the popular "The Birth of a Nation," of 1915, which glorified the Ku Klux Klan and depicted freed male slaves as beasts lusting after white women; and that the later big commercial success about the South was the 1936 novel and 1939 film "Gone With the Wind," which romanticized the region as a victim of an unjust war. (Of course, the relatively few black historians had a different view.)
Partly as a result of this denial of slavery's centrality in American history, few Americans today know that black bondage had long been legal in all 13 colonies when the American Revolution began. Indeed, black slavery also flourished in 16th-century Mexico, Peru and Brazil. In the 17th century, it made possible factorylike plantations in the British, French, Danish and Dutch Caribbean -- the center of wealth in the Western Hemisphere, as slave-grown sugar and tobacco became the first luxury goods for an international mass market. In fact, in 1688, Governor Denonville of French Canada wrote to King Louis XIV, begging him to end the manpower shortage by authorizing shipments of African slaves. Though France granted permission, Canada could not afford the high prices of prized African slaves paid in the South. In 1716, a high Canadian official attributed the success of New York and New England to black slave labor, and insisted Canada could vie for the profitable West Indies markets if given credit to buy more slaves. 
While no New World colony began with a blueprint for becoming a slave society, the entire Western Hemisphere had become implicated by the paradox of trying to reconcile racial slavery with aspirations to escape the sins of the Old World. If some Africans abetted this by enslaving and making available millions of cheap laborers, it was Western European and then American entrepreneurs who exploited it. From the 1440's, when the Portuguese began transporting black slaves to Iberia, to the 1860's, when the illegal slave trade to Cuba finally came to an end, Africa exported an estimated 11 million slaves. 
AFTER decades of research, historians are only now beginning to grasp the complex interdependencies of a society enmeshed in slavery. There were shifting interactions among West African enslavers, sellers and European buyers; European investors in the slave trade, who ranged from small-town merchants to well-known figures like the philosophers John Locke and Voltaire; wealthy Virginian and Brazilian middlemen who purchased large numbers of Africans off the slave ships to sell to planters; New Englanders who shipped foodstuffs, timber, shoes and clothing as supplies for slaves in the South and the West Indies; and, finally, the European and American consumers of slave-produced sugar, rum, rice, cotton, tobacco, indigo (for dyes), hemp (for rope-making) and other goods.
Today, it is difficult to understand why slavery was accepted from prebiblical times in virtually every culture and not seriously challenged until the late 1700's. But the institution was so basic that genuine antislavery attitudes required a profound shift in moral perception. This meant fundamental religious and philosophic changes in views of human abilities, responsibilities and rights. By the time of the American Revolution, the isolated critiques of slavery by early Quakers and philosophers like Montesquieu had begun to win public support in Britain, France and even some bastions of slavery, like Virginia. Yet, though the American Revolution catalyzed the first antislavery movements around the world, slavery in America was a far stronger institution in 1800 than in 1770 -- largely because of the invention of the cotton gin.
Even most history books fail to convey the extent that the American government was dominated by slaveholders and proslavery interests between the inaugurations of Presidents Washington and Lincoln. Partly because of the clause in the Constitution that gave the South added political representation for three-fifths of its slave population, Southern slaveholding presidents governed the nation for roughly 50 of those 72 years. And four of the six Northern presidents in that span catered to Southern proslavery policies. For example, Martin Van Buren, who came from a New York slaveholding family, sought to undermine the nation's judicial process and send the captives from the slave ship Amistad back to Cuba -- and certain death. Millard Fillmore, also from New York, signed the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, which enforced return of escaped slaves even from free states.
From the start, America's foreign policy favored slaveholding interests, and administrations refused to cooperate with efforts by Britain to suppress the international slave trade, even though the United States had defined the African slave trade in 1820 as piracy, a capital crime. The one exception to this proslavery stand was the support John Adams's administration gave to Toussaint Louverture during the Haitian Revolution -- both to help the slaves gain freedom and to expel the French.
There were strong economic reasons for the broad national reach of American slavery. Though Northerners gradually eliminated slavery in their states, Southern slave-grown cotton was the nation's leading export. It powered textile-manufacturing revolutions in both New England and Europe, and paid for American imports of everything from steel to capital. In addition, the demand for slave labor in southwestern states like Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas drove up slave prices and land values throughout the South. In the 19th century, slave values more than tripled. By 1860, a young "prime field hand" in New Orleans would sell for the equivalent of an expensive car, say a Mercedes-Benz, today. American slaves represented more capital than any other asset in the nation, with the exception of land. In 1860, the value of Southern slaves was about three times the amount invested in manufacturing or railroads nationwide.
Not surprisingly, the richest Americans were concentrated in the South, which, in turn, attracted many Northern college graduates and ministers, who often married into prosperous Southern families. Rich Southern planters also summered in cooler locales like Boston, Newport, R.I., and Saratoga, N.Y., where marriages and other relationships between wealthy Southerners and Northerners reinforced business alliances based on cotton.
The fortunes of New England manufacturers and New York merchants increasingly depended on a northward flow of cotton, a fact that carried the deepest implications for politics as well as banking, insurance and shipping. The Southern "lords of the lash" forged ever closer ties with Northern "lords of the loom." For example, as the owners of major textile mills in Lowell and Lawrence, Mass., established cordial relations with Southern planters, it became increasingly necessary to reassure slaveholders that abolitionists like William Lloyd Garrison represented a lunatic fringe, and that Northerners generally agreed that the Constitution prevented any interference with slavery. 
Such reassurances became more difficult, however, after the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law, which was extremely unpopular in the North. Under its terms, any citizen could be drafted into a posse and any free black person seized without a jury trial. Then the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 seemed to open all the Western territories to slavery. 
Before the Mexican War and the resulting acquisition of a vast Western territory raised the possibility of an expanding slave empire, the abolitionist movement appealed to a small minority of Northern whites, who along with free black abolitionists faced violent mobs from Ohio to Rhode Island. In the 1830's, it took real courage to speak out against slavery in the North. Abolitionist speakers were shunned by "respectable society," even disowned by family members.
THOUGH these reformers faced rejection at home, they had a disproportionate influence on the South. Nat Turner's insurrection in Virginia in 1831 was blamed on abolitionist propaganda. Southerners grew convinced that slaves only became dangerous if incited by abolitionists. It was the South's extreme reaction to this fear, evident in escalating demands to nationalize slavery, that led to the creation of the North's Republican Party in the 1850's and to President-elect Lincoln's stand against any expansion of "the peculiar institution." 
The Confederacy's ideological victory, which the nation is still struggling with, would not have been possible without the North's deeply embedded racism and complicity in repudiating Reconstruction as an embarrassing failure. This was cited regularly, despite Reconstruction's many achievements in promoting black suffrage, education and civil rights. Because most of the Northern white public was unprepared to face the consequences of slave emancipation in 1865, it was easy to popularize a new history of America, in which slavery occupied a far less central role. Beginning in the 1870's, as the price of reconciliation, the North accepted the demands of Southern whites that they manage "Negroes" as they pleased -- an acquiescence to an era of lynching and Jim Crow.
Nonetheless, considering that slavery had been globally accepted for millennia, it is encouraging that people were able to make such a major shift in their moral view, especially when a cause like abolition conflicted with strong national economic interests. As the nation tries in this cynical age to avoid "generational chauvinism" -- the assumption that the current generation is morally superior to all past generations -- we can still learn from history the invaluable lesson that an enormously powerful and profitable evil can be overcome.
Future historians will need to explain the remarkable recent upsurge of public interest in slavery and the Civil War. Professors who confront the hundreds of new scholarly and popular books each year, to say nothing of the re-enactments of Civil War battles and slave sales, can only speculate. Certainly the growing black middle class sees little shame in the old stigma of slave origins and instead uses it as an opportunity to clarify its own identity.
In this era of relativism, an interest in the debates over slavery and America's most destructive war can reflect a discontent with the present, on the part of both blacks and whites, and a longing for an era when moral issues seemed clear cut. Like World War II, the Civil War was deemed a "good war," when people fought for what they believed in. While the slavery era may serve as a screen on which current conflicts are acted out, the nation is now freeing itself from the old Confederate-dominated paradigm, and can finally see the period from 1790 to 1865 as a deeply stained but defining era in the history of this strange nation.

That Sinking Feeling

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
Administration officials haven't yet admitted that they will break their promise to protect the Social Security surplus, but their allies in the media and the think tanks are already preparing the fallback position -- that everything is O.K. as long as the federal budget as a whole is in surplus.
 Let me pretend for a moment that the truth matters, and point out that real conservatives, who respect the lessons of the past, would disagree with the proposition that balancing the budget is enough. Why? Because the Social Security "lockbox" is the modern equivalent of a time-honored institution, the "sinking fund." 
 A sinking fund was a sum of money that the government undertook to set aside each year to pay down its debt. Alexander Hamilton, our first Treasury secretary, established such a fund in 1795, and thereby made the fledgling United States creditworthy. 
Hamilton understood very well that the sinking fund was in a sense a fiction: the government's ability to pay down its debt depended ultimately on its overall surplus, its excess of revenue over spending. But he also understood that it's very hard to maintain the fiscal discipline needed to pay down debt unless you establish a firm target. The sinking fund raised the fiscal bar: the government could not consider its house in order unless revenue was large enough, not only to cover current spending, but to make the scheduled debt repayment. 
Two centuries later, the federal government faces a more complicated problem. It has $3 trillion of ordinary debt; but the really important debts are "implicit." They consist of promises to current and future retirees -- promises that the government will provide pensions under Social Security and medical care under Medicare. The burden of honoring those promises will be much reduced if we do our best to pay down the debt, explicit and implicit, over the next decade -- our last window of opportunity before the demographic deluge, when the baby boomers start collecting benefits.
Some people say that the federal government shouldn't be providing retirement benefits in the first place. I disagree, but in any case you can't just wish away promises that have already been made. If the retirement programs had never existed there would be no implicit debt. But privatizing the programs now would increase, not reduce, the implicit debt. If the payroll taxes of younger workers are diverted into private accounts, the benefits promised to current retirees and older workers will have to be paid out of other revenue.
It goes without saying that we should pay off the explicit debt -- though that is looking less likely with each budget revision. To go beyond this, and pay down implicit debt, the federal government must accumulate claims on the private sector, which can eventually be used to pay benefits. I favor eventually investing part of the Social Security surplus in broad stock indexes. Alternatively, claims on the private sector could take the form of private retirement accounts. That's a bad idea for other reasons, but it similarly has the effect of acquiring assets that will be used to provide benefits to future retirees.
To do any of this, however, the federal government must run large surpluses. And when there's a surplus, it's hard to resist the pressure to cut taxes and increase spending.
That's where the lockbox comes in. It isn't a real box, just as the sinking fund wasn't a real fund. But a rule that says that the government should not dip into the surpluses of the retirement funds, like the rule setting aside money for the sinking fund, makes it easier for politicians to act responsibly.
Sometimes you have to break such rules. A temporary raid on the retirement surplus to fight a recession -- or a war -- would not be a bad thing. But the key word is "temporary." And even though the Office of Management and Budget has assumed a much faster recovery than private analysts find plausible, its projection shows us dipping into the trust funds every year until 2006. The reason, of course, is that the Bush tax cut starts small and keeps getting bigger -- the opposite of what you would do if you really wanted to fight a recession. And those projected surpluses after 2006 are based on gimmicks that give smoke and mirrors a bad name. What was that about "honor and dignity"?
One wonders what would have happened to our country if Hamilton's ideas had been rejected in favor of mindless slogans like "It's your money!" We may be about to find out.

States Are Following the Money

BYLINE:  By Rick Gladstone 

 BODY:
State and local governments that have become short of cash in a weakening economy have found a new revenue enhancer, one that citizens have long enjoyed: the courtroom. 
 Keenly aware of the huge financial recoveries obtained under whistle-blowing provisions of the Federal False Claims Act, a growing number of states have remodeled and expanded their own false-claims laws so that they, too, can reap big awards from favorable verdicts in court. 
 Under false-claims laws, individuals and companies found to have defrauded the government must pay heavy penalties. Under the whistle-blowing provisions of these laws, citizens who bring such frauds to the government's attention can get a share of the penalty money.
John T. Boese, an expert on false-claims litigation and a partner at the Washington office of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, said some states that have been hit the hardest by shrinking budgets now have some of the most far-reaching false-claims laws.
Mr. Boese cited Hawaii, which in June expanded the scope of its law to include false claims made to counties; and Tennessee, which has expanded its law to cover far more than false health care claims.
"As more states enact their own false-claims laws, the state laws have begun to produce large recoveries," he said in a newsletter sent to clients last month by Fried, Frank. California, for example, has recovered more than $300 million in cases involving the financial services industry, and Florida has recovered more than $28 million.
The money could not come too soon. The National Council of State Budget Officers and the National Governors Association said in their June fiscal survey that 16 states were cutting their budgets this year and that "many states are facing a widening gap between revenues and expenditures."

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Street Fighter: A Savior of Central Park Tackles New York's Sidewalks" (Aug. 12): I am a great admirer of Betsy Barlow Rogers and her contributions to Central Park and the parks profession.
 Unfortunately, the innovations she championed were not extended to the rest of the system over the past 20 years. 
This was due to a weakened Parks Department that suffered drastic budget cuts and major staff reductions. 
 This year, park activists formed Parks 2001, a citywide campaign to restore, reform and revitalize parks and recreation services.
Parks will only get better if we join the creative energy of people like Betsy Barlow Rogers with an adequately financed and staffed Parks Department. As Central Park has shown us, parks and playgrounds play a major role in the social, physical and economic life of New York.

HEADLINE: Sunday Q & A 

 BODY:
 Sunday Q & A appears in this section weekly. Readers are invited to send in questions about national or international affairs; those selected will be answered by Times correspondents who specialize in those issues. Information about submitting questions appears below.

Hebrew, Modern and Biblical

Q. What is the difference, if any, between biblical and modern Hebrew?

A. Gustav Niebuhr, a national religion correspondent, responds:
 Actually, in the past 3,000 years, there have been four varieties of Hebrew -- biblical, rabbinic, medieval and modern. Modern Hebrew is the language of the state of Israel, revived more than a century ago by a true linguistic pioneer, Eliezer Ben-Yehuda.
Born into a Hasidic family in Lithuania, he moved to Haifa in the 1880's, where he founded an early Zionist organization. One of its principles was restoring the Hebrew language.
Today's Hebrew contains vocabulary and grammatical elements from the language's biblical roots, said Dr. Alan Cooper, a professor of Bible who holds a joint appointment at Jewish Theological Seminary and Union Theological Seminary in New York. Israelis, Dr. Cooper said, conjugate verbs according to rules laid down in biblical times.
But the modern language's syntax is post-biblical. And what is spoken by Israelis today also includes words derived from languages of other countries, in Europe and the Middle East, from which Jews have emigrated.
That points to the fact that modern Hebrew is dynamic. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Israelis maintain a watchdog institute over their language, a bit like the French.
It is called the Academy of the Hebrew Language, said Dr. Cooper, who added, "It regularly issues what you might call white papers, in which they suggest new vocabulary and sometimes decry errors that creep into the language."

The Psychology of Pricing

Q. Why do gasoline prices end in nine-tenths of a cent?

A. Neela Banerjee, a business reporter who writes about the oil industry, responds:
Why do stores price a dress at $89.99 rather than $90? Gas stations employ the same psychological sleight of hand so that consumers think a gallon of gasoline is a bit cheaper than it really is. 
But gasoline stations, unlike other retailers, have no way to differentiate their products other than by price, said Tom Osborne, a spokesman for the Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of America, a trade association. Most consumers have learned to ignore the nine-tenths of a cent, Mr. Osborne said. But if any stations were to go against the system and, say, round up the price of gasoline from $1.49.9 to $1.50, customers would probably not reward them, he said. "They would think the gasoline is now one penny more rather than one-tenth of a cent more."

Stimulating the Economy?

Q. What does President Bush plan to do with his tax rebate check?

A. Frank Bruni, a White House correspondent, responds:
The president was asked the other day by reporters at his Texas ranch whether he had received his tax rebate check. He paused for a few seconds and looked at his aides before saying, "Not to my knowledge."
"How will you spend it?" the reporters asked.
"Charity," the president said.
Which one? 
"I don't know yet," the president replied.
When pressed about why he planned to give the rebate to charity instead of buying a new gadget to help stimulate the economy, Mr. Bush paused again before saying, "It's something people ought to do." 
There was no further explanation.

HEADLINE: Black Canada Lifts Its Voice and Seeks the World Stage 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: HALIFAX, Nova Scotia 

 BODY:
On the edge of Atlantic Canada, far from the American South and the slave-trading ports of Africa, a long-established community of black Canadians is beginning to join calls for reparations for slavery and for greater recognition of their history. 
 Like civil rights campaigners in the United States, black Canadians want their voices to be heard in Durban, South Africa, at the end of August at the United Nations international conference on racism and discrimination. That is especially true in this port city, where a once strong black community is in the midst of a cultural revival. 
 The black residents of greater Halifax -- in the old city itself, across the harbor in Dartmouth and in the semirural township of Preston -- form one of the oldest and largest black populations in Canada, their leaders say. Black immigrants arrived along with the French, British and Scottish settlers of the British colonial era. 
"Well, you won't hear much about us on the regular tours," said Carolyn Thomas, as she guided a visitor around the Citadel, the fort that looms over the town of Halifax. Black residents say it may have been built in large part with forced labor by the Jamaican Maroons, sent here in the late 18th century because they were troublesome to the British in the Caribbean. 
Although most of the Maroons were again forcibly moved, to help colonize Sierra Leone a few years later, hundreds managed to stay. 
That is part of what Ms. Thomas calls "the other half of the story" of Halifax. In the mid-1990's, she and her husband, Matthew, distressed because black Nova Scotia seemed invisible, took early retirement from their government jobs to start Black Heritage Tours. It is still a two-person operation.
A former teacher and government affirmative action director, Ms. Thomas, 58, said she had not been able to increase significantly the participation of black residents or the inclusion of their history in the mainline tourism industry, which is important to the local economy. The struggle continues, she added. 
"All traces of segregation were not removed from our statutes until 1954," she said, about the same time as the Supreme Court decision in the United States outlawing school segregation. Before that, most black students here had no opportunity to go beyond eighth grade, she said, and, "that denial included the denial of our history."
A conference on racism and discrimination -- a kind of warm-up for Durban -- was held here in early August. Among the organizers of the Halifax conference was Esmeralda Thornhill, who holds a chair in black Canadian studies at Dalhousie University in Halifax. She told a local newspaper that if governments could address the Holocaust, the incarceration of Japanese during World War II and the forced movements of indigenous people, then "reparation talks for slavery are needed to address the legacy of colonialism." 
Black Canadians, whose ancestors were enslaved under both British and American rule, fear that their government will join the United States in trying to keep the issue off the agenda. 
Greater Halifax has 12,000 to 15,000 black residents out of a population of close to 400,000. Their ancestors include slaves freed by the British in colonial America in return for their labor or willingness to fight for England in the Revolutionary War or in the War of 1812. Others escaped slavery along the Underground Railroad, often with help from Quakers. 
"In my grandmother's house there was always a picture of the Quakers," Ms. Thomas said. "It was in my mother's house, too. Like by osmosis, it became part of my life. The picture now hangs over my computer." 
Some people owned slaves in Nova Scotia, but slavery was not much in evidence by the time it was abolished throughout the British Empire in the 1830's. Black residents here say that there are enduring wounds, though. 
When their ancestors arrived, they were given far smaller plots of land than white Loyalists, and rural townships where they were settled lacked basic services.
Ms. Thomas said that when she taught school three decades ago in Preston, there was no bus service or snow plow. Community leaders shoveled their way to the end of the bus line to take her to school.
The story of Africville is not a happy one. Black historians say it was settled by blacks in 1796 on a lush meadow beside Bedford Bay, outside Halifax. It was bulldozed away in the 1960's to make room for an approach to a bridge and other development. Many families who had built homes over several generations, scraping together savings from their wages as servants and porters, were moved. A park called Seaview was built where their community once stood. The name Africville disappeared from the map. 
"The destruction of our community meant the loss of the physical -- the land; the spiritual -- our church, and the community -- the people," said Irvine Carvery, president of the Africville Genealogy Society, founded to keep its history alive. "These three things had worked in harmony, cultivating the heritage and culture that allowed us to survive over two hundred years of exclusion and marginalization with a sense of worth and dignity."
Pictures and objects from old Africville are on display at the Black Cultural Center for Nova Scotia in Dartmouth, where black history has been reconstructed from the limited documents available, along with the stories of a rich oral tradition handed down through families and churches. 
The center, which has grown steadily since its opening in 1983, promotes the achievements of local black heroes. They include church leaders like the 19th-century pastor Richard Preston, founder of the African United Baptist Association, a strong force for development in the region. It has a library and works by black artisans on display and offers musical performances to schools.
Linda Carvery, a Nova Scotian singer and actress, called the impact of the center phenomenal. On a recent morning, she brought her grandson, Dwayne Carvery, 8, to look at the exhibits. "To see these things is wonderful for our self-esteem, our being," Ms. Carvery said.
Like some other black Canadians, Ms. Carvery said she regretted that black Americans did not seem aware of these communities. 
Matthew Thomas recalled that some years ago, when he and his wife were invited to speak at the Canadian Embassy in Washington, a black American asked afterward, "Where did you say you were from?" When he answered, "Nova Scotia," the response was, "We didn't know we went up that far."
Mr. Thomas said he told them, "Well, we've got news for you."

A Bailout for Argentina

BYLINE:  By Larry Rohter

 BODY:
 With the reluctant support of the Bush administration, the International Monetary Fund extended an $8 billion lifeline to Argentina and its foundering economy. 
In return, Argentina promised a "zero deficit" government spending program that will require significant new budget cuts and continued sacrifice from its 36 million people. But with tax revenues already declining sharply as the result of three years of recession, the new austerity measures promise to make it even more difficult for Argentina to fulfill its pledge.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 According to an Aug. 21 news article, Gov. Gray Davis of California plans to cease building freeways and increase mass-transit spending. 
Peter Gordon, a professor of urban economics at the University of Southern California, responds that the state's policy is "goofy" because it lacks incentives for people to use mass transit and does not make driving more expensive. 
 Mass transit in California will not work until it is convenient and gets people to their destinations in a reasonable amount of time.
Public transit here is slow and unreliable. Taking a train to a bus to a light rail and then walking will never replace the convenience of driving door to door in a state where people must travel vast distances to work or shop.

 Freeway construction has supposedly ended in California (news article, Aug. 21), but you can bet more roads will be built to feed urban sprawl and more freeway traffic. 
 A paving moratorium in the United States has been needed for decades, as more roads and parking lots have undermined walking, buses and trains. 
Subsidies have made the cost of driving low, so alternative transportation and alternative energy have had to wait.
The world's supplies of oil will eventually run out, but prices will be kept low until it is too late to shift fuels and lifestyles. Picture society's drivers and consumers clamoring for just a bicycle and bike trailer for hauling groceries. Culture change awaits the demise of the petroleum economy.

Commercial Markets Show Signs of a Slowdown

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
RESIDENTIAL real estate agents in New Jersey are still bubbling, reporting buoyant housing prices. In contrast, midyear reports about the commercial markets -- industrial, office and retail -- provide a bit of a reality check. They also cast a bit of a pall.
 A recent report by the real estate services concern Cushman & Wakefield of New Jersey Inc. referred to a "generally declining overall picture" in the commercial market, despite basic health in the first six months. The report added that "the strong grip of the national economic slowdown is defining the forecast for the second half of the year." 
 Grubb & Ellis Research of Fairfield, N.J., reached similar conclusions, saying, "It appears that the wind has dissipated from the sails of the Northern and Central New Jersey office market, as we drift aimlessly on the open waters in mid-2001." 
GVA Williams of New Jersey analyzed statistics and trends in crucial submarkets and issued a sort of left-handed compliment. "New Jersey has not felt the effects of the general economic slowdown as severely as some other parts of the country," the midyear report said. "Demand will remain strong compared to other markets as long as there continues to be no speculative overbuilding."
Layoffs, mergers and acquisitions are generating higher vacancy rates for office space.
A spate of retail bankruptcy filings -- including Bradlees, Grand Union and Lechters -- has disrupted the retail market. If there is any sector staying afloat, the midyear reports indicated, it is the industrial market.
One positive development noted in the reports was Volkswagen of America's long-term lease for 928,000 square feet of distribution space off Exit 8A of the New Jersey Turnpike and relatively close to the Port of Newark and Newark Airport. Volkswagen is expected to occupy an entire facility now under construction in Cranbury Township. 
The office market, in contrast to the industrial sector, is being hit hard, according to Cushman & Wakefield. Following are some of the major blows:
* Rising unemployment (up to 4.3 percent, from 3.6 percent in January).
* A dragging telecommunications industry, including thousands of layoffs at Lucent Technologies.
* Increasing supply of sublease space as companies contract and fold.
* Rising vacancy rates in Manhattan, meaning less demand in New Jersey.
At 10.5 percent, the average vacancy rate for sublease space is the highest since year-end 1998, the report says. Vacancy rates for Class A space in northern New Jersey are 11.9 percent, up from 5.9 percent a year ago.
In Parsippany, Class A vacancy rates have climbed to 22 percent, up 14 percent over last year. 
Franklin Township reported the region's highest overall vacancy rate, covering all classes of space, 15 percent, and that is poised to climb. Merrill Lynch is about to move to offices in Hopewell, and this will put an additional 700,000 square feet on the market in Franklin.
On the other hand, in Newark, the city's revitalization efforts are helping to maintain relative stability. The overall vacancy rate is 12.4 percent, up slightly from last year's 11.1 percent, but better than the 10-year high of 17.8 percent in 1995.
The market in central New Jersey is also holding. Class A vacancy rates are down, to 8.4 percent, from 10.7 percent a year ago. 
"The pharmaceutical sector is strong," said Jonathan S. Meisel, a senior director for Cushman & Wakefield. The pharmaceutical company Aventis leased 417,288 square feet near Route 78 in Bridgewater earlier this year; Cendant, the hotel and rental car business, leased 386,079 square feet in Parsippany. Other brokers and developers noted UBS/PaineWebber's lease for 1.1 million square feet on the Hudson waterfront in the Newport Office Center VII in Jersey City. 
Still, the number of leases statewide of more than 100,000 square feet is down. Cushman & Wakefield reports 7 large leases during the first half of the year; there were 25 at midyear last year. 
GVA WILLIAMS'S report asserts the office market has entered a period of "neutral absorption" when an equal amount of space is being leased and being made available. Other reports describe a flood of sublet space but consider it an opportunity because it could force landlords to reduce rental rates. 
The retail sector, according to Grubb & Ellis Research, is suffering from a slowdown. 
"A year ago, the New Jersey retail market was defined by strong retail sales coupled with a growing, stable economy," the Grubb & Ellis midyear report said. "Many retailers were pursuing aggressive expansion strategies to take advantage of prolific sales volumes."
"Practically overnight, we have reversed direction," it concluded.
Grubb & Ellis reports a plague of bankruptcy court filings as well as store closings. Last spring, Federated Department Stores converted most of its 24 Stern's stores to Macy's or Bloomingdale's. Five Stern's stores closed.
Some large retailers are taking advantage of available space to expand. When Bradlees closed, Home Depot, Kohl's and Wal-Mart bought 35 of the 105 Bradlees stores in New Jersey. Kohl's used the same strategy last year to enter the New Jersey market, acquiring many Caldor stores, when that chain went out of business.
Bankruptcy filings are also occurring among supermarkets. Grand Union filed for protection from creditors earlier this year, and C & S Wholesale Grocers acquired 170 of 180 Grand Union stores in New Jersey for an estimated $301.8 million, Grubb & Ellis reported. The wholesaler reportedly plans to keep some stores open as Grand Unions and sell the others to several chains -- including Pathmark, which recently emerged from bankruptcy protection itself.
Other chains are hoping to enter the market or expand, according to Grubb & Ellis, and the midyear prediction is for saturation of the retail market, more bankruptcy filings and more closing.
Despite the reports, retail development continues. Various real estate service companies have issued statements each month about leasing agreements they have arranged or about new construction projects.
Grubb & Ellis, for example, has fully leased the 66,000-square-foot Fort Lee Towne Centre, which is nearing completion.
In Edgewater, a 185,000-square-foot retail center is being built. In Woodcliff Lake, near Exit 171 of the Garden State Parkway, work has begun on 13 acres for a 120,000-square-foot shopping center. In Woodbridge, final approval has been given for plans to develop 25 acres into a Lowe's Home Improvement.
THE industrial market remains generally robust, with only about 5 percent of the total space available, according to NAI/James E. Hanson Inc., a commercial broker in Hackensack. 
But Cushman & Wakefield's reported that the slowing economy is beginning to be felt in the industrial market.
Cushman & Wakefield's senior director, Frank Caccavo, said, "Constraint on future industrial development and a dramatic decrease in the number of manufacturing jobs statewide are rapidly changing the landscape of industrial inventory."
Cushman advised caution but also noted a bright side. Construction, it said, continues statewide, with projects ranging from 204,000 square feet to nearly 960,000 square feet expected to be completed by January.
In addition, more than 3.7 million square feet of industrial space has been leased in Middlesex County in the last six months.
North/Central New Jersey continues to attract research and development centers for pharmaceutical and high technology companies; several are shopping for laboratory space.
NAI/James E. Hanson thinks the market in Central New Jersey is particularly strong, citing the development of the distribution hub at Exit 8A. But farther north, in Bergen and Hudson Counties, Hanson's midyear statement noted, outdated plants predominate -- and will require refitting.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT; 
Low-Fare Airlines Lure More Business Travelers

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
RODNEY BARSTEIN, who owns a chain of 225 women's casual clothing stores in the Eastern half of the country, has a business plan: where Southwest Airlines goes, his Simply Fashions stores follow.
 "As Southwest has announced new cities, we have used that to decide where to go," Mr. Barstein said recently, explaining that cheaper fares help lower his business costs. "We opened in Baltimore after they did, and in October they started flying to Buffalo, so we are looking for locations in there. I see that Southwest plans to go into the Tidewater area of Virginia in October." 
 Mr. Barstein, who flew on Delta Airlines until Southwest came to his home base of Birmingham, Ala., more than a decade ago, was a forerunner in a growing trend by businesses to switch their travel from the major carriers to low-fare airlines such as Southwest, JetBlue, AirTran, Sun Country, Vanguard, Shuttle America and Spirit.
More than 60 percent of corporations are increasing their use of low-fare airlines, according to a June survey by the National Business Travel Association, an organization of 1,500 corporate travel officers at the Fortune 1,000 largest companies. A year ago that figure was just under 50 percent and five years ago, only 36 percent, said Eugene C. Laney, the association's director of information and legislative services.
Mr. Laney said that recent air fare sales by major carriers were prompted by a continuing shift of business travelers to low-fare carriers. That migration has been driven in turn, he said, by falling corporate profits.
Most airlines, major and discount, reported a slight decline in the percentage of seats sold, known as load factors, in July, although the discount carriers America West and JetBlue reported higher load factors. Despite the weakening economy, load factors were still high, with 77.4 percent of seats sold at the nine largest airlines, down from 79.6 percent in July 2000.
High seat sales have some negative implications for vacation travelers who fly on discount airlines. As those lines sell more seats, chances rise that a vacationer will get a middle seat or one that does not lean back. On airlines without advance seat selection, such as Southwest, this increases the premium on arriving early at the gate because passengers are given numbered boarding passes, with the first to arrive boarding first. With airlines that offer advance seating, such as JetBlue, picking a seat in advance by telephone or Internet is also more important.
The discount carriers, unlike the major airlines, have few spare planes (JetBlue plans to add a second spare later this year), which means that if a flight is canceled for weather or mechanical reasons it can be hard to get on the next flight because so few seats are available.
On the other hand, the discount carriers often impose smaller fees to change an advance-purchase ticket. While most of the major airlines charge up to $100 for such changes (if they allow them at all), Southwest imposes no charge; JetBlue's, for example, is $25.
The corporate shift to low-fare carriers is not limited to lower- and middle-level employees. A fifth of JetBlue's revenue last year was charged to American Express corporate and platinum cards, often carried by business executives, said Gareth Edmondson-Jones, a spokesman for the airline.
While the major carriers often match the lowest advance-purchase fares offered by low-fare carriers, they typically make only a few seats available at these deep discounts. Business travelers primarily use walk-up fares or those purchased just a few days before travel, and here the discount carriers often offer substantial savings. For example, JetBlue's current walk-up fare between New York and Buffalo is $105 ($100 for tickets bought on the Internet), while US Airways charges $286.75.
However, some discount carriers -- including JetBlue, Shuttle America, Sun Country and Vanguard -- do not have frequent flier programs. That means given a choice between the same rock-bottom fare on JetBlue or US Airways, for example, US Airways is actually more desirable because of the value of the frequent flier miles. (AirTran's and Southwest's frequent flier miles are good for tickets only on those respective airlines.)
The effect of competition is dramatic. Four years ago Buffalo had no discount carriers and the nation's second-highest air fares. Now it has five discount airlines, the number of passengers is up 50 percent to 4.2 million, and its air fares are 64th on the federal Department of Transportation list.
Luiz F. Kahl, chairman of the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, the state agency that runs Buffalo's airport, said: "Four years ago many management teams were afraid to fly low-cost airlines, but with JetBlue you have all new planes and I think there has been a dramatic change to acceptance of the low-fare airlines."

Financial History, As a Tale of Passion

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN; William J. Holstein is a freelance writer who worked previously as a reporter and editor at Business 2.0, U.S. News & World Report and Business Week.

 BODY:
SOME nuggets from the Department of Intriguing Trivia: the British imported ketchup into America from Asia. Graham crackers are named after an eccentric health reformer, Sylvester Graham. Bank of America started out in life as the Bank of Italy. Henry Ford created the mass assembly of automobiles after watching the highly advanced practices of Sears, Roebuck. And Desi Arnaz was a so-so actor but a brilliant businessman -- he persuaded CBS to give him the rerun rights to "I Love Lucy" for virtually nothing.
 Delighting in these details is one way to read John Steele Gordon's new book, "The Business of America" (Walker & Company, $27). He is a natural storyteller with abundant grace and wit. Each chapter is an essay organized loosely around themes like farming and food, manufacturing and the business of war. The essays have already appeared in American Heritage magazine, but taken together in book form they paint a rich picture of United States business history and complement one another. They shed light on today's headlines about Microsoft's antitrust battle, the Internet and dot-com mania and financial market volatility. 
 If your head is reeling from the wild ride of the past year or so, take solace in the knowledge that American economic life has always been spectacularly volatile. The long, steady climb and relative stability of the 1990's were not typical. Business history "seethes with passion," Mr. Gordon tells us.
"And because it is so very human," he adds, "it is rich in the grandeur and pettiness, triumphs and tragedies of which we as a species have proved ourselves so capable."
When a new idea hits, whether the steamboat or the railroad, someone tries to monopolize it or control it. Long before the Hunt brothers tried to corner the silver market or William H. Gates tried to dominate the Internet, for example, the wealthy Frederick Philipse tried to corner the wampum market in Manhattan, then called New Amsterdam. The Indians who provided the furs that were the mainstay of the local economy in the 1660's did not want gold and silver. Instead, they wanted the tubular beads called wampum because they saw them has having value. Wampum became the de facto currency. Philipse bought all of it that he could and took it out of circulation; his idea worked and he became even wealthier. Later, Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt cornered Harlem railroad stock and in 1869 Jay Gould and Jim Fisk nearly cornered gold. 
AMERICANS have long engaged in mad rushes. Mr. Gordon's description of the gold rush in California is particularly intriguing in view of the dot-com fury, the epicenter of which was also in that state. In 1848, San Francisco had fewer than 1,000 people and was not part of the United States. (Negotiations with Mexico were still in progress.) But the city nearly emptied as most every able-bodied man headed for the hills near Sacramento. Ships were abandoned in the harbor as sailors flocked to the gold region. It wasn't until 1849 that the gold rush became news on the East Coast, causing a large influx of prospectors. Oddly, John Sutter, who owned the 50,000 acres where gold was discovered, was to die broke.
Another truism is that financial markets have always gone through upheavals. Most commentators who discuss today's financial doldrums make reference to 1987, and some might even dredge up the crash of 1929 that prompted the Great Depression, but there have been many other financial panics -- in 1792, 1837, 1857, 1873, 1893 and 1907. Sometimes the federal government responded well and stabilized the markets; sometimes it did not. We do not know what Mr. Gordon thinks about Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, although it may be unfairly premature to expect an answer since we don't know if he has averted financial calamity in this downturn.
But the reader might well wish that Mr. Gordon had said more about the Internet. Although his book was completed in late 2000 and he certainly cannot be held accountable for chronicling the latest twists at Microsoft or AOL Time Warner, it would have been interesting if he had put the Internet in the context of the textile mill, the telegraph, the steam engine and the steamboat, the cotton gin, railroads and the sewing machine.
It is left to the reader to extract the lessons. One is that there may always be individuals who invent but do not see their marketplace opportunities. That sets the stage for others to exploit their inventions. Wang created the word processor but was not able to survive. WordPerfect and Ashton-Tate, software giants of the 1980's, are no longer independent. David Sarnoff and William S. Paley may have been visionaries in the creation of television. But it was Walter Annenberg, the creator of TV Guide, and A. C. Nielsen, father of the Nielsen ratings, who became even richer.
In many cases, Mr. Gordon tells us, there is "rapid evolution, proliferation, partial extinction." In many cases, he says, "an innovator fails to fully conceptualize the new technology he is dealing with and relies on models from the old technology he seeks to replace."
A modern example may be that Stephen M. Case of AOL and Mr. Gates of Microsoft did not invent the Internet. But both saw a way to capture it in a profitable way. 
Mr. Gordon identifies himself as "believing in capitalism" along the lines of Adam Smith. He does not think government is very effective when it comes to checking the power of robber barons. They are best left alone, Mr. Gordon said, because the vast majority of monopolists become lazy over time and fall victim to others with better ideas. "While we still tend to think of monopolies and cartels as the product of top-hatted, 19th-century plutocrats," Mr. Gordon says, "the major combinations in restraint of trade in this century have all been government-sponsored and just as pernicious." 
He is unabashedly Hamiltonian, having written a laudatory book about Alexander Hamilton. He is anti-Jeffersonian and anti-anything that smacks of leftism or liberalism. (At one point, in the same spirit, he slings a barb at The New York Times as "hardly a passionate advocate of free markets.")
Mr. Gordon may go a bit too far with this line of argument. Surely there is a role in a democracy for government to challenge concentrations of power that threaten the broader public interest. You do not need to be a communist, for instance, to worry about who will control the Internet.
All that aside, Mr. Gordon's book is well worth its 261 pages. It strongly suggests that after the current stock market malaise passes, there will be growth, innovation and continued gains in productivity.

How Long a Job Search Takes

BYLINE:  By Aaron Donovan 

 BODY:
Despite a slowing economy and a surge in layoffs, the time that managers and executives are spending on job searches is virtually the same as when the economy was thriving, a recent survey shows. Judging from the survey, of 1,616 executives who found jobs through Manchester Inc., the median length of time needed to find a new job is 13 weeks. 
 The time spent unemployed is about the same because people are now better at the job search itself, said Bill Keller, a senior vice president at Manchester, an outplacement provider. 
 "Nowadays most people are much more psychologically prepared to transition across companies," he said. "Many people have gone through this before and they know the drill." Employees now keep up-to-date resumes, maintain active professional networks and are in touch with recruiting firms.
Mr. Keller also said severance packages tended to be shrinking -- more incentive to get back to work. Most important, managers are better attuned to what companies are seeking from them.
People over 40, however, needed slightly more time, a median of 16 weeks, and those who had earned more than $100,000 a year required even more -- 20 weeks.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
Still Bullish After All These Years

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
UNTIL recently, Abby Joseph Cohen, chief market strategist at the Goldman Sachs Group, could give Alan Greenspan a run for his money when it came to shaking up the stock market.
 Last week, on the day the Federal Reserve cut interest rates an additional quarter-point, Ms. Cohen issued a report lowering her forecast for the earnings and stock prices of America's biggest corporations. The market's reaction was muted, both to the Fed's rate cut and to Ms. Cohen's prediction. Investors may not be paying her as much heed, but Ms. Cohen is still bullish about the prospects for a recovery. 
 In her report, Ms. Cohen said many companies had "cleaned their books" by taking sweeping charges against their earnings, clearing the way for profits to resume rising in 2002. In a year, she expects the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to reach 1,550, down from her previous forecast of 1,600 but up more than 30 percent from its current level. Ms. Cohen, who analyzes the overall market but does not choose stocks, took time last week to explain her outlook. Following are excerpts from the conversation.

Q. When the Federal Reserve cut rates again on Tuesday, it talked of economic weakness for the foreseeable future. Why do you think the economy will sidestep a recession?

A. Retail sales have been better than expected. Consumer spending continues to grow. The labor markets are no longer deteriorating as quickly as they were earlier in the year. Bad news now seems to be slowing. Federal Reserve actions to lower interest rates during the last few months have been helping. We think a good deal of the economic excesses of 1999 and early 2000 have been wrung out. From our standpoint, this whole adjustment process is much closer to the end than it is to the beginning.

Q. You are recommending putting 22 percent of assets in technology stocks, the most beaten-down group, which makes up about 17 percent of the S.& P. 500. Isn't it a little soon for that?

A. The 30 percent overweight we now suggest may in fact be premature. But we always try to tell our clients that we would rather be early and give them time to build their portfolio positions. In early 2000, we advised our clients to be notably underweight in technology and the current recommendation is a significant reversal of that view. We think the valuation of these stocks is appealing. The long-term earnings growth projections we're using for technology are not particularly aggressive. Tech over all could generate earnings growth on the order of 15 percent, about double that of the overall market.
We're still looking for catalysts. A couple of weeks ago, our semiconductor analyst said he thinks the worst news for the chipmakers is already reflected in their stock prices. There is improving demand in other areas, including computer services and some peripheral equipment.

Q. You like the financial sector, which has taken it on the chin this year, despite seven rate cuts. Do you expect a recovery on Wall Street or among banks and insurers?

A. We like selected banks, insurance companies and broad-based financial services companies. Despite adverse economic conditions, many of these companies have performed quite well. Most of the banks in the S.& P. 500 have had very little problem with credit quality. Some of the insurance companies and diversified financial services providers have been very successful in restructuring and updating their businesses. But our model portfolio is not as overweight in financial services as it was in early 2000. The sector was then 12 percent of the S.& P. 500, and we suggested 18 percent. Now we're suggesting 20 percent versus 18 percent for the index.

Q. On the flip side, what areas are you cautious about? What concerns you the most?

A. In the United States, we're watching C.E.O. confidence more than consumer confidence. C.E.O.'s make the decisions about future job cuts, or increases, and decide about future capital spending. In the global economy, we're concerned that several large foreign companies are anemic, yet policy makers seem reluctant to respond. In the U.S., investors and economists have already dramatically reduced their estimates, and the Fed has responded through vigorous policy actions. Contrast this to the Wile E. Coyote stance in parts of Europe where economic and company performance is already off the cliff, but few want to acknowledge it.
So, U.S.-based multinationals that produce commodity-like items, things like petrochemicals or other basic materials, are not appealing right now because global demand is not robust and these companies do not have much in the way of pricing flexibility. People ask whether the expected decline in the dollar will make multinationals more attractive. Yes and no. Yes, a lower dollar will help in terms of competitiveness, allowing some companies to sell more in global markets. But we don't want to pay for earnings increases that are due only to the currency translation. History says that investors don't pay for that.

HEADLINE: The World; 
Putin the Power Broker

BYLINE:  By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

 BODY:
"IT is said that Russia sulks," said the Russian prince, speaking as he usually did, in French. "Russia does not sulk. Russia is collecting itself."
 The prince in question was Prince Aleksandr M. Gorchakov, the architect of Russian foreign policy from 1856 to 1882, when Russia, weakened by its defeat in the Crimean War, chose to lie low, tend to its domestic affairs and substitute diplomacy for confrontation. 
 For several years, many Russians -- starting with former Prime Minister Yevgeni M. Primakov -- have been summoning up the prince's ghost as they reposition themselves in a post-cold-war world, which, in some ways, resembles Gorchakov's era.
Then, as now, Russia's main focus was inward, in particular on modernizing a society and an economy still seriously lagging behind their Western counterparts. Yet Russia now, as then, remains determined to stay in the great power game, projecting itself as an equal, if with a weak hand.
Another example appeared last week. The more President Bush presses Moscow with a virtual ultimatum over the testy issue of American withdrawal from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, the more Russia stands to pick up points with the rest of the world, where irritation with perceived American "unilateralism" is running high.
"Some of the rhetoric out of Washington in the last half-year has created a sense of unease in the world, which you see particularly in Russia, China and Europe," said a top Russian expert in the Bush administration, speaking on the condition of anonymity, "and the Russians are trying to be a leading global articulator of this concern."
It is not the first time Russia has made the best of a bad situation. This year, it has used old ties to North Korea to insert itself in the debate over rogue states; and, in 1999, the special Russian-Serbian relationship gave Moscow its chance to play a key role in bringing an end to the war over Kosovo.
Unlike his bombastic predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin, President Vladimir V. Putin has proved to be better suited to Gorchakov's pragmatic gamesmanship. First, he is quite articulate; and second, he makes no secret of Russia's weaknesses. In fact, Mr. Putin listed "pragmatism" as the second of three principles of Russian foreign policy in a speech last year. (The others were "national interests" and "economic efficiency.") 
"The rhetoric of the Yeltsin days has really disappeared," said Karl Kaiser, a German foreign policy expert. "This is a different Russia, more realistic and therefore more credible."
Unlike Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Putin -- buoyed at home by high polls -- has time on his side. "As a young and energetic leader he feels he need not be in a rush," said Mark C. Medish, a former adviser on Russia in the Clinton administration, "and he ought to go about things in a systematic way. He represents a modern man who comes at things with a cost-benefit analysis."
The peripatetic Mr. Putin -- he made 18 trips in his first year in office -- has used his foreign visits and the stream of foreign visitors to take stock of Russia's status. He tidied up old debts (Cuba), sized up old allies (Vietnam) and tested new relationships (Iran). He also put Russia's relations with close neighbors on a high priority, a move that raises the specter of Russian domination but also answers Moscow's concern about security threats in its border regions.
"The goal is to be seen out there operating as if you were a great power," said the Bush administration expert. "That builds international respect, and it makes outside powers less likely to intervene in your affairs. It gives you the external conditions necessary to rebuild yourself domestically."
With North Korea, Russia has emerged as a broker in the on-again, off-again negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang over the suspension of ballistic missile launchings. It is an issue with obvious benefit to Moscow, since it has the potential to undercut a critical selling point for the Bush administration's missile defense system.
Some experts argue that in acting as intermediary, Russia has only signaled how low its fortunes have fallen. After all, they note, the main purpose of Kim Jong Il's strange train trip across Siberia this summer was to send a message to Washington.
YET even if North Korea -- or China -- is playing a Russia card, a Gorchakov might argue, who cares? It means Russia is still in the game, and, it can be argued, as an increasingly constructive player. That was how Mr. Putin struck members of the Clinton administration in 2000, when, after visiting Pyongyang, he first offered to serve as a conduit. "He seized an opportunity to be an information broker," said Mr. Medish. "The Russians were pleased because it put them in a constructive position."
During the early days of the Putin administration, some experts suggested he might choose cooperation over confrontation in dealing with the West -- and so pose a greater challenge. "He will position Russia in such a way that Russia will not be blamed for confrontation," predicted one paper from the Center for Russia and Eurasia Studies in the spring of 2000.
Certainly, in his relations with the West, Mr. Putin has largely opted for cooperation. One of his first official acts was to push through the Duma, or parliament, ratification of the Start II treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which is more than the Americans have done.
The Russians have vigorously opposed the administration's plans to abandon the ABM treaty but, even there, their public statements have been free of the finger-pointing characteristic not only of the cold war, but also of the Yeltsin era. 
There is, of course, a pragmatic reason for this reasonable tone. The Russians still hope to negotiate deep cuts in the American and Russian offensive nuclear arsenals -- one of Moscow's long-term goals.
"Moscow has not supported the Chinese radical language on missile defense," said Mr. Kaiser, "because they are keeping open the option of making a deal with the U.S."
What that deal will be remains to be to seen. But some experts contend that Russia has won points, particularly in Europe, as the more reasonable of the two. "We have managed to make the Russians look constructive, rather than obstructive," said Mr. Medish.
Yet the war in Chechnya casts a pall over Russia's image abroad. In parts of Central Europe and the Baltics, memories of Soviet occupation are still fresh.
But Russia's importance for Europe has never been in doubt -- if only for geographic reasons. Now, Mr. Putin has put Europe at the center of his diplomatic efforts -- a shift from Soviet days when Moscow looked to the developing world to test its influence.
Earlier this year, the European Union and Russia reached an agreement to establish a "common economic space," a dialogue on energy and, most intriguingly, on crisis prevention, which raises the possibility of joint efforts to defuse hot spots. 
"This is something quite substantial," said Mr. Kaiser, "and the quality of the relationship is such that it holds the potential to achieve something."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
Rate Cuts Won't Spur an Economy Choked by Debt

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
IT was a law of nature, according to Wall Street. Whenever the Federal Reserve cut rates, the stock market moved higher in six months or so.
 Such was the chant in January, when Alan Greenspan began his most recent rate-cut crusade. But as the ensuing months in the market have shown, brokerage-firm gurus are better at salesmanship than science. The natural law they cited appears to have been suspended. 
 Including the quarter-point cut last Tuesday, rates have been slashed by three percentage points this year. Yet the economy has weakened and the sure-thing bull market is missing. Notwithstanding the rally on Friday, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is down 10 percent for the year, while the Nasdaq has lost 22 percent.
Investors appear to be recognizing that many woes faced by corporate America cannot be eliminated with a wave of Mr. Greenspan's wand. The cold truth is, when borrowers are up to their eyebrows in debt, even the most aggressive interest rate cuts can't seduce lenders into making additional, and riskier, loans. 
Balance sheets are now dictating events. And these aggregations of assets and liabilities, whether they belong to a company or a consumer, are in awful shape. 
Corporate borrowing in recent years has been an unadulterated binge. In 2000, according to the Fed, corporations borrowed $437 billion, almost double the amount raised in 1995. Corporate debt recently stood at 85 percent of gross domestic product, a record high.
Now, however, lenders are pulling back. While lower rates have resulted in sizable bond issuance, Moody's Investors Service expects corporate debt to increase just 5.2 percent this year, well down from the 11.5 percent gain in 2000. And lenders, although willing, have demanded higher yields, compared with the risk-free benchmark.
As long as the capital markets were willing to throw money at companies, they could spend more than they made. Consider how wide the gap had become between what companies spent on projects and what they made in cash flow. That difference, financed by investors and lenders, hit $251 billion at the end of last year. In 1995, it was $100 billion. 
Now, even as the Fed has cut rates, liquidity provided by investors and lenders is drying up. Ravi Suria, the convertible-bond analyst who made several prescient calls at Lehman Brothers before moving to a hedge fund this year, saw early that the Fed's rate cuts would not propel lenders and investors back into an easy-money mode. In a report last Dec. 15 on the telecommunications industry, Mr. Suria compared Fed easing in the current environment to cutting the interest rate for a consumer whose credit card is already at the limit. "It is unlikely that lenders will be willing to give a highly leveraged, noninvestment-grade company additional debt solely because the cost of primary funding for lenders has been reduced," he wrote.
Mr. Suria was talking about high-risk companies, but investment-grade concerns are also in debt. And hardly anyone can tap the equity markets for money. Only $83 billion has been raised through stock issues so far this year, according to Securities Data, and few believe that the 2001 total can reach the $162 billion of last year. The number of new filings is eroding still.
When technology was in the ascendancy, few people questioned the wisdom of using long-term debt to finance products with short life cycles. Only now, as some technology companies find that their debt exceeds the value of their enterprise, are questions being asked.
During the boom, it was not rate levels that spurred corporations to borrow. It was the availability of money. Until lenders start refinancing these companies, the Fed will have only a supporting role in the play.

To Gauge the Internet, Listen to the Steam Engine

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN 

 BODY:
 JOHN STEELE GORDON did not pass judgment on the Internet in his book, "The Business of America." In a recent interview, however, he did have some things to say about dot-com mania and its historical precedents.
 WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN

Q. How does the Internet compare with earlier waves of technology?

A. Some technologies are more fundamental than others. A better can opener doesn't change the world. But when a technology does something revolutionary, it changes the whole economic universe. A perfect case is the steam engine. Somebody born in 1720 would be utterly mystified by the world of 1820, which by then included railroads. The Internet is one of those very fundamental technologies; the microchip is another.

Q. Do you think that we understand the full dimensions of what the Internet will do to us?

A. Heavens, no. It will be a hundred years before it fully plays out, just like the steam engine. We are now at the point with the Internet that they were with the railroad in 1850. It's just beginning.

Q. Was the rush to invest in dot-coms typical of earlier investment manias?

A. Very typical. Whenever a new technology is brought before the public in a very impressive way, there is always a rush to invest in it, to get on the bandwagon. If you get on the right bandwagon, you get enormously rich. Of course, guessing the right horse is very difficult, especially when there are 10,000 horses in the race. After Lindbergh flew to Paris in 1927, for example, there was a bubble in aviation stocks. People rushed in without even knowing what they were buying. It turned out that one, Seaboard Airlines, was a poetically named railroad. It wasn't an airline at all.

Q. What are we learning from today's technology bust?

A. Old Andrew Carnegie's formula still applies. Whether you're making steel or software, you invest to be the low-cost producer. Keep the money. Don't pay it out in dividends. So that when times are bad, you can swoop in and scoop up the pieces. Bill Gates, for example, is sitting on billions of dollars and marketable securities. We haven't seen the last of him.

Q. You don't seem to think governments can be effective in breaking a monopoly.

A. Antitrust enforcement is a hippopotamus. It lumbers in after the game is over.

Q. So your view is that monopolies eventually self-destruct?

A. Right. Nobody works any harder than they have to. Lions don't make their living chasing fast wildebeests. They do it by chasing slow ones. It's the same in the marketplace. If you have the right widget and everyone comes to you, you get lazy.

Q. Do you subscribe to the view that we have a "new economy" that behaves differently than it did a few years ago?

A. Yes, we have a very different economy than we did 25 years ago. We haven't abrogated the laws of economics or the business cycle, but it is different. It's much more globalized than it was. And we learn about information so much faster.

Q. Will economic momentum resume?

A. This period reminds me of the English economy in the early part of the 19th century when their economy was exploding. The term "millionaire" was coined in 1827 by Benjamin Disraeli. Everybody was making so much money. The whole society was shifting. Power was shifting from the aristocracy, which owned the land, to the middle class, which owned the factories.

Q. So are you optimistic?

A. Over the long term, I'm very much a bull. Over the short term, it's a bumpy flight.

HEADLINE: How to Enliven The Fields of Dreams 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Your long account of the calamitous state of baseball was entertaining but largely very wide of the mark. 
 It's fun to know what the estimable Henry A. Kissinger and Rudolph W. Giuliani would do to heal the patient, but it's hugely more relevant to pick the brains of the two men who really count -- Bud Selig, the commissioner, and Donald Fehr, the head of the players' union, and they were scarcely heard from. 
Make no mistake: Baseball has some severe problems but they're not problems of popularity. The total media coverage of the game has never been greater and kids flood professional parks at all levels -- even if they don't watch midnight conclusions of World Series games. The real problems are economic, most importantly the control of ever-surging costs of player salaries. The N.B.A., N.H.L. and N.F.L. have all been able to work with their unions to contain costs through salary cap arrangements.
So far, at least, baseball's uniquely powerful and unified union has rejected this obvious solution. The union refuses to acknowledge publicly what it privately knows, that the operating statements of most clubs are appalling and that a stunning debt is accumulating in the industry. If the union does not contribute to the solution, I am confident that other forces in the ever-dynamic American culture will bring about a solution that the union won't relish but that the fans, I suspect, will.

HEADLINE: Harlem on the Cusp 

 BODY:
When Bill Clinton moved into the neighborhood, Harlem residents threw a party, gratified that their up-and-coming commercial district had attracted an ex-president's office. But to visit the community development that people are most thrilled about, you walk east on 125th Street, to the supermarket.
 The Pathmark store is modest, as modern grocery stores go. But its picture hangs in the lobby of Harlem's Carver Federal Savings Bank, which helped finance the deal. It has a place of pride on pamphlets that trumpet economic development in Harlem. When it opened in 1999, it was Harlem's first major supermarket in more than half a century -- an astonishing fact given that upper Manhattan has 500,000, people and is roughly the size of Atlanta. It employs about 300 people, the majority of them from the area, and is one of the more successful stores in the Pathmark chain. 
 The market came close to never getting built. It was stalled for 10 years, in part because of a very public turf war that seemed to be an advertisement for all the reasons business steered clear of Harlem. Now, for people in the neighborhood, it offers something that suburbanites take for granted -- a clean store, with fresh meat and vegetables at reasonable prices. And for the community development groups that have struggled for years to reclaim the area, the store's success is a perpetual advertisement for the fact that there is money to be made uptown.
During the 1960's, middle-class flight and business closings left Harlem one of the most blighted areas in New York. The city-financed effort that resurrected the South Bronx passed it by. Abandoned and neglected buildings were taken over by the city, which by the mid-1980's owned roughly half of the land and buildings in Harlem. Try as it might, the city could not do much more than tread water, keeping as many apartments marginally inhabitable as possible.
Little more than a ghost town 20 years ago, Harlem is now on the cusp of a recovery. In 1995 Deborah Wright, the housing commissioner for the Giuliani administration, came up with the program that transferred city-owned properties into the hands of not-for-profit developers who renovated them for low- and moderate-income families. The program has been particularly successful in Harlem, creating 36,000 units of affordable housing in the last 15 years. The city owns fewer than 200 buildings in Harlem now, down from more than 600 in 1994. The remaining city-owned buildings have all been scheduled for rehabilitation. Classic brownstones and 19th-century mansions that were boarded up for years could soon be elegant again, on streets buzzing with activity.
White New Yorkers who avoided Harlem have begun to venture north, in search of affordable housing. Black Harlemites whose families departed for the suburbs during the 1960's are beginning to return, seeking their ancestral roots. The homeownership rate in Harlem has increased over the last decade -- from 6 percent to 10 percent -- but still lags far behind the rate for the entire city, where about a third of people own homes. 
In 1996, Harlem became part of a federal empowerment zone, which has spurred a commercial renaissance with a $300 million development fund and $250 million in tax incentives, to be spent over 10 years. The empowerment zone played a crucial role in the Harlem USA project, which features several movie theaters and a successful Old Navy store. In addition, developers have broken ground on a new retail building just across from the Pathmark. Plans for a new hotel are to be announced soon. 
There is still a lot to be done. The resurgence received a setback this year, when scam artists began to use a Department of Housing and Urban Development program to bilk the government of federally secured mortgage money and construction loans. Several hundred properties in New York were fraudulently acquired by people who took the money and left the buildings derelict. About 175 of these buildings are in Harlem, most of them boarded up. They need to be conveyed to groups that can reclaim them. The neighborhood also needs a more diversified retail base for its shopping strips. Instead of concentrating on big developments, the empowerment zone must pay more attention to small, community-based retailers that have traditionally been turned down by banks. The recovery will be incomplete until it brings in more of Harlem's small-business men and women.
The slowing economy could threaten all the progress -- the community's unemployment rate is easily three times that of the city as a whole. But right now, virtually all the trends are in the right direction. When Mr. Clinton looks out of his office windows, he can watch Harlem coming back.

HEADLINE: Leisure Class to Working Class in Saudi Arabia 

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: JIDDA, Saudi Arabia 

 BODY:
To coax skittish young Saudis into working on an assembly line churning out 300,000 packages of cookies a day, the managers at the National Biscuits & Confectionery Company have learned to maintain a certain degree of flexibility -- and patience.
 One Saudi man objected to wearing overalls, embarrassed when acquaintances rolled down their car windows and joked that he should avoid police patrols looking for illegal immigrants. Another disliked the job title of laborer assigned to the roughly $6,000 per year entry job, wanting to tell his new bride he was a technician. A third insisted that he belonged in management, not production. 
 "A Saudi who is working on our factory floor came and said 'Why can't I become a supervisor? I graduated from college and I have a diploma and I am working among all these people from Nepal and Bangladesh and India,' " said William Menzies, the New Zealander running the factory. "That is a case of false expectations." 
It is an affliction that permeates Saudi society, rooted in the impression that a country with seemingly bottomless oil reserves would always be rich.
But the relaxed life is slowly vanishing. Saudi Arabia faces problems more typical of any other developing country, and young Saudis are confronting the fact that they will have to work at real jobs -- if they can find them. 
It is a rocky transition for a country where the generation that came of age in the 1980's lived as if they had won the lottery. They garnered monthly stipends from the government for enrolling in college, and upon graduation were guaranteed a spot on the public payroll with hefty wages and a 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. workday -- basically a license to sit at home and do nothing.
"There is an Arabic word, itikali, when you always want someone else to do something for you," said Prince Abdullah bin Faisal, 51, a nephew of the king and chairman of the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority. "Like now, some Saudis don't want to take work. They became lazy, spoiled." 
Saudi Arabia has managed to lift virtually everyone out of poverty. But today, even with lofty oil prices, the petrodollars do not stretch as far, not least because they are being spread among more Saudi citizens. 
The baby boom generation spawned by 1970's oil wealth is wading into a job market that can only generate one job for every two men. Prospects may only get worse considering that half the 14 million Saudis are under 18.
The tradition of ruling princes spending the country out of any problem (and please don't bother us with any silly questions while we're doing it) no longer functions smoothly. But no one envisions what can replace it. 
As a result, the kingdom is an anxious country unsure how to open itself to the world at large, especially the West. Suddenly, it must find ways to relax its rigid traditions in order to make the economy grow. It needs jobs for a new generation whose parents napped contentedly beside the public trough. It needs to refurbish its once awe-inspiring infrastructure of soaring airport terminals, freeways and phone booths pitched in the middle of the desert. It needs power and water to reduce rolling blackouts and water rationing.
To some extent the future hinges on the unresolved question of how to pass down the absolute monarchy once all 44 sons of the founder, King Abdel Aziz al-Saud, are gone.
And now that the royal clan numbers roughly 7,000 princes, there are also questions about how much longer some members can treat the kingdom like their private club.
Since the discovery of oil, Saudi Arabia's wealth has existed in uneasy proximity to the country's ascetic Islamic foundations. Oil wealth allowed the Saudis to live suspended in a state of creative ambiguity. 
The secular merchant class lives in its world and the fervently religious live in theirs. Where the interests of the two groups collide, the rules exist in shades of gray.
The insurance business -- suspect to the religious because they believe God wills accidents -- dwells outside formal laws, for example, because commerce depends on it. Women's driving, however, remains banned because convenience does not outweigh religious opposition. 
"The thing that people overlook or don't know or pretend they don't know is that Saudi Arabia is not an ordinary Islamic country; it is the heartland of all Islamic countries," said Wahib Binzagr, 68, the unassuming patriarch of a Jidda merchant clan. His affluence is only noticeable in subtle ways -- like the gold studs used to close his white robe. "But we have to choose whether we want to be isolated or part of the world as a whole."

Two unusual but telling pictures appeared recently on the front page of Saudi Arabia's main business newspaper. Each showed a young man wearing a somewhat outlandish costume, opening car doors and helping to carry suitcases into the Hyatt Regency Jidda. A young Saudi taking a bellboy job here is front page news. "The major challenge now is the growth of the population -- you have a lot of young people growing up," said Abdulrahman al-Tuwaijri, secretary general of the Supreme Economic Council. "You need schools, you need health care and you need jobs." 
"Saudization" laws passed five years ago mandated gradually eliminating the need for millions of expatriate workers. According to the law, the number of local workers in any business had to increase five percentage points a year, which meant that by this year one-quarter of every company's employee roll was supposed to be Saudi.
It has not happened.
Some employers -- banks, with marbled, air-conditioned interiors and abbreviated hours -- exceed the new levels easily. But companies that deploy thousands of street sweepers employ virtually no Saudis. The National Biscuits & Confectionery plant here is considered exemplary; it has more than 50 Saudi workers, or 11 percent, though strict adherence to the 25 percent would require 110 Saudis.
"If I hire, on an annual basis, 200 Saudis, I find at least 150 will leave," sighed Muhammad H. Kadi, general manager for human resources at the factory and its sister companies.
Hiring Saudis is one thing; getting them to show up is another. Managers at the cookie factory found that 18 percent of the 80 workers brought from Nepal were absent during any given month, while more than half the Saudis did not come to work. 
Still, managers sense that the aloof attitude toward work is receding. Per capita income exceeded $28,000 in the early 1980's, matching that of the United States. The population of native Saudis has nearly doubled since, to 14 million, while the per capita income has sunk below $7,000. 
Young Saudis fear they will never attain the same standard of living as their parents. Prospective workers no longer ask first about status issues like the size of their office. 
The pressure of marrying young, not to mention buying a house and car, is convincing many young Saudis that even a factory job is better than none at all.
Ten years ago unemployment was a nonissue. Now it is officially pegged around 18 percent, and is probably much higher among recent graduates. 
The picture is not likely to improve. An estimated 100,000 young men enter the labor force each year while the public and private sectors generate about 50,000 jobs.
"It won't be long before this goes from being a concern to being a major problem," said Brad Bourland, chief economist for the Saudi American Bank.
The strain already shows. When the military college in Riyadh advertised 10 jobs last year, several prospective applicants were injured in the melee that resulted when more than 1,000 people showed up.
And this is even before the kingdom considers broadening job opportunities for women. Aside from the ban on women driving cars, the obstacles to hiring women in places like factories are considerable. The legal separation of the sexes mandates an entire separate production line, separate entrances and other facilities. For the moment only a small percentage of educated women work outside the home, mostly in medicine and education. But like their male counterparts, many women crave greater opportunity.
Officials remain sanguine for now.
"We don't, in the government of Saudi Arabia, admit there is unemployment, basically because there are the jobs," said Prince Sultan bin Salman, who is in charge of creating a tourism industry. "There are six or seven million expatriates working in the kingdom. Many of those jobs can be done by Saudis."

An Aging System
Dirty Secret Lurks Behind the Fable
Jidda, the city that styles itself as the bride of the Red Sea, harbors an extremely dirty secret. A toxic sea of raw sewage pumped from the city's septic tanks festers just inland, fed daily by at least 1,000 trucks dumping an additional 50,000 cubic meters of sewage. (About 20 Olympic-size swimming pools each day.) The fouled water then seeps into precious aquifers. 
The fact that three-quarters of Jidda, a cosmopolitan port of some three million people, lacks a sewage system is merely the most pungent of Saudi Arabia's shortcomings.
The kingdom is rapidly outstripping the fabled infrastructure it bought with oil largess. The highways are still phenomenal, but the water, power and telephone systems all show their age. Big cities like Riyadh and Jidda endure rolling blackouts and water rationing, especially during peak summer demand when desert temperatures often hover around 109 degrees Fahrenheit.
"The economy can't grow enough anymore just by dumping all the oil revenue into it," said Mr. Bourland of the Saudi American Bank. "It is not enough money to fuel growth for an economy of more than 20 million people." Ibrahim A. al-Assaf, the finance minister, says that Saudi Arabia needs to spend $100 billion in the next 15 years to keep up with electricity demand, and that water treatment needs $27 billion in the next few years.
To obtain overseas investment, the kingdom is using the leverage of its oil reserves and its natural gas deposits, considered fourth in the world behind Russia, Iran and Qatar. A gas deal signed this summer will reopen the country to foreign oil companies despite fierce opposition from the domestic oil giant, Aramco.
Eight companies will explore for gas on the condition that they spend part of their initial $20 billion investment on building plants for desalination and electricity.
Beyond that, Mr. Assaf, the finance minister, and other leading Saudi economic officials stress that Saudi Arabia intends to overhaul its entire economy with new foreign investment laws in the works, new tax laws, a new capital-markets law, new commercial laws and at least a stated goal of joining the World Trade Organization. 
Joining the W.T.O., the finance minister said, would give Saudi Arabia the seat at the international trade table it deserves as an economic player.
Two months ago import tariffs were lowered to 5 percent from 12 percent, and foreigners are now allowed to own property outside the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Saudi Arabia also hopes to expand its economy by creating a tourism industry and becoming a manufacturing hub for the region. 
Many Saudis, however, find the kingdom long on reform announcements and short on bricks-and-mortar achievements. 
Saudis and foreign investors alike bemoan the country's legendary sluggishness and protectionist habits. The trumpeted changes to lure foreign investors came with a long list of areas closed to non-Saudis. Called the Negative List, it includes oil exploration and production, wholesale and retail trade, printing, transport, fishing and some medical services. The finance minister calls it temporary. To the Saudi business community, the best opening for change is the possibility of joining the World Trade Organization, nudging the kingdom toward the kind of financial transparency it has long avoided. Saudi law, for example, is drawn solely from the Koran and the Hadith, the practices of the prophet Muhammad. Although there is wide latitude for interpretation, principles developed in the 7th century are sometimes in conflict with 21st-century needs. Take mortgages, for example. In the late 1970's, any Saudi could get an interest-free, $80,000 housing loan from the government in days. The amount remains the same, yet the waiting list now stretches 10 years.
The growing population craves housing, however, and home building could provide an economic lift. But Islam forbids interest, making mortgages difficult.
In addition, the religious establishment, which dominates the legal system, has a knack for propagating random edicts that can abruptly destroy any venture. For example, Pokemon, the children's game, became the target of a ban this year because it was said to encourage un-Islamic behavior like gambling, and was somehow considered Zionist to boot. It was whisked off store shelves, and the manufacturer had no means of redress.

Royals and Citizens
On the Lookout For Fresh Leadership
In the 1930's, King Abdel Aziz kept the treasury of his newly unified kingdom in wooden boxes, calling for bags of coins to dispense as needed. Many Saudis feel that the al-Saud rulers still treat the treasury that way, except now an estimated 7,000 royal princes camp at the front of the line. 
"A lot of them have the mentality of 'I own this country and you are here to serve me,' " said one Saudi economist.
During the oil boom years, the tacit understanding was that the government would pay for everything and the people would not ask questions. Now, an increasingly educated population surveys a country hobbled by its isolation, yet unable to make the far-reaching changes needed because of a certain stagnation at the top. "They don't understand the concept of giving people their rights; we are their subjects," said an American-trained Saudi lawyer.
Crown Prince Abdullah, effectively running the kingdom for five years because King Fahd has been ill, has pushed to open the country by letting in foreign oil companies again and lowering barriers to foreign investment. But he can only take matters so far, since he is not yet king and is 77 years old. What's more, succession is complex. Just how Saudi Arabia will change depends on who will run the country.
Succession does not seem a major concern to most Saudis, but some worry about the kingdom's lineup of aging monarchs at the very moment it needs energetic, worldly leaders. King Abdel Aziz established the system of inheritance according to age and family consensus in the hope of avoiding fratricide. The one rule is that any king must be his direct descendant. King Fahd is the fourth son to hold the throne since King Abdel Aziz died in 1953. More than 20 other sons survive from among his 22 marriages. 
There is no doubt that the proliferation of princes grates among the professional classes. 
A waiter glides up to a senior government official settling onto a couch in a hotel lobby to tell him that it is permanently reserved for a local prince. "Another prince?" the official snapped, before regaining his composure. "Please don't quote me on that," he said to a reporter.
But to some the unhurried system of succession is delaying decisions by senior princes who worry that one mistake might hurt their standing. In addition, they sometimes appear to be creating personal fiefdoms with an interlocking network of personal loyalties. 
Prince Abdullah used to run the national guard, a job now held by one of his sons. The defense minister, Prince Sultan, made one son, Prince Khalid -- former commander of the Persian Gulf war forces -- his deputy. The same holds true for Prince Nayef, the interior minister, who at 65 is considered third or fourth in line.
But royals deny that anything is preordained. "There is no acquired right in this issue and there will not be any," Prince Nayef said in a rare interview. "I want to stress that they were chosen as normal citizens, not as members of the royal family and the sons of this one or that one." 
With Abdel Aziz's sons dying off, Prince Nayef said, the move to the next generation could come either through a family vote or by a future king picking a member of the next generation as crown prince.
Educated Saudis would prefer a more formal system of government. One reason business leaders back World Trade Organization membership, for example, is that they hope it will force the country to eliminate whimsical rulings. (And royal whim is one reason no Saudis want to be quoted by name when discussing their rulers.) Having one-quarter of the world's oil reserves has always allowed them to make their own rules.
"Money is spent on palaces, not think tanks; we have 300 palaces in Jidda alone," said a former member of the 120-seat Consultative Council, which the king appoints. It was designed to give greater public participation in decision making, but the king sways the agenda. "We need to clarify who owns the country, the people or the king," he added. 
For the moment, nobody knows what awaits when Saudis earning a living surely start wondering aloud about the way they are governed. Members of the younger generation are prone to want change. 
One indication of that came at 11 p.m. on a steamy summer weekend, during rush hour along the wide pedestrian quay circling the marina of Durrat Al-Arrus, a Red Sea beach resort town north of Jidda.
Saudi young men, some bristling out of their muscle shirts, sauntered past young women wearing stretch jeans. A few women dared let their hair float free; occasionally they even broke Saudi law by driving. 
The scene would be tame elsewhere, but it is shockingly risque for keep-it-under-a-robe Saudi Arabia. A young man with a ponytail said the resort felt like a foreign country. He and his friends said they wanted changes but did not want Saudi Arabia to ape the West. They shook their heads no when asked if they wanted someplace to dance in Durrat al-Arrus, for example. They abhor the idea of their sisters mingling with men who are strangers. But they do seek a greater sense of personal freedom.
"Ten years ago we really used to suffer, but in another 20, a lot of things will change," said the young man with the ponytail. The others around him all nodded.

The Perils of Plenty
Articles in this series are examining how sudden wealth from natural resources can bring unexpected problems for countries struggling to come out of poverty. The first article, last May, looked at whether Chad can escape the corruption often associated with oil riches. Later articles will look at other problems as political and economic systems elsewhere react to newfound wealth.

HEADLINE: Still Working, Boomers 'Retire' to Resorts 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS 

DATELINE: JACKSON TOWNSHIP, N.J., Aug. 21 

 BODY:
With their children grown and out of the house, Georgina and Richard Davis faced something of a dilemma. They could have mothballed the empty bedrooms in their rambling Colonial and continued paying the lawn doctor, the pool cleaner and the guy who picked up after their dogs in the yard. Or they could have followed their parents' generation and migrated to a low-maintenance retirement complex in Florida.
 But the Davises chose the kind of move that holds increasing appeal for members of the baby boom generation, who began hitting 55 this year. They decided on a tract of sandy pine scrub in central New Jersey that is being carved into a residential resort that caters to every whim of the moneyed, leisure-seeking boomer. 
 Today, the couple strolled into the sales center at the resort here in Ocean County, Greenbriar Westlake, and signed the papers on a $400,000 house far smaller than the six-bedroom home they own in Manalapan, just a half-hour to the north. What they got for their money is a gated neighborhood of quiet cul-de-sacs and tightly packed homes where children are permitted to visit but not live. 
It has an 18-hole golf course, two pools, an expansive clubhouse and, most important, maintenance-free living. "When you get to our age, the grass starts growing much faster and the stairs become your enemy," said Mr. Davis, 55, an accountant who said he had no intention of retiring soon. "As for the kids, they can stay in a hotel when they come to visit. Who needs the noise?"
In a trend sweeping the building industry, tens of thousands of older Americans are forsaking the sun-and-sand colonies of Florida, Arizona and California and choosing to stay closer to home in so-called active-adult communities that combine luxurious, suburban-style living with the amenities of a country club.
Unlike traditional communities for older adults, these enclaves eschew the word "retirement" and supply a dizzying array of distractions to keep residents busy and healthy.
Although there are no national statistics on such communities, industry experts say New Jersey has more than any other. "New Jersey is the trendsetter," said Leslie Marks, executive director of the National Home Builders Association's Senior Housing Council. "It's starting to happen in other places, but New Jersey is a hotbed of activity."
The center of the trend is Ocean County, poised halfway between Philadelphia and New York and blessed with huge tracts of undeveloped land. In the past five years, the nation's biggest home builders have flocked to the area, creating more than 10,000 single-family homes in developments that look like scaled-down versions of suburban tracts, but without the minivans, spacious lawns and frolicking children
And with millions of affluent boomers nearing the retirement threshold, the builders are seeing gold.
"This is just the tip of the iceberg," said Kira McCarron, vice president for marketing of Toll Brothers, a luxury-home builder that is developing two age-restricted communities in Ocean County and another two in metropolitan Detroit and Washington.
Like other builders, Toll Brothers is tapping into a bulging population of aging homeowners drawn from metropolitan New York and Philadelphia, where soaring real estate values have turned middle-class suburbanites into well-off empty nesters, experts say.
"People who paid $30,000 for a Bergen County ranch in the 1960's can sell it for $300,000 and live the life they never had when they had kids and bills," said William Becker, a consultant to the age-restricted housing industry. "Most of these people are paying cash for their new places, which is why it's such a hot business."
Unlike many in their parents' generation, aging boomers do not want to be far from family and friends, and do not want to skimp on creature comforts, builders say. They want cathedral ceilings, two-car garages, big closets and big windows overlooking the golf course.
Many are opting for basements and second floors, features unheard of in retirement communities a decade ago. And they want space to entertain and an extra bedroom for visiting grandchildren. "They don't want to make sacrifices to move out of their homes," Ms. McCarron said. "They want to retire gracefully."
They also don't want to slow down. More than a third of those buying homes in adult communities still work, market researchers say, but they have more time for tennis, tai chi and canasta.
Traditional retirement villages used to draw people in their mid-60's and early 70's, from a Depression-era demographic that wanted small, reasonably priced homes, a shuffleboard court and an on-site health clinic.
These days, the average buyer is 62, with many in their early 50's, according to the New Jersey Senior Housing Council. (In general, people younger than 55 are allowed in as long as their spouses are older.) 
"It's the Kennedy generation versus those who grew up in the Eisenhower years, and there's a big difference in the way they live," said Lisa Poggi, director of sales and marketing for Pulte Homes' Northeast active-adult division. "They're not looking to trade down anymore." 
Mr. Becker, 74, who helped pioneer age-restricted housing in the early 1960's, said the new crop of adult developments was selling more than just houses. "The message we send out is 'resort, resort, resort,' " he said. "Our advertisements barely even talk about housing."
The industry's advertisements feature images of gray-haired grandparents vigorously biking, swimming and swinging 9-irons -- or their grandchildren. "The R word is out," Mr. Becker said, referring to retirement.
"You don't even talk about medical facilities, although if they ask, you point out that there's a good hospital nearby," he added.
Sitting in the card room at Greenbriar Westlake, Judy Herling and her new friends let out a collective groan when asked why they did not choose Florida for their retirement years.
The heat and bugs are unbearable, they said, pausing from their weekly mah-jongg game, and the distance from big-city culture would have been stultifying. From here, they pointed out, Manhattan's theaters and museums are an hour away by car, as are their families and friends.
"I like the fact that I didn't have to change doctors or cleaners," said Mrs. Herling, a retired schoolteacher in her late 50's from Marlboro. "And I didn't want to drive more than 20 minutes to see my grandkid play a soccer game. My parents moved to Florida 30 years ago, and they missed seeing their grandchildren grow up."
Trudy Klein, a retired saleswoman from Rockland County, N.Y., also in her late 50's, agreed, adding that retirement in a faraway state would put an unfair burden on her children. "If I get sick, they'd have to jump on a plane to see me," she said.
With the share of the United States population age 65 or older expected to reach nearly 20 percent by 2030, demographers and builders agree that the market is ripe for such communities. "It's a huge tidal wave, and it's no surprise that developers are responding to that market," said James W. Hughes, the dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University.
Builders have been catering to the boom generation since the 1960's and 70's with garden apartments, then the town houses of the 80's, and in the last decade, large single-family homes packed with top-notch appliances and features.Although "people may want to scale down a bit," Dr. Hughes said, "they still want the Jacuzzi and the granite countertop."
The Davises, for example, took a $226,000 model, the Heritage (one of nine available floor plans), and added $170,000 in options, including a second level, a great room and a sunroom. Buyers must also pay maintenance fees of up to $200 a month.
Mrs. Davis, who runs her own business, said she planned to put in hardwood floors, ceramic tiles and crown molding. "I can spend the extra money because I know the kids aren't going to ruin it," she said with a smile. "And besides, this is the last stop before the nursing home."
Adult complexes are good not only for developers, but also for the town governments that approve their construction.
Municipalities that fear the extra services demanded by standard subdivisions are actively courting age-restricted projects, which produce tax revenue but create no demands on school districts. And because the streets are privately policed and maintained, there is minimal need for police, fire and snowplowing services.
"Retired folks are a wonderful group to have," said James Mancini, an Ocean County freeholder and the county's liaison to elderly residents. "Whether the economy is good or bad, they keep getting their Social Security and pension checks."
There are now more than 100 age-restricted communities in Ocean County, the second-fastest-growing New Jersey county in the past decade, thanks to an influx of older residents. More than 31 percent of the 78,000 people who moved to the county in the 1990's were 55 or older, according to the 2000 census.
Some municipalities, like Manchester and Berkeley Townships, now have a median age of more than 66, compared with the statewide median of 37. Monmouth and Mercer Counties, which share the midsection of the state, are also experiencing a wave of adult-community construction.
New Jersey has also benefited from New York's more restrictive building environment, which builders say makes such developments nearly impossible. In New York, the state attorney general regulates adult communities, but New Jersey has no statewide mechanism to oversee them.
Age-restricted communities do not appeal to everyone, however. Iris Cooper, 55, who recently moved from a town house to the Village Grande at Bear Creek, a development in West Windsor, said she missed the sounds and sights of children. "The quiet takes some getting used to," she said. "And it's odd not seeing tricycles and kids running around."
Others complain about the rules and restrictions, set by elected association boards, which govern everything from landscaping to window treatments.
"My only gripe is they made me give up my wind chimes," said Jo-Ann Koonz, 53, who moved to Greenbriar Westlake from Dallas. Mrs. Cooper said she had been wrestling with her homeowners' association over the design of a patio she hopes to build in her backyard. "These people have nothing better to do, so they're sticklers for everything."
But for many, the appeal of such communities outweighs the drawbacks.
Three weeks ago, when the development company K. Hovnanian opened a series of model homes at its Four Seasons at Upper Freehold, more than 300 people showed up in one weekend.
"People are just clamoring for this product," said Michael Villane, vice president for marketing and sales in K. Hovnanian's Northeast division, which has nine age-restricted communities under construction in New Jersey. "We just can't build them fast enough."

HEADLINE: The Promise In Selling Stem Cells 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: MENLO PARK, Calif. 

 BODY:
FOR a man who is supposed to be sitting on top of the world, Thomas B. Okarma can be a bit prickly. "I may sound offensive, but we are being invaded here," he said recently, reflecting the strain of giving many interviews.
 Dr. Okarma is the chief executive of the Geron Corporation, which controls many of the rights to human embryonic stem cells because it financed the first isolation of such cells, which occurred in 1998 at the University of Wisconsin. Stem cells might someday be used to grow new heart, liver or brain tissue for people whose own organs are damaged, allowing the body to repair itself. 
 On Aug. 9, President Bush said he would allow federal funds to be used for research on human embryonic stem cells, which could help scientists to accelerate the development of disease treatments that would mean income for Geron in the long run. The president's decision to restrict federally financed research to cell lines that already exist, some scientists say, will virtually force them to use cells for which Geron controls the commercial rights. 
"This is where the center of the universe is in stem cells," Dr. Okarma said.
But the center of this universe is not exactly an easy position to be in right now. Academic scientists are already asserting that Geron has a stranglehold on patent rights and that this could retard research that might lead to treatments for diabetes, Parkinson's disease and other maladies.
Geron is now embroiled in a federal lawsuit with its own partner, a University of Wisconsin foundation, over whether the company has the right to other uses of the technology.
Those who view stem cell work as immoral, meanwhile, are criticizing the company. Desperate people with incurable diseases are beseeching the company for treatments, though none will be ready for years if ever. And news organizations have bombarded the company with requests for interviews.
But the greatest challenge may be on the business side. Wall Street appears to believe that Geron, far from being a rapacious profiteer, may never even earn a profit. The company, they say, is much better at coming up with scientific discoveries than at turning them into viable businesses.
Few companies have stirred such headline-making scientific excitement as has Geron, which started life with the intriguing mission of fighting aging. Besides its role in stem cells, Geron has isolated the genes for telomerase, an enzyme that has been described, with some exaggeration, as an elixir of youth because it may play crucial roles in both aging and cancer-cell growth. Geron also acquired the company with the commercial rights to the technology used to create Dolly the sheep, the first cloned mammal, in 1996.
"It's the most valuable patent estate in all of biotechnology," said Lissa Morgenthaler, manager of the Monterey Murphy New World Biotechnology fund.
Yet no analysts at major Wall Street brokerage firms follow the company, and few institutions invest in it. That is partly because Geron, which has lost about $150 million since its inception in 1990, is years from making money. It lost $45.8 million last year, on revenue of $6.6 million.
"I'm not interested in investing on hype," said Lowell Sears of Sears Capital Management in Los Altos, Calif. "I'd like to see it worked through a little more." Mr. Sears, the former chief financial officer of Amgen, the biotechnology company, said he sold most of his Geron holdings last year because the telomerase program had fallen behind schedule and it was unclear whether stem cells would become a viable business.
So perhaps it is not surprising that Dr. Okarma, a physician turned entrepreneur, is a little prickly. But in a wide-ranging two-hour interview at Geron's headquarters in this suburban Silicon Valley city, Dr. Okarma vowed to turn the company's scientific assets into cures -- and profits.
"This company is going to dominate regenerative medicine," he said, using the term for treatments that allow the body to repair itself. "That is what I came here to do."
He said Wall Street had just not looked closely enough at the company, which employs 130 people. "If anybody would pick up our annual report and read what's in there, you wouldn't see technology, you'd see products," he said.
Dr. Okarma, 55, said Geron had already figured out how to turn human stem cells into heart cells that he says "beat" in a laboratory dish, into brain cells and into liver cells, with the next challenge being to manufacture in large quantities. He predicted that the company could start transplanting its first cells into patients in three years, far sooner than many scientists think that such therapy will be ready for clinical trials. He would not say what cell type would be first, but the company is looking closely at treating Parkinson's disease.
The patent on the human embryonic stem cell is held by a foundation affiliated with the University of Wisconsin, which is providing cells to researchers elsewhere. But Geron has the exclusive rights to commercialize treatments using six different cell types derived from the stem cells, like neural cells and liver cells. It wants to exercise options for the rights to 12 other cell types, but Wisconsin is suing to prevent that, saying it would be better if the technology were spread around.
Dr. Okarma said Geron did not want to impede others from doing research on stem cells or developing treatments. But if someone, were to figure out, say, how to turn stem cells into insulin-producing pancreatic cells to treat diabetes, Geron would demand royalties on sales of treatments.
"If there are 10 companies out there doing that for diabetes that's great for Geron because that's 10 royalties," he said. That could work both ways. If Geron wanted to sell its own diabetes treatment, it might have to license technology for turning stem cells into pancreas cells from other companies.
Dr. Okarma says Geron collaborates with many academic scientists. The company boasts a blue-chip roster of scientific advisers including James Watson, a discoverer of the structure of DNA, and Ian Wilmut, who cloned Dolly.
While some scientists say Geron is easy to work with, others say it demands too many rights to discoveries or imposes too many restrictions. Ali Brivanlou, a professor at Rockefeller University, said he could not collaborate with Geron on stem cells because the company's proposed agreement would have severely restricted his ability to talk about his work with colleagues, something essential for scientific progress. "They sent something that was not only hostile but was, in the words of the tech transfer officer here, punitive," he said.
DR. OKARMA disputed the contention that President Bush's limits on stem cell research would play into Geron's hands. He said that the Wisconsin patent was so fundamental that even if the president allowed new stem cell lines to be created with federal money, those lines would all infringe the Wisconsin patent. That, however, has not been tested in court, and some competitors say they think their cells do not infringe.
Dr. Okarma also said that in addition to the rights it already has to the Wisconsin patent, Geron has filed for new patents on techniques for growing stem cells and turning them into particular types of cells that others would have to license.
"It's not our fault that we had two years of running room ahead of everyone else," he said. "We were working to derive these cells before anyone else thought about it. I'm not apologetic for our intellectual property. We paid for it, we earned it and we deserve it."
Dr. Okarma is driven to have Geron succeed for another reason, as well -- to make up for the failure of his former company, Applied Immune Sciences. That company, which he founded in the 1980's after resigning from the faculty of the Stanford Medical School, took bone marrow or blood cells from patients, then modified, sorted and multiplied them and put them back in to try to treat diseases like cancer and AIDS.
The company went public, began several clinical trials and attracted investment from Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, a unit of the big French drug company now known as Aventis. In 1995, Rhone-Poulenc bought the entire company for $84.4 million, making Dr. Okarma rich and taking him on board as an executive. But then Rhone-Poulenc discontinued the work and none of the treatments reached the market.
"It was a big, colossal flop," said Dr. Okarma, who left Rhone-Poulenc in 1996. "That was a very hard lesson."
The lesson, he said, was that cell therapies tailored to individuals were not economically attractive, especially to big drug companies that like mass production of pills. The failure of Applied Immune Sciences, he said, has given him an appreciation for how hard it will be to turn stem cells into disease treatments.
After leaving Rhone-Poulenc, Dr. Okarma took a year off. He studied business at Stanford, honed his water-skiing skills and considered becoming a venture capitalist.
In exploring that last idea, he talked to Alex Barkas, a venture capitalist who was the chairman of Geron. Dr. Barkas persuaded Dr. Okarma to join the company in 1997 to head its new stem cell business. He was promoted to chief executive in 1999. (Dr. Barkas remains the chairman.)
"I came into this place ambivalent about operating again because I had been burned so badly," Dr. Okarma said.
But he said stem cells, unlike bone marrow cells, could be produced in large quantities, avoiding the problems of developing customized cells for each treatment.
And one of Geron's buildings, he noted, is the same one in which he helped to start Applied Immune Sciences. "It's a marvelous opportunity to finish what I started a long time ago," he said.
GERON'S future may be in Dr. Okarma's hands, but its agenda was set by Michael West, a cell biologist who believed that science could combat aging. After earning a Ph.D. from the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, he incorporated the company in 1990 and dropped out of medical school to pursue his dream in 1992, when the company received financing from some prominent venture capitalists.
Geron -- named after the Greek word for old man -- set out to prove a theory about why cells age. It focused on telomeres, stretches of DNA that cap chromosomes like the plastic tips of shoelaces. Every time a cell divides, the telomeres become shorter. When they run out, usually after 20 to 100 cell doublings, the cells stop dividing and start to die.
With collaborators, Geron raced to find the genes to produce telomerase, an enzyme made by some cells that restores telomeres to their full length. When Geron showed in early 1998 that telomerase could expand the life of cells growing in a test tube beyond their normal limits, it caused a fountain-of-youth sensation. "People thought we were going to put telomerase into the drinking water and everyone's going to live for 300 years," Dr. Okarma said. But just because cells can live longer does not mean that an entire body can.
The company is trying to distance itself from its anti-aging focus, even removing the hourglass from its logo. Instead, it is aiming at diseases associated with aging. Geron executives think telomerase can be used to rejuvenate aging cells to speed the healing of wounds. But its main focus has been on turning off telomerase to fight cancer.
Cancer cells produce telomerase, which lets them reproduce out of control. So a drug that turns off telomerase has potential use in treating all kinds of cancers. And because most normal cells in the body do not produce telomerase, such a drug would have little effect on healthy cells.
But it has taken longer than expected to find a drug that shuts off telomerase. Geron, which hoped to begin clinical trials of such a drug around 2000, is still a year or two away. Pharmacia, the big drug company that was financing much of Geron's work in this area, pulled out of the partnership in January.
Moreover, most scientists now say that even if telomerase is turned off, a tumor might still grow substantially before the telomeres in its cells run out and the cells die.
"We can kill it, but before we do it's going to increase tenfold in volume," said Judith Campisi, a scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory who collaborates with Geron on telomerase research. "The idea that inhibition of telomerase was going to be a cure for all cancers was oversold, and partly by the media."
But she and others said a telomerase inhibitor could still be important in stopping the tiny tumors that break off a main tumor and spread through the body, causing a recurrence of disease. Dr. Jerry Shay, a professor at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center who is collaborating with Geron, said a telomerase inhibitor on which he is working had slowed regrowth of prostate tumors in animals. "If you want to go for a blockbuster win, it takes time," he said.
Geron plans to begin clinical trials for a telomerase vaccine this fall at Duke University, Dr. Okarma said. Some immune system cells will be taken from a patient's body and exposed to telomerase; when they are put back into the body, they will be primed to attack cells that make the enzyme, presumably cancer cells. The company is also working with Roche to develop tests for telomerase that could be used to diagnose cancer.
STILL, many investors have apparently written off telomerase. Consider an event this month: Days after President Bush's decision on stem cells, Geron announced that it and its partner, Kyowa Hakko, a Japanese food and drug company, had found a telomerase-inhibiting compound that they would now move toward clinical trials. Geron scheduled an hourlong conference call to discuss the development with investors and analysts. But when Dr. Okarma threw the floor open for questions after his opening remarks, there was dead silence.
Even as he was moving on telomeres, Dr. West went off in search of the next thing -- stem cells. These primordial cells, isolated from embryos, can turn into any of the body's different cell types. James Thomson, a professor at the University of Wisconsin, had isolated monkey embryonic stem cells but could not get federal financing for work on human cells because of a ban on research that involved destroying embryos.
Geron financed the work on human cells at Wisconsin, as well as similar work at Johns Hopkins University and the University of California at San Francisco.
Dr. West, who was Geron's visionary but did not have a significant operating role, left the company in 1998 as its emphasis on anti-aging work diminished. He is now president of Advanced Cell Technology in Worcester, Mass., a competitor of Geron's that has made its own controversy by proposing to create clones for therapeutic purposes.
In 1999, Dr. Okarma replaced Ronald W. Eastman, a pharmaceutical industry veteran who had been Geron's chief executive since 1993. Mr. Eastman accepted the board's request to step aside because Dr. Okarma had more experience in cell therapy. He left Geron and now heads a company that provides interactive media to hospital patients.
DR. OKARMA, who is married with two grown children, was raised on a dairy farm in New Jersey and earned both a medical degree and a doctorate in molecular pharmacology from Stanford. Those who know him well describe him as highly intelligent and articulate.
"I think Tom is a very highly energetic, intense individual who really wants to make a contribution," said John Walker, a Geron director and chairman of Microcide Pharmaceuticals and Axys Pharmaceuticals.
Ever since the debate over stem cells heated up, Dr. Okarma has been an active advocate for such research. But he has declined to let company scientists be interviewed, saying they needed to focus on their work. "This is not show and tell," he said. "I'm the spokesman for the company, full stop."
He said he sympathized with people who believe that the research is immoral because it involves destroying embryos, which they regard as nascent human life.
"I was raised as a Catholic," he said. "Do you think it's good for me to hear that this stuff is challenged by the pope?"
But Dr. Okarma, who said he abandoned organized religion decades ago, added that the views might change when the benefits of cell therapy were realized.
"What is the objective of religion?" he asked. "To make society better. Isn't that what we're trying to do here?"
At one time, he said, there were religious objections to the use of anesthesia to reduce the pain of childbirth because of a biblical passage saying that Eve was supposed to suffer pain in labor after being cast out of the Garden of Eden.
Geron was one of the first biotech companies to form an ethics advisory committee of academic bioethicists. In 1999, the committee published its conclusions that embryonic stem cell work was ethically sound.
Some other bioethicists, however, said Geron's committee had been formed shortly before Wisconsin scientists announced the successful isolation of the human stem cells, creating the appearance that the committee was merely providing after-the-fact justification.
But Laurie Zoloth, the chairwoman of the committee, said Dr. Okarma, who attends many of its meetings, was sincerely interested in their opinions. "We've had a very much more than window-dressing relationship with them," said Dr. Zoloth, a professor of social ethics and Jewish philosophy at San Francisco State University.
Ethical issues also surround therapeutic cloning. The purpose of such cloning is not to create a baby but to use a patient's own cell to create embryos from which stem cells can be obtained. Such cells would grow into tissue matching that of the patient, so the patient's immune system would not reject transplants.
To obtain the cloning technology, Geron in 1999 acquired Roslin Bio-Med, the commercial spinoff of the Scottish research institute that cloned Dolly. That completed a triumvirate of technologies -- stem cells, telomerase to help keep such cells useful, and cloning to help tailor therapies to individuals.
THERE is a huge obstacle, however. The House of Representatives recently passed a bill that would ban all cloning, including therapeutic cloning. The legislation is pending in the Senate, where its prospects are unclear. 
Dr. Okarma said Geron would not be hurt much even if the bill became law, because its work in that area is based in Britain, where such work is allowed.
But he said that in practice, therapeutic cloning would "never, ever fly" because it is individualized cell therapy, not mass production, that is needed for cell therapies to succeed commercially. Geron, he said, wants to create human cloned embryos to learn about how adult cells revert to primordial status. That could allow for development of more economical techniques, like genetically engineering stem cells so that they do not provoke an immune response.
He said he was dead set against cloning to make babies, which he called a "crime against the clone," although stem cell work often becomes tied into the broader debate about cloning.
He recalled testifying before Congress one day, along with a cult that believes scientists from another planet created life on Earth and says it will clone people. "I knew from that moment we were in for the fight of our lives," he said.
After the interview, Dr. Okarma left for a weeklong vacation at his summer home near Lake Tahoe. When he returns, he would like to go back to running a business, and not being involved in politics. But the controversy is not likely to abate.
"The thing I worry most about," he said, "is that this is going to be a never-ending story."

HEADLINE: What's An Aging 'Barbarian' To Do? 

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
IN his private conference room, tucked away beside his formal Midtown Manhattan office, Henry R. Kravis keeps a framed quotation: "There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its outcome, than to take the lead in introducing a new order of things." 
 The line, from Niccolo Machiavelli, speaks to the image as a financial innovator that Mr. Kravis and his investment firm, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, have always cultivated. In the merger mania of the 1980's, Kohlberg Kravis did more than any other firm to popularize the leveraged buyout -- the use of huge amounts of debt, typically a mix of junk bonds, bank loans and a little cash, to buy public companies and take them private. 
 After acquiring such companies as Safeway Stores, Beatrice and Duracell, the firm reached the peak of its fame in 1989, when it completed what remains the largest-ever buyout, the acquisition of RJR Nabisco for $31 billion, including the assumption of debt. So vast was the power of K.K.R. at the time that "Barbarians at the Gate," the best-selling book chronicling the battle for RJR, noted that Mr. Kravis had "a war chest greater than the gross national products of Pakistan or Greece, his clout rivaling that of any in financial history." 
Last month, recalling his firm's earlier days, Mr. Kravis said: "We were instrumental in getting corporate managers to think like owners. We think we had some role in changing the landscape of corporate America." Along the way, Mr. Kravis and his cousin and partner, George R. Roberts -- both now 57 -- made themselves and their investors, mostly public pension funds, very rich. Their annualized returns in the mid-1980's reached as high as 40 percent.
But those days now seem far away. Today, far from being the king of Wall Street, Kohlberg Kravis is just one of dozens of buyout firms -- and one whose vitality beyond the working lives of its founders is unclear. 
Leveraged buyouts now play little role in shaping corporate America. In the first nine months of last year, they accounted for less than 2 percent of all acquisitions, down from a high of 34 percent in 1988, according to J. P. Morgan Chase & Company. Even with the depressed stock prices of recent months, in theory a prime time for leveraged buyout funds, firms like Kohlberg Kravis have done little -- cramped in part because the weakening economy has made it hard for them to raise debt to finance their deals. And where once the firm got favored treatment from banks -- better terms and few conditions -- it no longer does.
Making matters worse for Kohlberg Kravis, it now has to compete with more than 100 buyout firms that manage funds with $1 billion or more in assets, according to Thomson Venture Economics, as well as many smaller ones. And other leveraged buyout firms claim far higher returns, perhaps as much as double K.K.R.'s. Thomas H. Lee Partners, for example, had annualized returns of 44 percent through the end of last year on a fund started in 1996. 
Kohlberg Kravis's returns have been dragged down by several investments that went sour, most notably its half-interest in the 1998 buyout of Regal Cinemas, a movie theater chain, for $1.6 billion, and the shares that the firm has retained in long-ago buyouts that were taken public during the 1990's, but whose prices have sunk 50 percent or more from their peaks. In a cruel turn of fate, the disappointing performance of the RJR buyout, the deal that cemented the firm's reputation as the one that could tackle deals of any size, continues to hurt its track record.
"You have to credit them for being pioneers, but it's a much more competitive business now," said Richard I. Beattie, the chairman of the New York law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett and a close adviser to K.K.R. 
Still, he added, "they recognize the need to evolve."
That has turned out to be harder than it sounds. On the plus side, the firm retains its strong brand name, a golden Rolodex and a loyal band of pension fund investors. It guards its image assiduously: partners rarely speak to reporters -- on the record, at least. (For this article, they also declined to be photographed.) 
But the world around the firm has changed drastically.
From its beginnings in 1976 with just three partners (the third co-founder -- the first K in K.K.R. -- was Jerome S. Kohlberg Jr., who retired, acrimoniously, in 1987), the firm expanded long ago to include 42 other investment professionals. Turnover has been remarkably light: only four partners have left over the life of the firm.
Certainly, its offices on West 57th Street, near Fifth Avenue, retain an aura of permanence and power. From the reception area, there is a breathtaking view of Central Park. Lining the hallway are bookcases laden with leather volumes containing the financial and legal details of the firm's 90 deals. Throughout, an impressive art collection, mostly British and American paintings from the 18th and 19th centuries, hangs on the walls.
The firm's offices in California, where Mr. Roberts has chosen to live, are in the heart of Silicon Valley, on Sand Hill Road in Palo Alto -- but they are furnished in identically formal fashion. Recently, the only nod to its location evident was dim lighting, a concession to the California energy shortage.
But listen carefully to Mr. Kravis, Mr. Roberts and other partners at the firm, and even they acknowledge that the buyout business has become tougher -- leaving them in what amounts to a holding pattern.
In an earlier era, the firm boasted of its investing prowess. In an interview in 1989, one partner vowed that its returns would never fall to the 20 percent range. "I don't believe it's going to happen," the partner said, labeling the figure "unacceptable."
Mr. Roberts said that since 1996, when the firm was raising its eighth buyout fund, he and Mr. Kravis have been telling investors that such expectations are no longer realistic because market conditions have changed. "You cannot produce 30 percent-plus returns with large amounts of capital over the long term," said Perry Golkin, a partner. "We intend to give our investors 20 percent returns in good times and bad."
KOHLBERG KRAVIS has also learned to be flexible in its investments. During the battle for RJR Nabisco, Mr. Kravis seemed desperate to buy RJR to protect K.K.R.'s "franchise," as the only buyout firm capable of large deals, according to "Barbarians at the Gate" and other accounts.
Mr. Kravis and his partners deny ever having used that term. Still, they acknowledge that the days of such large deals are over, partly because they are now harder to finance. "The capital just isn't there," Mr. Kravis said.
These days, the firm has been tackling smaller deals, and it no longer insists on buying 100 percent of a company, although it still tries to retain influence on management by seeking board seats. Among the deals the firm has completed over the last couple of years are the purchase of a 20 percent stake in DPL, an Ohio utility, for $550 million, and investments in six telecommunications companies, averaging just $100 million to $200 million each.
But Kohlberg Kravis's image as the firm that chases the largest deals is so ingrained in financial circles that, when it started raising its Millennium fund a year ago, rumors quickly circulated that the firm was seeking $10 billion, a sum that would have created the largest buyout fund in the business, by far outpacing Thomas H. Lee, which had just raised $6.1 billion, a record.
Mr. Kravis said it was all a fantasy. "We don't have a clue who started that rumor," he said. "We never put that number out there."
In fact, Kohlberg Kravis partners say, the $5.1 billion that investors have pledged to the fund so far will do just fine. The firm now has close to $9 billion in capital, including the remnants of its last fund and $2.4 billion raised in 1999 for a K.K.R. fund set up to invest in Europe. "We have enough capital to do what we want," Mr. Roberts said.
The firm's pitch still resonates with enough investors. The new fund includes commitments from the state pension funds of Oregon, which pledged $1 billion, and Washington, which agreed to invest $1.5 billion. The huge California Public Employees' Retirement System, as well as pension funds for state employees in Michigan, Wisconsin and New York, have also signed up. Several banks with long-term Kohlberg Kravis relationships, like Citigroup, J. P. Morgan Chase, and Bank of America, have signed on, too.
"Nobody's ever going to bat a thousand, but their returns over all have been solid," said Gary Moore, chairman of the $55 billion Washington State Investment Board.
One of Mr. Moore's colleagues was more pragmatic. "There aren't many places where you can comfortably invest $1.5 billion," said James Parker, executive director of Washington's investment board. 
Now the onus is on K.K.R. as it tries to emerge from a sleepy period for buyout firms, when the booming stock market made it expensive to do deals. "Our competition isn't so much other buyout firms as it is stock market valuations," Mr. Kravis said. "Over all, price-earnings multiples are still high."
For the first half of this year, the number of buyouts is down 31 percent, compared with the same period last year, according to S.& P./Portfolio Management Data.
AND these days, all leveraged buyout firms, including Kohlberg Kravis, must invest more cash up front than they once did. In the 1980's, the golden era of buyouts, these investors would acquire businesses by paying 10 percent or less in cash and financing the rest with debt. Now, getting financing from lenders requires firms to put in nearly 40 percent of the price in cash, according to Portfolio Management Data.
How much cash a buyout firm invests makes a big difference in the potential profits. Kohlberg Kravis and other buyout firms made so much money in the 1980's partly because they bought businesses cheaply and paid little up front for them. When the deals succeeded, they made many times their original investment.
When Kohlberg Kravis bought Safeway Stores in 1986, it paid $4.8 billion, but just 3 percent of that in cash. K.K.R. eventually sold Safeway for a $7 billion profit, a 43 percent annualized return. 
Contrast Safeway with Shoppers Drug Mart, a Canadian retailer that Kohlberg Kravis bought a year ago. It paid $1.8 billion, more than one-third of it in cash.
Because of that difference, Kohlberg Kravis will have fewer problems if the acquired company runs into trouble: the company will have less debt to repay. But without the magic of leverage -- using other people's money -- K.K.R.'s returns are also likely to be less. "There is a lot less financial risk for us in Shoppers than there was in Safeway," said James H. Greene Jr., a K.K.R. partner. "As a result, you have to work harder at growing the business and increasing its value."
In recent years, Kohlberg Kravis has been distracted from searching for deals because it has had to rescue several underperforming investments, though it is hardly alone in that task. With the economy in a slump, the highly leveraged companies owned by buyout funds are among the most vulnerable businesses.
Kohlberg Kravis's biggest recent embarrassment is its investment in Regal Cinemas, acquired together with the rival buyout firm Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst. Regal was one of several theater chains acquired by buyout firms during the late 1990's. All of them proceeded to open new theaters at a time when movie attendance was shrinking, Mr. Roberts said.
"We lost all our money, but having said that, we dealt with the situation as best we could," he said. Regal's lenders -- but not the bondholders -- will be repaid in full under the proposed restructuring plan. Holders of the bank debt will wind up in control of Regal.
Kohlberg Kravis did avoid big bets on telecommunications stocks, an area in which some of its competitors lost billions in recent months. All told, K.K.R. invested just $700 million in six telecom start-ups. Of these, the firm wrote down $200 million invested in two companies and sold its interest in a third for a slight profit. But it is sticking with three others and putting in an additional $150 million each into two of them: Birch Telecom and NewSouth Communications, both providers of phone service and Internet access to businesses.
"We weren't immune to the telecom meltdown, but we think that for the most part, the companies we invested in will succeed in the long term," said Alexander Navab Jr., a partner. 
Kohlberg Kravis's bigger problem is in its portfolio of stakes in a dozen public companies, ranging from long-term holdings like Owens-Illinois, the glass and plastic container maker it acquired in 1987, to Alliance Imaging and the MedCath Corporation, two health care companies that it took public last month. While most of these companies are not in danger of failing, several of their stock prices have fallen sharply.
Kohlberg Kravis views its reluctance to sell quickly as a point of pride, proving that it is a supportive partner to the management of its investments. 
"We really work side by side with the management of our companies," Mr. Kravis said. "We don't just break up the business and pick the low-hanging fruit, but rather invest in companies for their long-term growth." K.K.R. also insists that management of its companies take equity stakes.
Kohlberg Kravis did not completely sell its stake in Safeway, for example, for 13 years. And, typically, when companies it owns complete initial public offerings of stock, it does not sell its shares as part of the offering. Of the three K.K.R. companies that went public in the last two months -- Medcath, Alliance Imaging and the Willis Group, a London-based insurance broker -- K.K.R. sold none of its shares.
The practice that looks virtuous to Mr. Kravis looks different to some competitors and advisers in the buyout industry. "You aren't paying them fees to own a basket of public stocks," said one pension fund adviser whose clients include Kohlberg Kravis investors.
Mr. Roberts countered by bringing up the firm's success with Safeway, noting that soon after that company went public in 1990, some K.K.R. investors tried to pressure the firm to sell out its shares. But K.K.R. held on, to its eventual benefit. "We bought equity at the equivalent of 50 cents a share, and some of our limited partners wanted us to sell at the equivalent of $2.75, but we insisted there was a lot of potential," Mr. Roberts said. The firm ended up selling its holdings at prices as high as $51 a share.
That philosophy does not always work, of course; in fact, it did not work for some high-profile deals. Last month, the firm sold its remaining stake in Gillette. The shares were acquired in 1996, when Gillette merged with Duracell, a 1988 Kohlberg Kravis buyout. K.K.R.'s investors made 11 times their original investment. But they could have earned far more: the company's stock has fallen 50 percent from its high in 1999.
Other disappointments include Owens-Illinois, whose stock peaked at $48.625 in July 1998 but now trades at just $5.49. Kohlberg Kravis has not sold a share. 
A spokeswoman for Kolberg Kravis said that the firm did not sell its shares in 1998 because Owens was in the midst of acquiring a competitor, and K.K.R. did not want to depress Owens's shares by dumping its holdings. 
The stock of another longtime holding, Primedia, which dates to 1989, has slumped from a high of $33.50 in March 2000 to just $5.23.
Perhaps Kohlberg Kravis's biggest albatross is a private holding: its stake in Borden, the consumer products company acquired in 1995 in a swap for its RJR shares. At the time, RJR was in the middle of a price war with Philip Morris. Since then, RJR's shares have risen several fold, after the investor Carl C. Icahn goaded that company into selling its food business. Profits at Borden, meanwhile, have declined, because a specialty chemical manufacturing division owned by the company is in a cyclical slump.
"With hindsight, we would have been better off if we'd kept the RJR stake," said Scott M. Stuart, the Kohlberg Kravis partner in charge of the investment.
IN the past, the firm has taken profits on its investments by selling its companies to third parties. In 1999 alone, it sold three companies for huge profits. But with merger activity in a slump, that is hard to do, bankers said.
Some followers of the buyout world say the firm may soon become active again. "K.K.R. is more of a value investor than a growth investor," a pension adviser said, and should flourish if the stock market reaches more reasonable levels.
The firm has indeed done well in the past by bargain-hunting in out-of-favor industries. It teamed up with the predecessor to FleetBoston Financial in 1991 to acquire the Bank of New England, which had been seized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and it acquired American Reinsurance in 1992 when the reinsurance market was ailing. Kohlberg Kravis profited -- with annualized returns of 22 percent on the bank and 50 percent on the reinsurer, when those industries revived in the mid-90's.
Early last year, the firm acquired a 20 percent stake in DPL, the parent of the Dayton Power and Light Company in Ohio.
Kohlberg Kravis is also hunting for bargains in telecommunications and technology. In February 2000, it formed an alliance with Accel Partners, a Palo Alto venture capital firm, thus combining K.K.R.'s contacts among large corporations and Accel's Internet knowledge. More recently, the two firms formed a second joint venture, which will try to acquire the assets of telecommunications companies. The ventures have attracted some big names, like Paul Hazen, former chief executive of Wells Fargo, and Arun Sarin, a former president of AirTouch Communications, the cellular phone company, who works on telecom deals.
"Henry and George have fabulous Rolodexes, but they also have unparalleled common sense," said Jim Breyer, managing partner of Accel.
And Kohlberg Kravis has tried to diversify. In the mid-1990's, it became one of the first American buyout firms to pursue European deals. In 1999, it even opened an office in London. But other firms soon followed suit, and it recently lost out to other investors in the bidding for Eircom, the Irish phone company, and for the Yell Group, the yellow-pages division of British Telecommunications. In both cases, K.K.R. partners said, the bidding went too high for the firm's taste.
Both founders say they have not lost their taste for deals. "There's not a day I don't wake up excited about coming to work," Mr. Kravis said. Neither Mr. Kravis nor Mr. Roberts has plans to retire. 
THE two say they are taking steps to ensure that Kohlberg Kravis goes on after they leave.
"We are trying to get the best thinking of everyone in the firm and identify the future leaders of K.K.R.," Mr. Roberts said. Last year, in an effort to democratize the running of the firm, they formed two committees, of five partners each, to keep track of new deals and assess the status of old ones.
Still, while they delegate more day-to-day dealmaking and monitoring, one or the other of them serves on the committees tracking every K.K.R. deal. And when it comes to the crucial task of raising money, Mr. Kravis or Mr. Roberts meets personally with each pension fund manager. Mr. Moore of Washington State said that before investing his $1.5 billion, he received assurances that Mr. Kravis and Mr. Roberts would be around for the life of the fund, possibly as much as 18 years. 
It remains to be seen whether any of Kohlberg Kravis's younger partners have the clout and the charm of Mr. Kravis and Mr. Roberts in wooing pension funds and corporate executives, said competitors and investment bankers. 
"The question is: Is this the sort of business that revolves around one great investor, like Henry or George, to keep it going, or can you train another generation?" asked Steven Rattner, a former investment banker who has started his own investment firm, the Quadrangle Group. 
Perhaps a bigger question is whether the buyout business will return to its onetime glory. 
"We had some small role in making corporate America more efficient," Mr. Roberts said. "That means the markets are much more transparent, and more people understand value."
Still, he said, Kohlberg Kravis will go on. "It's still a lot of fun," he said. "The harder it gets, the greater the challenge."

Re "World's Economy Slows to a Walk in Rare Lock Step" (front page, Aug. 20): Yes, we now have a faltering world economy and a busted global "bubble." What will be the next enterprise to drive development? 
 First, we must solve the triple "E" problem: providing energy for the economy within environmental constraints. 
 Clean energy, energy efficiency and "smart growth" can become the engine of growth for this century. Indeed, we have no other choice, as burning additional fossil fuels is no longer a viable option.
Incentives for fuel efficiency and renewable energy sources can help stabilize the climate, ameliorate the energy crisis and create new jobs, industries and trade.

To the Editor:
Re "Federal Reserve Cuts Its Key Rate by Quarter-Point" (front page, Aug. 22):
 The Fed continues to cut the prime rate, making it easier for companies to borrow from banks to enable them to grow, thereby creating a vast increase in American employment, thus spurring the economy. 
 So the theory goes! 
What in fact has been happening is that even with all this easy money, companies have not been expanding as anticipated. Instead, they are using this windfall to merge with other companies, resulting in the loss of hundreds of thousands of American jobs, further weakening the economy.
And all the while, the little guy watches the interest on his modest bank savings dwindle to nothing.

Measurability Hurts Ads on Internet
Throughout the history of advertising, it has been difficult to draw a direct line from a TV spot or a magazine ad to a sale. The Internet was going to change that with its ability to link the information consumers received with their purchases. But measurability has turned out to be a conspicuous weakness of online advertising, not its greatest strength. It is hard to prove that no one is paying attention to a TV commercial. But it is easy to prove that practically nobody is clicking on a given banner ad, leading to a perception that most online ads do not work. Marketers are focusing on quantitative measures, like the cost per click, as opposed to qualitative ones, like brand perception. New Economy. C4.

Panel for Black Journalists' Group
The National Association of Black Journalists, whose financial woes had led an alliance of members to seek curbs on the organization's leadership, approved a plan to create an advisory committee dominated by professionals with expertise in finance and management.

The Postal Service swaps the bald eagle for another national icon with warmer associations.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
EAGLE images and the "Fly like an eagle" theme, which have appeared for almost three years in advertising for the United States Postal Service, are going the way of the dodo and passenger pigeon as another familiar symbol of the mail takes center stage in a new campaign.
 The campaign, which begins today, must work harder than its predecessor because, in a sign of the times as noticeable as the new 34-cent stamps for first-class postage, the Postal Service plans to significantly cut its advertising budget for the 2002 fiscal year, which begins on Saturday. 
 As Postal Service executives grapple with declining revenue and rising costs, they intend to reduce the ad budget about 28 percent to just above $100 million, compared with an estimated $140 million in the previous fiscal year.
The eagle theme and imagery are being replaced in the campaign with the familiar blue mailbox -- or collection box, in Postal Service parlance -- and the theme "The U.S. Postal Service is everywhere so you can be anywhere." In the initial newspaper advertisements and billboards, the mailbox turns up in unexpected places, ranging from a soybean field to an icy Alaskan landscape to a fish-stocked stream. 
The idea is to present the box as an icon or totem, not unlike the way the bottle is celebrated in a new campaign for Heinz ketchup or the way the lonely repairman has come to stand for Maytag appliances. And that is no coincidence, as the campaign idea comes from the same agency responsible for those ads, Leo Burnett USA in Chicago.
"We looked at several ways to create a 'master brand' type campaign based on an icon," said Larry Speakes, advertising manager at the Postal Service in Washington, "and the collection box, what you see on the corner all across the country, was deemed the most recognizable.
"And it also brings back a lot of good memories for people," he added, "who told us it connotes safety, ubiquity, reach, reliability."
The campaign is part of Postal Service efforts to reverse its recent flagging fortunes as the economic slowdown reduces mail volume, particularly among businesses, and e-mail reduces the volume of traditional mail, particularly among consumers. Then, too, there are increasing costs like higher gasoline prices.
The result of that double whammy: a possible loss this year of more than $2 billion, despite the estimated $975 million to be raised by the rate increases in first-class and other categories that took effect last month.
Cutting the ad budget to save money is much easier to accomplish than other suggested steps like the elimination of Saturday delivery. Complaints from members of Congress and customers forced Postal Service executives to backpedal on that proposal faster than a mail carrier confronted by a rabid dog.
"The belt-tightening in the advertising budget is why we're making absolutely certain this new campaign is highly targeted, hitting audiences like large, small and medium businesses," said Mr. Speakes, the former news secretary for President Ronald Reagan.
It is also a reason to focus on "a specific icon," he added, "that will be highly visible in all our work."
Icons are a specialty of Burnett USA, which is known for so-called ad critters like the Pillsbury doughboy, the Keebler elves and the Kellogg's Frosted Flakes mascot, Tony the Tiger. But don't expect the Postal Service ads to feature animated mailboxes that "talk or walk or become critters," said Lisa Bennett, executive vice president and executive creative director at Burnett USA, part of the Leo Burnett Worldwide division of the Bcom3 Group. 
"Our strength is finding contemporary ways to create icons that are not traditional characters," she said. "The mailbox is a powerful icon and putting it in a new context can make people feel different about the U.S. Postal Service."
Ms. Bennett is also global creative director on the bottle-centric Heinz campaign that started in 1999, known as the "ketchup charisma" campaign because the bottle is infused with a personality intended to appeal to teenagers and young adults through measures that include funny front labels bearing phrases like "Mustard Looks Up To It" and "Fourteen Billion French Fries Can't Be Wrong."
" 'Fly like an eagle' didn't necessarily capture all there is to the Postal Service," Ms. Bennett said, listing elements like a new partnership with FedEx for an expanded shipping network, its global reach and services for business customers.
Besides, she added, the consumers the agency spoke with while developing the idea "felt warm toward the mailbox versus an eagle, which they couldn't associate with."
In addition to newspaper ads and billboards, the campaign celebrating the collection box will also include television commercials, Internet ads, displays in post offices and direct mail sent to customers.
The campaign will be aimed more than its eagle-filled predecessor at business owners and executives, said Jeff Poli, program manager for advertising media services at the Postal Service, by using media like cable news networks, Sunday news shows on broadcast networks and business publications. Media duties for the Postal Service are handled by MediaCom in New York, part of the MediaCom Worldwide division of the Grey Global Group. 
Burnett USA was added to the Postal Service's agency roster in September 2000, assuming tasks that had been handled by Foote, Cone & Belding in New York after a mandated review that ended with the reshuffling of several assignments.
The mailbox idea will also be adapted for use in campaigns created by other Postal Service roster agencies. They are: Foote, Cone, part of the FCB Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, responsible for direct marketing; A Partnership in New York, for ads aimed at Asian-Americans; the Bravo Group in New York, part of the Young & Rubicam division of the WPP Group, for ads aimed at Hispanic consumers; the Chisholm-Mingo Group in New York, for ads aimed at black consumers; and Frankel in Chicago, part of the Publicis Groupe, the retail marketing agency.

HEADLINE: The Plutonium Nightmare 

 BODY:
While the Bush administration is worrying about potential missile threats from North Korea, Iran or Iraq, it must not neglect the more immediate danger posed by tons of inadequately secured Russian plutonium. Any country trying to develop nuclear weapons would love to steal a few pounds of the bomb-making material. Yet the White House is considering indefinitely delaying a plan worked out with Moscow last year to begin disposing of the Russian plutonium. 
 The agreement provides for each country to gradually eliminate 34 metric tons of plutonium from its own stockpiles, mostly by burning it in power reactors. Citing rising costs, some administration officials prefer to wait until a newer, cheaper disposal technology can be developed. That would be a dangerously false economy. 
 Russia is the world's most inviting source of plutonium. It has more than 160 metric tons in all, roughly half contained in weapons and the other half stored under less than ideally secure conditions. The stored portion alone is enough to build about 8,000 nuclear bombs. Getting that plutonium out of the reach of would-be bomb makers should be one of Washington's top defense priorities. 
The 34 metric tons of Russian plutonium and most of America's corresponding share -- the United States has about 100 metric tons altogether -- were to be mixed with uranium and burned as fuel in power reactors. The remaining American plutonium was to be mixed with other materials and turned into logs of radioactive glass and buried, a cheaper and safer method but one that Russia could not be persuaded to adopt. Earlier this year the Bush administration suspended the glass logs approach indefinitely, arguing that it would be cheaper to use just one disposal method. Now it may give up on the burning method as well. 
Cost estimates for both methods have risen steeply since the plan was first proposed. Nevertheless, it is still a bargain compared with the risk of plutonium theft by a foreign government or terrorist group. Even using the more expensive burning method, the total cost of disposing of some 80 metric tons of plutonium would be about $6.6 billion on the American side and somewhat over $2 billion on the Russian side, spread out over nearly two decades. Most of the Russian cost would have to be assumed by the United States, although Europe has also promised to help. 
In return, enough plutonium to build thousands of nuclear warheads would be eliminated. An administration prepared to spend more than $8 billion in a single year testing an unproven missile defense system should not object to spending much smaller yearly amounts to eliminate a tempting source of plutonium. There is no harm in exploring other potential disposal technologies. But such experimentation should not delay carrying out the present agreement with Moscow. If anything, that arrangement, which calls for each side to dispose of just two metric tons per year, should be accelerated. Meanwhile, Washington should increase its investment, currently $140 million a year, in improving security at Russian plutonium storage facilities.
Missile defense, even if technologically perfected, cannot by itself provide adequate protection against nuclear dangers. Ballistic missiles are only one of several ways a potential foe could subject the United States to nuclear threat or attack. The faster excess bomb plutonium can be eliminated, the safer Americans will be.

HEADLINE: Quietly, Pataki Continues To Push Gambling Measures 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 24 

 BODY:
Suddenly, gambling has become the pivotal issue in state budget talks, and once again, it is Gov. George E. Pataki who is pushing it.
 With Mr. Pataki insisting that new sources of revenue are needed to meet the spending demands of the Legislature, he and legislative leaders this week took up three gambling options: join the multistate Powerball lottery, allow the Seneca Indians to build casinos in western New York; and permit horse racing tracks to install video lottery terminals, which are like slot machines without the levers. 
 If even two of the three proposals win approval -- and it appears likely that the casino and lottery measures will -- it would represent the biggest expansion of legalized gambling in New York State since the creation of the state lottery in the 1960's. And behind it would be Mr. Pataki, perhaps the most pro-gambling governor the state has ever had, who has championed gambling to legislatures while publicly saying little about it. 
In 1995, his first year in office, Mr. Pataki persuaded the Legislature to adopt the Quick Draw video lottery game, and since then he has tried unsuccessfully to expand the number of terminals. Mr. Pataki was the primary force behind a proposed amendment to the State Constitution, ultimately defeated in 1997, to permit non-Indian casinos in resort areas like the Catskills. He has promoted the development of Indian casinos by the Senecas and the Mohawks. And it was he who proposed joining Powerball.
"There isn't any kind of gambling he doesn't seem to think is right," said State Senator Frank Padavan, a Republican of Queens who is the Legislature's most vocal opponent of gambling. "No other governor has done it to the same degree. And he's the one pushing it now."
New York is just one of the states affected by a national proliferation in gambling over the last decade. The most marked increase has been in Indian casinos -- 72 tribes now have them -- but there are also riverboat casinos, more state lotteries and more states in multistate lotteries. Forty-seven states now have some form of legalized gambling.
And that, the governor's office says, is why New York should follow the trend. "All you have to do is look at the border with Connecticut because there's a mad rush of New Yorkers to play Powerball," said Michael McKeon, the governor's spokesman. "We know that New Yorkers are already spending $300 million a year in Canada at the casinos. New Yorkers are going in droves to Atlantic City. We think it makes sense to keep some of that money in New York."
But with the exception of advocating Indian casinos as economic development for depressed areas of the state, Mr. Pataki, a Republican, has not been eager to be seen as promoting gambling.
When the proposed constitutional amendment went to the Legislature, he did not lobby aggressively for it or publicly say much about it. When the Legislature allowed Quick Draw to lapse two years ago, Mr. Pataki insisted publicly that he did not care, but lawmakers said he lobbied furiously in private to restore it. While his budgets have proposed expanding Quick Draw and joining Powerball, the governor has barely mentioned them in public forums.
In the current talks, aides to Mr. Pataki say it is not clear who initially raised the idea of video lottery terminals at racetracks, the most controversial of the gambling options under discussion. But legislators and aides insist that the governor has been the only one pushing it.
As the governor prepares for an expected run for a third term next year, a more full-throated support for gambling could erode his support on the political right, which includes the only organized opposition to gambling in New York: the Conservative Party, the Catholic Church and a Protestant alliance upstate called New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms.
"I think it could hurt him with some of the conservative base, the Christian right," said Michael Long, chairman of the Conservative Party, which endorsed Mr. Pataki in the past and is likely to do so again. "It doesn't help with the overwhelming majority of leaders in the Conservative Party."
Studies show that it is mostly the poor who patronize lotteries and casinos, that those players are disproportionately black and Hispanic, and that there are millions of people with gambling problems across the country.
The push to expand gambling, Senator Padavan said, is "one more effort to solve budgetary problems on the backs of people who can least afford it."
But some minority lawmakers agree with Mr. Pataki that gambling is inevitable and that New York should reap some of the profits. Others privately admit to having deep reservations about the social consequences, but say that gambling is so popular in their communities that it would be pointless to oppose it.
Over the years, the Democratic Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, and the Republican majority leader of the Senate, Joseph L. Bruno, have taken a more cautious approach to expanding gambling than Mr. Pataki has, often expressing concerns about it.
Lawmakers in both parties expect New York to join Powerball as part of a budget settlement, a move projected to generate $145 million a year in state revenue. Approval of Indian casinos is also widely expected, eventually, but getting there could be difficult. Those casinos can only be established under compacts between the state and the tribe, and a state court has ruled that such compacts are subject to approval by the Legislature.
The plan to put video lottery terminals at racetracks would meet with the most opposition in the Legislature, but lawmakers have said they cannot rule out that it would win passage as well.

U.S. May Lift Sanctions To Bolster Ties With India
The Bush administration is moving on a broad front to strengthen relations with India, a nation it views as a neglected and potentially important strategic ally and trading partner in Asia. The most dramatic step the administration will take, officials say, is the almost certain lifting of American economic and military sanctions imposed on India in 1998 for its test of a nuclear weapon. A1

Wobbly Flaw for Missile Shield
The missile defense planned by the Bush administration may be least able to destroy warheads from countries that are thought to pose the biggest threat, federal and private experts say. The trouble is that so-called rogue nations, like North Korea, Iran and Iraq, would fire wobbling, rudimentary warheads during an attack, and those turn out to be among the hardest to hit. A1

Violent Weekend in Mideast
An Israeli man from the coastal town of Netanya was shot to death on a road north of Tulkarm in the West Bank. The Israeli Army demolished police headquarters in four Palestinian towns in retaliation for six killings on Saturday. A Palestinian security officer was reportedly killed. A3

President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat could not stop 11 months of Israeli-Palestinian violence on his own and urged the United States to play a greater role in finding a solution. His voice joined a chorus of Palestinian and Arab leaders saying America should do more. A3

Visits for 8 Jailed by Taliban
Eight jailed aid workers met with officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross, the first visitors allowed to see the prisoners since their arrest more than three weeks ago on charges of preaching Christianity. A Red Cross spokesman said the prisoners "were happy to see anyone from the outside." A4

Colombia Peace Efforts Stalled
Efforts to secure a peace settlement, a campaign promise of President Andres Pastrana, between the government and the rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, have lurched to a near standstill. A6

Aaliyah
A multimillion-selling, precociously sultry rhythm-and-blues singer and actress who was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Detroit, she played the title role in the film of the Anne Rice novel "Queen of the Damned," due for release next year. Her third album, "Aaliyah," was released in July and reached No. 2 on the Billboard 200 album chart. She was 22. B6

Report Reveals Disparities In Minorities' Mental Care
Ethnic and racial minorities face troubling disparities in mental health care, the surgeon general, Dr. David Satcher, said in a broad report that offers a rare look at the mental health needs of minority groups and the obstacles to treatment. A1

List of Stem Cell Sources
The National Institutes of Health will announce the names today of 10 organizations that possess human embryonic stem cells eligible for use by federally financed researchers. A document made available to The New York Times indicates that there are 10 universities and companies that derived cell cultures from 64 embryos before the cutoff date and that have told the agency they will make the cells available to researchers. The list includes four in the United States and six in Sweden, Australia, India and Israel. A1

After President Bush announced his decision on stem cell research, responses came quickly from Roman Catholic bishops, who criticized it, and some prominent religious conservatives, whose views were mixed. But many major religious groups have yet to be heard from. A12

Cash Crop Takes Flight
Federal subsidies for leaving land as a habitat for ducks are helping farmers survive on the Dakota plains, the annual payments keeping small farms afloat and allowing young farmers to establish themselves. The subsidies also have ensured the revival of a duck population that was in serious decline. A1

Softer Stance on Soft Money
Black politicians who were once supporters of an overhaul of campaign finance rules -- most important, of a moratorium on soft money -- have changed their minds. A bill to ban soft money is now stalled in the House. But if it comes up for a vote later this fall, no group of lawmakers is likely to be more influential in the bargaining than the 38 members of the black caucus. A1

Funeral for Victims of Killings
Thousands of mourners from a religious community in shock held a funeral service in Sacramento, Calif., for six members of a Ukrainian family. The hunt continued for Nikolay Soltys, 27, the only suspect in the killings last Monday of his pregnant wife, his 3-year-old son, two young cousins, an aunt and an uncle. A10

EDUCATION

No Shortage of Confusion
Confusion about both the hiring process and the shortage of teachers in New York City, combined with a bureaucracy that is often unwelcoming, make for a bumpier ride than many promising applicants are willing to endure. "There are significant numbers of people who think if they come, we are going to take them automatically because we are so desperate," said the head of teacher recruitment for the school board. "That is one of the notions we are trying desperately to change." A1

HEADLINE: Hope Comes In Peaks And Valleys; 
Artist's View of New Haven Preceded Changing Times

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
In the late 1970's, right around the time that the Armstrong tire factory was closing down, the last movie flickered onto the screen at the Bowl Drive-In a few miles away on Route 1. In a single, cold gust of change, Gene Wells lost both his tire-making job and his family's hallowed tradition of drive-in movie night -- no more work on the tire line, no more evenings with the kids piled into the car in their pajamas. It was the end of an era. 
 More than 20 years later the abandoned screen of the Bowl still stands -- listing a bit as the weeds grow around it, but enduring nonetheless. And Mr. Wells endures as well. After Armstrong, he landed a job at Yale University, as a custodial services manager. His is the matter-of-fact voice of a man who has seen the hard things that life can sometimes dish up. 
 "I liked it," he said of his job as a tire builder. "But then they closed up, and when they close up you got to go." 
The Northeast is celebrated for the cycle of its seasons: flaming fall foliage, deep-woods winterscapes, dense green springs and languorous summers when the humidity thickens every breath. But times changed here in a way that was linked more to the human presence than the hand of nature. In a place where an artist once stood, a city flowered, and then fell.
The precise spot where Frederic Edwin Church set up his easel in 1849 is not known -- the closest approximation today is atop a former landfill that did not exist back then. The Boston Post Road, which later became Route 1, was the main thoroughfare, and the field where the Bowl would one day rise was a few hundred yards away. Church, who was still on his way to fame as a Hudson River School artist when he stopped by New Haven, showed farmers bringing in their hay -- a picture of hardy economic independence and optimism against the backdrop of ancient stone. It was summer and the nation was young.
Within 25 years of Church's visit, New Haven had tripled in size, and dozens of factories had sprung up, pushing out the farms. The Elm City, as it was called then, specialized in fine mechanical work -- clocks, locks, carriages and guns. But then the factories themselves mostly departed. Things like slaughterhouses, breweries, rubber plants, scrap yards and landfills took over the Route 1 corridor, called Allingtown.
West Rock remained unchanged in the distance, and the West River -- the foreground of Church's painting -- continued its meandering way to Long Island Sound. Allingtown became an economic and urban borderland.
Mr. Wells, 63, the son of a Caribbean sugar worker who came to New Haven in the early 1920's, grew up in a time that had a similar borderland quality. The great black migration from the South had only begun. Manufacturing jobs were ample, but times were still hard. His father, Al Wells, who was born on the island of Nevis, got work as a cook.
Gene Wells said his grandchildren just laugh when he tells them about how he and his friends would get a new $2 pair of sneakers and wear them until the word "Keds" had become simply "ed," and how they would then put cardboard inside to cover the holes and make the shoes last even longer. 
Bicycles were an important part of growing up then, Mr. Wells said, and he would sometimes ride with his friends to the summit of West Rock, just to stand for a few minutes and look out over their city. 
"Sometimes in the summertime at night everybody would be riding their bikes," he said. "Your bike was a big thing: polished chrome fenders, chrome wheels, and -- what do you call them? -- streamers on the handlebars."
No one he knew then could actually afford a new bike, he said, and so part of the game was building one from parts you could trade or find. "You'd get the wheels from somebody, and hopefully you had a frame with a handlebar so you didn't have to worry about finding that," he said.
Mr. Wells's father worked for a time at Yale University, cooking in one of the residence halls. And it was at Yale after Gene started working there, too, in 1981, that he stumbled upon the Frederic Church painting, copies of which can be found, he said, in various places around campus. He recognized the view, he said, from his bike rides as a child -- somewhere around the Orange Avenue Bridge between New Haven and West Haven. 
He was also pursuing a new hobby then, photography. So one day he drove to the bridge, took his camera and snapped his own view of West Rock, more or less like the painting. Mr. Wells is modest about his hobby, though. He keeps his photos in a drawer and it was only just this summer that his wife, Dorothy, finally persuaded him to replace the 20-year-old camera that he had complained about for years.
"She kept saying, 'Get yourself a new camera, get yourself a new camera,' and I'd say, 'It's not the camera, it's the photographer,' " he said.
Getting to know his new Nikon, shooting pictures in his yard, is now the project for the fall days ahead, he said.

The Outlook Is Bleak
Just south of the landfill hilltop that offers Church's West Rock view there is an automobile salvage yard called Classic Used Auto Parts, which has been in business under various names and owners for about 50 years. It is a place of hard edges and ancient rust. A mountain of tires dominates one edge of the property. Cars in various states of cannibalization squat behind a metal fence. 
Classic is a hectic, old-fashioned business where prices are shouted from behind the counter for a set of hubcaps or a rebuilt transmission, and dickering after that is the accepted norm. One of the employees goes shirtless, the better perhaps to display his piercings and tattoos. Burglaries are a chronic problem, said Tony DeLucia, who took over the place several years ago. 
Mr. DeLucia, a former antiques dealer, sees a long winter ahead for New Haven. He said he held out some hope that a recent effort, led by Yale, to recast the city's image as Connecticut's arts and culture capital could bring more tourists, and there has been talk for years about an emerging biotechnology industry. But none of those things, he said, can offer much comfort to the low-income people who are his core customers. New Haven has lost about 25 percent of its population since 1950, when it peaked at 164,000, according to census figures.
"I don't see the long-term outlook in terms of opportunity for the less fortunate to be any greater with what's going on," he said. "Culture doesn't offer much and high tech doesn't either, unless you've got a degree. Let's face it, the only kind of jobs that low-skilled people are going to get are manufacturing jobs and things like that, and manufacturing is a dead issue."
Mr. DeLucia's father, also known as Tony (technically, the father is Antonio and the son is Anthony), has an even more bleak view.
The elder Tony, 66, a retired construction crane operator who grew up in the city, the youngest son of an Italian immigrant who sold fruits and vegetables from a pushcart, said he had long since given up all hope about New Haven coming back to anything the way he remembers it. Not that the city or its political leaders are to blame, he said -- all small cities are in the same pickle.
"There may be an answer out there," said Mr. DeLucia, who comes by the shop most days to help his son, or just to sit a while. "But I don't know of it. Almost every city this size seems to have great ideas to try and turn it around, but it never works. It never works."
Down on Route 1, car washes, auto-detailing shops and fast-food places fill the spaces between vacant lots. A statue commemorates the Battle of New Haven during the Revolutionary War, when residents burned the bridge over the West River to keep the British from crossing. (The soldiers simply went around, crossed the river near West Rock, and took the city anyway.)
Historians say the old Post Road, although still a major artery through the area, was a fading presence in Church's day, too. Steamships and railroads were making the rutted road a means of last or cheapest resort. The inns and taverns that had grown up to serve the commercial travelers of earlier days were doomed.

The Outlook Is Bright
The string that had been lying lax on the water suddenly went taut. That meant a crab had locked its claws onto the piece of chicken somewhere down in the river, and that in turn put into motion a little family minuet of coordination and patience.
Ismael Castro was on string duty. Gently, hand over hand, he pulled the string in -- too fast and the crab would let go, he said; too slow, and it would get dragged on the bottom and fall off.
Bernice Velez stood waiting, stooped over with her net extending a few inches above the river.
The moment of truth came when the crab got close enough to see -- close enough that the chicken chunk was about to scrape on the mud. That was when Ms. Velez played her part -- a quick swooping capture with the net.
This was how the Castros -- Ismael and his three children -- and Ms. Velez, his fiancee, were spending a week's mid-August vacation: crabbing on the West River a mile from their house in West Haven.
It was not fancy and it cost almost nothing, but everyone seemed to be having a ball. The muddy brown creek just north of the Orange Avenue Bridge -- the foreground of Church's painting -- was their playground.
Partly, Ms. Velez said, the fun came from mastering something new. They moved to the New Haven area only a year ago from Danielson in Connecticut's northeast corner. They had never gone crabbing until this summer. Everything, she said, still felt fresh.
When they fumbled and lost a crab, as they often did, they could laugh about it.
"We decided to start something new, to take a chance," said Ms. Velez, referring to their relocation to New Haven. "And it's the best move I've ever made."
Mr. Castro, 32, was born in Puerto Rico and was living in Brooklyn when he and Ms. Velez, 39, who grew up in Manhattan, met in an Internet chat room about 18 months ago. She was already living in Connecticut then, and he joined her in Danielson before they moved here.
Now they are planning a wedding next year at St. Peter's Lutheran Church in Manhattan, where Mr. Castro works as a facilities coordinator, setting up for the jazz performances and services that have made the church famous.
Part of what brought them to New Haven, they said, was its cultural and ethnic diversity. Northeastern Connecticut, though it was pretty and green, was not right for them. Ms. Velez's 17-year-old daughter, Chasitie Cruz, started floundering in school. There was a racial tension in the air, and at least once she had the letters "KKK" scrawled on her locker.
Ms. Velez, who works as a cashier in a local shop, said that Chasitie wants to go to Yale someday.
But Chasitie said that for now, she was just happy to be here. School has become a welcoming place again, she said, thanks in part to a great guidance counselor. She has a job she likes in the evenings at a family arcade.
If she should get into Yale to study social work or psychology, her two main interests at the moment, that would be great.
If not, she will look for another option, she said. Her life and hope are intertwined, and perhaps, in that link, there is hope for old New Haven, too. 
"I see a lot of opportunities," she said.

In Art's Footsteps
The paintings of the Hudson River School are portraits of the Northeast, captured at a time when 19th-century America was re-examining its ideas about nature. The landscapes helped spur tourism and environmentalism. 
This is the ninth of 10 summer articles in which The New York Times returns to the places illuminated by Hudson River School artists.
The final article, from Catskill, N.Y., will look at the power of an artistic vision. Thomas Cole, painting from underneath Kaaterskill Falls, created a reverent new vocabulary of how the natural world should be considered. But at the same time, he helped turn nature into a commercial product. He painted the wilderness, but perhaps his greatest impact was on the city where his art was sold: New York. His legacy lives on, but it's more complicated and ambivalent than he might have imagined.

HEADLINE: And Not a (Free) Drop to Drink 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Ted C. Fishman ("A Simple Glass of Water," Op-Ed, Aug. 23) laments the replacement of free tap water with costly bottled water throughout the United States. This is a global phenomenon. 
International financial institutions and multinational corporations are pushing privatization plans that transform water from a common resource available to all into a commodity for purchase. 
 The result: low-income communities around the world are forced to seek water from polluted and untreated sources, leading to needless deaths from waterborne diseases.
For these reasons, international human rights law recognizes the right to water as an essential component of the rights to life and health. Government and business should also recognize that the right to safe drinking water must neither be bought nor sold.

HEADLINE: Huge Default Unsettles Turkish Economic Reform Efforts 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Aug. 26 

 BODY:
A local company owes a huge debt to Motorola, and the dispute is threatening to disrupt Turkey's efforts to restore foreign confidence in its economy.
 Motorola, the American wireless technology giant, is getting help from the American government and former senior American officials to try to collect a $2 billion debt from the Turkish company, Telsim, the country's No. 2 cellular phone company. Telsim is owned by a Turkish family whose fortune has been battered by the nation's economic problems. 
 The loan helped Telsim buy Motorola products, but Motorola says the Turkish company has been in default since June. Telsim also missed a payment on a $719 million loan from Nokia, the Finnish technology company. 
Marc Grossman, under secretary of state for political affairs and a former ambassador to Turkey, and the American embassy in Ankara raised the issue with Turkish government officials, according to an American official. 
The official described the contacts as routine. The matter is sensitive, however, because Turkey is a NATO member and ally whose economy has been battered for seven months.
The International Monetary Fund and World Bank have pledged $17 billion in emergency loans to Turkey and the Bush administration has praised its efforts to adopt financial reforms and attract new capital from foreign investors and lenders. The steps are viewed as essential to the country's economic and political stability. 
But financial analysts cautioned Turkey's recovery effort could be damaged if the Turkish government appears unable to protect foreign investors like Motorola and Nokia in a private commercial disagreement.
Along with getting administration help, Motorola enlisted two former senior officials and a prominent investigative agency, people involved in the business dispute said.
One of the former officials was identified as Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser in the first Bush administration. Mr. Scowcroft, a consultant in Washington who has worked for Motorola in the past, is chairman of the American-Turkish Council, an influential business group. 
The other is Mark Parris, American ambassador to Turkey until last September when he joined a Washington law firm. Mr. Parris is in Turkey now to discuss the matter with business and government officials, the people involved said.
Kroll Associates, an investigative agency based in New York City, was hired to look into the assets of the Uzan family, which owns privately held Telsim and about 100 other businesses.
Attempts to reach Telsim officials and Uzan family members were unsuccessful. A spokesman for Motorola said the company was pursuing all of its options in attempting to collect the loan, but declined to discuss specifics. 
The Turkish government has not discussed the dispute officially. A senior official said the government was concerned about potential fallout among foreign investors and hopes that Telsim will begin making payments.
Telsim paid the government $500 million for the cellular phone license in 1998. Motorola and Nokia lent money to Telsim to buy telephone handsets and other equipment from them. The collateral was mainly Telsim shares.
Motorola's problems became public last month when The Financial Times reported that Telsim missed a $728 million payment in April. Motorola said it had demanded that the entire $2 billion be repaid and Telsim had refused.
The American company said Telsim also violated its contract by issuing new shares that diluted Motorola's collateral from 66 percent of Telsim to 22 percent. Nokia stopped supplying equipment to Telsim after it said the company failed to repay $240 million on a $719 million loan.
The Uzan family's wealth was estimated at $1.6 billion by Forbes magazine earlier this year, though many sectors in which it has interests have been hurt by the economic decline. In addition to Telsim, the family owns banks, media properties and companies in the cement, steel, energy and construction industries.
When private investigators began examining the family's assets this summer, the Uzans filed civil suit in Turkish court. The suit demanded the detention of executives from Motorola and Nokia, claiming that the investigators had caused security problems for the family. A person close to Motorola said that the tactics were legal and routine and that the suit had not been pursued.
The Uzan family has been in a dispute since 1994 with Turkey's Capital Markets Board, which regulates its financial markets. The board accused the Uzans of transferring assets from two publicly traded electricity generators they controlled to their other businesses.
The family has denied the charges, which have not been resolved.

HEADLINE: White House Notebook; 
Bush Ventures Off Ranch to Court Steelworkers

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WEST MIFFLIN, Pa., Aug. 26 

 BODY:
It takes a lot to lure President Bush off his beloved Texas ranch as his working vacation dwindles to a close, and with it the end of morning intelligence briefings on the front porch and hours of work on the project that has consumed his summer, using a chain saw to create a path to his favorite canyon, a cathedral in stone that is one of the most distinctive features of his ranch.
 But today, with less than a week remaining at Crawford, Mr. Bush flew here to the Irvin Works, the core of the old United States Steel Corporation, now part of USX, to picnic with steelworkers and tinker with his other summer project: taking back a base of voters who have traditionally gone Democratic. 
 So there was Mr. Bush, eating barbeque with union leaders who last fall had pictures of Al Gore on their walls in a state that Mr. Bush lost, talking about the crisis that is again engulfing the American steel industry. All around him were the steelworkers, pressing Mr. Bush to speed ahead with an investigation that could result in large, protective duties on steel from countries accused of "dumping" their products in the American market. 
That decision is largely out of Mr. Bush's hands: It must be made by the International Trade Commission, an independent agency. Still, Mr. Bush knew just what workers wanted to hear: that he would act later this year to block foreign imports of "dumped" steel, which the industry and the union blame for the loss of 20,000 jobs in 18 months. The workers noted that Mr. Bush, by beginning the action against Japan, Korea, Russia and other nations, had already pressed the issue further than President Bill Clinton did -- though during the boom years of the Clinton administration the mill that loomed behind Mr. Bush today was running at capacity.
"Today we're running at 40 percent of capacity and losing $41 million a year," said Ross W. McClellan, the president of the local chapter of the United Steelworkers of America, who sat next to Mr. Bush at the picnic. Mr. Bush, Mr. McClellan said, "made an impression that he is going to help us." That was just the impression Mr. Bush wanted to make, just as he wanted to avoid saying he would support legislation in Congress that would cut off many foreign steel imports and possibly violate international trade laws. (He also skipped his traditional paean to free trade -- those are fighting words in this part of Pennsylvania.) So Mr. Bush hailed the once mighty United States Steel Corporation, formed by J. Pierpont Morgan a century ago (the ostensible reason for today's celebration) and told the workers that even if the cold war was over, they still manned the economic and military ramparts.
"If you're worried about the security of the country and you become overreliant on foreign sources of steel, it can easily affect the capability of our military to be well-supplied," Mr. Bush said. The company said he was the first president to visit a steel mill in three decades.

So He's Not Babe Ruth
There was another reason for Mr. Bush's visit to Pennsylvania today: He is the first president inducted into the Little League's equivalent of the Hall of Fame. Then again, he appears to be the first president who ever played Little League baseball. The honor came as Mr. Bush attended the Little League World Championship in South Williamsport.
"I qualified by the fact that I was the first president ever to play Little League baseball," he told reporters last week, conceding that perhaps that did not put him on par with the "first guy to hit 60 home runs," a guy named Babe. Then again, the Babe never made the leap from the stadium to leader of the world's unchallenged superpower.
"What the heck?" Mr. Bush said. "What's the difference?"

Meanwhile, at the Ranch
The game was not even over when Mr. Bush and his wife headed back to the ranch. And anyone who dropped by on Saturday morning and saw him cutting up dead trees with a small chain saw, would immediately understand his rush to get home.
"I'm in my element here," Mr. Bush told some visiting reporters on a recent morning. And to hear his aides talk, the mix of meetings and trailblazing not only makes him happier, but also helps him focus on his work.
He met Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, military and national security leaders for six hours on Friday afternoon, without interruption, without schedulers, without members of Congress in the waiting room.
One of Mr. Bush's closest aides said, "We can get far more done here than in the White House," taking the White House message that the president is not on vacation, he is just not in Washington to a new level. C.I.A. briefings are on the porch, overlooking an artificial lake that Mr. Bush had dug so he could go bass fishing. More than a few conferences take place during hikes.
He is even eating differently, except for the kielbasa at the steelworkers' picnic. One consumer of the ranch cuisine reports that Mr. Bush and his wife, Laura, have used the summer to move to a low-fat diet: "There's less Mexican food on the table," the insider reports. The workday is shorter, "but much more conducive to real discussion" about budget strategy, Vladimir V. Putin's negotiating strategy and an upcoming trip to China.
Mr. Bush revels in the fact that the Secret Service lets him drive his own car on the ranch, which is strictly forbidden back in Washington at his other house. "I love to get in the pickup truck with my dogs as the sun is setting, go look for game," he reports. He shoots doves, he said, but he draws the line there. "I don't want to shoot the turkeys. I like turkeys." His dog Barney, a small terrier that a reporter once mistook for a black throw rug, is a happy hunter as well. Barney has spent the summer perfecting his skills at an old Texas sport: chasing armadillos, which burrow in Mrs. Bush's new gardens.
Barney clearly has no interest in going back to Washington on Thursday, and Mr. Bush does not sound markedly more enthusiastic. "We like living in the White House," he told a reporter who asked if he dreaded the return. Then, he began waxing philosophic again about the canyon to which he was clearing his trails, saying the spot brought him inner peace -- of a sort.
"It's a wonderful spot to come up in here and just kind of think about the budget," Mr. Bush said.

HEADLINE: U.S. READY TO END SANCTIONS ON INDIA TO BUILD ALLIANCE 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 26 

 BODY:
The Bush administration is moving on a broad front to strengthen relations with India, a nation it views as a neglected and potentially important strategic ally and trading partner in Asia. 
 The most dramatic step the administration will take, officials say, is the almost certain lifting of American economic and military sanctions imposed on India in 1998 for its test of a nuclear weapon. 
 Senior administration officials say Congress will be asked to lift the sanctions when it returns next month. Some of the most senior legislators, including the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, favor the move. 
Senator Biden said in an interview that he had sent a letter to President Bush last week expressing his support and indicating that the sanctions could be removed in time for a possible meeting between Mr. Bush and Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, in New York in late September. Mr. Bush is also planning a visit to India early next year. 
The sanctions were symbolic as much as practical, the officials said. Lifting them now would remove a significant irritant to closer ties. But it would also signal that the United States -- after being surprised and chagrined by India's nuclear test three years ago -- had little choice but to accept that India, the second most populous nation, had elbowed its way into the nuclear club. 
The reversal is not as awkward as it might once have been, given the administration's own opposition to a nuclear-test-ban treaty and its desire to build a missile shield against what it increasingly seems to regard as the inevitable spread of missile technology and weapons of mass destruction. 
In short, as one official said, the United States had to face the fact that India was a nuclear power and that "the genie could not be put back in the bottle." 
One senior official said the administration was also likely to ask Congress to lift some sanctions against India's neighbor and rival, Pakistan, which detonated its own nuclear weapon in a tit-for-tat test just weeks after India did. But Senator Biden said he was not prepared to go along with the request for Pakistan, which has since come under military rule. 
In the most direct explanation of the administration's position, Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, told an audience in New Delhi earlier this month, "The United States wants to treat India realistically for what it is -- a major country and an emerging power. 
"We want to engage India in a strategic dialogue that encompasses the full range of global issues," he added. "The United States appreciates that India's influence clearly extends far beyond South Asia."
Mr. Zoellick, the first member of President Bush's cabinet to visit India, said Washington wanted to work with India on fighting terrorism and the spread of nuclear weapons, promoting human rights and protecting the environment.
He also urged India to drop its resistance to the start of a new round of trade talks by the World Trade Organization, in Doha, Qatar, in October. India's strong voice on behalf of developing countries contributed to the breakdown of the last round, in Seattle in 1999. 
Another high-ranking Bush official, Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage, said this month in Sydney, Australia: "India is a nuclear power. There are a lot of reasons we ought to engage with India, and we're going to."
Mr. Armitage noted that the Indian-American population in the United States was "very high-tech oriented, very organized, very politically astute, a very helpful" factor in American politics. 
In urging the lifting of sanctions, senior Bush officials said, they are not seeking a quid pro quo. They say the end of sanctions will itself produce a closer dialogue and, for example, possibly lead India to tighten its controls on the manufacture of material for nuclear weapons. 
The sanctions bar military exports to India and any exports to companies believed to be connected to India's nuclear program. Lifting them now would open the way for joint military operations and the sale of nonnuclear weapons technology to India. 
The warming trend toward India, which led a nonaligned movement during the cold war and had friendly relations with the Soviet Union and now Russia, is not new. A visit by President Clinton to India in 2000 went a long way toward breaking down years of mistrust. But Mr. Clinton's efforts to improve ties were complicated by India's nuclear test. 
During his presidential campaign, Mr. Bush spoke of India as an important but needlessly ignored country, and praised the Indian-American community, one of the wealthiest in the United States and one that includes generous donors to congressional campaigns. 
In particular, officials said, the Bush administration is pleased by India's openness to what has become the president's major foreign policy goal: missile defense. 
During a visit in April, the Indian foreign and defense minister, Jaswant Singh, was invited for a surprise tete-a-tete with President Bush. Officials said Mr. Singh was sympathetic to key elements of the administration's missile plan, even though some experts have warned that a shield could set off an arms race across Asia if China builds up its arsenal in response. 
But the deputy secretary, Mr. Armitage, and others went out of their way to declare that the relaxation toward India was not motivated by a desire to create a counterweight to China. "Whenever you try to establish a relationship with a country which is based on a third country, then you're doomed to failure," he said. 
Senator Biden agrees. "I don't view this as playing India off China," he said. "There are all kinds of reasons to treat them as they are -- a great nation." 
Indeed, India and the United States share a potentially broad range of security interests, particularly given India's location on the Subcontinent, which bridges the Far East and the Islamic world. 
Both nations have an interest in countering Islamic extremism, particularly in Pakistan, which New Delhi and Washington have each accused of receiving weapons technology from China. India has also accused Pakistan of supporting Islamic militants in disputed Kashmir. 
And though its relations with Beijing have slowly improved, New Delhi has long been conscious of the need to balance against China, which the United States sees a fast-emerging strategic rival in the Pacific. 
In the long term, strategic planners preparing for China's expanding military presence see a new friendliness between the United States and India as potentially very helpful. Among the top American officials to visit India in recent months was Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
"How much do we care about India, qua India, or because it's close to China?" asked George R. Perkovich, an arms expert at the W. Alton Jones Foundation, a philanthropic group based in Charlottesville, Va., who has written extensively about India, suggesting that China was indeed on the administration's mind as it thinks about India. 
In addition, both India and the United States have expressed an interest in reducing tensions over Kashmir, over which India and Pakistan have had several military conflicts. With the addition of nuclear weapons to the region, Mr. Clinton said, the Subcontinent had become "the most dangerous place in the world." 
By lifting the sanctions on India, Senator Biden said, the United States would be "setting an example for Pakistan," a reference to India's relatively good behavior on selling nuclear-related materials to other countries. Pakistan has a poorer record, administration officials said. 
The United States has also been frustrated by Pakistan's inability to restore a democratic government since Gen. Pervez Musharraf took power in a coup in 1999, and India's place as the largest democracy dovetails neatly with Washington's interest in promoting democracy abroad. 
Aware of the possibility of creating an "India only" policy, however, American officials said Pakistan, a strong ally in the 1980's, should not be relegated to the dust heap. "This is not an either/or game with Pakistan," one senior official said. 
In particular, officials acknowledged that Washington does not want to alienate Pakistan for fear of encouraging Islamic extremists there or giving them reason to strengthen ties to the fundamentalist Taliban government in Afghanistan. 
"The United States is not interested in Pakistan becoming more under the influence of Afghanistan," said Mr. Armitage. "There has to be a way out for Pakistan. We're going to play an effective role." 
While officials said the administration would seek to remove the sanctions imposed on Pakistan in 1998 because of its nuclear tests, other sanctions -- including those imposed after General Musharraf's coup -- would remain in place.
Finally, officials said, the administration sees India as an enticing trade partner, but one that must do much more to reform its economy. Mr. Zoellick urged India to do so, noting that the United States was responsible for 15 percent of India's international trade. 
"You will not be surprised if I observe that the emerging strategic relationship between our two great democracies will not be resilient and growing if we fail to draw our economies closer together," he said. "I am seeking close governmental cooperation on trade -- bilaterally and for the global trading system." 
Mr. Bush has appointed a new ambassador in India, Robert D. Blackwill, to cultivate ties. Mr. Blackwill was one of a handful of close foreign policy advisers, known as the Vulcans, who guided Mr. Bush during his presidential campaign. Moreover, Mr. Blackwill was the boss of Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, when they both served on the National Security Council for the president's father.

HEADLINE: Sales of Existing Homes Fell 3% in July 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 27 

 BODY:
Americans bought fewer previously owned homes in July, the National Association of Realtors reported today. But the level of sales remained strong, suggesting that the housing market will continue to be a pillar of support for the struggling economy.
 Existing-home sales fell 3 percent in July from the previous month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.17 million. 
 Even with the decline, economists said sales in July were solid and noted that existing-home sales had been hovering near record levels in recent months.
"Existing-home sales faded a touch in July, but don't even think that is an indicator that the housing market is finally starting to tank," Joel Naroff, an economist at Naroff Economic Advisors, said. "The level of activity can be unambiguously characterized as very strong."
And with mortgage rates now below 7 percent, the outlook for sales continues to be bright, economists said.
Last week, the government reported that sales of new homes surged 4.9 percent in July.
In today's report, economists said the drop in existing-home sales reflected the fact that some prospective buyers were put off by the choppy economy and felt insecure about their jobs in light of mounting layoffs that have been announced over the last several months.
"Psychologically, there's some impact when people are thinking about trading up and buying a house," said David Lereah, the association's chief economist.
Though July's sales pace of 5.17 million was the lowest level this year, it was 7.3 percent higher than the 4.82 million sales rate in July 2000.
By region, sales fell 8.9 percent in the West, to a rate of 1.33 million in July. In the South, sales declined 1.9 percent, to a rate of 2.07 million, and in the Midwest they edged down 1.8 percent, to a rate of 1.12 million. But in the Northeast, sales rose 3.2 percent, to a rate of 650,000.
The drop in overall sales in July pulled prices down a bit from the previous month. The median existing-home sales price, meaning half sold for more and half for less, dipped to $150,800 in July from $152,200. But prices were up 5.2 percent from July 2000.
In June, sales of previously owned homes slipped to a rate of 5.33 million, but that matched the fifth-highest level on record, registered in December 1998.
The biggest reason the housing market has held up well during the economic slowdown is because mortgage rates have been low.
In July, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 7.13 percent, down from 7.16 percent in June and well below the 8.15 percent posted in July 2000. Last week, mortgage rates dipped to 6.91 percent.
"This is providing opportunities for first-time buyers who are fundamental to the overall health of the housing market," said Richard Mendenhall, president of the real estate group.

HEADLINE: No. 2 Official at I.M.F. Offers a Bleak Forecast 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 27 

 BODY:
The world economy is skirting the edge of a recession, harmed by Japan's predicted contraction and the rapid slowing of the United States economy, the International Monetary Fund's No. 2 official said today.
 The significant slowdown is exacting a toll on emerging-market economies like Turkey and Argentina that are trying to recapture investor confidence and pull out of their own recessions, the official, Stanley Fischer, said. 
 "We might well escape what you'd call a global recession," said Mr. Fischer, who is retiring as the I.M.F.'s deputy managing director this week. "But it's very, very uncomfortable, and it's particularly hard on growing and emerging-market countries." 
The I.M.F. has recently downgraded its outlook for three of the world's five largest economies: Japan, Germany and France. Many private forecasters have also warned that the world outlook has dimmed in recent weeks.
Mr. Fischer's assessment echoes the negative tone of the recent I.M.F. reports.
The fund warned that the dollar might be in for a sharp depreciation because of an unsustainable trade imbalance of 4.5 percent of gross domestic product. And it kept its forecast for growth in the United States this year at 1.5 percent, down from 5 percent last year.
The fund also cut its forecast for Japan, saying its economy would now contract 0.2 percent this year, instead of expanding 0.5 percent as predicted in April.
The I.M.F. last month also lowered its growth outlook for Germany this year to 1.25 percent from its forecast of 1.9 percent in April, a sign that the global economic decline is lasting longer than the fund expected when it said earlier this year that the world economy would expand 3.2 percent.
Critics of the I.M.F. say that the simultaneous fall in Europe, Japan and the United States shows the negative effect of global integration of trade and capital.
Today, Mr. Fischer played down the importance of those criticisms while saying the rules of the flow of global finance need to be reworked to reduce volatility.
"We need to work on reducing volatility in capital flows to emerging markets, and we are working on that," he said. One way to do that, he said, is to change the international rules guiding the flow of capital.
"I would love to find a legal system that is more conducive to helping countries" that cannot afford their debts, he said. "I suspect the fund in the next few years is going to be exploring this issue very, very hard, and I suspect that it's going to be very, very difficult to get agreement on it."
In other remarks, Mr. Fischer said Argentina would most likely get more international aid to help with its plan to swap some of its $130 billion in debt for safer, lower-cost securities.
The I.M.F., which agreed to an $8 billion bailout of Argentina last week, has pledged to speed up $3 billion in payments to encourage a bond swap or buyback.
"I don't think $3 billion is the end of the story," Mr. Fischer said. "They will need more than we're providing."
Mr. Fischer also said Argentina's policy makers must fulfill a pledge to cut out new borrowing to emerge from its current crisis with its credit intact.
"Everybody wants to see whether they can implement it," he said. "The pressure is on."
Mr. Fischer dismissed suggestions that the country would be better off defaulting to emerge from under its current debt crisis, as many independent analysts have counseled. That would destroy investors' faith in Argentina, he warned.
Defaulting "is not something that doesn't cause a huge mess," he said.
"There is no clean way to do it," he said.

 That's the $160 million question being posed by Toyota Motor Sales USA and its agency, Saatchi & Saatchi Los Angeles, as they ready what they are calling the largest campaign in the 43 years Toyota has been in the American market. The campaign -- involving artists as diverse as Lyle Lovett; Earth, Wind and Fire; John Lennon; and the Go-Gos -- will peddle the 2002 version of the Camry, the bread-and-butter Toyota midsize sedan that has been the nation's top-selling passenger car for the last four years. 
 The campaign is indicative of the intensification of efforts to sell products in competitive categories like automobiles as consumers demonstrate increasing reluctance to spend while the economy sputters. The Japanese-based automakers like Toyota have been maintaining or increasing the size of their marketing budgets -- and have recently been gaining market share at the expense of their American-based rivals. 
A central aspect of the Camry campaign is Toyota's buying of commercial time and advertising space configured in customized packages from three media giants: AOL Time Warner, the Conde Nast Publications division of Advance Publications and the MSN network of Internet services operated by the Microsoft Corporation. The packages include elements that bundle together disparate media properties; the packages at AOL Time Warner, for instance, involve cable television networks, magazines and Web sites.
"We've been trying for a number of years to have the big media conglomerates talk to us as one instead of in pieces," said Steve Sturm, vice president for marketing at Toyota Motor Sales USA in Torrance, Calif., part of the Toyota Motor Company.
"It was a struggle to get them to do that when they had more business than time and space to sell," he added. "Now that the environment is a lot more competitive, the worldwide conglomerates are saying, 'This can be stronger if we put it all together,' and we can have a much bigger launch than we would have if we bought all the segments separately."
The ads appearing in the cross-media packages as well as in the traditional outlets bought one medium at a time are meant to help Toyota cultivate interest among car shoppers who do not usually consider Camry, particularly men in their 30's and 40's, while retaining its traditional appeal to its core buyers, women in their 40's and 50's.
"Music seemed to be the best unifying element, the best way to get to all the different consumer groups," said Scott Gilbert, chief executive at Saatchi & Saatchi Los Angeles, also based in Torrance, the longtime Toyota agency that is part of the Saatchi & Saatchi division of the Publicis Groupe. "I was interviewing people for openings last week -- the market's very much alive out here -- and the first three said, 'I hate country music' and the fourth one said, 'I love country music.' When it comes to music, there's no one answer."
The cross-media parts of the campaign "make Camry feel like it's everywhere, like it's important," Mr. Gilbert said, "like an event, a rock concert, a concert tour."
There's that music thought again.
The music initiatives for the redesigned Camry, carrying the punning theme "Making tracks," include a multimedia enhanced compact disc with songs by artists like Mr. Lovett and the Go-Gos and links to the artists' and Toyota's Web sites; sponsorship of the MTV Video Music Awards and VH1 My Music Awards with the MTV and VH1 divisions of Viacom; an ad insert in seven Conde Nast magazines centered on the compact disc, which will be sold to raise funds for a new Camry Music Education Fund; an ad insert in the Sept. 24 "Music Goes Global" issue of Time magazine, which will also appear in nine other Time Inc. magazines; sponsorship of "Come Together: A Night for John Lennon," a special on the TNT cable network; and sponsorship of music news and feature reports on the "Showbiz Today" and "Showbiz This Weekend" programs on the CNN cable network.
"We've had a couple deals with automakers, but nothing of this magnitude," said Bob Pittman, co-chief operating officer at AOL Time Warner, which owns Time Inc., TNT, CNN and other properties that Toyota is buying for the Camry campaign like the Web sites of Entertainment Weekly, Fortune, Money and People.
One reason, he added, is that "the ability of a media company to provide a complete package, and do the coordination, is increasingly important to advertisers" -- and that was "one of the motivations for the merger" of America Online and Time Warner that formed AOL Time Warner.
As for concerns that cross-media packages concentrate too much power in the hands of a handful of media behemoths, "I don't think anyone these days is too concerned about the concentration of power in the sellers' hands," Mr. Pittman said, laughing. Other advertisers buying cross-media packages from AOL Time Warner include Bank of America, Philips, Qwest, Samsung and Swatch.
The Camry campaign, which will present a new sporty model named Camry SE aimed at the younger, male car buyers, is the first that will feature a revamped Toyota ad theme. "Toyota. Everyday," which lasted for two years, is being replaced by "Get the feeling," echoing the popular "Oh, what a feeling" theme that ran from 1985 to 1989.
"Get the feeling" is intended to "play off the emotional aspect of the new Camry," Mr. Sturm said, adding: "We have a car -- wider, longer, faster, more fun to drive -- that consumers have told us has made them go from needing a Camry to wanting a Camry. From that point of view, we felt we needed to do the launch in an emotional way."
Music, needless to say, stirs emotion, almost as much as did "Toyota. Everyday," which had grammarians debating whether Toyota meant "Every day," for ubiquity and dependability, rather than "Everyday," for ordinary and plebian.
Saatchi & Saatchi executives hope that the Camry campaign, now getting under way, will help damp down widespread speculation in trade publications that Toyota Motor Sales USA is unhappy with the agency's work.
"I don't lose sleep any more" over the speculation, Mr. Gilbert said. "All we can do is do the work, and do it well."

HEADLINE: A Young Heir Has New Plans At Old Company; 
Bill Wrigley Is Aggressive In Meeting Rivals Head-On

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 275 

 BODY:
For 38 years, William Wrigley carrying on a long family tradition dating back to the 1890's -- was in charge of the chewing gum company founded by his grandfather. He was healthy, it seemed, certainly wealthy, and thought to be wise in the way he managed the famously secretive company, the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company. He was expected to lead Wrigley into the new century.
 But in March 1999, when Mr. Wrigley died at the age of 66, the $2 billion business empire was left to the fourth generation of Wrigleys, another William Jr., then a 35-year-old company executive who was largely unknown to investors and Wall Street analysts. Some worried about diluted family ambitions, others simply doubted the young Wrigley was ready to run the company. 
 Yet two years after taking over, the young man, who is known around the headquarters here as Bill Wrigley Jr., is being applauded for aggressively pushing the company to reinvent itself with a host of new products and marketing initiatives. 
After years of stagnant volume growth in the United States, Wrigley -- the maker of Doublemint, Juicy Fruit, Big Red and Winterfresh -- is benefiting from brisk sales of sugarless chewing gums and gaining against its two biggest rivals, the makers of Dentyne and Carefree.
The company is also selling breath mints and gum pellets in the United States for the first time. And in perhaps its boldest venture yet, Wrigley is moving into the health product business by creating a division that aims to use chewing gum as a palatable way to deliver a wide range of remedies to consumers, everything from cold relief to cavity prevention.
Analysts say Mr. Wrigley has become something of a risk taker in a company that long prided itself on being conservative.
"His father said, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it;' " said one executive whose company works with Wrigley. "The son is, 'It works but let's find a better way.' "
One thing that seemed to be broken was the domestic market for chewing gum, which had been slumping for years. Bill Jr.'s father established his reputation by strongly expanding the international business and following a simple mantra: volume, volume, volume.
Now, the young Wrigley is trying to update the major brands, jazz up the Wrigley advertising and plant the seeds for older Americans to get their over-the-counter drug delivery through chewing gum. The new mantra might be: value, value, value.
"I see my role as taking a late 19th-century company and bringing it into the 21st century with guns blazing," Mr. Wrigley, who has granted only one press interview since becoming chief executive, told Forbes magazine.
The first product to come out of Wrigley's health division is Surpass, an antacid chewing gum that it introduced in February. The company plans to spend close to $50 million over the next year to promote and market Surpass as a chewy and tasty alternative to other antacid products, like Rolaids and Mylanta.
The company is also experimenting with a cold-relief gum in Canada. And this month, Wrigley said it would team up with Procter & Gamble, the maker of Crest toothpaste, to create a chewing gum that would offer added dental benefits.
These moves, and a bold new marketing campaign, seem to have restored confidence in Wrigley. Shares of the company have soared 36 percent in the last year, rebounding from a sharp decline in the months after Mr. Wrigley was appointed. The stock closed yesterday at $50.90, down 8 cents.
"This company has introduced more domestic initiatives this year than in all of the last decade that I've followed them," said John McMillin, a veteran food company analyst at Prudential Securities. "Bill Wrigley's been far more aggressive than I thought he'd be."
Some Wall Street analysts warn that it is still too early to tell whether Wrigley can persuade customers to trust it to deliver a pharmaceutical product. They also say Wrigley faces the prospect of big challenges from the likes of Pfizer, the drug giant that now owns the Dentyne, Chicklets and Trident brands, and Hershey Foods, which recently acquired the Carefree and Bubble Yum brands.
But even the skeptics say that Wrigley is largely unrivaled in the global marketplace.
"Not many companies can say they have 50 percent of the world market, no debt, very high returns and that kind of brand awareness," said Eric Katzman, a food analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown.
One problem with investing in Wrigley, though, is access to good information. Top executives have very little one-on-one contact with Wall Street analysts, and Wrigley does not offer earnings guidance, which is highly unusual for a Fortune 500 company.
Wrigley executives say the company does not play to the press, Wall Street or to the quarterly ups and downs of the stock market, but focuses instead on long-term strategy and profit growth.
"We're an investment company," said Ronald V. Waters, Wrigley's chief financial officer. "The focus is on maintaining the track record."
The Wrigley family, which has overwhelming control of the company through its 56 percent share of the Class B stock and about 21 percent of the common stock, is extremely private. William Wrigley rarely granted press interviews or met with Wall Street analysts. And Bill Wrigley Jr., now 37, who works on the 16th floor of the company's landmark headquarters in downtown Chicago, seems equally reclusive.
What is known is that he is the youngest of three children from the first of William Wrigley's three marriages. He received a bachelor's degree in economics from Duke University in 1985, joined the company later that year, and worked as an assistant to his father and as a marketing and top executive in Canada and then was tutored in a variety of positions here in Chicago. 
Bill Wrigley Jr.'s older siblings went their own way, but retain a stake in the company, according to a spokesman for Wrigley. His brother Philip went into banking and his sister Alison runs a California vineyard.
Mr. Wrigley is married with three children. He is described by friends and associates as personable, unpretentious, and someone who likes to delegate. He has a deep voice, and speaks slowly, sparingly and quite deliberately.
The best evidence of this can be seen at the company's annual meeting each spring, which is one of the few times ordinary investors, the press and Wall Street analysts get a glimpse of the inner circle.
Shortly after taking office, Mr. Wrigley began recruiting top executives from Gillette and Procter & Gamble, who were trotted out as a team for the first time this year. The moves were something of a departure for a company that usually elevates from within.
Mr. Wrigley, despite his comparative inexperience, showed that he can map a game plan and stick to it. Since he took office, the company has bought back millions of shares, created the health division, bought part of a gum technology company and acquired Velamints, the maker of sugarless breath mints.
"Almost everything they said they were going to do a year ago, they've executed on," Mr. Katzman at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown said. "That's rare."
The company's major competitors have not yet signaled any moves into health products, but they are staking out ground in the mint business and creating gums that promise added dental benefits.
Trident Advantage Mints and Trident gum promise to whiten teeth and reduce plaque. Arm & Hammer sells Dental Care gum with baking soda. And there is even an Aquafresh gum.
That may be why Wrigley made a deal with P.& G. and why it is going to try mints. "It's a natural for us to go into the mint category," Mr. Waters, the chief financial officer, said.
Indeed, Wrigley seems to have little choice. For several years, sales of sugared gums like Juicy Fruit and Doublemint -- a category in which Wrigley commands a 75 percent share -- have been falling across the board. Now they are being hurt even more by the growing popularity of high-intensity breath mints, like Altoids. One survey showed that teenagers now chew an average of seven sticks of gum a week, down from 10 sticks a week in 1996, according to Teenage Research Unlimited, a market research company in Northbrook, Ill.
More and more young people want powerful mints, market researchers say, instead of just mint-flavored gums.
"Wrigley brands are at the top," said Michael Wood, an executive at Teenage Research. "But there is no doubt the category is being threatened by mints. Teens chew gum for breath freshening, and that's what they are getting with breath mints."
Wrigley has been pushing new brands into the American market, like Eclipse, its first pellet gum; Everest, packaged in a tin box like Altoids; and Extra Polar Ice, a powerfully flavored chewing gum. All these brands are growing strongly.
Wrigley has also introduced a more aggressive advertising campaign. The television spots for Big Red, Winterfresh and Doublemint are more provocative. Some feature animated hip-hop characters rapping. More recently, the company signed the tennis sisters, Venus and Serena Williams, who are now being featured in the company's "Distinctively Doublemint" ads.
The campaigns -- created by the Chicago office of BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group and the company's longtime agency -- are a marked departure for Wrigley, which had been known for softer, more conservative tones -- the "double your pleasure, double your fun" style.
There has also been new packaging, new online promotions and a giant new billboard planned for Times Square.
In response to all this, sales of Wrigley chewing gum jumped 10 percent in the United States in the first half of this year and global sales were also up about 10 percent, despite the adverse effects of the strong dollar.
Wrigley is even stronger abroad. More than 60 percent of its sales now come from outside the United States. It has a remarkable 90 percent of the chewing gum market in Germany.
Wrigley is strong in Asia, too, where it sells about $250 million worth of chewing gum a year, according to Prudential Securities. Some analysts expect that figure to balloon to $1 billion within a decade or so.
The company, some say, was built in the mold of Coca-Cola. It has managed to keep prices extremely low for decades by increasing volume and reducing manufacturing costs, making it difficult for competitors to enter the market.
"It's an easy company to understand," said Anne Selkovits, a portfolio manager at Gray, Seifert & Company. "It's not like Gillette, which went out and bought batteries and other things to keep the growth going."
Still, there are always things to worry about. Suppose candies and mints seriously erode the chewing gum market? Suppose delivering health care products through gum fails? 
The young Bill Wrigley seems very much aware of those prospects, analysts say, and that may be why the company is rolling out so many new products and why it is preparing to sell to an aging population -- people who might want to chew on gum rather than take a pill that delivers pain relief, soothes a sore throat, relieves an upset stomach, or perhaps cleans and whitens teeth.
How far might such innovations go? No one really knows. But an older investor rose at the annual meeting in March to put Bill Wrigley Jr. on the spot. 
"My one request is, that being older now, that should you develop a Viagra-flavored health care product, I would like to be among the first to know," the man said.
The audience roared with laughter. Mr. Wrigley smiled calmly. "I think," he replied, "the possibilities are endless."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS; 
Major Gauges Fall as Shares Again Fail to Extend a Rally

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday in lackluster summer trading. Investors feared the rally on Friday would fizzle like other advances this year as corporate profits continue to shrink and the economy sputters.
 "There is a lot of uncertainty out there and people are cautious," said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Kirlin Securities. "Since May, every rally has failed, and people are afraid this will be the same." 
 The buying of weakened stocks like computer chip makers briefly pushed the main gauges into positive territory in the early afternoon, but they gave back those gains and closed lower across the board.
"Every trading rally has been an opportunity to pare back, and people take profits," said Tony Rosenthal of TimesSquare Capital Management. "Investors are scared." 
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 4.39 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,912.41. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 40.82 points, or 0.4 percent, to 10,382.35. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shed 5.72 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,179.21.
On Friday, the main gauges posted their biggest gains in more than six weeks with the Nasdaq rising more than 4 percent after Cisco Systems said business was stabilizing and strong sales of new homes indicated that consumers were holding up a crucial sector.
But the latest economic data offered little support after the National Association of Realtors yesterday reported that sales of existing homes fell 3 percent in July.
Home Depot, a Dow component, took a hit after the report, falling 95 cents, to $48.99.
Semiconductor stocks were helped by news that Intel began selling a processor that runs at two billion cycles a second. That doubled the speed of computer chips in only 18 months. It rose 7 cents, to $29.15.
The Philadelphia semiconductor index rose 1.9 percent, closing at a three-week high. Semiconductors have been rising on recent data showing improvement in orders and suggesting the industry's worst downturn in decades is bottoming.
Financial stocks, in particular interest-rate-sensitive regional banks, added to last week's losses on fears the Fed's effort to cut interest rates was nearing an end. Staten Island Bancorp fell $1.77, or 6 percent, to $27.71, and Washington Mutual lost $1.75, or 4.6 percent, to $36.25.
"It might be giving an early clue that the Federal Reserve is either done lowering rates or one interest rate cut away from that," said Barry Hyman, chief investment strategist at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum.
More layoffs stung the market after the farm equipment maker Deere said it would close several plants and cut 1,975 more jobs, bringing total layoffs to 3,225. Deere fell 4 cents, to $43.91.
Blockbuster sank 7.29 percent after Barron's reported that the growth of video on demand over the Internet may slow video rentals. Its stock was off $1.60, to $20.35.
 --------------------

Treasury Prices Fall
 (By Bloomberg News) -- Bond prices fell with expectations that the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates once more to head off a recession.
"The risk of a recession is so costly that the Fed can afford" to cut rates again, even at the risk of igniting inflation, said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo.
The price of the benchmark 10-year note fell 3/32, to 100 18/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.93 percent from 4.92 percent on Friday.
The 30-year bond fell 9/32, to 98 22/32. Its yield rose to 5.47 percent from 5.45 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-and six-month bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
3-Mo. Bills 6-Mo. Bills Price 99.153 98.337 High Rate 3.350 3.290 Investment Rate 3.426 3.392 Low Rate 3.30% 3.21% Median Rate 3.33% 3.27% Total applied for $39,591,947 $32,490,436 Accepted $21,852,437 $17,942,171 Noncompetitive $1,391,905 $1,330,822

Dust Off Your Ungaros
Emanuel Ungaro, the French couturier known for his catwalk Jezebels, is taking over the armory on Lexington Avenue the evening of Sept. 5 to celebrate 35 years in fashion. There will be dinner and dancing on a pink plexiglass floor and, of course, lots of guests dressed in Ungaro, new and vintage. About 400 people are expected.
 Mr. Ungaro, who began his career in the workrooms at Balenciaga -- his name, written by hand in ink, can still be found among the dress labels in the Balenciaga archive that Gucci recently acquired -- has mellowed, if slightly, from marriage, fatherhood and years of pleasing women. Balenciaga, who abruptly closed his doors in 1968, said, in his only known interview, that fashion was "a dog's life." A spokeswoman for Mr. Ungaro said yesterday that nowadays he preferred to spend his time with his family, going to galleries and reading Proust. 
 But these are modern competitive times, and no designer can afford to rest on his laurels mulling over the fates of Swann and Charlus. In the 1980's, Mr. Ungaro's big numbers captured the extravagance of the era: a tartan ball skirt worn by Lynn Wyatt, the Houston socialite, still stands out in memory. His ready-to-wear was a mainstay of any good boutique. But a lot of those boutiques are gone, minimalism has ruled, to the approval of serious-minded working women, and Mr. Ungaro has sometimes had a time-warp quality. 
Slowly, he is trying to change. He is working closely with a young assistant, Jean-Batista Valli. He has made his ads more provocative. According to his spokeswoman, sales have doubled in the last year, in part thanks to a new London boutique. And like many older designers, Mr. Ungaro is being discovered by the younger crowd, including the Hilton sisters and Sarah Jessica Parker. Among those expected at the party is Zoe Cassavetes, whose mother, Gena Rowlands, was dressed by Mr. Ungaro for her 1980 movie, "Gloria," and who had the good sense to keep some of the clothes.

Passing on Coverage
At a time when fashion coverage seems to be anybody's game, including the tabloids and those feisty young sleuths at Hintmag.com, regional newspapers are having second thoughts. 
Among newspapers not sending reporters to the spring collections in New York, which begin Sept. 8, are The Houston Chronicle, The Times-Picayune of New Orleans and The San Francisco Chronicle.
The economy is the reason. "We're in our third round of budget cuts," said Linda Griffin, fashion editor of The Houston Chonicle, which until last spring published a weekly eight-page fashion section. But declining ad revenues have clipped Ms. Griffin's wings. She stopped covering shows in Europe two years ago, and for the first time in more than a decade will not be at the New York shows. 
"The large advertisers want to be in the front section of the paper," she said. "You can beat them over the head with a high heel, but they're not going to change."
Fern Mallis, executive director of 7th on Sixth, which runs the shows in Bryant Park, said: "It's unfortunate that the state of the economy is preventing some out-of-town editors from coming to the shows. But I don't think it's going to impact coverage." According to registration figures, 16 of the top 20 daily American newspapers are sending reporters, and attendance has increased in all categories, notably among Web sites. 
But those numbers tell only part of the story. James O'Byrne, the features editor of The Times-Picayune, said he questioned the wisdom of sending a reporter and a photographer to New York, at a cost of $9,000, when there may be other ways of covering fashion. "It's the economy, but it's more than that," Mr. O'Byrne said. "Even if things were to get bright and rosy tomorrow, I would never go back to the way we were doing it." He suggested that while readers want fashion news, they were not dependent on a local editor to explain the finer points.
Dotty Lane couldn't agree more. Ms. Lane is the fashion writer at The Record-Courier (circulation: 26,000) in Kent, Ohio, and she faithfully covered the New York shows for 30 years. But in 1999, she gave up. "Designers used to take the time to talk to you and explain what their inspirations were," she said. "But now the trends on the runways are the same ones you catch on television -- tight jeans and T-shirts."
So Ms. Lane decided to give New York fashion a pass. "In the last few years, I was really just coming to see my friends," she said.
So what else is new?

HEADLINE: Standard Media Inc. Files for Bankruptcy 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 27 

 BODY:
Standard Media Inc., the parent company of the once high-flying dot-com magazine The Industry Standard, filed for bankruptcy protection today, one week after it ceased publication and laid off most of its staff.
 Clerks at the federal bankruptcy court in San Francisco confirmed the filing, which sets the stage for the court to supervise the sale of Standard Media's assets, including the magazine's subscriber list, trademarks, computers and office furniture. 
 Officials at Standard Media declined to comment on the filing. But the company's chief operating officer, Ann-Marie McGowan, was quoted on the company Web site as saying there was "considerable interest" in the remaining assets from both investors and media companies, some of whom might be interested in restarting the magazine.
At the height of the dot-com heyday, The Industry Standard employed more than 400 people and regularly published magazines that exceeded 300 pages.
But the drastic reversal in dot-com fortunes hit the magazine's advertising base hard, and negotiations for further financing from principal investors including the trade magazine publisher International Data Group collapsed.

HEADLINE: Preserving a Hair-Raising Relic of the Cold War 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEW WINDSOR, N.Y. 

 BODY:
They called it the blockhouse, and from the outside at least, it lived up to its name. It was a windowless square with no distinguishing features except for a single beige stripe around its middle.
 The four-story building was constructed of lead-reinforced concrete and was tucked behind a hill on a United States Air Force base in this small town 60 miles north of New York City. Since the building was hard to camouflage, the designers did the next best thing, making it so nondescript that few but those with a security clearance to get inside knew what went on there. 
 Now, the structure and its mysterious past have captured the imagination of two residents of the nearby town of New Paltz.
The two residents -- Susan Zimet, 47, co-director of the Hudson Valley Media Arts Center, and Karl Rodman, 65, the president of River Valley Tours, an educational travel organization -- hope to turn it into a museum to commemorate what they see as the next era ripe for nostalgia: the cold war. They will call it the Cold War/Peace Museum.
"People need to see this and know what was going on right in their own backyard during that time," Ms. Zimet said.
Beginning in 1958, the building, once known as the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment Direction Center and called SAGE, played a crucial role in America's defense against a possible Soviet air attack. It housed part of the military's first major computer-based command and control system.
Data from far-flung radar sites were transmitted over phone lines to computer consoles at this and 21 similar centers nationwide, where Air Force personnel scanned the skies, prepared at the touch of a button to intercept enemy planes with remote-controlled surface-to-air missiles.
After serving as the hub of Northeast air defense for more than a decade, the SAGE Center on the Stewart Air Force Base closed in the late 1960's, its technology made obsolete by the proliferation of intercontinental ballistic missiles. Tracking ICBM's required more sensitive radar and faster computers. It has sat ever since, largely empty and deteriorating, on the grounds of what is now Stewart International Airport.
Ms. Zimet and Mr. Rodman envision a museum that would not only explain the building and its technology, but also examine the impact of the cold war on all aspects of life in both the United States and the Soviet Union. It might also have a full-size theater that would show continuous screenings of cold war movies like "Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb" and "Seven Days in May."
Other potential exhibits include a life-size reconstruction of a family's backyard bomb shelter and a collection of oral histories from military personnel and civilians.
Ms. Zimet and Mr. Rodman are trying to raise $200,000 by Dec. 1 to finance feasibility and concept studies. They have been discussing their plans with Ralph Appelbaum Associates, a Manhattan museum design firm best known for the Holocaust Museum in Washington, and Economics Research Associates, an entertainment consulting firm.
The museum project is among a growing number of efforts to preserve sites related to the time when fear of nuclear annihilation gripped America.
Francis Gary Powers Jr., son of the U-2 pilot whose reconnaissance plane was shot down over Russia in 1960, plans to open a museum on a former Nike missile base in Lorton, Va. On Long Island, a group wants to save the nation's last remaining intact Air Force radar tower and antenna, situated on state-owned land at Montauk Point. In New Jersey, the federal government is restoring another former Nike missile site at Fort Hancock on Sandy Hook peninsula in hopes of turning it into a national park.
America is increasingly fascinated by the cold war, partly because enough time has passed for most people to truly consider it history, said Robert Sharlet, the Chauncey H. Winters professor of political science at Union College in Schenectady. Yet the cold war is still a vivid memory for nostalgia-prone baby boomers who participated in duck-and-cover drills at school and monitored the space race, he said.
"In a sense, everyone who lived through the cold war is a cold war veteran," Professor Sharlet said. "Now that all the unpleasantness is history and the memories are sanitized, I foresee cold war toys, T-shirts and bus tours of old" Strategic Air Command bomber sites. "Nostalgia is a terrific marketing tool, and pop culture is a great earner."
Nevertheless, those interested in saving cold-war-related sites are not finding their task easy. Built to be functional, not beautiful, old radar towers, hulking concrete computer centers and outdated missile bases can be a hard sell for those who favor preserving them.
Also, many of the properties have been stripped of the electronics that were arguably their most interesting feature. At the New Windsor site, one floor is now home to a company that makes chocolate lollipops by hand.
Upstairs, all that remains of the storied technology are the hulking air-conditioning units that once cooled two identical computer systems, each with approximately 50,000 vacuum tubes. In the command center, where air defense strategy was plotted, are two painted Plexiglas maps indicating the status of potential targets of enemy bombs.
In its heyday, the system featured the largest and most expensive real-time computer program every built. Designed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratories and constructed by I.B.M., it pioneered technology that modern computer users now consider standard, including dial-up telephone modems and the mouse. Its advancements helped create today's airline reservation systems.
"The SAGE computer was a marvel not seen in civilian circles," said Chris McWilliams, a retired Air Force major who worked as a radar operator at the New Windsor site from 1957 to 1960. "Compared to the older manual radar consoles, the SAGE consoles looked like something out of Buck Rogers."
Ms. Zimet and Mr. Rodman hope that the New Windsor building's role in history and its contributions to modern computing will help draw a crowd. They believe that a cold war museum in New Windsor will tie in with existing local historic military sites, particularly the United States Military Academy at West Point, which attracts 2.5 million visitors a year.
"I took one look at this and knew that its history and significance were too great to do anything but make it into a museum," Ms. Zimet said. "The goal is to have them walk out with their hair standing up on the back of their necks and realizing that at any given moment, we could find ourselves back in that situation again."

HEADLINE: Florida Minister Defies Drug Dealers, Despite Threat on Life 

BYLINE:  By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Aug. 18 

 BODY:
The Rev. John Guns is 5-foot-3 and thick, like a steamer trunk in a blue pin-striped suit, but he moves light and fast across the dais at St. Paul's Missionary Baptist Church. An electric organ moans, a drum booms and Mr. Guns begins to proselytize. "We are the people of God," the minister shouts, and lifts up his congregation even as, one by one, the worshipers drop on their knees.
 "Lord, we ask you to bind the Devil right now," Mr. Guns says to people who pray for rent money, groceries, lost sons, or to live one more day free of crack cocaine. "Quiet your spirits," he says, as they press their foreheads to the carpet or raise their hands to heaven. "You had enough gas to get here. Let God get you home." 
 "Yes, Lord, yes," the congregation says. Some ministers give sermons. Mr. Guns, in this simple white church in northwest Jacksonville, came to preach. The son of a preacher, he always loved his calling. But he has never loved it so much as now. 
God, he believes, has sent him a test of faith, not of lust or greed, the kind that has toppled so many preachers, but the kind that makes a man watch his rearview mirror and pray that the headlights will not follow him home.
After he spoke out against drug gangs in a blighted neighborhood a month ago, word began to circulate in the hair salons, housing projects, barber shops and clubs that the dealers would pay $25,000 to have him killed. Mr. Guns had to decide to push on or bow his head and shut his mouth. Mr. Guns, a 37-year-old husband and the father of a little girl, chose to push.
He led a march through the poor, mostly black Ken Knight neighborhood -- where the threat is believed to have originated -- and held a tent revival, where he brought four people to the Lord. Now, the pastor is raising money for a women's center to help, among others, mothers addicted to the crack the dealers sold. Even as common sense and self-preservation shook his knees, he defied the dealers.
"I'm just a preacher," he told himself when he first heard about the bounty on his head. "I don't want this." He just wanted to return to his church, where the Devil took many forms but none so real as this. "I just wanted to preach."
But then he would have been a paper preacher, a man with a microphone who extolled others to a faith he did not trust himself.
"If I buckle, my calling, and my mission, is a farce," Mr. Guns said.
The threat has substance, the police, the city's mayor and the people who live and work in the Ken Knight neighborhood say, and it is being investigated. "The police keep an eye on him," said John Delaney, the mayor.
So do his church members. The maintenance man patrols the hallways and parking lot, searching for drug dealers. Older women stand sentry at the sanctuary entrance, a palace guard of flower-print pantsuits and well-thumbed Bibles, watching. Police cruisers drive by.
Just down the street, the Washington Heights area of the Ken Knight neighborhood seems tired and worn. A homemade sign tacked to a power pole says: "Car loan to 29 people with bad credit. Call 805-9909." In a red-brick housing project, a sun-faded sedan sits on four flat tires, and will for a long time.
It was not so bad, some people said, before a gang began using the projects and concrete-block houses as a base to sell crack. It was around 1994. "I hate it, I hate it," said Gerline Gordon, 55. "I got a son on it."
The drug gang, the Waterfront Boys, was not an outside evil that showed up one day. Ms. Gordon watched some of the dealers grow up, as the drug became an economic mainstay in a place short on jobs. Some people even had their rent or power bills paid by dealers, in exchange for their good will. The dealers even passed out Christmas gifts.
The gang slowly poisoned the community, and people pleaded with the sheriff to shut it down. In July, after years of investigations and more than 1,000 pounds of powder and rock cocaine distributed in the area, federal agents and the Jacksonville police raided the neighborhood. Twelve men, including the alleged ringleader, Linwood Smith, have been charged with drug-related crimes.
Mr. Guns praised the effort in an article in The Florida Times-Union, but warned that the problem would only return if the community was not revitalized.
And so every day, more than 20 full-time members of the church staff run programs to help this community. Counselors find beds in treatment centers for crack addicts, screening them in the church offices.
The church's Northside Affordable Housing Opportunity Community Development Corporation helps families buy houses. The St. Paul Community Empowerment Center runs programs to teach children suspended from schools and to help adults find work, schooling and counseling.
"A 21st-century church," Mr. Guns said, must fight the Devil "in a multiplicity of ways."
Within days of the drug arrests, word began to circulate around the city that a $25,000 bounty was being offered for Mr. Guns's death. The drug dealers apparently believed, wrongly, that he had been involved in the investigation, Mr. Guns said. He has spoken out against the drug, he said, but has never named names.
But many people in the neighborhood said the drug dealers still see Mr. Guns as a threat. He offers not only salvation, but also a means to get off crack, to live decently.
"If your light bill is paid and you have food on the table," Mr. Delaney said, "it's easier to think about God."
Kenneth Adkins, the church's minister of community development, heard about the bounty in the Perfect Ten barber shop on Norwood Street. A patron there warned him.
Callers to the church warned the pastor and his staff.
Some people said it was just a bluff, a rumor, but most in the neighborhood took it seriously. "If someone says they're going to burn your house down, you better go get a hose," said Dewayne Scott, 35, who works in a small grocery in Ken Knight.
It would be wrong to say that, when Mr. Guns heard about the threat, he never doubted what to do. He did have doubts -- even as he marched, even as he preached.
"Let the Devil know he should have killed me," he said, in his tent revival. "Because I'm still here."
Later, when the crowds were gone, he thought to himself: "You are so stupid. Shut up."
But in the pulpit, on the streets, Mr. Guns never wavered. He had promised, through the power of his church's programs, to fill that void left by the drug dealers. It was much too late to back down now.
"I didn't run," Mr. Guns said. "I couldn't."
Help and support came from unexpected places. White pastors marched with him, and invited him to preach in their churches. White business owners were suddenly interested in the church's programs.
"It galvanized us," said the Rev. Ted Corley, pastor of the Mayfair Baptist Church on the city's south side. Such a threat, Mr. Corley said, sliced through race and class.
It has been weeks, and nothing has happened. Mr. Guns sleeps in the same house with his family now -- something he was afraid to do after first hearing of the threat. He believes he has been spared.
He believes, more than ever.
He believes.

U.S. Criticizes Israel For 'Targeted Killings'
The Bush administration said Israel's policy of killing Palestinians it believes are involved in terrorist acts was inflaming the Middle East conflict and urged the Israelis to ease what it called the humiliations of the Palestinian people. The remarks, by the State Department spokesman Richard L. Boucher, came a few hours after the latest such attack, in which Israeli helicopters killed the leader of a radical Palestinian faction, Mustafa Zubari, also known as Abu Ali Mustafas. A1

Mr. Zubari's death set off protests and renewed gunfire in a Jerusalem neighborhood; later, Israeli tanks pushed into the Palestinian-ruled town of Beit Jala. A6

Powell to Skip Race Meeting
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell will not attend a United Nations conference on racism in South Africa on Friday and it is possible that the United States will boycott the gathering, a spokesman said. A decision on sending any American delegates will hinge on whether agenda language criticizing Israel is changed. A6

NATO Collects Rebels' Guns
Hours after a British soldier became the first NATO peacekeeper to die in Macedonia, NATO dropped some of its toughest troops into Otlja, a village held by the ethnic Albanian rebels they came to disarm, and started collecting weapons. A3

Capitol Budget Office Sees Deeper Dips Into Surplus
Congressional budget analysts warned that the economic downturn and President Bush's tax cut would force the government to spend $9 billion from the Social Security surplus this year and billions more over the next three years. Last week, the White House said the government could avoid using Social Security funds to pay for other programs. A1

Impact Statement Sought
Environmental groups hope to slow the Bush administration's missile defense program by filing a lawsuit today asserting that Pentagon plans for a missile defense test range violate federal environmental rules. They want the Pentagon to conduct a detailed analysis of the environmental impact of missile testing on Alaska, Hawaii, California and other areas in the proposed test range. A10

Charges Against Condit Urged
A conservative legal group, Judicial Watch, joined an effort to persuade a California district attorney to file charges against Representative Gary A. Condit, a Democrat, arising from a flight attendant's accusation that he had urged her to sign an affidavit denying that they had an affair. A8

Teamsters' Ex-Leader on Trial
Ron Carey, elected president of the Teamsters union in 1991 as an anticorruption crusader, went on trial in Manhattan on federal charges that he repeatedly lied to investigators looking into fund-raising improprieties in his re-election campaign five years later. Mr. Carey won the election, but federal monitors voided his victory, citing campaign fraud. A12

Ruling on Variety vs. Diversity
A panel of the federal appeals court in Atlanta unanimously ruled that the University of Georgia's admissions policy, which gives a slight preference in bonus points to nonwhite students, is unconstitutional. The three judges said the university had failed to prove that having more nonwhite students on campus would lead to a more diverse student body, a possible justification under the Supreme Court's 1978 Bakke ruling.

Sharpton Endorses Ferrer In Crowded Mayoral Field
The Rev. Al Sharpton said he would back Fernando Ferrer for mayor, an endorsement that Ferrer aides said should assure him enough votes in the Sept. 11 Democratic primary to qualify for a runoff between the two top vote-getters. Similarly, a number of Democrats said Mr. Ferrer's performance in the primary would also be a gauge of Mr. Sharpton's clout. A1

The mayor's race features the most candidates on alternative party lines ever. Among the seven are Kenny Kramer of "Seinfeld" fame (Libertarian); Bernard Goetz (City Independent), who gained notoriety in a 1984 subway shooting; and two rivals for the Green Party nomination. B1

Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, a Democratic mayoral candidate, accused the Giuliani administration of covering up evidence that could have been central to a corruption inquiry involving a welfare-to-work program. B3

HEADLINE: Judge Delays Effort to Close Token Booths 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL J. WAKIN 

 BODY:
New York City Transit must hold public hearings before it can close token booths or reduce their hours at 53 subway stations across the city, a judge ruled yesterday, deciding in favor of rider advocates who said the agency was acting arrogantly.
 The judge, Justice Diane A. Lebedeff of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, said the transit agency ignored a state law that specifically called for hearings before carrying out a permanent "partial closing" of a station or before limiting "any means of public access." 
 The judge's order puts off the closings only temporarily, because the transit agency could close the stations even after public hearings are held.
The agency, the subsidiary of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority responsible for New York City subways and buses, had announced the closings as a means of saving money, arguing that it was merely changing the way it collected fares and did not need to hold hearings. Starting in September, it planned to remove token clerks from 18 subway entrances and reduce staffing hours at 35 others, involving 7.5 percent of the subway system's 709 token booths, the judge said. 
Many of the regular turnstiles would be closed off, because there would be no attendant to keep people from jumping them. Riders could still use MetroCard vending machines and pass through the tall, clawlike turnstiles that look like revolving doors.
But Justice Lebedeff took note of riders who find those narrow turnstiles impassable: parents with infants and strollers, shoppers with packages, people with crutches or walkers, and people with guide dogs.
"To such persons, 'access' at a subway entrance only through a high turnstile is no access at all and constitutes an effective closing of that given entrance," the judge said. She noted that the plaintiffs in the case had pointed out that some of the restrictive turnstiles would be installed at a station entrance near the offices of an organization that serves blind people.
She also seemed to say that there was something downright un-New York about not having hearings, particularly in a city not known for shyness.
"New York City has a well-placed and profound respect for public hearings, specifically because interested individuals and organizations do often provide insights, perspectives and constructive suggestions which may not have been considered by the agency and its planners," she said.
The judge noted that changes in station access had usually been the subject of public hearings.
A New York City Transit spokesman, James Anyansi, said last night that the agency was still deciding whether to appeal the ruling to the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court.
According to the law governing public service changes, the transit agency would have to wait at least 30 days to hold any hearings after first announcing them.
Rider advocates hailed the decision for its practical effects and also as a moral victory in efforts to bring to heel what they see as an arrogant and unresponsive agency.
"The people who run the agency have been doing a bad job listening to their riders," said Gene Russianoff, staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a transit watchdog group that was one of the organizations that sued the authority. "It's a major reason why we brought the lawsuit. It wasn't just about token booths. If you're going to close somebody's token booth, for God's sakes, you've got to talk to the community."
As examples of what he called the transit agency's arrogance, Mr. Russianoff also cited proposed cutbacks at the Grand Street station in Chinatown and on the G line -- service reductions that were modified after complaints. He also said that Lawrence G. Reuter, the president of New York City Transit, used to meet four or five times a year with rider advocacy groups, but the practice been ended three years ago.
Mr. Anyansi declined to comment on the criticism.
Other plaintiffs included Citizen Action of New York, the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance, Acorn and the Transport Workers union Local 100, which represents the city's 3,500 token booth clerks. 
Opponents of the cutbacks also argued that fewer clerks mean fewer eyes and ears to discourage crime, and that was on the mind of riders at some of the stations that would be affected.
"We need someone down there," said Kali Christian, 21, of the Bronx, a laborer standing outside the Myrtle-Willoughby Avenues station on the G line in Brooklyn. "It's more safer for myself and everybody who takes the train. What would have happened if I were to go down there right now and get robbed? Who's going to see? Who's going to call the police?"
Farther along the line, at the Bedford-Nostrand Avenues stop, which is also on the list of cutbacks, one rider said the ruling gave the authority's managers what they deserved.
"They're being arrogant," said Ramon Medina, 24, an unemployed truck driver who lives in Park Slope in Brooklyn. "They're being condescending. They're not using their heads. They're not using common sense. They should have had a meeting and talked to the people who use the train every day. I'm sure they would have told them the same thing I'm saying right now." 
Mr. Russianoff noted that after hearings in 1991, a time of fiscal austerity, service cuts including station closings were abandoned.
"It's not just some technical, pointless exercise," he said.
The law cited by Justice Lebedeff, the Public Authorities Law, was enacted in 1977 during another, more serious, fiscal crisis. The subway system was laboring under heavy debt, and the transit agency came up with a plan to save money by closing stations. The law was passed after a public outcry that public comment should precede any closings.

Truth And Lies

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; Thomas L. Friedman is on vacation.

 BODY:
Dishonesty in the pursuit of tax cuts is no vice. That, in the end, will be the only way to defend George W. Bush's deceptions.
 Let's remember the way the debate ran during the spring. Back in May, The New Republic's cover showed a picture of Mr. Bush, with the headline "He's Lying." Inside were two articles about the tax cut. One, by Jonathan Chait, showed that -- contrary to administration claims -- the tax cut would mainly go to the richest few percent of the population. The other was an excerpt from my own book "Fuzzy Math," refuting the administration's claims that it could cut taxes, increase military spending, provide prescription drug coverage and still avoid dipping into the Social Security surplus. 
 The New Republic cover caused much tut-tutting; the magazine's editors were accused of hyperbole, of rabble-rousing. But the headline was a simple statement of fact. Mr. Bush was lying. It was obvious from the start that the administration's numbers didn't add up.
 And in case you were wondering, the administration is still lying. I could explain at length how the Office of Management and Budget has cooked the books so that it can still claim a surplus outside of Social Security over the next two years. But here's an easy way to see that the numbers are bogus: O.M.B. claims that the budget will show a surplus of $1 billion this year, and another $1 billion next year. Ask yourself how likely it is that revenues and outlays in a $2 trillion budget would line up that exactly. Then ask yourself how likely it is that they would line up that exactly two years in a row. The O.M.B. numbers are the result of desperate backing and filling -- shift some revenue from this year to next year, then move some of it back, then change accounting rules that have been in place for 65 years, then bump up the estimate of economic growth -- all so that the administration can pretend that it is keeping its promise.
 The Congressional Budget Office, which does honest work but under certain constraints -- more on that in a minute -- is supposed to release its own estimate today, but the main results have already been leaked. They show a deficit outside Social Security this year, a tiny surplus next year, then a return to deficit in 2003 and 2004. And these numbers, read properly, flatly refute two of the arguments you'll hear over the next few days.
 First, the administration will tell you that the return to deficits is the result of the economic slowdown. Not so: the C.B.O., like the administration, assumes that the economy will recover next year, but projects that we will be in deficit through 2004. Why? Because the tax cut grows over time, and the revenue lost because of that growing tax cut is more than the revenue gained from economic recovery. Why has the prospect of surpluses been replaced by the prospect of deficits, even after the economy recovers? To coin a phrase: It's the tax cut, stupid.
 Second, the administration will try to blame big spenders in Congress for the deficits. But who are these big spenders? The only major new spending items in the C.B.O. projection are for defense and education -- both in response to administration initiatives. And it's the administration, not the Democrats, that has described the defense increase as a mere "down payment" on much larger future sums.
 Those future defense increases aren't in the C.B.O. projection, because the rules under which C.B.O. operates force it to project the budget as if current policy will remain unchanged. So the C.B.O. projection leaves out the budget-busters it knows are out there, such as Donald Rumsfeld's next installment and the cost of fixing the alternative minimum tax. Put those items in, and the picture is clear: the surplus is gone, and we won't see it again as long as the tax cut goes through as scheduled.
 I'll turn in future columns to the reasons why this year's deficit is not a bad thing, but those future deficits -- which will be much larger than the C.B.O. projects -- are very bad things indeed.
 But the important point for now involves honor and credibility. Mr. Bush promised not to dip into the Social Security surplus; he has broken that promise. Critics told you that would happen; they have been completely vindicated. Mr. Bush told you it wouldn't; he lied.

HEADLINE: U.S. SAYS KILLINGS BY ISRAEL INFLAME MIDEAST CONFLICT 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 27 

 BODY:
The Bush administration said today that Israel's policy of pinpoint killings of Palestinians was inflaming the Middle East conflict and urged the Israelis to alleviate what it called the humiliations of the Palestinian people.
 In sterner terms than those used by President Bush just three days ago, the State Department spokesman, Richard L. Boucher, said that "Israel needs to understand that targeted killings of Palestinians don't end the violence but are only inflaming an already volatile situation and making it much harder to restore calm." 
 Mr. Boucher was referring to Israel's policy of seeking out and killing Palestinian leaders it says have plotted or supervised terrorist acts. Hours before he spoke, Israeli helicopters fired missiles on the offices of the leader of a radical Palestinian faction, Mustafa Zubari, also known by the name Abu Ali Mustafa. The attack killed him and set off protests by thousands of Palestinians; later, Israeli tanks pushed into the Palestinian-ruled town of Beit Jala. Page A7. 
In declaring that such slayings of Palestinians were "only inflaming an already volatile situation and making it harder to restore calm," Mr. Boucher went beyond remarks made Friday by President Bush, who merely called on the Israelis to show restraint.
Mr. Boucher repeated the administration's frequent appeal to the Palestinian Authority to take "sustained and credible steps" to arrest those responsible for terrorism. 
But what was perhaps most striking was his strongly worded appeal to Israel to soften its policy toward the Palestinians. "If the situation on the ground is to improve," he said, "then Israel must also take the economic and security steps that are necessary to alleviate the pressure, the hardship and the humiliations of the Palestinian population." 
Mr. Boucher did not spell out what action the United States expected to see. During the 11 months of this Palestinian uprising, Palestinian towns and villages have frequently been virtually shut off from one another by Israeli soldiers. The Israelis say those actions help to prevent terrorist attacks. 
The State Department spokesman also made an unusual and explicit reference today to 20 American citizens who he said were living in the building where Mr. Zubari was killed, but who were not injured.
"We are deeply troubled by the fact that civilians, including more than 20 American citizens, some of whom were children, were living in the building which was attacked," Mr. Boucher said. 
The building housed three Palestinian families whose members have lived extended periods in the United States and also hold American citizenship, residents said. 
The Daas family, which lives on the floor under the office that was attacked, moved to Ramallah three years ago from Springfield, Va., near Washington. The windows of the Daas apartment were blown out. 
Leila Daas, 10, standing on shards of glass that littered her bedroom, said she had been at the bedroom door with her two-year old sister when "I saw fire from my window and I heard big explosions and a lot of breaking glass.
"I started running and screaming," she said. "I was very frightened." 
Leila's father, Abdul Daas, 40, the owner of two restaurant chains in the Washington area and another in the West Bank, said he had returned to Ramallah so his children, born in the United States, would learn Arabic and absorb Palestinian culture. He said he also owned a diner in Anandale, near Washington, whose customers included senators and congressmen. 
A senior State Department official said the language about Israel today was not intended to balance the words of Mr. Bush, who said on Friday: "The Israelis will not negotiate under terrorist threat. It's as simple as that." 
The official insisted that it was the White House, not the State Department, that came up with the word "humiliation" this morning as a way of describing the effects of Israeli actions on the Palestinians.
The official said the term was intended to refer to the Israeli military's roadblocks as well as to the economic pressure that Israel has applied by making it difficult for Palestinians to travel to jobs, and by buying far less Palestinian goods.
No matter the origins of today's statement on the Middle East, it left the impression that the State Department was trying to walk a fine line, balancing Mr. Bush's remarks, which were more supportive of Israel, and some of the wider concerns of American diplomacy in the region.
The administration toughened its tone toward Israel on the same day that senior administration officials met for more than four hours with a senior Israeli military officers and diplomats for a scheduled session on shared security needs. 
The State Department went out of its way to say that the session -- which included Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage; Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, and the deputy national security adviser, Stephen Hadley -- was not timed to coincide with the violence of the last few days. 
The discussion centered on Israel's overall security situation in the region and how the United States can cooperate with Israel to "make sure they can face that properly," an official said. Topics at meeting ranged from the threat to Israel from Iran, Israel's relations with Russia and questions about the defunct peace process, the official said. Such sessions were held in the Clinton administration but are now being handled by more senior officials, Israeli and administration officials said.
Whether the administration officials involved today in the "dialogue" raised the question of Israel using American aircraft and helicopters in their attacks against Palestinians remained unclear. Israel used American-made fighter jets on Sunday in bombing raids on Palestinian security headquarters in three locations in the West Bank and Gaza. 
Arab governments have consistently protested to the administration that the Israeli use of American-supplied weapons against the Palestinians is a breach of American law.
But a senior State Department official said no legal determination had been made on whether the Israelis were breaking the terms of the act under which Israel receives American weaponry. The act says Israel may use F-16 aircraft and Apache helicopters for "legitimate defensive purposes," the official said. 
The administration has declined to say in the last few months whether it has complained to Israel about the use of American weapons in the attacks on Palestinians. "We don't do that in public," one official said, making clear that the administration does not want a public debate on the issue but declining to say whether such concerns were aired in private.
Some Middle East experts have raised the question of how the administration can publicly oppose Israel's policy of "targeted killings" and not oppose the use of American weapons in carrying out those killings. 
If the administration decided to make an issue of the use of American jet fighters in the raids against Palestinians, it was not clear that Congress would support the stand, several experts said.

Study Says Bush Budget Would Tap Social Security
Congressional budget analysts warned that the economic downturn and President Bush's tax-cut package would force the federal government to spend $9 billion from the Social Security surplus this year and billions more over the next three years.
 The report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office was more pessimistic than a projection released last week by the White House, which suggested that while the surplus was shrinking drastically, the government would still avoid using Social Security funds to pay for other programs.

HEADLINE: STUDY IN CONGRESS SEES NEED TO TAP SOCIAL SECURITY 

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 27 

 BODY:
Congressional budget analysts warned in a report made public today that the economic downturn and President Bush's tax-cut package would force the federal government to spend $9 billion from the Social Security surplus this year and billions more over the next three years.
 The report, from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, was more pessimistic than a projection released last week by the White House, which suggested that while the surplus was shrinking quickly, the government could still avoid using Social Security funds to pay for other government programs. 
 The budget office report found that the overall federal budget surplus projected for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30 had dropped to $153 billion, down $122 billion from its estimate in May. The Congressional budget analysts found that the Bush tax-cut package was responsible for about two-thirds of that reduction.
As a result, the report said, $30 billion would have to be taken from the Social Security surplus over three of the next four years to pay for government operations -- $9 billion this fiscal year, $18 billion in 2003 and $3 billion in 2004. A non-Social Security surplus of $2 billion was projected for fiscal year 2002, which would allow the Social Security fund to remain untouched next year. 
The White House predicted last week that there would be no need to tap Social Security at all in Mr. Bush's first term since its projections showed that there would be small federal surpluses, not including Social Security, in each of the next four years: $2 billion this year, $4 billion next year, $2 billion in 2003 and $6 billion in 2004. Those figures cover the same scope of programs as the Congressional accounting.
Over all, however, the budget projections in the White House and Congressional Budget Office reports differ only slightly. Taken together, the reports presage a bitter struggle in Congress this fall as lawmakers complete work on next year's federal budget, with plenty of finger-pointing expected between the White House and Congressional Democrats over who should take responsibility if the government dips into the so-called lockbox of tax revenues paid into Social Security. 
"It is now clear that the president will be raiding Social Security and Medicare trust funds even when he is forecasting strong economic growth," said Senator Kent Conrad, the North Dakota Democrat who is chairman of the Budget Committee. "He's cooked a stew that's going to be very hard for us to choke down."
The Republican speaker of the House, J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, was obviously referring to his Democratic opponents in Congress when he said today that "excessive federal spending" -- not the president's tax-cut package -- was largely to blame for any budget shortfall.
"While some in Washington may want to play politics and fan the flames of rhetorical fear," Mr. Hastert said, "let me be unequivocal that this Congress will work with this president to ensure every dime collected for Social Security" will be spent on Social Security.
Both Mr. Bush and Congressional leaders had vowed not to touch money collected for Social Security, a promise they are now likely to break given the souring economy, the $1.3 trillion tax-cut package passed by Congress at Mr. Bush's urging and the administration's commitment to a sharp increase in spending for the military and education.
The administration's budget director, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., said today that the Congressional Budget Office projections were "essentially identical" to those prepared by the White House, which came close to a concession by the White House that it was prepared to draw on Social Security later this year, if only by a negligible amount.
Mr. Daniels said in a telephone interview with several reporters that Mr. Bush was "serious about trying to quarantine Social Security surpluses" but that "it would be a mistake to shortchange fundamental priorities like defense or education" to prevent any use of Social Security money for other purposes this year.
And he reminded reporters that the overall federal surplus would still be huge this year and next. "We're going to continue to reduce the national debt significantly in all of these years going forward," he said.
In economic terms, it makes little or no difference whether the government spends a few billion dollars of the Social Security surplus in any given year. The surplus in the program is expected to total about $162 billion this year.
For decades, the government routinely spent the entire Social Security surplus to cover shortfalls on other programs, and a decision to resume using the surplus for that purpose would pose no threat to current recipients of Social Security checks.
But the political implications are vast, since both Republicans and Democrats have described the Social Security surplus as a symbolic bulwark against fiscal irresponsibility in Washington and as a vehicle to pay off the national debt. Last year's Republican platform could not have been much more blunt. "The Social Security surplus is off limits, off budget and will not be touched," it said.
Democratic and Republican Party leaders are accusing each other of hypocrisy on the issue, which is threatening to dominate several Congressional races next year, especially in House districts where Social Security recipients dominate the voting rolls.
The chairman of the Republican National Committee, Gov. James S. Gilmore III of Virginia, announced today that the party would begin broadcasting television advertisements to counter Democratic ones that blamed Mr. Bush for the shrinking surplus and accused Republicans of raiding Social Security.
"Sadly, the Democrats are misleading people and attacking President Bush," Mr. Gilmore said. "As a matter of principle, we feel the American people have a right to the truth, which is that President Bush is working hard to rescue our economy, protect Social Security and Medicare and eliminate the national debt."
The Republican National Committee said the advertisements would run indefinitely in selected television markets including Washington, D.C., Missouri and South Dakota. 
There was no surprise in the choice of Missouri, home to the House Democratic leader, Richard A. Gephardt, and South Dakota, home to the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle. The party said it had also established an Internet site, www.protectsocialsecurity.com, to defend the Republican record.
Mr. Gephardt said that the report by Congressional budget analysts showed that the Bush 10-year tax-cut package had created an "alarming fiscal crisis" that was draining away historic budget surpluses. "The numbers don't lie," he said.
Last week, Mr. Bush said that Social Security revenues should be used for other programs only if the government was in a recession or at war. 
The Congressional Budget Office analysts said that the economy should "narrowly" avoid a recession, with growth of about 2.6 percent next year. That compares to the administration's estimate of 3.2 percent, which Democrats describe as inflated and a gimmick meant to camouflage the likelihood of additional drains on Social Security.
"Despite White House denials, the president's tax cut and spending requests -- not new Congressional spending -- are driving the government back into the red," said Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee.
Mr. Spratt said that because Congress had not even begun to consider additional requests from the administration for billions of dollars in spending on a military buildup and on education, the budget projections released today "represent only the beginning of the bad news."

HEADLINE: LIFE'S WORK; 
What's Missing in Paradise?

BYLINE:  By LISA BELKIN; This column about the intersection of jobs and personal lives appears every other week. E-mail: Belkin@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
WHEN we last left Brandon and Jill Lowitz three months ago, they were off to Bali. Frustrated by life in New York (and particularly peeved that they couldn't spare the time for something as simple as lunch together a few times a month), the newlywed couple quit their jobs and headed to the quietest and least expensive place they could find. Their plan -- because even a life spent defying obligation needs a plan -- was to separate themselves from work long enough to figure out who they wanted to be when they grew up.
 Now, just in time for Labor Day, they are back home, with a few thoughts about how work looks to two who stopped doing it, at least for a while. They have lived out our collective fantasy, ditching deadlines and goals, and they are here to report that sometimes a little of each of those things isn't all that bad. 
 Their first surprise was how easily they could leave the world of work behind. Back in New York, Mr. Lowitz was in Internet sales and Ms. Lowitz was in marketing for a fashion designer. Their dinner conversation used to be about her project or his client or the latest skinny on their friends from the office. "We put that away almost from Day 1," Mr. Lowitz said. "We found a slew of other things to talk to each other about." And when they e-mailed those office friends, "I never asked anything about work," he said. "I asked about their families or what they were doing with their lives, but nothing about what was going on with an account."
Going cold turkey was made easier because they were in a part of the world where work is too scarce and too hard to become an identity. In Bali, for instance, they spent days returning again and again to a shop that advertised lessons in Batik dying, but never found anyone around to teach them. Work just wasn't a topic of conversation.
"No one cared what we did for a living," Ms. Lowitz said. "We would tell people we'd both stopped working so we could travel and no one asked what work we had done before. Here, it's the first question. There, they don't even ask."
They carefully explain that they did not miss work, and certainly did not miss working in New York City during the heat of the summer, but they did miss the structure and contrast that work brings. Going to work defines the day, giving it a beginning and an end. It divides work time from play time, and even though we blur and abuse those lines, we are still steadied by the fact that they are there.
"It's strange to wake up in a foreign country and not know what to do for the day, where to eat, what to see, when to see it and how to get there," Mr. Lowitz said. "I can honestly say that if we lived in a society without work, there would be a lot of bored people on the street."
To their surprise, they felt unmoored without the small goals and the miniaccomplishments -- activities as fleeting, but satisfying, as checking a task off a to-do list. They found themselves role-playing professions, declaring Ms. Lowitz to be the professional photographer for their trip and Mr. Lowitz the professional writer. They took these jobs seriously, not wanting to leave a moment of the adventure unrecorded, and Ms. Lowitz discovered a deep creative vein while snapping hundreds of evocative and dreamy black and whites.
Now and again they would catch a glimpse of CNN, so they knew that "the economy back home was heading for the toilet," Mr. Lowitz said. Nonetheless, they didn't think any macro thoughts about their future until they were on their way home three weeks ago. "I miss working," Mr. Lowitz realized when he allowed himself to wonder what he was going to do next. "I miss the interaction with co-workers and clients," he said. "Working is part of the game. We must work to live." 
For the moment he is working part time, as a consultant for his former boss, while fleshing out some business ideas of his own about how the Internet can be applied to the travel industry. Ms. Lowitz is looking for a more artistic type of work, ideally designing a line of shoes or handbags. They are re-entering the work world with the same determination with which they left it. It's time to start saving again for a down payment on an apartment, time to resume living a real life.
"This trip was not to 'find ourselves' or discover who we are," Mr. Lowitz said. "It was to give us a window in both our working and personal lives. Having separated ourselves from the grind will keep us going in the future."

HEADLINE: Writing a Novel in the Deli, Making Revisions in the Bar 

BYLINE:  By MEL GUSSOW

DATELINE: CAMDEN, Me. 

 BODY:
In his five novels, from "Mohawk" through his latest book, "Empire Falls," Richard Russo has proved himself to be an alchemist, transforming the quotidian -- everyday people and seemingly ordinary events -- into the quintessential.
 To the passing stranger, the fictional Empire Falls might look like a ghost town. The textile mill and shirt factory that once made it a thriving Maine community have long since disappeared, leaving a main street of sleepy nonchalance. But as illuminated by Mr. Russo, the town is full of vivid characters and is the embodiment of the dreams and disappointments of its citizens and, on a metaphorical level, of the country they live in. 
 With "Empire Falls," Mr. Russo moves from New York State, the setting of "Mohawk" and "Nobody's Fool" (a novel that became a Paul Newman film), to Maine. That route follows the author's own journey. Born in Johnstown, N.Y., 52 years ago, he grew up in nearby Gloversville. For five years he has lived here in Camden, a picture-perfect, harborside community, the antithesis of Empire Falls, which, he says, is closer to such inland Maine towns as Lewiston, Madison and Skowhegan. 
For many years, Camden has been a home for writers, painters and photographers, and now Rick Russo is the most notable resident artist. As unpretentious as any of his principal characters, he is a familiar figure on Camden streets.
The unofficial Russo tour of the city begins at the Camden Deli, a small cafe where every morning he sits at a corner table and writes in a composition book. Before lunch he moves to Fitzpatrick's bar and grill near the pier, and revises what he has written that morning or on previous days. Around the corner from Fitzpatrick's is the Owl and Turtle Bookshop, where signed copies of "Empire Falls" have been selling briskly since the book's publication.
Later in the afternoon he returns home and puts his revisions on a computer. This is a routine he follows like a ritual. Having previously written in college cafeterias in stolen hours between teaching classes, he finds a kind of aesthetic tranquillity amid the tumult of daily life. When Mr. Russo is writing in a public place, people don't bother him, at least "not more than once." And "if the phone rings, it's not for me."
One Sunday morning he altered his schedule to sit in the sunroom of his home (where he lives with his wife and their two daughters) and talk about himself and his work. Asked how much one would know about his life from reading his novels, he said, "There are things in my novels that are very autobiographical and there are things that are just wholly imagined." With a typically hearty laugh, he added, "And I'm probably not going to tell you which is which."
Undeniably he knows the territory from personal experience. Aspects of Mr. Russo and his late father, James (a decorated war hero and a plumber), run through all the books. Jimmy Russo is there in Sam Hall in "The Risk Pool"; as Sully, the character played by Mr. Newman in "Nobody's Fool"; and in Max Roby, an unemployed house painter and the father of the protagonist, Miles Roby, in "Empire Falls." They all have, he said, a certain "roguish, rakish quality." Mr. Newman already has his eye on playing Max if a movie or a mini-series is made from "Empire Falls," Mr. Russo said.
"There's a certain spirit to my father that I tend to capture in various guises," Mr. Russo said. "He was one of the most generous men I've ever known about any kind of unenforceable obligation" to a friend or an acquaintance. "My father wasn't good at enforceable obligations, like husband to wife. As soon as you told him he had do something, that was the end of that."
His parents were divorced when he was in high school and he and his father became closer over the years. When he was home on vacation from college, he joined his father on the job as a laborer and also hung out with him at local bars: "One of the hard lessons I've learned in my life with my father and any number of people is that you can't really ask them to do what they're not designed to do. You can only fiddle with their software."
He found that he enjoyed the working-class life. "Sitting on a stool at a bar next to my father, listening to his stories," he said, "I was beginning to know all the people that he knew and have affection and respect for them as he did. There were times when I could imagine doing that for the rest of my life." Eventually those times and the people he met were transformed into his art.
Rick Russo himself is present in many characters in his novels, most particularly in Miles Roby in "Empire Falls" and in Miles's devotion to his teenage daughter. Although he once wanted to be a college professor, he has settled for a life as the manager of the Empire Grill, with the futile hope that he may eventually own the restaurant.
A classic underachiever, Miles is also a good man and a figure of some nobility. "One of the reasons I think he is heroic," Mr. Russo said, "is that in an age of whiners, he is not a whiner. He's made his choices. As much as he would like to blame circumstances for things that did not work out, he's much more likely to blame himself. He's been a grown-up for a very long time."
Mr. Russo said the book was inspired by two visual images. The first was a van that he saw that had "The Silver Fox" stenciled on it. That inscription brought to life the character of Walt Comeau, a small-town braggart who has run off with Miles's wife but remains an ostentatious regular in the Empire Grill. The other image was of Mr. Russo's younger daughter, Kate, leaving for school carrying a heavy backpack, a young woman "with too much weight to bear." Kate was the model for Miles's daughter, Tick, who is at the heart of the novel.
"Writing this book I had a sense that my own truest destiny is as a father of my daughters," he said. "I couldn't have brought that to life in Miles if I didn't feel it so deeply."
As a novelist Mr. Russo was a late starter, although in common with his father and his grandfather, he has always been a storyteller. He did not begin writing until he was nearly 30, and then largely as a distraction from finishing his doctoral dissertation at the University of Arizona. His subject was the early American novelist Charles Brockden Brown. He thought that the graduate students in creative writing were having much more fun than he was. So he wrote a short story and then took classes in fiction writing.
Several semesters and at least one published story later, he decided he had "a novelist's temperament: my imagination goes outward." He wrote a novel, about a bitter middle-aged woman in Arizona, and showed it to a professor who said that only one part of the book came to life, a flashback to a small town back East.
"I was trying to become a worldly and sophisticated young man and to distance myself from my parochial past," Mr. Russo said. The professor's remark was "a horrible blow," but he realized that it was also the truth and that he had "about 100 stories about people I knew unlike this imaginary woman."
"Nobody leaps into the air from the air," he continued. "We all leap into the air from something solid," in his case, his small-town past. He discarded the first novel, "destroying the evidence," and began writing "Mohawk," about people in a place like Gloversville, and he purged all literary pretension from his writing.
Nevertheless, "Mohawk" was rejected by a score of publishers before it was printed as an original Vintage paperback. It was followed by "The Risk Pool," which paralleled the story of Russo, father and son, and was dedicated to James Russo. His next book, "Nobody's Fool," with the charming Sully at the center, became a turning point with the release of the Robert Benton film (starring Mr. Newman). After an academic comedy, "Straight Man," Mr. Russo moved on to "Empire Falls."
Although the environment -- the bleakness of the former mill town -- is important, the author thinks of the book as more about class than about place. "People often confuse the two," he said, "but what strikes readers as place is very often closer to class, to the rhythms of a life."
It wasn't until he was more than halfway through the novel that he decided to give greater prominence to the mill owner, C. B. Whiting, introducing him and his family in a prologue. Whiting became the Russo equivalent of an F. Scott Fitzgerald character, "a man who believes the past can be outrun, that the self can be reinvented to achieve an effect."
That sense of reinvention is pervasive in the novel and in the author's life. Last year, in a commencement address at the Penn State campus in Altoona, he told the graduates that education was like "entering the witness-protection program -- you come out a different person with a different identity, and that's all part of the American dream."
For him, "Empire Falls" is a major step ahead. "It challenged me to do some things I had never done before," he said. "It forced me to think about history and myth and to do more research. I really had to understand what was behind those mill closings. That doesn't mean that I won't depend on my life as a primary source of material, but I have to expand into the world if my work is to have relevance."
In an essay, he wrote about his annual autumn climb with his daughters up Mount Megunticook in Maine. Sitting on a mountaintop looking at Camden and its harbor, he came to the conclusion that "a middle-aged man with two smart, beautiful college-bound daughters just might -- despite his hereditary inclinations -- find himself guilty of optimism."

HEADLINE: Canada Cuts A Key Rate By 0.25 Point 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON

DATELINE: TORONTO, Aug. 28 

 BODY:
Signaling a more pessimistic outlook for the Canadian economy, the Bank of Canada cut its leading short-term interest rate today by one-quarter of a percentage point, to 4 percent.
 The bank, which has eased monetary policy less aggressively than the United States Federal Reserve so far this year, said data released since the last rate reduction in mid-July "suggest that the pace of growth of the Canadian economy has been slower than expected." 
 It said weakness in the United States economy, especially in capital spending, was partly to blame. The United States accounts for about four-fifths of Canada's exports, and American companies are among the biggest investors in Canada. The bank also pointed to slowing economic growth outside North America. 
The surprise in the central bank's statement, however, was an acknowledgment that the adjustment of inventories by Canadian businesses, especially in the telecommunications manufacturing sector, "is not as far advanced as had been expected."
As a result, the bank now expects economic growth in the third and fourth quarters of this year to be "below potential, resulting in a lower level of activity than earlier expected."
Robert Palombi, an economist at Standard & Poor's MMS in Toronto, said the implication was that "we probably won't eliminate excess capacity until some time towards the second half of next year."
The Bank of Canada has up to now taken a relatively upbeat view of domestic prospects, based on tax cuts earlier this year, a strong oil and gas sector and a softening Canadian dollar.
David Dodge, the bank's governor, predicted as recently as Aug. 1 that the economy would begin to strengthen in the second half of this year, and pick up further in 2002. In keeping with this optimistic assessment, the Bank of Canada has lowered its target for the overnight interest rate by only 1.75 percentage points so far this year, compared with a three percentage point reduction in the United States federal funds rate.
Economists in Canada have, however, recently begun lowering their growth forecasts. "There is a strong case to be made that the outperformance of the Canadian economy relative to its United States counterpart -- which has prevented the Bank of Canada from matching the Fed's rate cuts tit for tat -- has now run its course," Toronto-Dominion Bank said in an economic commentary.
Data on economic growth for the second quarter is due to be released Friday. Mr. Palombi expects the second-quarter increase in gross domestic product to be 1.4 percent, compared with 2.5 percent in the previous three months.

HEADLINE: Big Lotteries' Real Losers 

 BODY:
The economy may be slowing, but Americans still seem to have plenty of money for gambling. During the two months leading up to this week's drawing for the multistate Powerball game's $295 million jackpot, 600 million tickets were sold and New Yorkers clogged the highways in search of a Powerball connection in Connecticut. 
 Powerball sales this year are running 40 percent ahead of last year. They are the premier example of the national trend toward bigger prizes and more gambling venues. Yesterday the Big Game, another multistate lottery, drew numbers for a prize worth $90 million. States are racing to get out in front of the casino-building stampede that threatens to turn the nation into one large Las Vegas. Those that feel they are falling behind fret that their residents' gambling dollars are going to out-of-state casinos when they should be betting at home. 
 New York already has an array of lottery games, along with horse racing and casino gambling on Indian reservations near the Canadian border. But the State Legislature is considering joining the Powerball consortium. And Gov. George Pataki has been quietly lobbying for casinos in western New York and video lottery terminals at racetracks.
Gambling expansionists universally support betting in moderation only. But both the national gaming expansion and the lottery mania depend on repeat players for their growing success. Lotteries have collectively taken the name "the fool's tax" because the odds of winning are so small. The biggest players are disproportionately poor and uneducated. Everyone has heard the story about the unemployed ex-convict in need of back surgery who suddenly struck it rich on Powerball. For countless others facing financial straits, money squandered on losing tickets just made matters worse.
The top 20 percent of players, who spend an average of more than $4 on tickets each day, account for more than 80 percent of all sales. They are almost twice as likely as the average adult both to have dropped out of high school and to have a household income under $10,000. Surveys show that the higher the household income, the fewer the dollars spent annually on lottery tickets.
Lottery organizers have learned to exploit the weaknesses of their clientele. Over time, they found out that reducing the chance of winning could actually boost ticket sales. The lower the odds of winning, the more the jackpots go unclaimed and roll over into a bigger grand prize. And a few big jackpots sell many more tickets than weeks' worth of small jackpots. Powerball lowered the odds of winning its jackpot from 1 in 55 million to 1 in 80 million in 1997, and the Big Game narrowed the chances of a big payoff from 1 in 53 million to 1 in 76 million in 1999. Sales have accelerated. In the three-day window between its last winnerless drawing and the weekend's big jackpot, Powerball sold 204 million tickets.
Worse odds have failed to dampen players' enthusiasm, any more than the slowing economy has. Most people gamble for a fantasy -- the chance to walk around with a lottery ticket in your pocket, mentally spending the big jackpot. Changes in infinitesimal odds make little difference to them. But the die-hard players who buy tickets in bulk aren't gaining any extra entertainment value. In New York State, as many as one in every 11 players is a compulsive gambler feeding an addiction. The last thing they need is more places to bet, or bigger prizes to pursue hopelessly.

HEADLINE: Better Protection for Farmers and Their Land 

BYLINE:  By Ron Kind and Wayne Gilchrest; Ron Kind, Democrat of Wisconsin, and Wayne Gilchrest, Republican of Maryland, are members of the House of Representatives.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression, President Franklin Roosevelt signed legislation to help stabilize and protect American agriculture. Farmers were being battered by low commodity prices and erratic markets, and at the same time, land was showing damage from past abuses, like the poor tilling practices that contributed to the devastating Dust Bowl.
 That legislation, the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, recognized the crucial role of farming in our economy -- an importance that endures today, when far fewer Americans are farmers. The law was the nation's first attempt to stabilize commodity markets by propping up falling prices and by offering farmers an economic incentive to hold down their production. It was also a first attempt to help farmers be good stewards of their land. At Roosevelt's request, Congress set aside significant funds to help farmers improve soil and water quality. 
 It is in this progressive tradition that we have introduced legislation to restore conservation to the important place in the farm bill that it had in Roosevelt's day. In addition to providing an equitable distribution of federal assistance payments to small agricultural producers, our proposal would also work to protect wildlife habitat, reduce sprawl onto agricultural land, and improve air and water quality.
More than 900 million acres of the United States are now farmland. The benefits America gets from this land are far-reaching, but the responsibility of its stewardship lies in the hands of only 2 percent of the population. Farmers not only provide our nation's food and fiber, but, because they control so much land, have a key role to play in preserving the quality of water supplies, which can be degraded by unwise use of pesticides and by soil runoff; restoring wetlands to reduce flooding; protecting wildlife habitat; and providing open spaces.
Many American farmers have been good long-term stewards of their land. They cultivate and harvest crops in ways that preserve the fertility of soil and keep it from eroding, use water without overtaxing the supply, and preserve woods and streams on their land. But with their continual struggle just to make ends meet, farmers are under pressure to use their land in ways that give them the largest possible income. They need financial assistance if they are to help protect or restore the natural environment.
Current federal farm programs provide some financing for voluntary conservation programs -- paying farmers, for example, to let fields revert to wetlands for wildlife habitat, or to let strips of grass grow along the shores of streams to prevent sediment from flowing into them. But the funds, about $2 billion a year, fall far short of demand; three out of four farmers who apply to participate are turned away.
The current, commodity-based payments system to support agriculture, which rewards mass production of selected crops, actually fails a majority of our nation's agricultural producers. The farm bill that controls this system has come up for renewal every five years, and the one now in effect, passed in 1996, was promoted as designed to reduce farmers' dependence on federal support payments by unleashing the benefits of free-market forces. Despite its attempt to phase out many traditional commodity payment programs, the legislation ultimately did little to change an inherently skewed system that disproportionately rewards a minority of large-scale producers over the majority, which are small family farms. Currently, three-fourths of all farm program funding goes to fewer than one-third of our producers. Most who receive these payments are in 15 heavily agricultural states.
Small and mid-size farmers -- those with great incentive to preserve land, because their farms have often been handed down for generations in their families -- are at an economic disadvantage because their production is small. The incentives of the farm support system also contribute to overproduction, which keeps prices low and farm income down.
Despite the annual influx of billions of federal dollars to the farm sector, the Department of Agriculture reports that the number of farms has been declining about 1 percent (20,000 farms) each year for the past 20 years. The current system is simply failing the vast majority of our nation's farmers, ranchers and foresters, while at the same time it does too little to protect and improve the natural environment.
This year's farm bill presents an opportunity to do more not just for agricultural producers, but also for consumers and society at large. Our bill would shift $2 billion from commodity payments to payments for participation in voluntary conservation programs. This lets us assist the family farmers who have lost ground under the current system while we use taxpayer dollars more sensibly to protect natural resources and environmental quality. If we don't do this, many of the nation's rivers and lakes will remain polluted, hundreds of species will fall closer to extinction, and millions of acres of open space will be lost forever as small farmers go out of business and their land is sold for development.
We're pleased that our legislation is gaining broad bipartisan support among our colleagues in Congress. We believe that this farm bill, if done right, can help all farmers in all regions of the country and become the great conservation bill of the 21st century.

Consumer confidence fell in August to the lowest level in four months, a survey showed today, suggesting that the economy may struggle to rebound after a yearlong period of the weakest growth in a decade.
 The survey, compiled by the Conference Board from a sampling of 5,000 households, dropped to an index reading of 114.3 from 116.3 in July. August's level was the lowest since a reading of 109.9 in April and reflected a decline in optimism about the state of the economy. 
 Job cuts were a major concern -- something that in coming months may restrain consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the economy.
Mitch Stapley, a money manager in Grand Rapids, Mich., said, "The consumer is the last finger hanging on the edge of the cliff, and if we lose him," he said, the economy could slip into recession. 
The component of the confidence index that tracks consumers' current situation fell to 145.8, from 151.3 in July, its lowest level since April 1997.
But a gauge of consumers' expectations for the next six months rose to 93.3 from 92.9.
The Treasury is more than halfway through the mailing of $300 and $600 tax rebates, but that has not done much to shore up confidence. As of last Friday, it had sent out about 49 million checks with a combined value of almost $21 billion. While that may give consumers reason to keep spending, by some reckonings, joblessness is a cause of concern, with new rounds of job-cut announcements restraining optimism.
The economy lost 259,000 jobs in the last four months, and manufacturing employment has not increased over the last year, Labor Department statistics showed. The national unemployment rate was 4.5 percent in July.
The percentage of those responding who considered jobs hard to obtain rose to 15.9 percent from 13.9 percent in July, the highest since 16.4 percent in January 1998.
Yet the share of those expecting more jobs to become available increased to 16 percent from 15 percent in July.
The share of those planning to buy a home held at 3.8 percent. The percentage intending to buy a car fell to 7.8 percent from 9.4 percent. And the share planning to buy a major appliance held at 31.3 percent.

Shares Slide After Report That Consumer Confidence Fell

BYLINE:  By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks slumped yesterday after a crucial gauge of consumer confidence declined, stoking fears that Americans would close their wallets and deprive the sluggish economy of one of its main props.
 "People have been spending," said Jon Brorson, director of equities at Northern Trust. That has been "the glue holding the economy together," he said. 
 "Should you get cracks in that, I think that's disturbing for the recovery and for earnings," he added. 
Consumer confidence dropped unexpectedly in August to its lowest level in four months as a weakening job market weighed on consumers. This threatens to undermine retail spending, one of the few pockets of strength in the economy. 
"If consumer confidence gets shaken, then consumer spending may slow, and that's another big negative for the market," said William Rutherford, chief executive of Rutherford Investment Management, which oversees $100 million.
All eyes will now be on today's first revision in the gross domestic product data for the second quarter, which will show whether the economy grew or shrank.
"It will probably reinforce the notion that we are headed into a recession," said Uma Rajeshwar, first vice president at the Glenmede Trust Company, which manages $17 billion. "It will be revised down. That seems to be the consensus opinion."
The Dow Jones industrial average slid 160.32 points, or 1.5 percent, to close at 10,222.03, as 28 of its 30 components fell. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 17.70 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,161.51, and the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index sank 47.43 points, or 2.5 percent, to 1,864.98.
So far this year, the Nasdaq is down 24.9 percent, the Dow off 5.2 percent and the S.& P. 500 is down 12 percent.
Trading was light, with many traders vacationing ahead of the long Labor Day weekend. About 980 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Nasdaq was dragged down by big technology names like Sun Microsystems, the network computer maker. Sun fell after the investment bank Goldman, Sachs cut its profit expectations for the company, saying economic weakness would take its toll. Sun fell 94 cents, to $13.56.
The market's slide compounded Monday's losses as investors bet that Friday's rally would fizzle like other advances this year amid dwindling corporate profits and the sluggish economy. The Nasdaq rose more than 4 percent Friday after Cisco Systems, the maker of equipment for the World Wide Web, said business was stabilizing and strong new-home sales showed that consumers were still holding up a crucial sector.
But Wall Street was shaken yesterday after the Conference Board, a private New York research firm, reported that its consumer confidence index fell to 114.3 in August -- well below the expectations for a reading of 117.0 -- from July's revised 116.3.
The drop in confidence came despite a fiscal stimulus to consumers in the form of tax rebates, which economists had thought would bolster the index. One bright spot was that the report's expectations index, which gauges consumers' outlook for the next six months, edged up to 93.3 in August from 92.9.
The three major equity indexes are again at crucial technical "support" levels. These are areas where buyers have emerged in the past to purchase stocks, so a serious breach of those could snowball into more selling.
Investors snapped up the telecommunications equipment maker Lucent Technologies. Lucent rose 27 cents, to $7.60. Lucent said it closed its Israeli unit Chromatis Networks.
Intel, the maker of computer chips, said it still expected a seasonal improvement in demand in the second half of the year, and its stock rose briefly. But Intel, which is a Dow component, closed down 64 cents, at $28.51. --------------------

Treasury Prices Increase
By Bloomberg News
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday as an unexpected drop in consumer confidence fueled expectations for an eighth interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve this year.
There are "tax rebates, lower gas prices and mortgage rates, yet people are more blase and blue," said Jim Claire, director of bond trading at the Evergreen Investment Management Company in Charlotte, N.C. "Something else is underlying sentiment, like corporate profits or layoffs," he said. 
The 10-year Treasury note rose 23/32 , to a price of 101 9/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.84 percent from 4.93 percent on Monday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 27/32 , to 99 17/32 . The bond's yield fell to 5.41 percent from 5.47 percent on Monday.

Declaring a Recession: Precision Is Not Optional

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
When is a recession a recession?
 Officially, the Business Cycle Dating Committee, a group of eminent economists, determines when a slump has turned into a recession. But a rule of thumb is two consecutive quarters of economic contraction, and that has proved to be a pretty good barometer. 
 So the Commerce Department's report today on the initial revision in gross domestic product figures for the second quarter could start a recession buzz. The consensus of analysts is for zero growth, and a slight decline is considered possible. 
A decline in the G.D.P., the nation's output of goods and services and a broad measure of economic health, would follow a downbeat report yesterday that consumer confidence dropped to a four-month low in August.
Americans have not experienced even a single quarter of contraction in the total economy since early in 1993 (and then a dip of just 0.1 percent). The last recession, as economists define it, ended in 1991.
The few economists already out on a limb predicting a recession may begin to feel a little less lonely.
But in Cambridge, Mass., the dating committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research is unlikely to do anything right away. The economic pot may be cooling, but it has to be cold before the group signs a certificate of recession.
"The data continue to suggest that the only substantial declines in real activity in the U.S. economy are in manufacturing," the committee said on Aug. 3, in its most recent posting on the economic research bureau's Web site. "Broader aggregates, such as employment and real personal income, have not fallen significantly or at all."
Robert E. Hall, a professor of economics at Stanford University and the chairman of the committee, said in an e-mail message that a new memo would be issued next week after the release of employment data for August. But, he said, "I don't know which way things will change relative to the August version."
The tone of the group's Web site postings, begun in March in response to many inquiries about the committee's work, has varied with economic conditions and the response of the news media. In April, Mr. Hall concluded, "Again, nothing in the data is yet anywhere close to the point that the bureau would investigate whether a peak occurred in late 2000."
In May, the group said, "The data normally considered by the committee indicate the possibility that a recession began recently, but the economy has not declined nearly enough to merit a meeting of the committee or the determination of a peak date."
The recent memo dropped the "possibility" language and concluded that the economic decline so far was just not broad enough to warrant a determination that a recession had begun.
Mr. Hall acknowledged that a flurry of questions followed its suggestion that a recession might have begun. Consequently, he said, "the committee adopted the policy of not making any statement about whether or not a recession had started, but only to report and comment on the data that will ultimately go into the decision."
The six economists on the dating committee take a dim view of rushing to declare a peak or a trough in any economic cycle. "The committee does not determine the start or end of a recession until it has at least six months of data beyond the peak date, and often even more time is required to make the determination," its memo said.
Indeed, on April 25, 1991, the committee officially declared that the last recession had begun in July 1990. But the April announcement, it turned out, came a month after the recession had formally ended.
Yet the group has good reason for being slow and sure: The outlook can change, and data can be revised. "In January and February, I thought a recession was all but inevitable," said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. Now, he said, business inventories are diminishing and consumer expectations of future business conditions are improving even if confidence about current conditions fell in August. "I think the recovery is imminent," he said, adding he thought that the economy would skirt a formal recession.
If the revised data on the gross domestic product indeed show a contraction in the second quarter, academics will make the point that as they see it, two consecutive quarters of decline do not a recession make.
Rather, the dating committee's memo states, "a recession is a period of significant decline in total output, income, employment and trade, usually lasting from six months to a year, and marked by widespread contractions in many sectors of the economy."
In fact, the recession of 1980, which ran from January to July, originally had just one quarter of decline -- a 9.4 percent plunge in output at an annual rate in the second quarter of the year.
And the dating committee declared that a recession had begun in June 1980, even before the six months were up. In the third quarter, the initial reading showed annual growth of 0.9 percent. That quarter was considered positive until 1996, when the Commerce Department made benchmark revisions in the G.D.P. figures. The data now show two quarters of decline in 1980 -- a sharp drop of 7.9 percent, followed by a 0.6 percent contraction.
The recession of 1990-91 did not fool the dating committee, either. Based on initial data, there had been two quarters of decline, with output shrinking at a rate of 1.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 1990 and 2.9 percent in the first quarter of 1991. The third quarter of 1990 initially showed growth of 1.6 percent. The committee, though it appears to be cautious, declared July 1990 as the beginning of the recession even when data showed growth in the quarter beginning that month.
By July 1992, the data showed that economic output had actually declined by 1.6 percent that quarter.
The committee does not use quarterly G.D.P. data in determining peaks and troughs in the economy, in part because of all the revisions. It instead makes determinations by the month.
According to the Web site, the committee uses four crucial barometers to determine if the economy has reached a peak, and will look at other data. The main measure is employment, based on nonfarm payrolls. The second is industrial production. The third is personal income minus government transfer payments, including welfare, and the fourth is manufacturing and trade revenue.
Comparing the current state of these economic indicators with their performance in 1990-91 shows why the dating committee has still not convened a meeting. Of the four indicators, only industrial production has fallen sharply, down 4.2 percent since September 2000. In the period a decade earlier, industrial production reached a peak in September 1990, two months after the recession officially began, and hit a bottom in March 1991. It plunged 4.6 percent. 
Employment now has been declining for just four months, falling 0.2 percent since March to July's figure of 4.5 percent nationwide.
A decade ago, nonfarm employment reached a peak in June 1990, one month before the official start of the recession, and hit bottom in May 1991, two months after the official end. Over all, it declined 1.6 percent. July was picked as the beginning of the 1990-91 recession to adjust for the different peaks in employment and industrial production. 
Manufacturing and trade sales have actually risen in recent months and are off just 0.6 percent since August 2000, according to the Conference Board, which is estimating monthly figures while the government is redefining the industry classifications used in the data.
In the 1990-91 period, manufacturing and trade sales reached a peak in August 1990 and a bottom in January 1991, dropping 5.1 percent.
And personal income is still rising. A decade ago, it hit a peak in June 1990 and a bottom in February 1991, falling 2.6 percent. 

CORRECTION-DATE: August 30, 2001

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about the dating of recessions connected two statistics incorrectly in discussing jobs in the United States. While total employment has declined 0.2 percent since March, it has not fallen to 4.5 percent. The 4.5 percent figure is the unemployment rate, which has risen from 4.3 percent in March.

HEADLINE: Xerox Chief Offers Upbeat Assessment 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Aug. 28 

 BODY:
The Xerox Corporation offered an upbeat assessment today of its efforts to reorganize, but faced questions from skeptical shareholders. 
 The company, based in Stamford, still expects to return to profitability in the fourth quarter, the chief executive, Anne M. Mulcahy, told the annual shareholder meeting. 
 "So far, we've met our commitments," she said. "We're putting our operations on a sound and disciplined footing. And we're doing all this without mortgaging our future." 
Xerox has struggled with stiff competition, a botched sales force reorganization, sluggish sales, credit-rating downgrades and a sharp drop in its stock price that has begun to rebound in recent months. The company last month reported a second quarter loss of $281 million. 
Xerox had hoped to return to profitability in the third quarter, but pushed that forecast to the fourth quarter because of weakened economic conditions. The consensus forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call is that Xerox will post a loss of 8 cents a share in the third quarter and a profit of 13 cents a share in the last three months of the year. 
Next week, Xerox plans to introduce FutureColor, a large color digital printer the company hopes will become an engine of growth.

HEADLINE: East Takes Center Stage as Yale Focuses on China 

BYLINE:  By YILU ZHAO

 BODY:
When the 1,300 Yale seniors assembled in the university's ornate Woolsey Hall for their graduation this year, they did not hear a speech about the moral quandaries facing their generation or the responsibilities they shoulder as Americans. They heard a speech about China. 
 It was hardly a surprise at the Ivy League institution, where a fascination with China dates to the 1850's and where one of the most popular classes is a course in modern Chinese history taught by Jonathan Spence. 
 In 1854, the school offered a bachelor's degree to Yung Wing, the first Chinese native to graduate from any American college. "He flew on the wings of the wind. His hat went off; his queue burst from the pins and streamed out behind him," a classmate wrote, describing Mr. Yung in a football game. 
In the following decades, dozens, if not hundreds, of Yale men traveled to China to spread the word about Christianity, including the father of Henry Luce, the founder of Time magazine who had a lifelong interest in China. In 1901, a missionary project called Yale-in-China was founded that would later build a teaching hospital and a middle school in China's province of Hunan.
Today, Yale is even more involved with China, with programs including AIDS education in Hunan and a waterfront revival project in Shanghai, though the impetus is less missionary than Yale's intention to become a truly global university. 
Why China? 
"China matters because one-fifth of the world population lives there," Yale's president, Richard C. Levin, said in his graduation speech.
And China, says Jeffrey Garten, the dean of the Yale School of Management, is "the second most important country in the world."
"To work with China is a conscious decision at Yale," said Mr. Garten. "Over the next decade, China is going to be a major player in the world economy. Whatever happens in China will have a big impact on the rest of the world, and we obviously want to be involved." 
Harvard, the University of California at Berkeley and Columbia all have programs in Chinese studies and have sponsored research trips to the country, but few universities have been involved as directly in China as Yale.
Yale Law School has started a China Law Center, which conducts workshops for Chinese legislators and legal scholars in hopes of helping to establish more equitable laws.
For six years, the Yale School of Nursing has conducted AIDS education in Hunan, training nursing instructors who teach about AIDS and H.I.V. According to the Chinese Ministry of Health, there has been a rapid increase in the number of people who are H.I.V.-positive. 
And professors at the management school are trying to bring together members of the Securities and Exchange Commission and their Chinese counterparts to talk about the expanding Chinese stock market.
Yale has not stopped dispatching its college graduates to China either. Through the Yale-China program, a cultural and academic exchange whose precursor is Yale-in-China, dozens of recent graduates have spent years in China teaching English and spreading information about American culture.
At Yale in the last academic year, 312 people from mainland China made up the largest number of foreign students. While most study science at the graduate level, a few high school seniors are admitted each year on full financial aid. Many, who come to the United States as teenagers, see their lives transformed.
"My life is now filled with new ideas, new people and new experiences," said Qinan Tang, a junior.
But courting China, a nation with a rich history that was subject to colonial occupation from 1840 to 1945, is harder than transforming lives. The Chinese are suspicious of Westerners, and the relations between their government and the Unites States has often been hostile.
"Being based in a university has a lot of advantages," said Paul Gewirtz, director of the law center. "It disconnects us from the ups and downs of the relationship between governments." The April spy plane incident, for example, did not hamper Yale's relations with China. Perhaps, Mr. Gewirtz said, an exchange with scholars appears less threatening to the Chinese than one with the government. And Mr. Gewirtz is very attuned to Chinese sensitivities. He tries to make sure that the seminars for Chinese legislators and scholars are not sermons. 
So far, Mr. Gewirtz and his Yale law colleagues say they are seeing positive results. On a visit to Beijing in July, his group was invited to a reception at the Great Hall of the People (usually reserved for national leaders) and later discussed Western licensing laws -- regarding government regulations -- with its host, the Office of Legislative Affairs. 
This month, Mr. Gewirtz was visited by Chen Guangzhong, a Chinese scholar on criminal law and a main architect of the widely applauded 1996 Chinese criminal procedure law guaranteeing many defendants' rights. Mr. Chen and his fellow scholars explored the exclusion of illegally seized evidence and the right to silence during a police interrogation at law center workshops. 
On another front, Wang Honghong, a Hunan nursing teacher who attended Yale's AIDS workshops in her home province, said she learned about handling the side effects of AIDS treatment and reducing chances of transmission from mothers to babies.
Some Yale officials say that China is not the only party that may change because of this liaison. "In the long run, I think China will have more influence on Yale than the other way around," said Nancy Chapman, director of the Yale-China Association. 
"The fact there are hundreds of Chinese students present on campus has transformed the university. And the Chinese values and culture certainly lead Yale people to question their own assumptions."

Israeli Forces Take Over Arab Area in West Bank
Israeli tanks and soldiers took control of parts of Beit Jala, a Palestinian town south of Jerusalem. Israel called the operation necessary to protect its citizens. Palestinian officials denounced it as a "reoccupation" of areas supposedly under their control. It was the first time Israel had entered a Palestinian-ruled zone for an indefinite stay. A Palestinian security officer was killed and more than six Palestinians were wounded. A1

The Bush administration urged Israel to withdraw and called on the Palestinians to stop shootings and attacks from Beit Jala on Gilo, on the southern edge of Jerusalem. A10

U.S.-British Attack on Iraq
American and British warplanes attacked two military command posts in southern Iraq. It was the latest effort to debilitate Iraq's increasingly aggressive air defense system. Officials asserted that the attack had nothing to do with the loss of an American reconnaissance plane near Basra the day before. A10

U.S. Wary of a U.N. Agenda
The Bush administration is engaged in a strenuous effort to influence the agenda of a special United Nations conference next month on the rights of children so that the session's final declaration does not appear to lend support for abortion counseling, American and United Nations officials said. State Department officials said that no matter what might occur in ongoing negotiations, the administration was not considering boycotting the session. A11

More NATO Arms Collections
Hundreds of ethnic Albanian fighters lined up to hand in their weapons to NATO troops at a rebel training camp in Brodec, a village in western Macedonia. It was the second day of NATO's weapons collection operation and, without a hitch, several hundred more weapons, including three ground-to-air missiles, were consigned for destruction. A6

Belarus Chief Rails at West
Belarus's authoritarian president, Aleksandr Lukashenko, reacting to fresh accusations that his secret police had ordered two critics killed, accused the West of financing a campaign of lies "to poison the people" before presidential elections set for next month. A5

Economists Say Surplus Faces Greater Pressure
New budget projections from Congressional analysts and the White House show that the Bush administration is almost certain to have to dip into the Social Security surplus to pay the government's bills, prominent economists said. And because Congressional analysts may base projections only on current spending, their report does not factor in further big spending increases that would accompany plans for a national missile-defense system and a Medicare prescription drug benefit.

The National Transportation Safety Board said a 1999 New Orleans bus crash that killed 22 women had resulted from the driver's poor health and the failure of the doctors who had examined him to try to take him off the road. The board recommended tighter standards for medical exams that bus and truck drivers must pass every two years and for procedures to help employers find out about applicants' drug problems. A16

DNA Leads to New Suspect
Oklahoma investigators said DNA evidence, which exonerated Jeffrey Pierce after he spent 15 years in prison on a rape conviction, had led them to another man serving time for rape and burglary. They did not identify the inmate and said he might not be charged because the seven-year statute of limitations had expired in the 1985 rape case. A12

Charges in Pilots' Deaths
Frank Brady, 50, of Redwood City, Calif., was arrested on suspicion of murder in the deaths of two pilots whose firefighting planes collided over a wildfire. Officials said they were investigating whether Mr. Brady and Richard Mortensen, 43, of San Pablo, who was being held on previous warrants, were running an illegal drug lab where the fire began. A18

HEADLINE: Diverging Views About Policing, Race Policy, Taxes and Education 

 BODY:
 Following are excerpts from yesterday's debate of the Democratic candidates for mayor, as recorded for The New York Times. The debate was organized by the New York City Campaign Finance Board for candidates who receive public money, and was sponsored by WPIX-TV (Channel 11), WNYC-AM Radio (820) and Newsday. It was moderated by Kaity Tong, co-anchor of "WB11 News at 10." The candidates were questioned by Brian Lehrer, host of WNYC's "On the Line"; Les Payne, deputy managing editor at Newsday; and Jim Watkins, co-anchor of "WB11 News at 10."

Q. Let's say just hypothetically the squeegee men think that with the Giuliani administration gone, for them the coast is clear. Please tell us the steps you would take.

FERNANDO FERRER: A Ferrer administration wouldn't give squeegee guys or aggressive panhandlers any reason to believe that they can harass or aggressively panhandle any New Yorker. . . . One of the important aspects of quality of living in this city is a city that preserves and protects everyone's individual sense of safety and security. But having said that, we also need a Police Department that inspires the trust, confidence, support and respect of every New Yorker. A police commissioner who has a sense of balance about those things, who will continue to bring down crime but also bring down those negative contacts between people and the police that serves them.

MARK GREEN: If there's an uptick in some intersection that some so-called squeegee men are back, it's not the hardest thing to invest officers in that corner to stop it. What is more important is to come up with a strategy to keep on not just low, but even lower. And so I am such a strong proponent of more community policing with more cops on the neighborhood beat. . . . Until and when we lower the barriers between cops and communities, especially communities of color, we'll never continue our crime reduction as we must.

ALAN G. HEVESI: There cannot be one step back in the fight against crime. There has to be a continuous effort to sustain the police force at its current levels with new deployments, with new technologies. And included in that formula is an absolute requirement that we do not retreat when it comes to quality-of-life crimes as represented in your question by the squeegees. . . . I will eliminate the decency commission. But when it comes to fare-jumping and squeegees and graffiti, we will sustain that effort to make sure that everybody in New York gets the idea that we're not retreating at all on crime.

GEORGE N. SPITZ: The problem is that the Democratic Party has become too conservative. These squeegee people need help. And I favor looking into some of the programs that they do in the Scandinavian countries, and getting them into the mainstream of the Democratic Party. These people need help, and the government should give it to them.

PETER F. VALLONE: I've worked alongside three different mayors to make sure that this is the safest city in the country. I'm the one who conceived the plan in the first place to put 10,000 more police on the streets. There's absolutely no way I'd ever let the city slip back the way it was with squeegee men or anyone else. Under my community-policing plan, I would make sure that the police that are assigned to that area, or any area in the city, not only know the area and know the problems of the area, but know the people in the community.

Q. Secretary of State Colin Powell announced that he's not going to go to the U.N. global conference on racism in Durban. And as a mayor, would you, at some level, have sent a delegation to this conference? . . . And what is your specific position on reparations for slavery in the United States?

VALLONE: I would think that the mayor is second only to the president in terms of world recognition. And it strikes me that I would do whatever I can to understand how serious the problem of racism is. But within the jurisdiction that I have as mayor of the city of New York, one of the things that I've just done is to try to get the truth of whether or not we have such things as racial profiling that exists in the city of New York by passing a landmark disclosure bill in which we will have our police -- every arrest that's made in the city, every single stop and frisk that's made in the city. I want our police to be ambassadors of good will, and I want -- I'd work with representatives of every color, every corner, every culture of this city.

FERRER: The decision by Secretary of State Powell saddens me. But the Bush administration, in fact, has been asleep at the switch on, for example, the commission on human rights at the U.N. letting slave-trading nations like Sudan be in the driver's seat. We have a moral obligation as a nation to speak up and speak out on human rights and civil rights abuses all over the world. And the mayor . . . should be stepping up to this one as well because the sons and daughters of those countries live in the five boroughs of this city. Let me say a word about racial profiling. It's good to have a law that counts numbers. It's better to have a law banning it. That's what I proposed a month ago.

GREEN: Since that conference says that Zionism is racism, which is absurd, the United States had a right to say, "Get rid of that, and now let's talk about racism." . . . I don't know a greater evil in the world than the slave trade in Africa and America. I worry that 150 years later, reparations is an unworkable and divisive way to cure it or to pay down the debt. The way to do that is smaller class sizes, more children on health insurance since it's black and Latino children and families that are most discriminated.

HEVESI: My first speech as comptroller . . . was a call to end any form of bigotry in this city. . . . The U.S. should be participating in a conference that deals with the issue of racism. And I know Peter Vallone didn't intend to create a different impression than he did when he said, "We have to find out if there's racial profiling." There is. Not on the part of the department, not on the part of any particular command, but in individual cases. The question of reparations -- I . . . succeeded in obtaining restitution . . . from European governments for Holocaust victims. We provided reparations as well to Japanese-Americans. Reparations does not mean everybody gets a check.

SPITZ: I think I'm the only candidate running for citywide office who takes a balanced point of view towards the Mideast. I'm opposing the Israeli occupation policies, the land confiscation, the collective punishments and the assassinations. I'm proud that I'm an Orthodox Jew, but I believe Palestinians have a right -- have a right to live. And I think that our policies, U.S. policies, have been exacerbated by New York City mayors . . . taking extremist stands on this issue.

Q. Mr. Ferrer, in recent years we had a temporary income tax surcharge to pay for building up the police force. You've proposed restoring that surcharge to pay for after-school programs. Mr. Hevesi has proposed restoring it for education. . . . Why is that a good idea in as heavily taxed a city as this?

FERRER: It's one and a half points of a personal income tax surcharge that would result in a daily savings to the average working family of four pennies a day. Since being mayor is about choices . . . the choice I would make is to give every working parent the guarantee that their child, by dismissal time, is still in front of adult supervision, out of harm's way and learning more. . . . If it's between a trivial personal income tax surcharge tax cut and after-school programs, I gladly make the choice for kids.

GREEN: We are a very high-taxed city, which can hurt growth. And the last moment -- the worst moment we should think about raising taxes is on the brink of a potential softening of the economy or recession. I appeared with Mayor David Dinkins last week; he was the creator of the after-school programs called Beacon schools. I want to increase them. It would cost $25 million, which could be paid for by the -- indefensible $300 million overtime budget at the Police Department. I have hundreds of millions of savings in productivity gains and labor savings and e-government that can and will be invested in smaller class sizes and more after-school programs. If at the end of that we need more revenue, I would invest it in our kids, even at the cost of increased taxes. But that's the last, not an eager first option.

HEVESI: You really have to have experience in dealing with budgets to make the kind of commitment that we just heard from Mark Green. The reality is that if the economy goes sour, we're going to have to make some very heavy choices and there'll be real austerity. The truth is, it was in a recession that Peter Vallone and David Dinkins did raise taxes, the 12 1/2 percent surcharge on the income tax, for policing. And it worked. And my position is that, while we supported a whole range of tax cuts including eight business tax cuts, four of which we recommended during the boom times, what I have said is if we needed to as a last resort, if money from the state in the campaign for fiscal equity case doesn't come through, then a restoration of that same 12 1/2 percent surcharge earmarked for education so we don't lose another generation of kids is appropriate.

SPITZ: Before the war -- and I lived here before the war, even worked here before the war; this was a mean-spirited city compared to today -- mediocre restaurants and stores, 1 percent sales tax, no income tax, built Queens College, Brooklyn College, libraries were open till 9 every night, free tuition in the universities, expanded park space 50 percent, go on and on. Today with a vibrant multiculture society we have -- and an 8 1/4 percent sales tax and no -- and a huge income tax, we can't even pay our teachers properly or police or fire properly.

VALLONE: In terms of a surtax, I'm the one that instituted the surtax together with Mayor Dinkins. . . . And I also promised that I would give it back in 1998 and would not raise one single tax since. I kept that promise. We have the money back, the mayor wanted to use it to move Yankee Stadium from the Bronx to Manhattan. I said absolutely not. I haven't raised a single tax, have made -- I reduced occupancy taxes and other obnoxious taxes in order to encourage business in the city. The worst thing that we could do now is, when we have a $1 billion surplus, is to chase good businesses out of the city by talking about raising taxes again.

Q. Mr. Ferrer, you've promised to raise the salary of city teachers by 30 percent across the board. . . . How do you specifically plan to finance this, especially given the fact that other unions -- police, fire -- are going to line up?

FERRER: First, a bold and very large raise for teachers. I want to treat teachers as the professionals they are. But I also want to demand more from the profession: more accountability, the ability to remove an unfit or unqualified teacher promptly now, and year-round training and teaching for teachers. And I've shown time and time again how I'd pay for that, within the budget, within savings of the Board of Education.

GREEN: There's no more important challenge . . . than to fix our broken school system. . . . I've visited 50 schools one by one myself to learn what works and what doesn't. And what I heard from teachers and principals is we need a big deal with our teachers. Pay more, especially bonuses for improved performance if they're going to a lower-performance school, if they tutor younger colleagues.

HEVESI: The formula for good education . . . is simple: smaller classes. It's geometrically better to have 18 kids than 25 or 30 in a class. A qualified, certified teacher in every class. Parents trained to help their kids learn. And safe schools. And nothing more critical than having a certified, qualified teacher in every class. . . . We have to have a closing of the gap in salaries between the teachers in this city and the surrounding suburbs. The differential is 25 percent right now.

SPITZ: My local school board: 65 patronage jobs in a luxurious schoolhouse. . . . What kind of morale can the teachers and the parents have when you have a situation like that? . . . We have enough money to pay the salaries of everybody if we cut the patronage, the contracting out of all our system.

VALLONE: I think it's time that we understand to get rid of the Board of Education as it exists -- the politics of the Board of Education is interfering not only with the education of the kids but many other things, including the monies that have to go into the classroom. What we have to do is to have a plan, a realistic plan which would give $500 million more a year to our school system, together with the $1 billion that is now owed to us by the state on an annual basis.

HEADLINE: City Will Close Office Running Foster Program 

BYLINE:  By NINA BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
New York City's child welfare commissioner said yesterday that he would close the city office that directly runs foster homes in Manhattan and Staten Island because it had scored at the bottom of a systemwide performance evaluation -- far below the worst-performing nonprofit foster care agency under contract to the city.
 The commissioner, Nicholas Scoppetta, said the administration of foster homes for the city-run program's 280 children would be transferred to better-performing agencies, mostly private ones, by Sept. 30. Most of the children will stay in their present foster homes. 
 The office for Manhattan and Staten Island, one of four in different boroughs under Mr. Scoppetta's direct control, was rated unsatisfactory on measures like how often caseworkers visited children, how swiftly families were reunited and whether children received needed medical care. 
Mr. Scoppetta said the decision to shut the 42-year-old operation showed that the city was applying the same tough standards to itself that it applied to the private agencies that provide most foster care beds in the long-troubled system.
"Better if an agency is performing so poorly to close it," Mr. Scoppetta said, noting that the office's score of 50 percent was 9 points below the score of a private agency that he had already threatened to shut down. "It's a very important message to the community, including our own people." 
But some child welfare veterans worried that the decision to close the office rather than fix the city-run operation was a step backward. They recalled past periods when the city's dependence on private agencies left many children, especially black children, with no home at all. 
"Being totally dependent on the private sector does not give the city the leverage to assure quality services for children," said Marcia Robinson Lowry, a veteran child welfare litigator. "Certainly that's the history of child welfare in this city." 
Mr. Scoppetta did not disagree. He said it was "extremely important" to keep the city in the business of what is known as direct foster care services so that "in the unlikely event that there's a need to expand foster care, there will be a way to do it." But, he added, "we want it to be a quality service."
The office being closed, which is in Harlem, is one of four operated by the city's Administration for Children's Services in its Direct Foster Care Services. One, in Queens, scored 76.4, better than most of the private foster care agencies, including well-endowed institutions like New York Foundling and the Children's Aid Society. But those in the Bronx and Brooklyn had unsatisfactory scores of 61.7 and 61.5 on the new evaluation, the most comprehensive ever.
Mr. Scoppetta said that the director of the Bronx office had been demoted and transferred and that a new Brooklyn director had been named. The director for Manhattan and Staten Island resigned, he said.
While some child welfare veterans praised the decision as the end of a longstanding double standard, others asked why Mr. Scoppetta had not acted sooner to fix city-run programs with management problems that were well known when he took office more than five years ago.
"They have a long history of having caseloads that are too high and workers who are not adequately supervised and not held to standards," Ms. Lowry said, noting that Mr. Scoppetta's widely praised improvements in worker training and supervision mainly affected child abuse and neglect investigators, not direct-care workers or the workers at private agencies.
"The city has made top-level management changes, theoretical changes and policy changes," she said. "But I think this shows a lack of attention to the level where children and families live."
For more than a century, New York City's foster care system has been one of the nation's most privatized and the one that most relied on religious agencies. The city did not venture into publicly provided foster homes until 1959. It entered the field reluctantly, propelled by the needs of hundreds of black and Hispanic babies who were waiting in hospital wards for foster homes after being rejected by the Catholic, Jewish and Protestant agencies that controlled all publicly subsidized foster home beds. 
The city's first plan was to reopen a ward of a defunct tuberculosis hospital on Long Island for the babies' care, Justine Wise Polier, a family court judge at the time, recalled in her memoirs. Well aware of the damage to babies in such settings, Judge Polier came up with an alternative: the city should pay approved welfare mothers to board an infant, simultaneously improving each family's economic condition, giving the mother useful work, and saving the babies from institutional neglect.
"At that time, the private agencies were not following their responsibility for placing children irrespective of their racial and ethnic identity," said James R. Dumpson, who was then the city's director of social services. "That's how we got into public service."
Faye Moore, director of grievances for the caseworkers' union, said the above-average performance of the Queens office showed that the city was capable of providing good care for children. She said the union, which represents the 58 workers to be redeployed to other assignments, had complained about management in the Harlem office for years.
"Every time they had vacancies in other boroughs for child welfare specialists, they would pull from this office, so there was a constant lack of staff," she said.
But Mr. Scoppetta said the downsizing of the city's direct-care operation made sense in light of the steep decline of the city's foster care population over the last decade, to about 30,000 from a 1991 peak of 49,100. 
In the case of "an unforeseen catastrophe" like a new kind of crack epidemic, he said, the city may have to reopen the Manhattan office.
"But we're not planning for the catastrophe that may or may not appear on the scene in the next 10 years," he said. "I'm absolutely convinced we have too many children in foster care."

HEADLINE: Hiker From Brooklyn Is Found Dead in New Hampshire 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
It was supposed to be a 15-minute hike in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, about 10 miles from the synagogue that Abraham Hauer managed for the many Orthodox Jews who vacationed in the area.
 Mr. Hauer's wife, Milka, stopped to rest after about five minutes, and her husband said he would be back in 20 minutes. But Mr. Hauer, who lives in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, never returned. After two days of searching by New Hampshire Fish and Game Department officers, the state police and hundreds of Orthodox Jewish volunteers, his body was found yesterday in the woods in Franconia. 
 The police said it appeared that Mr. Hauer, 53, who went on the walk toward dusk on Sunday, wandered off the path and was trying to find his way by thrashing through the woods. On Monday, searchers found his vest, about 200 yards from the body.
"Apparently he became disoriented and slipped and fell, and more than likely succumbed to the weather conditions," Sgt. Timothy Hayes of the New Hampshire State Police said. "There was no indication of major injury."
The medical examiner did not immediately give a cause of death, and the body was released to the family. 
Mr. Hauer's body was brought back to Brooklyn for the funeral. Today, shortly after midnight, about 400 people filled Rodney Street in Williamsburg -- the men on one side, the women on the other, according to tradition -- outside the Satmar synagogue, where the ceremony took place.
Burial was to follow in Kiryas Joel in Orange County, in keeping with Jewish custom that the deceased be buried within 24 hours. 
Temperatures on Sunday night were down to the high 40's in the area, and it rained on Monday. "If you are not properly dressed or used to it, it can take a toll," Sergeant Hayes said.
Acquaintances described Mr. Hauer as someone who enjoyed good views and regular walks, but not an experienced hiker. The sergeant said Mr. Hauer may have been trying to head for the sound of traffic, because three highways pass through the area. He was hiking in Franconia Notch, a narrow passage through rocky terrain, which could easily distort the sound of cars, making them seem closer then they were.
"It's a perfect echo chamber," Sergeant Hayes said.
The trail, which leads up the mountain to a ledge with panoramic views, is considered an easy hike.
Mr. Hauer managed the Arlington Synagogue in Bethlehem, N.H., an area popular with vacationing Orthodox Jews. He took over the synagogue about 10 years ago, and led prayers there three times a day, said Miriam Ausch, who lives in Williamsburg and was in Bethlehem yesterday while on vacation.
She described Mr. Hauer as a kind man with a ready smile. "Everybody he met, he greeted," she said.
Mr. Hauer's disappearance drew hundreds of Orthodox Jews from New York, New Jersey and Montreal to take part in the search. Many others contributed money for boots, jackets and food for the searchers.
"They would do this for anybody from our society because our religion teaches us that," Ms. Ausch said. "Each person cares for the other. It's a big loss, but we accept God's will. We just have to go on."
In Williamsburg, Isaac Abraham said it was not uncommon for Orthodox Jews to organize searches when one of their own goes missing.
"Usually when we go on searches we hope to bring someone out walking and talking," he said.
Along with his activities at the New Hampshire synagogue, Mr. Hauer was known as a matchmaker for the Satmars in Williamsburg, where he lived in a five-story brick walk-up.
In the Brooklyn neighborhood, others described Mr. Hauer as a popular and charitable man. "He would go out of his way to help everyone," said Eugene Singer, 51, a salesman. "He helped my brother once. He saw that he looked a little depressed because he was unemployed, and he got him a job making ties."
Acquaintances said Mr. Hauer had a 22-year-old daughter and several grandchildren.
The Associated Press quoted Milka Hauer, who explained how she sat on a rock waiting for her husband to return.
"I waited and went up farther and yelled and he didn't call," she said, "so I decided that he was in trouble."
Another woman, who said she saw Mr. Hauer on Sunday before returning from vacation, said: "A nice man goes for a walk and doesn't come back. Of course it makes you upset."

HEADLINE: National Briefing Midwest: Michigan: Schools Make Cuts 

BYLINE:  By Elizabeth Stanton (NYT)

 BODY:
 Public schools across the state are being forced to cut budgets and programs, citing a lack of state financing. 
Because of a property tax cut approved in 1994, some districts whose increases in state aid fell below the inflation rate are cutting teaching positions, increasing class sizes and charging students to compete in sports. The 1994 plan cut school property taxes up to 82 percent, moved the burden of school financing to the state from property owners and tried to even spending among districts. Gov. John Engler, who helped design the tax cut, said the education problems were not the result of a lack of resources. Elizabeth Stanton (NYT)

HEADLINE: National Briefing Education: Support For Gay Rights 

BYLINE:  By Jacques Steinberg (NYT)

 BODY:
 American teenagers are more likely than their parents to support the legalization of gay marriage and other protections for gay men and lesbians, a national survey of 1,000 high school seniors has found. 
The survey, conducted this year by researchers at Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., found that two-thirds of the students supported the legal recognition of gay marriage. That compares with about a third of adults in Associated Press and Gallup Organization surveys. More than two-thirds of the teenagers also said gay couples should be permitted to adopt children.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
A creative executive, formerly of Kirshenbaum Bond, moves to Ogilvy & Mather in New York.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
A LEADING creative executive is joining the New York office of a giant agency.
 The executive is Bill Oberlander, who until early this year had been managing partner and executive creative director of the New York office of Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners. 
 Effective Sept. 17, Mr. Oberlander, who has also worked for McCaffrey & McCall and McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, will join the New York office of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, part of the WPP Group, as one of five senior partners and executive creative directors. 
Mr. Oberlander, 41, is an art director and recently completed three years as president of the Art Directors Club in New York. He will be paired at Ogilvy New York with a copywriter, Dan Burrier, who is also a senior partner and executive creative director, on accounts like Motorola, the Perrier Group of America division of Nestle and Cotton Inc. Mr. Oberlander will also help Mr. Burrier oversee a program at the agency called Young Guns, which offers jobs to top graduates of advertising schools and programs across the county.
The hiring of Mr. Oberlander by Ogilvy New York is emblematic of the steps agencies seek to take during unsettling economic times to attract new clients and keep current clients happy. One way is to try to bolster creative firepower by assembling a cadre of well-known, award-winning senior executives.
"We have a pretty strong story for any client," Rick Boyko, co-president and chief creative officer at Ogilvy New York, said yesterday, adding that there was "a terrific stable of creative talent at senior levels running businesses."
One strength of the creative lineup, he added, is that like Mr. Oberlander, many of the executives had joined Ogilvy New York from other agencies including the BBDO Worldwide and DDB Worldwide units of the Omnicom Group; Foote, Cone & Belding, now part of the FCB Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies; and Wieden & Kennedy.
In an interview in which he discussed Mr. Oberlander's hiring, which is to be formally announced today, Mr. Boyko cited approvingly a quotation from David Ogilvy, the agency's founder, which he paraphrased as, "Hire people bigger than yourself, and you become an agency of giants."
Not bad for a paraphrase. The full quotation from Mr. Ogilvy, who died in 1999, is as follows: "If you always hire people who are smaller than you are, we shall become a company of dwarfs. If, on the other hand, you always hire people who are bigger than you are, we shall become a company of giants."
Mr. Ogilvy also had another pithy saying on staffing an agency: "If you ever find a man who is better than you are, hire him. If necessary, pay him more than you pay yourself."
Mr. Oberlander joined Kirshenbaum Bond, part of the Kirshenbaum Bond Creative Network, in early 1990, when the agency, known then as Kirshenbaum & Bond, had billings estimated at $15 million. When he left in January, the agency had an office in San Francisco as well as in New York and billings estimated at $600 million. The accounts he worked on included Coach, Rockport, Snapple and Target.
Mr. Oberlander left Kirshenbaum Bond abruptly after being replaced unexpectedly by the agency's co-chairmen, Jonathan Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum, ahead of a planned reorganization. Two creative executives, Rob Feakins and Logan Wilmont, were named to assume his duties.
In an interview, Mr. Oberlander said he would prefer to "keep it about the future" rather than the past. But when asked to discuss what happened at Kirshenbaum Bond, which ignited much speculation among his colleagues and peers, he ascribed it to "partnership differences."
"Eventually, everything runs its course," Mr. Oberlander said. "It was more fun when we were younger and had less to lose. It came time."
Besides, "Ogilvy is a unique species in New York, an agency where being big doesn't make them bad," he added. "It seems the heart and soul of the agency comes out of the creative product."
As an example, Mr. Oberlander cited the Young Guns program, which he praised -- except for the name.
"Much to my chagrin," he said, laughing, "we had something at the Art Directors Club like 'Young Guns,' which we had to change to 'Young Bloods' or something."
Seriously, Mr. Oberlander said he was looking forward to helping Mr. Burrier and Mr. Boyko with the program, which recruits from places like the School for Visual Arts, the Adcenter at Virginia Commonwealth University, Creative Circus, the University of Texas at Austin and Michigan State University. One popular current campaign, the series of offbeat print ads and posters carrying the theme "Perrier in America," was produced by Young Guns teams.
"We make a promise to these young people that they won't just 'wrist out' other people's ideas," Mr. Burrier said, using a term meaning to execute something conceived by more senior employees. "It's a great way to find new talent."
Mr. Burrier and Mr. Boyko had overseen the Young Guns program with Mr. Burrier's previous art director partner, Peter Wood, who left Ogilvy New York in April to join Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmettterer/Euro RSCG in New York, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide division of Havas Advertising, as worldwide head of art on the Volvo account.
"Peter and I were together at the agency for three and a half years," said Mr. Burrier, who joined Ogilvy New York from the Los Angeles office of BBDO. "It was just one of those found partnerships that went really well."
Asked whether he was hoping history would repeat itself in his new partnership with Mr. Oberlander, Mr. Burrier said, "Lightning strikes twice if you stick your head up high enough, or so one would hope."
Now that's a copywriter.

HEADLINE: Two Are Promoted as Enron Seeks Executive Stability 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

DATELINE: DALLAS, Aug. 28 

 BODY:
With its stock still suffering after the unexpected departure of its chief executive, the Enron Corporation today promoted a top official in its core energy-trading business to be the company's No. 2 executive as it begins finding new leadership.
 Greg Whalley, 39, was named president and chief operating officer. Also, the company promoted Mark A. Frevert, 46, to vice chairman. Both will join Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman and chief executive, in an office of the chairman. 
 The moves come two weeks after Jeffrey K. Skilling, a longtime protege of Mr. Lay who was the architect of Enron's wholesale energy-trading business, quit unexpectedly after just six months as chief executive. Mr. Lay, 59, has reassumed the role of chief executive and has extended his commitment to stay at the company until the end of 2005.
Mr. Skilling's departure, which he said was for "purely personal" reasons that he would not disclose, stunned investors, and the company's shares fell 14 percent in the next two days. In trading today, shares of Enron rose 40 cents, to $38.16, after peaking at $90 a year ago.
Mr. Whalley was president and chief operating officer of Enron Wholesale Services, the energy-trading unit that provides most of the company's operating income and revenue. A former officer in the Army, Mr. Whalley joined the company in 1992. He will "be somewhat more kind of the operations person on a day-to-day basis," Mr. Lay said in an interview.
Mr. Frevert was previously Mr. Whalley's boss as chairman and chief executive of Enron Wholesale Services. He started with a predecessor company to Enron, Houston Natural Gas, in 1984, and is completing a doctorate in economics from Rice University.
The announcement today clearly makes the two men, in particular Mr. Whalley, leading candidates to become chief executive, but Mr. Lay asserted that others at Enron, whom he declined to identify, were also potential successors.
"Obviously, these would be two of the people on the list," Mr. Lay said, but he said others include "various people depending on how they do the next two to three years." Finding a new chief executive, however, may take as long as four or five years, he said. "The main thing I need to convey is that I and the board are not in a big hurry on that."
In the interview, Mr. Lay said no one from Enron's board ever voiced disapproval of Mr. Skilling or in any way played a role in his departure, and Mr. Lay said that on several occasions he had asked Mr. Skilling to reconsider his decision to leave. He also said Mr. Skilling's personal reasons for leaving, while not health related, were "things with fairly short time fuses on them" and were "something he can't wait two or three years to address."
An immediate test for both Mr. Whalley and Mr. Frevert will be winning the respect and confidence of investors after the sharp slide in Enron shares this year as analysts questioned whether the company can continue to improve earnings as prices for natural gas and electricity -- its two biggest products -- have declined. The stock has also been hit by fallout from a number of missteps, including the troubled Dabhol power plant project in India and an expensive and unprofitable foray into trading telecommunications bandwidth.
Andre Meade, head of United States utilities research at Commerzbank Securities, said a chief problem was that energy trading and marketing account for a far bigger part of Enron's market capitalization than they do at other unregulated energy companies, but Enron's financial disclosures largely do not break down this business to show the profitability of different products and different regions.
"All that is compressed into one set of numbers, and it's really hard for analysts to determine where they are making money in a given quarter and where they are losing money," Mr. Meade said.
He added that Enron's having so much of its market capitalization tied up in a business that is so difficult for investors to understand "is really disconcerting."
Neither Mr. Whalley nor Mr. Frevert were available for comment, an Enron spokesman said. In the interview today, Mr. Lay, reiterating comments made to The Wall Street Journal, said he would try to make Enron's financials and business model more easily understood to investors.
"Analysts have expressed some concerns about that, and we're addressing those concerns," he said, though he added that "they'll probably never get all the information they want." Enron will break out more information on business segments and geographic results, he said, but he also said the company would probably not provide profit and loss numbers for natural gas and electricity -- by far the biggest products it trades. 
He also confirmed that Enron has "unwound" a series of complex deals it had entered into with partnerships that included Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. The transactions had been done for hedging and tax reasons, he said.
Enron's financial statements include other complex transactions. For example, the most recent 10-K states that Enron might be required to issue new shares of common stock if the price falls below levels ranging from $28.20 to $55 because of "certain financial contracts." Enron's stock has been below $55 for the last three months, but the company has not had to issue shares, a spokesman said. Enron may end up not having to issue any shares, he said, and any that are issued are already accounted for in diluted earnings per share.

HEADLINE: Accord at VW Signals a Shift For Germany 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Aug. 28 

 BODY:
Striking a blow against Germany's rigid work rules, Volkswagen reached an agreement today with the country's biggest labor union that should permit VW to demand longer workweeks and higher productivity.
 By American standards, the deal is modest and applies only to a sliver of Volkswagen's work force. But it is potentially important because it breaks out from Germany's nationwide collective-bargaining agreements and opens the door for other companies to demand customized deals. 
 It may be even more important in a negative sense: political leaders led by Chancellor Gerhard Schroder feared that if union leaders had torpedoed the talks and effectively killed 3,500 new jobs, Germany would be sending a deeply depressing message to domestic and foreign investors. 
German unemployment, which had declined the last year, hit 9.2 percent in July.
Today's agreement was reached only after talks collapsed in June and after Mr. Schroder personally pressed both sides to return to the bargaining table.
Mr. Schroder, who faces elections next year, is not expected to reach his own goal of reducing German unemployment to 3.5 million workers by the end of this year. And though he vowed to reduce unemployment through three-way discussions involving industry, labor and government, those talks produced little more than acrimony.
The Volkswagen talks began earlier this year, when VW proposed a "5,000 by 5,000" plan that would create 5,000 new jobs that paid a monthly wage of 5,000 marks (about $2,350).
The twist was that Volkswagen demanded much more flexibility than it normally had. It wanted the right to do away with overtime for anything less than 42 hours a week, and it wanted to make some of the pay dependent on reaching production targets.
IG Metall, the union that represents more than three million workers in the metal and electrical industries, treated many of those proposals as unacceptable, and talks broke down. They were revived this month, after Mr. Schroder stepped in and pressed both sides to try again.
Mr. Schroder has close ties to both sides. Before he became chancellor, he was premier of the state of Lower Saxony, where Volkswagen is based and which owns a 20 percent stake in Volkswagen. As premier, he was a member of Volkswagen's supervisory board and frequently championed its interests.
But the Social Democratic Party, Mr. Schroder's party, is also beholden to organized labor and most particularly to IG Metall, Germany's biggest union. The labor minister was previously vice chairman of IG Metall.
Today's agreement was reached after a 17-hour session that ended early this morning, and it covers only 3,500 workers because the two sides could not agree on how to treat another 1,500 workers in Hanover.
Under the agreement, Volkswagen will hire 3,500 workers to build minivans at a new factory at its headquarters in Wolfsburg. Volkswagen will be able to demand that workers put in up to 42 hours a week before being entitled to overtime.
Workers will be compensated through a system of so-called work-time accounts, which allows the company to demand up to 200 hours a year beyond its standard 35-hour workweek. That translates into as many as 30 Saturday shifts a year.
The time accounts will allow workers to put in fewer hours at other times of the year, so they still average a 35-hour week on an annualized basis. The deal may not reduce actual wages, but it should reduce overtime and give Volkswagen much more flexibility to fine-tune production.
The idea of time accounts is not new. It has been adopted in different forms by many manufacturing companies in different forms, including BMW, the maker of luxury cars based in Munich.
But Volkswagen is a much bigger and more conservative enterprise, so its bargaining effort had become a closely watched benchmark for much of German industry.
At least in theory, if workers fail to hit the company's production targets within their normal workweeks, they will have to work the extra hours without extra pay. In practice, that may never happen because the union leaders can argue that targets were missed because of company problems.
Josef-Fidelis Senn, head of Volkswagen's negotiating team, said the added flexibility would allow the new factory to save 20 percent in comparison with the standard union contract at its other German operations.
But union leaders said that they had softened Volkswagen's harshest demands and that wages at the new factory would still correspond to those set in the industrywide collective bargaining agreements.
They said Volkswagen had made a big concession on its demand that workers put in extra time if they failed to hit production targets. And while Volkswagen will be able to demand that workers put in as much as 42 hours a week, the average workweek over the course of a year should still add up to the standard 35 hours.
"We have established an example of how one can build cars while honoring the wage standards," said Jurgen Peters, vice chairman of IG Metall, at a news conference in Hanover.

HEADLINE: GREEN AND HEVESI EXCHANGE ATTACKS IN MAYORAL DEBATE 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
Mark Green and Alan G. Hevesi tangled over each other's ethics and credentials at a televised mayoral debate yesterday. Mr. Green questioned Mr. Hevesi's role as city comptroller in helping out a campaign contributor four years ago, while Mr. Hevesi mocked Mr. Green, the public advocate, as being unqualified to take over as New York's next mayor.
 As Mr. Hevesi and Mr. Green squabbled intermittently throughout the 60-minute session, a third candidate, Fernando Ferrer, sighed and said that viewers "must be wondering why we are talking above everyone's issues," in particular housing and schools. 
 The fourth major Democratic candidate, Peter F. Vallone, presented himself as the staid and mature government official, asserting again that Democrats should choose him to succeed Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani because Mr. Vallone had played a central role, as the City Council speaker, in pushing through programs that had improved New York's fortunes over the past 10 years. A fifth Democrat, George N. Spitz, a retired civil servant, also appeared in the debate, which was presented under the auspices of the Campaign Finance Board. 
But Mr. Green, after months of not attacking the other Democrats, surprised even his opponents by going after Mr. Hevesi. Within minutes of the opening of the debate, Mr. Green distanced himself from Mr. Ferrer and Mr. Vallone, saying that he thought it was undesirable for Mr. Hevesi to have arranged a meeting for a campaign contributor with a private business, Bell Atlantic.
Before their session was over, Mr. Green derided Democrats who "bicker among themselves with the current mayor" rather than looking to the future -- an allusion to Mr. Hevesi's weeklong fight with Mayor Giuliani. The debate came as Mr. Hevesi began broadcasting a television commercial critical of the mayor on corruption issues. Page B1. 
Mr. Green also criticized Mr. Hevesi's proposal for reforming the makeup of the Board of Education.
If Mr. Green sprinkled his typically nonconfrontational campaign appeal with occasional shots at Mr. Hevesi, the city comptroller was more intense in his approach to Mr. Green. He mocked the "small ideas" that he said Mr. Green was presenting to deal with expanding the city's public transit system, suggested that his opponent did not have the budgetary experience to deal with the fiscal problems that may await the next mayor, and said Mr. Green's biggest political strength might be his ability to get on television and into the newspapers.
"Mark Green, my good friend, is admirable when it comes to press conferences and press and asking questions and even bringing lawsuits," Mr. Hevesi said evenly, with a sidelong gaze at Mr. Green. "But being mayor of the city of New York requires experience in the global economy, it requires experience as a manager -- not running an agency of 40 people."
Mr. Hevesi's decision to go after Mr. Green had been expected by many Democrats in recent days. Mr. Green has consistently run ahead in polls leading up to the Sept. 11 primary, and Mr. Hevesi has been bunched more closely with the other two. And the comptroller has treaded some rough waters in recent days, as Mr. Giuliani has attacked him as an "ethically challenged" city comptroller; a number of Democrats have argued that Mr. Hevesi has reached a critical juncture as he seeks to handle Mr. Giuliani's attacks.
But Mr. Green's decision to go after Mr. Hevesi signaled an obvious change in strategy. It was unclear whether Mr. Green, in trying to knock back Mr. Hevesi, was worried that Mr. Hevesi's fights with Mr. Giuliani might increase his stature with Democrats in the primary, as Mr. Hevesi's aides believe. Alternatively, Mr. Green may see Mr. Hevesi's campaign as on the verge of collapsing, which would provide Mr. Green with the opportunity to win more than 40 percent of the votes, and thus avoid a runoff. If no candidate wins over 40 percent on Sept. 11, the top two vote-getters meet again in a runoff on Sept. 25.
Mr. Hevesi tripped up when a questioner asked him whether he agreed with a decision by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell not to attend a conference in South Africa on racism, because the resolution calling for the conference includes language critical of Israel. "The U.S. should be participating in a conference that deals with the issue of racism," Mr. Hevesi said, suggesting that he disagreed with Mr. Powell's decision.
After the debate, Mr. Hevesi's spokesman, Josh Isay, said that because part of the conference agenda was "equating Zionism with racism," Mr. Hevesi believed that Mr. Powell should not attend. Mr. Isay said that the comptroller was not aware of the details of the conference when he answered the question.
Mr. Vallone, in his response to the question, suggested that he approved of the decision by the Bush administration, and Mr. Ferrer said, "We have a moral obligation as a nation to speak up and speak out on human rights and civil rights abuses all over the world."
Mr. Green, afterward, laughed off Mr. Hevesi's criticism about his qualifications, and said that Mr. Hevesi was trying to run for mayor based on things he did in the State Assembly 20 years ago. "I could brush it off because the public knows of my record of results in the 90's, and can contrast it with his ads, which simply talk about bills in the 1970's and 1980's," Mr. Green said. "Let him talk about his record; I'm proud to talk about mine."
At the debate, sponsored by Newsday, WPIX-TV and WNYC-TV, in conjunction with the city's Campaign Finance Board, Mr. Hevesi accused Mr. Giuliani of trying to "smear me" and "involve himself in the Democratic primary" by attacking his ethics.
Mr. Hevesi has been criticized for arranging the meeting with a campaign contributor and Bell Atlantic, which never produced a contract between them. He has also been the subject of an unsubstantiated allegation that he took a $6,000 cash bribe to arrange the meeting; he has flatly denied that allegation.
Mr. Ferrer and Mr. Vallone both came to Mr. Hevesi's defense. Mr. Ferrer noted that Mr. Hevesi enjoyed friendly relations with Mr. Giuliani before beginning his race for mayor (a relationship that has given Mr. Hevesi some problems with Democratic leaders), but Mr. Ferrer went on to criticize Mr. Giuliani for raising questions about Mr. Hevesi's ethics.
"This is a matter of impugning someone's good name and integrity," Mr. Ferrer said. "I've known Alan for a long time. He has an unblemished record in the public service. This should not be a way in the closing days of the campaign to smear somebody's reputation."
Mr. Vallone also said he had "no question" about Mr. Hevesi's integrity, but went on to criticize him for his dispute with the Campaign Finance Board in which he sought, without success, to be permitted to have his campaign consultant and close friend, Hank Morris, work free for his campaign. Mr. Hevesi later compromised and agreed to pay Mr. Morris and then received his campaign matching funds. 
Mr. Green, who initially was silent as the dispute between Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Hevesi escalated last week, was notably more ambivalent in offering his view of it yesterday. He said he did not believe the bribery allegation, but then suggested that he operated on a higher standard in dealing with campaign contributors. "I actually can never remember using my public office to help a donor or a bundler get a private contract, which of course is not criminal, but it's, I think, undesirable," Mr. Green said.
The format of the debate included a strict 45-second limit on responses, which on a number of occasions stopped candidates in midsentence, or choked off exchanges, particularly after the moderator, Kaity Tong of WPIX-TV, warned that "if you are still talking when the red light goes on, I'm going to have to jump in and interrupt you, so don't make me go there!"
The pressure on the candidates was also lessened by Mr. Spitz's presence, which was permitted because he is enrolled with the Campaign Finance Board. Although Mr. Spitz himself describes his chances of winning as remote, he was given as much time as his opponents and espoused unconventional views like calling for the decriminalization of drugs.
The candidates all made clear, in response to an opening question, that they would protect some of the changes that had taken place under Mr. Giuliani, saying, for example, that they would not tolerate a return of squeegee men. "The Ferrer administration will not give the squeegee guys or aggressive panhandlers any reason to believe that they can harass or aggressively panhandle any New Yorker," Mr. Ferrer said.
Mr. Vallone said that he "conceived the plan" to put more police officers on the street (Mayor David N. Dinkins has disputed Mr. Vallone's recollection on that), and added, "There is absolutely no way I will let this city step back to where it was with squeegee men or anyone else."

HEADLINE: Economists Back Projection That It Will Be Necessary to Dip Into Social Security Surplus 

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 28 

 BODY:
New budget projections from Congressional analysts and the White House show that the Bush administration and Congressional leaders are almost certain to violate their promise not to dip into the Social Security surplus to pay the government's bills, prominent economists said today.
 A White House report last week made clear that only an assortment of accounting changes -- described by Democrats as politically motivated gimmicks -- would prevent the use of Social Security to make ends meet in the budget during the rest of President Bush's four-year term. 
 And even then, the government would face an uncomfortably tight squeeze in order to leave Social Security untouched, with a margin of error of only about $1 billion, a pittance in an overall federal budget approaching $2 trillion a year.
The analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office was more pessimistic. Its report, which was made public on Monday, suggested that the White House was too hopeful in its predictions about economic growth next year and about the impact of the $1.3 trillion tax-cut package that Mr. Bush pushed through Congress. 
"It appears that it's inevitable that we'll dip into the Social Security surplus," said Robert D. Reischauer of the Urban Institute, an economist who directed the Congressional Budget Office from 1989 to 1995. "From an economic standpoint, it's totally nonconsequential. But politically and symbolically, it's terribly important."
Congressional analysts found that $9 billion would need to be tapped from Social Security this year to cover shortfalls in the budget, and that $21 billion more would need to be drained from the retirement program over the next three years.
Because the Congressional analysts are required by law to make their projections on the basis of current government spending, the report does not factor in the huge spending increases that President Bush is expected to propose for the Defense Department and for his plan to develop a national missile-defense system. The price tag of those programs could approach $300 billion over the next 10 years.
It does not take into account the proposals from both parties for a prescription-drug benefit -- at least $200 billion over 10 years -- or for an expanded federal role in education, a signature issue for President Bush; it does not include the billions of dollars that Republican and Democratic lawmakers will want to set aside for hometown projects when next year's federal budget is completed this fall.
Allen Sinai of Primark Decision Economics in New York said today that the administration could avoid using Social Security revenues to cover other costs only "if the economy turned on a dime and suddenly began to grow faster -- and that's highly unlikely."
Mr. Sinai said the president's tax-cut package -- and more important, the souring economy -- had "torpedoed the budget surplus, which is really going to guarantee that the government will be dipping into Social Security funds."
The effect of even a large diversion of the Social Security surplus to other government programs does not threaten the current benefits received by more than 30 million retired workers and their dependents. For decades, the government used the surplus to pay off its other bills.
But any diversion is a violation of a fundamental promise made by both political parties during last year's presidential campaign. Republicans and Democrats promised in their platforms that the Social Security surplus would never be touched.
The Democratic candidate, Vice President Al Gore, was parodied for referring again and again in the campaign to the need for a "lockbox" to protect revenues paid to the government in Social Security taxes.
Mr. Bush used different words but made a similar promise.
"Our greatest generation deserves our greatest respect," he said as a candidate in December 1999. "This begins by keeping our word. We must reserve the Social Security surplus for Social Security itself."
In a campaign speech in May last year in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., Mr. Bush said that "for years, politicians in both parties have dipped into the trust fund to pay for more spending -- and I will stop it."
In the House in February, 211 Republicans joined with 194 Democrats to pass the "Social Security and Medicare Lockbox Act," which barred the use of Social Security surpluses for other spending. 
"We assure the American people that tax relief will not come at the expenses of Medicare or Social Security," Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois said at the time on behalf of the House Republican leadership.
Gov. James S. Gilmore III of Virginia, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said the president would keep his word to preserve the Social Security surplus, if only by forcing Congress to make deep cuts in federal spending.
"The president has made it clear that he's going to control spending," Mr. Gilmore said today in a telephone interview from Ohio, where he traveled as part of his national "honesty tour" to defend the administration's budget record.
Mr. Bush would not allow Congress to "blow the lid off the budget through spending," he said.

HEADLINE: Maybe We've Just About Hit Bottom 

BYLINE:  By Ian C. Shepherdson; Ian C. Shepherdson is the chief American economist at High Frequency Economics, an independent research company.

DATELINE: VALHALLA, N.Y. 

 BODY:
The economic news this month looks bad enough to turn even an inveterate optimist into a pessimist. Gateway announced that it would lay off one-quarter of its work force, Lucent told 2,200 workers in the United States that they would lose their jobs, and at least 21 dot-coms shut their doors for good.
 If this unpleasant news continues over the next few months, driving up the unemployment rate, many say that there will be a further slowdown in consumer spending (by far the biggest component of the American economy). But this is not necessarily true. Although the future might seem grim for the newly unemployed, what is true of individuals is not necessarily true of the economy as a whole. 
 Yes, unemployment, which had been at a 31-year low of 3.9 percent, has been climbing since late last year. It now stands at 4.5 percent and will probably rise further. But this figure doesn't tell us that much. Rising unemployment is a consequence, not a cause, of an economic slowdown. For instance, the economy began to recover from recession in the second quarter of 1991, but unemployment continued to rise until mid-1992.
There are signs that we are at a similar point now -- at or approaching the bottom of the economic cycle. In polls taken over the past few months by the Conference Board, respondents have become more gloomy about the current state of the economy, but they have become more optimistic about the future. The number of people expecting the employment picture to brighten over the next six months has also risen. 
For most people, the important economic story of the moment is probably not the rising unemployment rate. Instead, most may be focusing on the stock market, which is volatile but not plunging, and they may be expecting the actions of the Federal Reserve, which has been cutting interest rates aggressively, to turn the economy around. Tax rebates have also probably lifted expectations.
Those of a gloomy disposition often argue that people are carrying much more debt than ever before, which might slow growth in consumer spending as unemployment rises. But consumer debt is only half the story. Consumers' debt has risen by nearly $4 trillion over the past 10 years, but their assets -- even after the plunge in the Nasdaq -- have risen by more than $20 trillion. Overwhelmed by debt? It doesn't look that way to the dispassionate eye.
Pessimists also claim that recovery will be delayed because the Fed's reductions in short-term interest rates have not been followed by significant declines in long-term rates, which affect mortgages and borrowing costs for companies. But the markets anticipated the economic slowdown well before the Fed did and drove these rates down in advance of the Fed's actions. The average 30-year mortgage rate, for example, is now just under 7 percent. This is only a quarter-point or so lower than when the Fed first cut rates in January, but it is more than a full point lower than the rate a year ago. No wonder the housing market is so strong.
Meanwhile, in the industrial sector, unwanted inventory -- everything from shoes to refrigerators to raw materials -- is now disappearing fast. Over the past six months, companies have reduced their stocks of durable goods like computers and cars at a very rapid 7.7 percent annualized rate, and they now hold less inventory than they did a year ago. In the past, inventory reductions at this pace have always signaled strong rebounds in production within a few months.
This will do little immediately to address the other problem facing manufacturers, particularly in the technology sector -- what to do with the now-idle factories and equipment they bought in the late 1990's. These investments helped drive economic growth to an average of 4.2 percent between 1997 and 2000, but as the past year has clearly shown, growth at that pace cannot be maintained for long.
A return to growth of about 3 percent would be great news by all but the crazy standards of the dot-com boom, and it is within reach -- rising unemployment or not.

Sun Expects Another Losing Quarter

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
Sun Microsystems said today that it expected to report its second consecutive quarterly loss because demand for its products had continued to fall.
 Sun, which makes computer server systems, warned Wall Street that its operating expenses for its first fiscal quarter would probably exceed its revenue, even though it has cut spending. Citing a sharper-than-expected decline in sales in Japan and Europe, the company said its revenue goal of $3.7 billion seemed out of reach. 
 "It will take a very large month of September, in terms of demand, in order for us to hit the break-even point," Michael E. Lehman, the chief financial officer of Sun, said in a conference call with analysts. "At this date, I would not count on that happening."
Mr. Lehman did note that orders taken in the United States lagged the company's expectation only slightly.
Wall Street expected a first-quarter profit of 2 cents a share on revenue of $3.8 billion, according to a poll of analysts by Thomson Financial/First Call.
In trading ahead of the announcement, shares of Sun fell 13 cents, to $13.43. Shares fell to $12.76 in after-hours trading.
After reaping the benefits of exuberant spending by telecommunications providers and dot-coms in 2000, Sun is suffering from the sharply cut budgets -- or even bankruptcies -- of those customers. The downturn arrived at a time when Sun was introducing new servers and storage systems. The new products on the horizon give customers another reason to wait to buy.
Anticipating the introduction of those new systems, Mr. Lehman said he expected a noticeable improvement next quarter.
Sun, based in Palo Alto., Calif., reported its first quarterly loss since 1989 last month, but predicted that it would at least break even with $3.7 billion in revenue this quarter, which ends on Sept. 28. Despite today's warning, Mr. Lehman said, the company will not cut research and development to try to weather the downturn better.
"We are consciously willing to sacrifice maximization of near-term earnings to protect key investments," he said.
Thomas D. Kraemer, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, applauded Mr. Lehman's priorities, saying that "cutting R.& D. would be like using leeches to cure a disease." But Mr. Kraemer, who before the conference call cut his estimate on Sun to a loss of 2 cents a share from a penny-a-share loss, said Sun might have to start laying off employees to keep its business plan in line with today's economic reality.
Earlier this month, Sun said that fewer than 2 percent of its 43,000 workers would lose their jobs, but that some would remain within the company in new roles. So far, Sun is one of the few high-technology companies that have refrained from widespread layoffs.

HEADLINE: Gasoline Prices Jump in Midwest, Hinting of Wider Spikes 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
Starting out on a day of shopping, Barbara Graivier stopped at her local Amoco gas station in downtown Chicago and found that prices had jumped again.
 "Oh, my God," she said, staring at the price of $2.10 a gallon for regular unleaded gasoline. "I was here last weekend and it was $1.99. This is just ridiculous." 
 Nearly everyone that came through the Amoco station this afternoon said the same thing. Kristen Gruidl put just $7 worth of gas in her Jeep Wrangler because of the high prices. Another man bought $10 worth of gas, about four and a half gallons, enough to get to the airport in his Honda Accord. "This is crazy," he said, speeding away.
The reaction is similar across the Midwest, where gas prices are soaring ahead of the busy Labor Day weekend, reviving motorists' suspicions that price-gouging may be taking place. Tight supplies in the Midwest are also raising the prospect that other regions could be hit with higher prices later in the year, if refiners shift production capacity away from diesel or heating oil to meet gasoline demand.
Here in Chicago, a volatile summer for motorists is closing out with the highest prices in the nation. Gas prices climbed in the days leading up to the Memorial Day weekend, then dipped sharply going into the July 4 weekend. Since then, the price of regular gasoline has shot up about 50 cents a gallon, with much of that rise coming over the last month.
Energy analysts and government officials dismiss the notion that refiners or gas station operators are profiteering as the summer driving season ends. Spikes above $2 a gallon last summer led to federal investigations that found little evidence of price-gouging, and experts say that seems to be the case now, too.
"We're of the opinion nothing strange is going on," said Joanne Shore, a senior analyst at the Energy Information Administration. "There's no evidence of unusual market behavior. All the increases and the decreases in wholesale prices get passed through."
Instead, experts are blaming tight inventories in the Midwest and a fire earlier this month that disabled a giant Citgo gas refinery in Lemont, Ill. The fire has made it difficult to supply major hubs like Chicago and Milwaukee with the special blends of reformulated gasoline that are required by law in those cities.
Yesterday, the Environmental Protection Agency tried to ease the bottleneck by granting a waiver to Citgo so that the company could speed a more widely available gas blend to market. Refineries in the Gulf Coast are scrambling to meet the Midwest's demand, diverting supplies that would otherwise be shipped to other parts of the country. But that is not an easy fix, because pipelines -- the least expensive means for shipping fuels between regions -- are already full. 
"If we have supply disruptions here in Chicago, we can't just run next door to Iowa or Indiana; you have a special blend here," said Tom Mueller, a spokesman at BP, the British oil company that merged with Amoco. "The last couple of years, the pipelines have been full, and you have jet fuel, diesel and gasoline coming up; it's all scheduled well in advance."
So while much of the nation is benefiting from relatively stable gas prices that average about $1.48 a gallon of regular unleaded gas, the average price in the Midwest jumped to $1.69 a gallon last week. 
In Chicago, government statistics indicate that the average price spiked to $1.79 a gallon. But do not tell that to consumers or gas station managers here. Prices seem to be rising faster than number crunchers can calculate.
"The average price now is about $2," insisted Sultan Noorullah, one of the owners of an Amoco station in Rogers Park, a northern Chicago neighborhood.
Several other Chicago gas station managers agreed. In a random survey of 10 gas stations in Chicago, all reached by telephone today, the average price was reported to be $1.99 a gallon, with prices at several stations in the more affluent areas hovering near $2.10 a gallon.
"This is a perfect example of what we've been saying for two years," said Geoff Sundstrom, a spokesman for AAA. "The U.S. simply does not have enough refining capacity to meet the growing demand for gasoline."
Most analysts do not expect the spike in gas prices here to last much beyond the Labor Day weekend, because the holiday signals the end to the busy summer driving season. But the region's capacity problems could reverberate for months. 
The Citgo refinery in Lemont normally processes about 163,000 barrels a day, accounting for 5 percent of the region's gasoline, and it is not expected to restart for six months. Meanwhile, a government report released today showed that gasoline stocks in the Midwest fell sharply last week, to 48 million barrels, the lowest level in a decade. And distillate stocks, including diesel and heating oil, are also low, hinting at higher diesel and home heating oil prices in the fall and winter.
"In the Midwest, we're going into the high demand season and the stocks are off about 20 percent," said Jake Bournazian, an energy economist at the Energy Information Administration. "This could be very bad for farmers. Their fuel costs could be very high."
So there is little leeway for further bad news. "Distillate levels have been flat at a time when they should be rising," said Jay Saunders, an energy analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. "We don't think they're at levels to be overly concerned about, but another refinery outage or a cold spell in November could mean pretty high heating oil prices."

HEADLINE: Ferrer the Campaigner Offers an Old-Style Approach 

BYLINE:  By DEXTER FILKINS 

 BODY:
It was a muggy evening at the Calvary Baptist Church in Queens when Fernando Ferrer, the Democratic mayoral candidate, grasped the microphone and stood up. Alive with promises of deliverance, booming like a prophet from his party's past, he took a few minutes to go through millions of dollars.
 "Pay them like professionals!" Mr. Ferrer exclaimed, pushing his 30 percent pay raise for the city's teachers. 
 "The most ambitious housing plan this city has ever seen!" he said, promising 150,000 new homes at this mayoral forum. 
"After-school programs at 200 middle schools!" he added.
"Hallelujah," someone called from in the pews, and the others whooped and clapped.
As he crisscrosses the city seeking the Democratic party's nomination for mayor, Mr. Ferrer is proudly carrying the hopes of his party's oldest and most orthodox wing. In stump speeches and neighborhood tours, Mr. Ferrer, 51, often seems like a candidate from another era, the old-style populist coaxing votes from the city's precincts with promises of government largess. 
Earlier this month, Mr. Ferrer stood among the Rolando Paulino All-Stars -- the Bronx team that finished third in the Little League World Series last weekend in Williamsport, Pa. -- as the players, coaches and supporters waited for a bus to take them to an earlier-round game in Bristol, Conn. The bus came courtesy of Mr. Ferrer and the treasury of his Bronx borough, where Mr. Ferrer has been the president since 1987. Cost to taxpayers: about $700. 
"Numero uno!" Mr. Ferrer shouted as he stood among the young baseball players. "Numero uno!" 
Even if it had nothing to do with Mr. Ferrer's mayoral aspirations, the favor was not lost on the team's supporters who are old enough to vote. "Mr. Ferrer is always there for us," said Joan Dalmau, a league volunteer, as she climbed into the air-conditioned bus. "Always."
Mr. Ferrer was there again for them yesterday, leading the cheers when the Little Leaguers were honored in a daylong celebration throughout the city.
Mr. Ferrer's liberal election platform is part of his vision to reach out to what he calls the "other New York" -- the millions of residents he says have been left out of the city's economic boom and alienated by the policies of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. 
Mr. Ferrer said most of his initiatives could be paid for without new taxes. In lieu of specifics, he typically offered his hard-scrabble childhood in the South Bronx as proof of his sincerity. 
"When I talk about affordable housing, it comes from the perspective of a kid who grew up in a five-story walk-up without heat and hot water," Mr. Ferrer told the church crowd in Jamaica, Queens. "I want New Yorkers to know where I came from." 
Mr. Ferrer's pitch seemed to resonate with many likely voters, especially those in the city's minority communities. 
"I thought Mr. Ferrer was very down to earth," said Chris Durham, who attended the mayoral forum at the church. "I had to endure things like that myself. You have to have been there to know what he is talking about."
While Mr. Ferrer talks often about his roots in the South Bronx, he rarely makes direct ethnic appeals, even before friendly audiences. 
"I guess I'm not breaking any new ground here tonight by telling you I am a Puerto Rican from the Bronx," Mr. Ferrer told a crowd at the Madison Avenue United Methodist Church in Harlem. "But if that is the only reason that you are going to vote for me, wrong reason, wrong reason. Go back to the drawing board and think again."
Mr. Ferrer clearly believes that "the other New York" is everywhere -- not just in the South Bronx, but in the city's more robust neighborhoods as well. Even there, Mr. Ferrer's pitch never wavers.
During a recent meeting at a Polish-American club in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, Mr. Ferrer seemed to offer himself a chance to back away from his expensive vision. Instead, he congratulated himself for it. 
"Some people say I'm just another tax-and-spend liberal," Mr. Ferrer said at the John Smolenski Memorial Democratic Club. "That means I'm willing to stand up for what I believe in."
It is in these middle-class neighborhoods where Mr. Ferrer's populist pitch sometimes falters. In the wood-paneled confines of the Polish-American club, Mr. Ferrer wheeled out his usual stump speech, with promises of health care, housing and teacher pay raises. He departed without taking questions, prompting some to wish that Mr. Ferrer had stayed to listen to their worries about a new power plant that may be built nearby. 
"I'm not convinced," said Dr. Jolanta Kulpa-Subernat, a pediatrician who lives in Greenpoint. "He's certainly sincere. But what he said didn't relate to our neighborhood."
It often seems that Mr. Ferrer is trying to meet each of New York's voters before the Sept. 11 primary. He often starts his day at dawn, shaking hands with commuters, bleary-eyed and caffeinated alike, at some far-flung subway stop. Then, typically, he heads to one of a half-dozen events in any of the city's five boroughs -- a black church in Brooklyn, a parade in the Bronx, a lunch in Staten Island, a news conference at City Hall. Like most of the mayoral candidates, Mr. Ferrer is perpetually behind schedule, arriving late, leaving early, always apologizing. 
But he almost never fails to show up. His black limousine raced to its final destination of the day, the rooftop of the Brooklyn Children's Museum, where a group of Lubavitcher Jews was holding a barbecue to raise money for their schools. Mr. Ferrer was supposed to arrive at the tail end of the event, at 9:30 p.m. But it was 10:30 p.m. before he finally pulled up, and a handful of the event's organizers greeted him with a cold beer and a kebab off the grill. 
"I can't tell you his positions on all the issues, but as a judge of people and character, I can tell you that Freddy is very, very straight," said Rabbi Yitzchok Hecht, as he scraped the charcoal from the grill. "Freddy is a good friend of the yeshiva. We think he's a mensch."

HEADLINE: United States Backs Plan to Help Chinese Evade Government Censorship of Web 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER 8. LEE 

 BODY:
The United States government agencies that once tried to breach the Iron Curtain with radio broadcasts are taking the information war to the Internet, hoping to finance an American-based computer network designed to thwart attempts by the Chinese government to censor the World Wide Web for users in China.
 Government officials and private architects of the plan say the program would be financed by the International Broadcasting Bureau, parent agency of the Voice of America, which has been presenting the American view abroad -- mostly by radio -- for decades. It would mark a significant expansion of the long-running information war between China and the United States. 
 The agency is in advanced discussions with Safeweb, a small company based in Emeryville, Calif., which has received financing from the venture capital arm of the Central Intelligence Agency, In-Q-Tel. The discussions were confirmed by parties on both sides. 
Safeweb currently runs its own worldwide network of about 100 privacy servers -- computers that help disguise what Web sites a user is seeking to view -- which are popular with users in China. The privacy servers have been a continuing target for the Chinese government, which has blocked most of them in recent weeks.
The bureau would provide money for new computers to run Safeweb software specifically tailored for the Chinese audience and intended to be more resistant to blocking by the government. It would also cover some of the costs of network bandwidth to carry the the Internet traffic, but would not act as host for the computers itself.
The plan would initially pay for around a dozen computers, with an option to grow to a larger number after the new federal fiscal year begins on Oct. 1. The project would be financed from a Congressional allocation of $5 million last year intended to improve broadcasting to China, including both Internet and radio. Of that $5 million, $800,000 was approved for "Internet and multimedia enhancement," some of which is scheduled for use on this project. 
"We recognized that we have an obligation to reach out to our audience in ways that are effective, that includes the Internet," said Tish King, a spokeswoman for the International Broadcasting Bureau.
To that end, Voice of America also started VOANews.com to make news available worldwide on the Internet. Currently, audio broadcasts in over 53 languages are streamed live and archived on the site. Text is archived in almost all the languages.
Voice of America has been developing an Internet strategy to reach an audience in China with a daily newsletter in Chinese that is e-mailed to 180,000 people and a Chinese-language news Web site.
In addition to a Chinese-language Web site, Radio Free Asia also maintains Web sites aimed at ethnic minority groups in China like Tibetans and Uighurs, who are concentrated in the northwest region of Xinjiang.
But the Chinese government has sporadically jammed the radio broadcasts from Voice of America since 1989 and from Radio Free Asia since 1997, a year after it began, specifically those in Mandarin and Tibetan. The government has also blocked the Chinese-language Web sites of Voice of America since 1997 and Radio Free Asia almost since it began in 1998.
For Chinese leaders, the Internet is a doubled-edged sword, a rapidly evolving medium that brings economic opportunity but remains beyond complete control.
Internet use in China is growing dramatically, seeping from urban universities and businesses to homes and affordable Internet cafes all over the country. The Chinese government estimates there were over 26 million Internet users in July, compared to only 9 million at the end of 1999.
Periodically, the government tries new ways to tighten control, including police raids. Since April the government has waged a campaign to shut down thousands of unlicensed Internet cafes, and the government has publicized the arrests of over a dozen "Internet dissidents" over the last three years.
The government maintains an elaborate set of rules that requires Internet service providers to electronically filter content that may be pornographic, anti-government, violent, unhealthy or superstitious.
Among sites that are blocked for the vast majority of users are those of The Washington Post, Amnesty International and various sites identifying with the Falun Gong spiritual movement, which the Chinese government has accused of being a cult. However, users can access other news sites including ABCnews.com, the British Broadcasting Corporation and USA Today. 
Until early this month, the site for The New York Times on the Web was blocked. The blocking was lifted after an interview with President Jiang Zemin by top editors at The Times in which President Jiang was specifically questioned about the blocking of the site. 
Chinese Web users have nevertheless found methods to get around the censorship. In a recent study by researchers at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, more than a quarter of Internet users admitted to occasionally using Internet proxy computers, which work similarly to those of Safeweb, while 10 percent admitted to frequent use. That was much higher than was expected, said Guo Liang, one of the researchers.
Among the most popular masquerade services is Safeweb, an 18-month-old company. The technology, dubbed Triangle Boy (after a character in an episode of the sitcom "Seinfeld"), can fool an electronic filter into thinking Web content is coming from a benign computer server instead of a blocked site like Human Rights Watch.
But the service has become a target for the Chinese government, which has engaged in a cat-and-mouse game with Safeweb.
"They are becoming increasingly aggressive," said Stephen Hsu, chief executive of Safeweb. "We get these frantic e-mails from users saying they are totally cut off now."
In addition, Safeweb says, the Chinese government is now blocking e-mail sent to users who request Triangle Boy e-mail addresses. As a response, Safeweb is encouraging users to sign up for free Web-based e-mail accounts at non-Chinese services like Hotmail and Yahoo.
Part of the proposal being financed by the International Broadcasting Bureau would have the Triangle Boy servers change their Internet addresses on a regular basis -- perhaps as frequently as every few hours -- to make them more difficult for the Chinese government to find and block.
Despite government efforts to rein in the Internet, it is playing an emerging political role in China. The study by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, one of the most rigorous Internet studies in China to date, found that 67.5 percent of adult users believe the Internet gives people more opportunity to criticize government policies. And more than 74 percent agree the Internet allows people to "express their political views" and to learn about politics.
"We want to force the Chinese government to accept the pro-democracy consequences of the Internet," said Dr. Hsu. "Up until now the Chinese government has been amazingly successful at having their cake and eating it too."

Economy Edges Up 0.2%, Bolstered by Consumers
The American economy grew more slowly in the second quarter than at any time in eight years, the Commerce Department reported. Still, the new numbers suggested that if consumers continue to spend at their present level, the nation may avoid a recession.
 Instead of shrinking in the second quarter, as many forecasters had feared, the nation's output of goods and services rose by 0.2 percent at an annual rate. Consumers kept the economy above water, stepping up their spending in the spring and early summer -- and, possibly, setting the stage for stronger growth in the current quarter. Page A1. 

Stocks Slump on Economic Data

Computer Associates Directors Survive Challenge

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

DATELINE: ISLANDIA, N.Y., Aug. 29 

 BODY:
Computer Associates International soundly defeated an effort yesterday by the dissident investor Sam Wyly to replace four directors, including Charles Wang, the company's founder and chairman.
 At least 60 percent of the shares were voted in favor of the current board, while fewer than 20 percent were cast for Mr. Wyly's slate, Computer Associates said. The remaining shareholders abstained. 
 "The entire C.A. slate has been re-elected," the company treasurer, Michael A. McElroy, said at 10:40 a.m. at Computer Associates' annual meeting yesterday, as a ballroom full of Computer Associates shareholders and employees erupted in robust applause. More than 1,500 people, mostly supporters of the company, attended the meeting, which was held in a hotel across from the company's headquarters on Long Island.
"So I guess we know what we're going to do tomorrow," Mr. Wang said after the applause died down.
The announcement turned what had been a tense gathering into a corporate pep rally, punctuated by several long waves of applause for Mr. Wang and Sanjay Kumar, the chief executive. 
"We should all get down on our hands and knees and kiss the ground that they walk on," one shareholder bubbled during the question-and-answer session. "I love you, too, Dad," Mr. Wang said.
The vote's outcome did not come as a shock. Nearly 30 percent of the company's shares had been pledged to the incumbent board since the fight began. As a result, Mr. Wyly's investment company, Ranger Governance, would have had to win more than 70 percent of the remaining shares to oust Mr. Wang. 
Still, the size of the company's victory was unexpected. Mr. Wyly, a 65-year-old Texas billionaire, had spent about $10 million this summer to argue that the company needed a new direction after a half-decade in which its stock underperformed both the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and other software companies.
Those arguments seemed to resonate with advocates of corporate governance. Mr. Wyly's bid was supported by Institutional Shareholder Services and by Proxy Monitor, which advise investors how to vote in proxy fights. The California Public Employees Retirement System, the nation's largest pension fund, also supported Mr. Wyly. 
Computer Associates has had credibility problems on Wall Street at least since 1998, when it announced a huge revenue shortfall shortly after giving its three top executives a $1.1 billion bonus. Last October, the company confounded investors again by changing its accounting practices, making it all but impossible for investors to compare current results with those of previous years. Under standard accounting rules, Computer Associates will lose more than $1 billion this year.
But Mr. Wang and Mr. Kumar apparently convinced investors that Ranger's proposal would have left the company with a divided board and complicated its turnaround efforts. The company's largest investors, including Fidelity Investments, the Boston mutual fund giant, which owns more than 10 percent of Computer Associates, overwhelmingly supported the current board.
As for small investors, at least those at the meeting said they were satisfied with Computer Associates' management and suspicious of Mr. Wyly's motives. "I thought his ideas were not good for the company," a shareholder, Melvin Young, said.
In addition, shareholders who lived on Long Island said they feared Mr. Wyly would move Computer Associates' headquarters to Texas, where he lives. Computer Associates is "good for the Long Island economy," said Nina Smith, a retired teacher who lives in Huntington.
Computer Associates shares fell 71 cents, to $32, yesterday.
At a news conference after the meeting, Mr. Wang called the proxy battle "a rather sobering experience." He said he believed that Computer Associates needed to reach out to investors, the media and clients. "The main takeaway for me is we need to continue to communicate all the things we're doing for our customers."
Mr. Wang also urged Mr. Wyly to respect the shareholders' decision. "We hope he goes away and lets us continue to build our business," Mr. Wang said. "There is no plan to call him, there is no plan to meet with him."
But Mr. Wyly may not be finished jousting with Mr. Wang. Only a few minutes after Mr. Wang called for Mr. Wyly to disappear, Mr. Wyly held his own news conference to vow that Ranger would continue to monitor Computer Associates. 
Mr. Wyly said that Mr. Kumar had promised institutional shareholders in the days before the vote that within a few months it would replace at least 2 of its 10 board members with new directors. After winning the vote, the company has already begun to back off that pledge, Mr. Wyly said.
"There's a question of performance -- will they perform," Mr. Wyly said in a telephone interview yesterday. "If they don't keep the promises, they're probably looking at another challenge."
Mr. Kumar said Computer Associates planned to appoint new directors. But he said he had never promised publicly or privately that current board members would resign if new members were added. In an article last Friday, Newsday quoted Mr. Kumar saying, "There are people on the current board who have said, if new people come on, that they have done their service to shareholders."
"We have not made any assurance to anyone that any director will leave," Mr. Kumar said yesterday. He added that he expected all the current directors to serve at least until the company's next annual meeting.

HEADLINE: Data Suggests Weak Growth, Not a Recession 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The American economy grew more slowly in the second quarter than at any time in eight years, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. Still, the new numbers suggested to many economists that if consumers continued to spend at their present level, the nation could avoid a recession.
 Instead of shrinking in the second quarter, as many forecasters had feared, the nation's output of goods and services rose 0.2 percent, at an annual rate, the government said. Consumers kept the economy above water, stepping up their spending in the spring and early summer -- and, possibly, setting the stage for stronger growth in the current quarter. 
 Because consumers purchased a lot of merchandise that was already sitting on shelves, inventories fell $38.4 billion, a much bigger reduction than the Commerce Department had originally thought. That suggests merchants now may have to begin placing new orders to restock their shelves. If so, the stepped-up industrial production needed to fill the new orders would give the economy a lift. 
That was the widely shared hope yesterday, even though stock prices fell after an initial rally. Page C7. 
"The mix was pretty favorable," said Peter Hooper, chief domestic economist at Deutsche Bank North America.
"The inventory sell-off was more than we thought it would be, and that paves the way for a pickup," he added
For a nation braced for the start of a recession, the Commerce Department's announcement that the economy grew at all in the second quarter was in itself a lift, even though the gain was smaller than the department's initial estimate last month that output had expanded 0.7 percent in the April-to-June period.
Analysts said the new report suggested that the country might in time look back on a slowdown that lasted many months. It has already lasted since the spring of last year, when the boom suddenly gave way to tepid growth of less than 2 percent in each of the last four quarters.
"My best guess is that we will see a small positive number for the third quarter, maybe about 1 percent, possibly a bit more," said Dean Baker, an economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research. 
Other forecasters, more optimistic than Mr. Baker, predicted that growth would reach 2 percent in the current quarter.
That would be a substantial improvement on the minuscule growth in the second quarter, but not enough to stop the layoffs and shrinking corporate profits that have been hallmarks of the weak economy over the last year. 
"We have $40 billion in tax rebate checks to support the consumer in the coming weeks," noted Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch.
Stock prices initially rose on the news that the gross domestic product had managed to expand in the second quarter rather than contract. Several Wall Street analysts suggested that the growth, although slight, would suppress talk of recession in the media, and the worries that such speculation spurs. But a sell-off soon developed, perhaps in response to less happy details in the Commerce Department's latest report. The Dow Jones Industrial average fell 131.13 points, or 1.28 percent, to close at 10,090.9, its lowest level since April 11. The Nasdaq was down 21.81 points, or 1.17 percent.
Corporate profits, which had shot up in the late 1990's, declined for the third consecutive quarter. Pretax profits were 14.7 percent below their levels in June of last year. 
Capital spending, also a big source of strength in the booming 1990's, declined for the second consecutive quarter, shrinking at an unusually large annual rate of 14.6 percent. That was slightly more than the 13.6 percent drop in the government's original estimate last month. With profits shrinking, there is not much incentive to invest in new computers, machinery and all the other tools used to produce goods and services. 
Still, profits fell more slowly in the second quarter than in the first -- a 3.6 percent drop versus 6.8 percent. "I would interpret that as fairly rosy compared with where we were in the winter and spring," said Brent Moulton, director of the division that calculates the gross domestic product at the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis.
A broad inflation index that is included in the output report -- a broader measure than the widely cited Consumer Price Index -- suggested that the inflation rate was inching down. The index of gross domestic purchase prices, which covers purchases by households, business and government, rose at a very mild 1.4 percent annual rate in the second quarter compared with 2.7 percent in the first. 
A falling inflation rate removes an obstacle to further reductions in interest rates when the Federal Reserve's policy makers meet again in October. To spur borrowing and encourage spending, the Fed has already cut short-term interest rates seven times since January. 
There were other drags on the economy. With growth slowing in Europe and Asia, exports from the United States fell more than originally estimated. And government spending was slightly weaker than originally thought, particularly at the state and local levels. 
Even more troubling, in Mr. Hooper's view, market indexes, having drifted down in recent weeks, are near their lows of last spring.
"If stock prices drop noticeably more, then the likelihood of consumers' continuing to expand their spending, even at the moderate second-quarter pace of 2.5 percent a year, goes down," he said. "And if consumer spending stops growing, that means either that inventories will go up tremendously or firms will have to cut production."
Other analysts noted that if many employers emulate the Ford Motor Company's newly announced decision to eliminate executive bonuses, such actions could also translate into a drop in consumer spending.
So far, though, consumers do not seem to be pulling back. Retail sales, for example, rose in July, except for motor vehicles. And factory production, which had been falling for months, stopped doing so last month. Meanwhile, American workers' wages continued to rise in the second quarter faster than inflation. 
"As long as the consumer holds up," Mr. Hooper said, "we are likely to see this sort of improvement."

HEADLINE: Ford Motor Will Not Pay Annual Bonus ToManagers 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Aug. 29 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company, which is struggling with falling auto sales and the Firestone tire recall, said today that it would not pay bonuses this year to 6,000 middle-level and senior managers, including its chief executive, Jacques A. Nasser.
 This would be the first time since 1992 that Ford has not paid bonuses to executives. The announcement came months earlier than usual for major corporations to act on executive compensation. Most companies generally do not decide the level of executive bonuses until late in the fourth quarter, when they are able to gauge full-year financial results. 
 Ford bases its bonuses primarily on whether the company meets profitability and customer satisfaction goals, NickSharkey, a company spokesman, said. The automaker paid $440 million in bonuses in 2001, or about $75,000 per eligible employee. Mr. Nasser received a $7.7 million bonus last year, as part of his total compensation of $17.8 million.
Ford's action increased concern among economists that other companies might quickly take similar steps, using the sluggish economy as an excuse. If so, the impact could go far beyond the executive suite, because many companies' employee compensation plans, like profit-sharing, are tied to the same financial criteria as payments to executives.
As much as $30 billion is paid out each year in variable employee compensation, including executive bonuses, said Richard Berner, chief United States economist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. The three big Detroit auto companies paid $1 billion last year in employee and executive compensation. Half of it went to members of the United Auto Workers union, who receive profit sharing under their contracts with the auto companies. That $1 billion is the equivalent of 2.6 percent of the companies' annual payrolls. 
If more companies decrease compensation plans, "the slump in corporate profits will thus translate into a bigger hit to consumer incomes than in the past," Mr. Berner said. "The question is how big. It's one of those things that makes you think consumer spending growth will be restrained in the future."
Word of Ford's decision not to give a bonus to managers took a while to trickle out. Ford's top 300 executives learned of the decision on Aug. 1, in a memorandum from David Murphy, the Ford executive vice president who is in charge of human resources. Mr. Sharkey said it was left to those executives to share the news with their subordinates, either personally or in memos.
The move, which was not announced publicly by Ford, was reported yesterday in The Detroit News and confirmed by the company.
Mr. Sharkey said the company decided to take the action after Mr. Nasser and other senior managers reviewed the automaker's second-quarter results, which it reported on July 18. The company lost $550 million, including a $2.1 billion after-tax charge to replace Firestone tires on a range of vehicles, including the Ford Explorer. Since August of last year, Ford has replaced 14 million Firestone tires and it is facing many lawsuits from consumers over accidents involving the Explorer.
Ford has suffered most among Big Three companies from a downturn in sales of cars and trucks, with annual sales down 14 percent through July. On Aug. 17, Ford said it will take charges of up to $900 million the rest of this year, and cut up to 5,000 white collar jobs, or 10 percent of its salaried work force. And, it advised analysts to reduce their full-year profit forecasts from $1.20 a share to 70 cents a share. 
Many fear the worst is not over. Nicholas Scheele, named on July 12 as group vice president for Ford's North American operations, has been drafting a turnaround plan that the company expects to unveil before the end of the year.
Stephen Girsky, Morgan Stanley's auto industry analyst, said the bonus move is meant to alert Ford employees, suppliers, dealers and others connected to the company that Mr. Scheele's plan will mean more pain. "This is part of a bigger agenda that they are setting the stage for," Mr. Girsky said.
He sees an increased likelihood that Ford will have to cut its dividend. However, Ford's chief financial officer, Martin Inglis, said earlier this month that the dividend is safe "and that's still true," Mr. Sharkey said.
Ford's chief competitor, the General Motors Corporation, has made no decision yet on whether it will eliminate its executive bonuses, said a G.M. spokesman, Brian Akre. G.M. pays bonuses to about 3,500 executives, basing them on a series of financial, customer-satisfaction and other targets that must be met for payments to be made.
Through the second quarter, G.M. had fallen short of achieving those goals, said a company official close to the data, but the automaker is not ready to declare that bonuses will not be paid.
Chrysler, which suffered deep losses in 2000, did not pay bonuses last year, and has deferred raises to employees as part of a corporate overhaul announced in January. About 1,500 executives are eligible for bonuses. 
Under the terms of the 1998 DaimlerChrysler merger, this is the final year in which American executives will be paid under the compensation standards that were in place when Chrysler was acquired by Daimler-Benz. Generally, German executives are paid lower salaries than their American counterparts. Chrysler has not yet determined what its new compensation standards will be or whether they will change.
Outside the auto industry, cases in which compensation is being canceled are starting to accumulate. On July 31, Media General Inc., the publishing company based in Richmond, Va., told its 3,200 employees not to expect their annual holiday bonus, which in the past has equaled one week's pay or just more than $500 a person. The step will save the company $1.9 million.
Said Mr. Berner of Morgan Stanley, "A lot of things will start coming out of the weeds. We don't even know the scope of this thing."

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: Belgium: Economic Growth Declines 

BYLINE:  By Paul Meller (NYT) 

 BODY:
 Belgium's economic growth fell 0.6 percent in the second quarter of this year compared with the previous quarter, the first such decline in two and a half years, according to figures released by the Belgian National Bank. 
Analysts said the slowdown in the United States, and the effect it had on Belgium's neighbor Germany, was a considerable factor in the decline. According to the report, imports declined 2 percent, but exports fell 6.5 percent. Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, above, said he expected the economy to grow 2 percent this year and 2.5 percent to 3 percent in 2002. Paul Meller (NYT)

HEADLINE: Fair to Fill 400 Teacher Posts Draws 3,000 

 BODY:
About 3,000 people showed up at a job fair in Brooklyn yesterday to apply for 400 jobs as New York City school teachers, Board of Education officials said.
 Margie Feinberg, a spokeswoman for the board, said the turnout for the fair was the largest that anyone could remember and twice what board officials had expected. 
About half of the applicants had no teaching credentials, she said, and they appeared to be recent college graduates looking for work. The job fair, at a hotel in Downtown Brooklyn, had been advertised in New York City newspapers. 
 "This may be an illustration of the state of the economy," Ms. Feinberg said.
"Many of the applicants came just because they saw an advertisement for a job, without realizing they needed credentials." 
Many of the applicants with credentials were certified as elementary school teachers, but the board was seeking those certified in areas facing a teacher shortage: math, Spanish, science, special education and bilingual education.
Ms. Feinberg said she did not yet know how many of the 400 vacancies had been filled, but she said the board expected to fill all teaching posts by Wednesday, when school begins.

Israelis Leave Arab Town After Halt in the Shooting
The Israeli army withdrew its tanks and soldiers from Beit Jala in the West Bank early today, ending Israel's longest stay in a Palestinian-ruled area after a little over two days. Israel had agreed to pull out if Palestinian gunmen there stopped shooting at Gilo, a nearby Israeli neighborhood. Reports said the gunfire in Beit Jala stopped around midnight, and the Israeli forces began moving out five hours later. A8

Secretary of State Colin L. Powell phoned Yasir Arafat with assurances that the United States was pressing Israel to leave Beit Jala, and then he called Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his foreign minister, Shimon Peres, to request that withdrawal, administration officials said. But it was not clear whether that figured in Israel's decision. A8

HEADLINE: Odds Are Dim for European Rate Cut 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
Ernst Welteke, a council member of the European Central Bank, said today that it was not the bank's job to fine-tune economic growth, suggesting that policy makers will not reduce interest rates when they meet on Thursday. 
 "The E.C.B. doesn't have the job of steering the economy," Mr. Welteke said in a speech at a banking conference in Frankfurt. "The best contribution monetary policy can make to growth and employment is to keep prices stable." 
 The speech was the first by an official of the bank in a month and came a week after figures showed the German economy stalled last quarter.
"I thought they'd cut rates tomorrow, but there's no point expecting that any more," said Guillaume Sciard, a money manager at Barclays Asset Management France in Paris. 
The central bank's policy makers have kept rates unchanged since May 10, the only time they lowered the price of money this year, by a quarter-point. The Bank of England has cut its main rate four times this year. The Federal Reserve has cut United States rates seven times in the period.
"The ability to fine-tune economic growth is obviously being overestimated," Mr. Welteke said.
The European Central Bank's main responsibility is to combat inflation.
The German economy, Europe's largest, stalled in the second quarter, while Italy's shrank 0.1 percent. The weakening economies mean inflation will probably ease in coming months. 
The inflation rate in the dozen nations using the euro declined to 2.8 percent in July from 3.4 percent in May. The bank says it wants to keep inflation below 2 percent, a goal it has missed for 14 months. Preliminary figures from Germany and Italy suggest it is likely to decline again in August. 
Even so, annual money supply growth, which the central bank uses as a gauge of future inflation, rose in July, to 6.4 percent from 6.1 percent in June. The bank has said it wants to keep growth to 4.5 percent.

PERSON: Michael L. Dertouzos 

HEADLINE: Michael L. Dertouzos, 64, Computer Visionary, Dies 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
Michael L. Dertouzos, a computer scientist with a knack for explaining the ways that high technology affects people's lives, died on Monday night in Boston. He was 64. 
 The cause of death is unknown, pending an autopsy. 
 Mr. Dertouzos, a faculty member of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology since 1964, became the director of the institute's Laboratory for Computer Sciences in 1974. Under his leadership, the laboratory developed many of the technologies that underlie today's computers, including one of the best-known methods for scrambling data, the RSA encryption system, and innovations that helped bring the World Wide Web into popular use. 
Charles M. Vest, the president of M.I.T., described Mr. Dertouzos as "larger than life," saying: "He was at once a leader, builder, visionary and caring human being. Few individuals have so personally and profoundly shaped their institutions and professional fields."
Mr. Dertouzos was instrumental in creating a home within his labs for the World Wide Web Consortium, a forum of companies and organizations that promotes the development of the Web. He recruited Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Web, to the labs.
Though he worked in some of the highest realms of computer science, Mr. Dertouzos always insisted that technology be designed to serve people and not the other way around. In 1999, for example, the labs announced the "Oxygen Project," a $50 million effort undertaken with the M.I.T. Artificial Intelligence Laboratory to make computers easier to use, the institute said, and "as natural a part of our environment as the air we breathe."
Mr. Berners-Lee, in a tribute posted on the Web (www.w3.org/People/ Berners-Lee/2001/MLD.html), wrote, "Michael had been promoting the vision of the information marketplace long before the Web came along." 
In the tribute, Mr. Berners-Lee recalled Mr. Dertouzos's ability to cut through confusion to get things done. It was early in the life of his fledgling organization, and he recalled that the small group was "frankly quite adrift." At that moment, he recalled, Mr. Dertouzos "took us in hand" and held "one dramatic eight-hour meeting in which the mission, goals and structure of the team was in place, and everything looked at once logical and possible."
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Berners-Lee recalled his friend as being "very effective -- but unbelievably human and warm at the end of the day, and much more interested in the human than in the project." 
Michael Leonidas Dertouzos (pronounced der-TOO-zohs) was born in Athens on Nov. 5, 1936. His father was an admiral in the Greek navy, and his mother was a concert pianist. Although he recalled dreaming of going to M.I.T. as a young man, he won a Fulbright Scholarship to attend the University of Arkansas, where he earned bachelor's and master's degrees. He worked briefly at Baldwin Piano and then entered the M.I.T. doctorate program, earning the degree in 1964; he never left.
During the Carter administration, Mr. Dertouzos was chairman of a White House advisory group that helped to redesign computer networks there, and represented the United States in a delegation to the 1995 G-7 Conference on the Information Society. He was co-chairman of the World Economic Forum on the Network Society in Davos, Switzerland, in 1998. In his free time, he was an avid sailor and woodworker.
Mr. Dertouzos, a resident of Weston, Mass., married Hadwig Gofferje in 1961. They divorced in 1993. In 1998 he married Catherine Liddell, who survives him. He is also survived by two children, Alexandra Dertouzos Rowe and Leonidas M. Dertouzos of Boston, and a granddaughter. 
A scientist in his own right, Mr. Dertouzos held patents on such inventions as a thermal printer, a graphical display system and a graphic tablet. He also tried to communicate his vision of science and technology to a broader audience in eight books, including his last, "The Unfinished Revolution: Human-Centered Computers and What They Can Do For Us" (Harper-Collins), which was published this year.
He foresaw technological change in his books and speeches. In 1976, he predicted that there would be a personal computer in one of every three homes by the mid-1990's, and described the vast online information marketplace that the Internet would become in antediluvian 1980. 
"He is one of the truly articulate spokesmen for the field," said David D. Clark, a senior research scientist at the laboratory. "It's a big loss for us, because there are very few people who had their arms so much around what our field is, and what it should aspire to be." 
In "The Unfinished Revolution," Mr. Dertouzos sought an elusive harmony between technology and humanity. He wrote that intractable problems like the ethics of genetic engineering, school violence -- everything from choosing a school to running a nation -- would require the kind of thinking that transcended "pure technology" and "pure faith." He wrote, "We need to bring these back together if we want to find our way through the maze of an increasingly complex world."
Bridging that gap is difficult, he wrote, but essential.
"We will be better off and we will be finishing the ultimate Unfinished Revolution," he wrote, "if we reach for these goals using all our human dimensions in concert, standing once again in awe before the sunset, the wheel, and what may lie behind them."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
A tarnished new economy loses more luster with revised productivity data.

BYLINE:  By Jeff Madrick; Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine and a collection of essays, "Unconventional Wisdom: Alternative Perspectives on the New Economy." He teaches at Cooper Union. E-mail: challenge@ mesharpe.com.

 BODY:
THE overly romantic faith in a new economy has already done plenty of damage. Just ask all those investors in Nasdaq stocks. But recent revisions to the productivity data reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics show how thin the new- economy thinking has been all along.
 First, the revisions cast doubt on a central new-economy argument by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and others. They argued that accelerating productivity gains in 1999 and 2000 were evidence that the computer revolution was at last providing a foundation for more rapid economic growth in the long run. Those gains, however, turn out mostly to have been the product of a counting error. 
 Second, the revisions seriously call into question the 10-year projections of federal budget surpluses made by the Congressional Budget Office, on which this year's $1.35 trillion tax cut was based. 
Third, the long-term trend of productivity, if properly measured, looks significantly slower than was thought only a couple of months ago -- and, contrary to some reports, remains well below historical rates of growth.
Productivity is the amount of goods and services the nation produces per hour of work. Only when the nation's businesses produce more per worker can they increase profits and raise wages. The growth of gross domestic product is the sum of increases in productivity and the labor force.
Many have long been arguing that information technology is helping business raise productivity substantially and, indeed, from 1995 to 2000, productivity was reported to have grown at nearly 2.9 percent a year. That was double the 1.4 percent rate of growth from 1973 to 1995.
But largely because of overestimates of computer software sales and consumer spending, the actual rate of productivity growth was, in fact, only slightly above 2.5 percent a year. This amounts to a reduction of somewhat less than four-tenths of a percentage point a year.
Can such a reduction in the annual rate of growth make that much of a difference? The answer is a resounding yes, especially when considering its timing.
For one thing, the faster rates of productivity growth in the late 1990's, which lent so much confidence to Mr. Greenspan and others about the maturing of the new economy, were significantly reduced. The 2.6 percent growth rate in 1999 was cut to 2.3 percent, and the stunning 4.3 percent rate in 2000, which converted many a skeptic to the new- economy cause, was cut to 3 percent.
This is hardly a deepening computer revolution. To the contrary, the more modest gains add weight to the argument by the economist Robert Gordon of Northwestern University that the rapid productivity gains of the late 1990's were largely a result of a cyclical pickup in growth. They were in line with gains typically made in the faster-growth years of past business cycles, when companies were forced to use labor more efficiently.
Furthermore, the projections of 10-year budget surpluses made by the budget office now look highly dubious. In January, it increased its 10-year estimate of productivity growth to 2.7 percent a year from 2.2 percent based on the rapid five-year growth in the late 1990's. With such an assumption, the budget office projected a $5.6 trillion federal budget surplus over 10 years.
The 2.7 percent projection was disturbingly optimistic even before the revisions. It was only slightly less than the rate of growth of the fastest five years of the business cycle. Typically, economists believe a long-term trend is the average rate of growth over the course of an entire business cycle. From 1990 -- the start of the cycle -- to 2000, productivity growth was closer to just 2 percent a year. 
With the revisions, the budget office productivity forecast is even faster than the actual rate of growth in productivity in the last half of the 1990's. This week, the budget office adjusted down its forecast of the future surplus and cut the expected long-term rate of annual productivity growth to 2.5 percent. But this is still too optimistic. Further downward adjustments are almost certain when the next forecast comes out in January.
Finally, when analyzed for how much income higher productivity might add to the economy, the long-term trend of annual productivity growth is probably weaker than 2 percent. This is because G.D.P. now includes software sales as an investment. As Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, points out, investment in computer software becomes obsolete much more quickly than does investment in more traditional equipment.
Such investment contributes less to business revenue and profit than does traditional investment and therefore creates less income to pay higher wages and taxes. Businesses deduct depreciation from their profits to account for this obsolescence.
If depreciation were deducted to measure productivity, it would have grown 35-hundredths of a percentage point a year more slowly than reported from 1995 to 2000. This would have cut the average rate of productivity over the course of the cycle to about 1.8 percent a year.
One last important point. Some argue that an annual rate of productivity growth of even 1.8 percent or so is almost equal to the long-term average of about 2 percent since 1870. So why worry?
But since the 1960's, and especially since the 1980's, G.D.P. and productivity data have been adjusted upward to account for the improving quality of products. No such adjustments have been made to the historical data. Had they been made, they would probably have raised the long-term rate of productivity growth to 2.5 or 3 percent.
None of this means there was no improvement in America's economic prospects in the late 1990's. There is perhaps an increase of five-tenths of a percentage point a year in the long-term productivity growth trend, and over time, this will be significant.
But promises of a once-in-a-century transformation are not supported by the facts. More disturbing, such optimism on the part of influential Washington policy makers has provided the foundation for the $1.35 trillion tax cut the nation now has to live with, and perhaps more mistakes to come.

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN; 
Ferrer's Vision of the 'Other New York'

BYLINE:  By DEXTER FILKINS 

 BODY:
 Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president and mayoral candidate, is broadcasting a new television commercial, scheduled to begin today on New York stations.

PRODUCER -- Axelrod & Associates

ON THE SCREEN -- The commercial opens with a split frame, with a smiling Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani on one side, and a succession of scenes on the other: a Yankees ticker-tape parade, the New York Stock Exchange and Times Square at night. The ad cuts to a listless schoolboy, to a parent cradling a child, to apartment buildings and a couple walking with police lights and sirens behind them. Mr. Ferrer speaks to an applauding group. His campaign slogans flash on the screen: "The Ferrer Plan: Qualified Teachers in every classroom." "More after-school programs." "Promote Community Policing. Ban Racial Profiling."

THE SCRIPT -- A narrator says: "In Rudy's New York, everything is fine. But how about the other New York, where our schools are struggling, and one out of four working people have no health plan? Where housing costs are out of reach, and fear divides people and police?

"Fernando Ferrer is fighting to make New York work for all of us, to put a qualified teacher in every classroom and after-school programs in every neighborhood, to protect our safety and our rights.

"Democrat Fernando Ferrer," the narrator concludes, "A mayor for all New Yorkers."

ACCURACY -- Mr. Ferrer has campaigned on a pitch to "the other New York," the one he says has been left out by Mayor Giuliani and the economic boom. But polls show that many poor New Yorkers have benefited from the reductions in crime and years of economic growth. Schools and housing, though, are listed as top concerns.

SCORECARD -- The images are intended to draw the contrasts Mr. Ferrer has made in his campaign. This commercial is also a direct appeal to minority residents, particularly black and Latino New Yorkers, whose relations with the police have been strained over police misconduct issues.

HEADLINE: CHANCELLOR MAKES A $150 MILLION CUT IN SCHOOL BUDGET 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
After weeks of bickering with City Hall over the Board of Education's budget, Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy said yesterday that he had ordered $150 million in immediate program cuts, including less spending for after-school classes, athletic and arts programs, lab equipment, computer software and teacher training. 
 The cuts, which amount to 1.3 percent of the Board of Education's $11.5 billion budget, result from what Mr. Levy called "a significant shortfall" in revenue the board had expected from the city and the state this year. Many of the programs are favored by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani or have only recently regained spending levels they reached before the 70's fiscal crisis. 
 The last-minute cuts are not likely to smooth the way for next week's school opening, when problems often come to light. 
In human terms, the cuts mean that more than 2,300 jobs would be eliminated, Mr. Levy said, including 1,406 classroom paraprofessionals and administrative aides, 558 teachers who would have been hired to help reduce class sizes in the lower grades, and nearly 400 supervisors and administrators. Many of those cuts, however, will result from vacancies that will go unfilled or from the merging of existing positions. 
In addition to the $150 million in cuts, new programs costing $40 million will be deferred until next school year, Mr. Levy said, including the expansion of classroom libraries and Saturday classes in science and in English for non-native speakers. Special in-school suspension centers for disruptive students, a change ardently sought by the teachers' union, also will be delayed.
Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker and a Democratic candidate for mayor, continues to press Mr. Giuliani to direct more money to the board, but Mr. Levy said the start of school next Wednesday and Thursday forced him to act. 
There was still the possibility of a last-minute decision that would prevent some of the cuts. Late yesterday, Mr. Vallone released a draft agreement, involving his office, the mayor and the board, to release $80 million of additional money that would be earmarked for some of the after-school and weekend programs. It was unclear, though, what conditions Mr. Giuliani would set for his consent.
In explaining his need to act quickly, Mr. Levy said: "As of today, we face a $190 million budget shortfall from both state and city funds, a problem that is largely the result of increases in mandated costs, including rising labor contract expenses, increases for special-education contracts, and the need to recruit certified teachers to meet Regents requirements. I cannot in good conscience start schools without any preparation for the shortfall."
The cuts announced yesterday are in addition to the $100 million in administrative savings that will result this year from Mr. Levy's plan to restructure the schools' central administration. That plan, which was announced earlier this month, included eliminating or transferring 1,200 administrative jobs and would save $300 million over three years, Mr. Levy said. 
Many of the cuts announced yesterday would be put into effect beginning next week by local district superintendents, who will decide what specific jobs and programs to eliminate.
The new cuts intensify an increasingly bitter war of words between Mr. Levy and Mayor Giuliani, who has consistently portrayed the Board of Education as a fiscal sinkhole that should be able to squeeze plenty of waste from its nearly $12 billion budget.
Mr. Giuliani was once again dismissive of Mr. Levy's plans. He said yesterday that Mr. Levy was "trying to get attention" and that the cuts were "intended to help other political campaigns." He declined to say which candidates he meant, adding, "You'll have to figure that out," but his comment seemed most likely to be intended for Mr. Vallone or Alan G. Hevesi.
Mr. Hevesi, the city comptroller, has been urging that the mayor provide more money to the Board of Education. When City Hall reached a budget agreement this summer, it included a clause saying that the board would receive the additional money if it trimmed its administrative structure enough. 
Last week, Mr. Vallone also urged the mayor to agree to restore money that the city was withholding from the board's budget, saying that Mr. Levy appeared to have met those conditions.
But Mr. Vallone has objected to Mr. Levy's statements that the administrative changes amounted to actual cuts, since the new budget is $200 million larger than last year's. Mr. Levy, however, says that mandated cost increases and the effect of inflation cut the board's spending power by $120 million below last year.
Since the city budget was adopted in June, Mr. Levy has warned that it left the board short of the money it needs to keep existing programs at their current levels. Mr. Levy also warned that without additional money, many of the programs championed by Mr. Giuliani in his State of the City and budget addresses earlier this year could not be started. 
Close to half of the 2,300 jobs that would be eliminated were to be filled by members of the United Federation of Teachers. The president of the teachers' union, Randi Weingarten, said yesterday that the budgetary dispute was "an unnecessary crisis" created by "legislative gridlock and political infighting."
Some longtime observers of city politics and the school system said the contemplated cuts were remarkable in light of the city's overall robust financial situation. 
Noreen Connell, executive director of the Educational Priorities Panel, a coalition of civic groups, noted that the city budget passed in June included $500 million in tax cuts. "Why should the Board of Education be the banker for tax cuts that all of the city's budget monitors viewed as a bad idea?" she said.
Others gave Mr. Levy more of the blame. The Manhattan borough president, C. Virginia Fields, said cuts could have been made without affecting students so directly. "I don't believe enough reductions have been made at the central Board of Education, where there is an infamous bloated bureaucracy, and where substantial savings can be realized that could back into the classrooms," Ms. Fields said. 
While Mr. Levy might have been able to delay the cuts, Robert Berne, the vice president for academic affairs at New York University and a longtime observer of the Board of Education, said that doing so would be inconsistent with Mr. Levy's management style. 
"It's obvious that there's a huge game of chicken going on here," he said. "I know the school system well enough to know there is not $190 million of painless cuts that can be made. These cuts are going to have effects on real kids who will not learn as much as a result."

HEADLINE: Boasts in 6-Way Race: Experience and Endorsements 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Among the myriad open City Council seats this year, few have attracted as many candidates with the political credentials and connections as those in the six-way race in the Democratic primary in the 39th Council District.
 The candidates' resumes cover the spectrum of local politics in what is commonly known as brownstone Brooklyn, but their names are known outside the borough and each one can boast of influential endorsements. 
 Steven R. Banks, the director of the Homeless Rights Project of the Legal Aid Society, has made a name for himself as an advocate for the homeless.
John W. Carroll is president of a powerful Democratic club in Brooklyn, and has also served as counsel to several neighborhood and preservation groups. 
Bill de Blasio, a member of the community school board in District 15, is a veteran Democratic strategist who worked for Andrew M. Cuomo at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and was the manager of Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign last year. 
Paul Bader, a longtime neighborhood advocate who owns a print and design shop, is married to United States Representative Nydia M. Velazquez.
Craig H. Hammerman has been the district manager of Community Board 6 for 11 years. 
And Anthony J. Pugliese is a carpenter who has been a longtime community activist and an organizer for his union.
The district stretches from the relatively affluent Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens sections of Brooklyn through a portion of Park Slope and Kensington and into Borough Park.
For the last 10 years, the district has been represented by City Councilman Stephen DiBrienza. But Mr. DiBrienza is barred under the city's term-limit laws from running for re-election and is now seeking the Democratic nomination for public advocate.
The race in the 39th District is being watched not only because of its candidates, but because the district's campaign issues are as disparate as its neighborhood identities are distinct. In some areas, there is concern about the proposed restructuring of the Gowanus Expressway. Most of the candidates support a plan to replace the highway with a tunnel. In other areas, there are great concerns about skyrocketing rents as developers find new projects to lure higher-paying tenants.
Mr. Bader, 48, has established strong ties through nearly 30 years of involvement in civic groups in Carroll Gardens and beyond. In this campaign he has spoken with particular passion about the Council's role in ensuring that city contracts are awarded in a cost-effective way, particularly amid projections of a slow economy.
The political roots of Mr. Carroll, 48, are in the Park Slope and Kensington sections of the borough, where he was a founding member of the Central Brooklyn Independent Democrats, a politically robust club in Brooklyn. Mr. Carroll, who once ran for State Senate, has emphasized his desire to study whether an electric power company owned by the city would provide cheaper rates than a privately owned one.
"A public power company doesn't have to produce a profit for its shareholders," Mr. Carroll said.
Mr. Banks, 44, emphasized his long history of legal work as evidence that he has the legislative background for the Council. "I've written dozens of laws that the Council members have passed," he said. "Through the work I have already done, I've gotten money for seniors and victims of domestic violence."
While all of the candidates discuss proposals to improve education, Mr. de Blasio, 40, said that his work on the school board had given him expertise on the subject. He talks about the role he played in developing secondary programs for the district. "We need to have an increase in teacher salaries, but the city also has to come up with the will to get hundreds of millions from the operating budget for public education," he said.
Mr. Pugliese, 47, said that his major thrust, if elected, would be to develop more programs to help middle-class residents in the district become homeowners. 
And Mr. Hammerman, 36, discussed the need for stepped-up police patrols in the district.
The politics of the district have made the race utterly unpredictable. Mr. Bader has been supported by Martin Connor, the Democratic leader of the State Senate, and Assemblywoman Joan Millman. Mr. de Blasio has been endorsed by former Mayor David N. Dinkins and many large unions, including the United Federation of Teachers.
Mr. Carroll has received the support of several local elected officials, including State Senator Marty Markowitz, who is running for Brooklyn borough president, and United States Representative Major Owens. And Mr. Banks has been endorsed by former Mayor Edward I. Koch and a number of advocacy groups. Mr. Pugliese has been endorsed by District Council 37, the city's largest municipal labor union.
Mr. de Blasio has raised the most in contributions, at $116,500. Mr. Banks is next, with nearly $105,000 (he has also raised money from more individual contributors -- nearly 700 -- than the other candidates). Mr. Pugliese has raised about $65,500, Mr. Bader about $53,500, Mr. Carroll about $45,600 and Mr. Hammerman reported contributions of about $31,400. All of the candidates have received the full $75,350 in city campaign matching funds, except for Mr. Pugliese, who has not received a payment as yet.
Handicapping this crowded race is even more complicated because the voters in the district have a history of being fiercely independent. "I don't know how much political endorsements matter in a race like this," Mr. Hammerman said. "What wins this race is grass-roots support."

HEADLINE: Council Endorsements: Brooklyn 

 BODY:
Brooklyn voters have a chance this year to enliven New York's City Council with the kind of energy, intelligence and independence unrivaled in city politics in many years. Here are our recommendations in seven important Democratic races in the Sept. 11 primary.
 33rd District (Downtown Brooklyn, Brooklyn Heights, Williamsburg, Greenpoint): David Yassky, a professor at Brooklyn Law School, was Charles Schumer's firepower when Mr. Schumer, now senator, was in the House of Representatives. He helped create the Brady bill and the Violence Against Women Act and helped get more than 6,000 new police officers on the streets of New York City. Mr. Yassky has an uphill battle against the Democratic organization's candidate, Steven Cohn. Mr. Cohn, a lawyer, has a long record of community activity, but he harks back to the city's old political patronage era rather than forward to something better. We enthusiastically endorse David Yassky. 
 35th District (Crown Heights, Prospect Heights, Clinton Hill, Fort Greene): Letitia James, a former assistant attorney general for Brooklyn, is the Democratic organization's candidate in this race. But Ms. James, who has compiled a fine record as a legislative counsel in Albany, seems to have the strength of character to chart an independent course. Her main opponent, Peter Williams, is the director of housing and community development for the National Urban League. Mr. Williams has an impressive background of city activism, but we endorse Letitia James, with the hope that she will recruit Mr. Williams to advise her on housing and development issues.
39th District (Borough Park, Kensington, Windsor Terrace, Park Slope, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill): Even in a year when the quality of City Council candidates is exceptional, this race stands out. Bill de Blasio, a local school board member, is better known as the campaign manager for Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate race. Steven Banks, a Legal Aid lawyer, has a national name for his work on behalf of the homeless. John Carroll is an attorney who pioneered the development of low- and moderate-income housing in his Windsor Terrace neighborhood. Any of the three would make a fine Council member, but we endorse Bill de Blasio, who has the most potential as leader for the district and the city. 
40th District (Central Brooklyn): Una Clarke is one of the many term-limited Council members attempting to bequeath her seat to a relative. Her daughter, Yvette Clarke, is a politically sophisticated candidate with experience in economic development. Another strong candidate is Jean Vernet, a community activist from the National Coalition for Haitian Rights. But he does not have the energy level that we think Ms. Clarke would bring to the job. Our endorsement goes to Yvette Clarke, in the hope that she will use her mother's better instincts in fighting for social services while avoiding political divisiveness.
44th District (Midwood, Borough Park, Bensonhurst): Two candidates stand out in this race to replace the outgoing Council member Noach Dear -- Simcha Felder, chief of staff to Assemblyman Dov Hikind, and Bob Miller, an attorney with a long record of civic work in the district. Bob Miller's well-thought-out proposals to improve schools in the area earn him our endorsement.
45th District (Flatbush, Flatlands): Kevin Parker, special assistant to State Comptroller Carl McCall, is an African-American running against two opponents who argue that the district should be represented by someone with Caribbean roots. What the area residents really need is an energetic and intelligent Council member who wants to serve everyone with equal vigor. That description best fits Kevin Parker, and he gets our endorsement.
47th District (Brighton Beach, Bensonhurst, Coney Island, Gravesend): Susan Lasher, the wife of the outgoing Council member, is running to continue "the Lasher legacy." Although Mrs. Lasher has an appealing personality, this diverse district needs to be represented by someone with a broader vision. Domenic Recchia, an attorney and school board member, is well versed in education issues but he seems too focused on the neighborhoods where he has his political base. Alec Brook-Krasny, who immigrated from Moscow in 1989, is less politically sophisticated but he appears to be genuinely committed to reaching out to all the neighborhoods in the district. His election would also give the city's Russian-American community a much-needed connection to city affairs. We endorse Alec Brook-Krasny.

HEADLINE: TIGHTER FINANCES WON'T CURB GOALS, PRESIDENT ASSERTS 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO, Aug. 29 

 BODY:
President Bush vowed today not to let the economic slowdown or the evaporating federal surplus deter him from increasing the military budget, beginning work on a missile shield or increasing spending on education.
 Mr. Bush outlined his agenda for the autumn, before thousands of cheering veterans at the annual American Legion Convention, only hours after the Commerce Department released revised figures for economic growth in the second quarter of this year, showing an anemic 0.2 percent. Mr. Bush said the figure showed that an economic "recovery is very slow in coming." 
 Mr. Bush said the continuing weak economic performance proved that the tax cut he signed into law in the spring and tax rebate checks now being mailed by the Treasury, were exquisitely timed to provide an economic stimulus. 
"With the tax reduction already in place, Americans will have more of their own money to spend, to save and invest, the very things that make our economy grow," Mr. Bush said.
And he responded to Democrats who had argued that the tax cut contributed to the disappearance of the non-Social Security surplus, challenging them to think twice about the alternative.
"Now there are some who are second-guessing tax relief," Mr. Bush said, which he called "the right prescription at the right time."
"I presume those who now oppose tax relief are for raising your taxes," he added. "That would tie an anchor on our economy, and I can assure you I won't allow it."
Even as Mr. Bush prepared to return to Washington on Thursday after his 25-day working vacation, Congressional Democrats were honing their attacks. 
Democratic leaders in both houses sent Mr. Bush a letter today urging him to specify how he would pay for his increase in military spending and other programs, clearly trying to tempt the president into going first in describing what programs he would scale back or eliminate.
The administration last week projected a $1 billion surplus beyond Social Security revenue, then the Congressional Budget Office projected that the current budget would dip $9 billion into the Social Security surplus. Both parties have vowed not to take that step.
"It is imperative that you provide specific guidance on how you intend to pay for the additional initiatives that you are calling for," the Democrats wrote. "We would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to receive the benefit of your thinking." 
The letter concluded, "For Democrats, saving the Social Security surplus is not a symbolic goal -- it is a shared commitment we have made to the American people and one that we thought you shared." 
A White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, said this evening that "the letter was odd," because Mr. Bush already had a meeting scheduled with the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, on Tuesday, and one with the House minority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, on Friday.
While Mr. Bush has not detailed any cuts, his spokesman said, there would be no need to dip into the Social Security surplus if Congress stuck to the budget that Mr. Bush sent it. 
The statement appeared to be an effort to make Mr. Bush be the first to declare that the agreement might have to be violated.
Mr. Bush continued to outline his counterstrategy today. He is demanding that that Congress pass the military budget first and the education budget second, so that those areas are not squeezed when Congress confronts the hard choices that it will ultimately have to make if it avoids spending surplus money generated by Social Security taxes.
"Near the end of the process," the president said, "suddenly we hear that Congress is about to go over the budget, so the items that have been saved for last are the ones most likely to get cut. And guess which -- guess what usually has been saved for the last? The defense bill -- leaving our national security at the mercy of budget games and last-minute cuts."
It is far from clear that Mr. Bush can persuade Congressional leaders, especially in the Democratic-controlled Senate, to deliver the spending bills in the order he desires. Nor did he suggest today how he would deal with the other priorities he listed: more benefits for veterans, prescription drug benefits for the elderly and modernization of Medicare. 
He never once mentioned his energy agenda, which would also cost billions and is bound to face close scrutiny. In fact, in laying out his agenda for the autumn he never even mentioned the energy crisis, even though it was a staple of his speeches earlier this year.
Mr. Bush looked tanned today and sounded optimistic, and he told another audience here, at a park dedication ceremony this morning, that "our batteries are recharged" after time on his ranch. 
In his speech to the veterans, he called for compromise.
"I return to Washington tomorrow ready to make my case and ready to work with folks on both sides of the aisle," he said.
But he added: "Dick Cheney and I didn't seek our offices so we could just settle in and mark time. We didn't come to rubber stamp the status quo."
The president's relaxed air could be endangered after the Labor Day weekend. The revised surplus figures give him and the Democrats virtually no room to operate. They cannot increase spending for new programs, including many Mr. Bush listed today as priorities, without coming up with compensating cuts. Already there are whispers in the Republican camp about whether the ban on spending the Social Security surplus makes sense, especially at a time of economic downturn, when classical Keynesian economic theory would call for more government spending as an economic stimulus.
"Remember, until a year or two ago, no one ever distinguished between the Social Security surplus and the non-Social Security surplus," a Bush economic adviser said the other day, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "That doesn't mean we should spend the Social Security funds. But we have to remember that this is an accounting distinction that is relatively new, and this is the first time it's being tested."
Some Democrats, though not Mr. Daschle and Mr. Gephardt, are already arguing that the goal could be economically dangerous. In an op-ed essay today in The Wall Street Journal, Robert B. Reich, a secretary of labor under President Bill Clinton and now a professor of social and economic policy at Brandeis University, argued that "this fictional 'lock box' was harmless enough when the economy was booming but makes no sense when it is slowing."
Mr. Reich said "Democrats should stop their bellyaching about 'raids,' " arguing that eventually those constraints would undercut both economic recovery and traditional Democratic commitment to education, mass transit and child health care. 
That may be so, but the mantra of protecting the surplus was a creation of the Clinton administration, after Mr. Reich left to return to academia. It quickly became the orthodoxy for both parties, because each wanted to show that it was the more fiscally responsible. Turning back on that pledge now would be politically painful, maybe impossible.
This afternoon, returning to Waco, Tex., Mr. Bush performed a ceremony to honor former President Ronald Reagan, whose name he often invokes in discussing his strategy of cutting taxes and shrinking government. He decommissioned a former Air Force One, which took its last flight carrying the president today. The plane is a specially configured Boeing 707, tail number 27000, which began flying in 1972, when President Nixon used it.
It was closely identified with Mr. Reagan, who flew it to Berlin in 1987 and demanded that Mikhail S. Gorbachev tear down the Berlin Wall. Earlier, it was also used by President Jimmy Carter, in the hours after his presidency, to greet the 52 Americans who had just been released from captivity in Iran. 
The plane will be kept on display at the Reagan Library in California.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about President Bush's vow to increase military and education spending referred incorrectly in some copies to an effort to make him declare that the Social Security surplus might have to be used. A letter in which Democratic leaders asked Mr. Bush to specify how he would pay for his proposals appeared to be such an effort. A statement from a White House spokesman that Mr. Bush had scheduled a meeting with Democratic leaders was not.

HEADLINE: From Brazil, An Emerging Steel Giant; 
A Family Company Shops Abroad for Acquisitions

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORTO ALEGRE, Brazil 

 BODY:
Exactly 100 years ago, a German immigrant named Joao Gerdau bought a small, struggling nail factory here. Today, that company, now run by four of his great-grandsons, is one of the fastest-growing steel producers in the world -- and the envy of every Brazilian corporation eager to establish an international presence.
 No matter that steel is a perpetually troubled industry all over the world or that Metalurgica Gerdau S.A. is still based in this state capital of about 1.5 million in the extreme south of Brazil, far from the country's industrial heartland. By shopping abroad for bargains with the same tenacity it has always shown at home, Gerdau has been able to transform itself into a global business -- demonstrating how once-obscure companies from emerging nations like Brazil are becoming increasingly important on the international economic stage. 
 "This is an agile, aggressive group that throughout its history has shown an ability to rapidly identify and exploit opportunities," said Germano Mendes de Paula, a professor of economics at the Federal University of Uberlandia and an expert on the Brazilian steel industry. "They are a company with a high degree of specialization, but they have always been pioneers." 
Worldwide, Gerdau has 12,000 employees, operates in six countries and produces more than seven million tons of steel a year. The company's growing international profile includes four mills in the United States, where in 1999 Gerdau acquired AmeriSteel, the second-largest producer of reinforced steel bars in the American market.
"We started with a regional focus and then went searching for a national position," Jorge Gerdau Johannpeter, the company's president and chairman, said in an interview here.
"Once we achieved that," Mr. Johannpeter said, "we came to the conclusion that if we wanted to maintain our focus in steel, we had better seek an international position because the world was already moving toward globalization and more open markets, and we couldn't afford to be left behind."
The Brazilian steel industry, whose annual production of 25 million tons makes it the eighth largest in the world, was created with United States aid during World War II to help supply the Allied cause. Gerdau entered the business in 1948, after earlier trying manufacturing ventures in areas like furniture.
Over the next three decades, the company grew gradually, snapping up the factories of domestic competitors farther north and building new plants in its home region. Its focus was always on "long steel" products, which are used in the construction industry, and items like rods, barbed wire, and, yes, the humble nail that gave the company its start.
Traditionally, Brazilian companies have been so captivated by the potential of their nation's huge domestic market that they paid little attention to the world outside. But Gerdau's managers have always been quick to adopt foreign innovations, as one might expect of an immigrant family that has maintained its ties to relatives in Hamburg and New York.
"My father was born abroad and was director of a German bank, which means he inspected all the branches here in South America," said Mr. Johannpeter, who spent part of his childhood in Buenos Aires and, in addition to Portuguese, speaks English, German and Spanish. "So he had an internationalized mentality, open to the most modern management and financial technologies of the time. That was very much a part of our culture and upbringing."
From the beginning, for instance, Gerdau operated with a mini-mill system that had proved successful elsewhere, deliberately avoiding larger integrated plants, which require bigger investments and are less flexible, so it could decentralize its production and put its factories closer to both markets and the sources of raw material.
That way, the company was able to capitalize on the enormous natural competitive advantage that Brazil enjoys in steel production.
"Economically, there are few places in the world where it makes sense to be producing steel," said Mauricio Reveco, Latin American steel analyst for Salomon Smith Barney in New York. "Brazil is one of those places, though, and the reasons are clear: you have cheap iron ore, labor that is less expensive than in the United States or Europe, and abundant energy sources."
But in Brazil, too, there are limits to growth, and when Gerdau began to look outside the country with the intention of becoming an international producer, it sought a steady but measured expansion. The process started in 1980 with the purchase of a small company over the border in Uruguay, and accelerated with the acquisition of mills in Cambridge, Ontario, in 1989 and Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 1995.
Along the way, Gerdau also established footholds in Argentina and Chile in the 90's through the acquisition of producers there. But the company's most prominent venture came in 1999, when it entered the United States market in a big way by acquiring a 75 percent interest in AmeriSteel from Kyoei Steel of Japan for $272 million.
The AmeriSteel transaction increased Gerdau's overall output more than 50 percent, tripled its production outside Brazil and raised the company to the 25th-largest steel producer in the world from the 46th, according to rankings compiled by the International Iron and Steel Institute. It was also in 1999 that Gerdau's American depository receipts began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. On Wednesday, they closed at $6.50, up 24 cents. 
With the downturn in the world economy, Gerdau's expansion overseas has proved to be a double-edged sword. Brazil continues to grow, albeit more slowly.
But with nearly half the company's production now taking place abroad and with a glut of steel and slumping demand having led to declining prices, analysts warn that Gerdau is more vulnerable than in the past to market fluctuations.
In the first half of this year, Gerdau's profitability rose 6 percent in local currency terms, compared with the similar period last year. But because the Brazilian currency, the real, has declined in value by almost one-quarter against the United States dollar this year, in part because of the economic turmoil in neighboring Argentina, Gerdau reported a 15.8 percent drop in profit in dollar terms, to $98.9 million from $117.5 million.
"This is going to prove to be a very tough year for them, but it should not be catastrophic," said Thomas de Mello e Souza, who follows the Brazilian steel industry for Merrill Lynch in Sao Paulo. "They are really good operators who have shown a high level of competence and flexibility in difficult situations in the past."
To complicate matters further, President Bush in June asked the United States International Trade Commission to determine whether current levels of steel imports are harming American producers.
Saying he was "deeply concerned" by what he described as a pattern of "foreign government intervention in the market and direct financial support of their steel industries," Mr. Bush held out the possibility that he might soon impose restrictions on imports of steel.
The announcement was criticized by European and other governments, who said it was contrary to the spirit of free trade. But as Professor Mendes de Paula noted, any restrictions on imports from Brazil, which has been a target of previous complaints from the United States about the dumping of steel, may actually help Gerdau.
"Unlike other Brazilian steel companies," he said, "Gerdau supplies the American market not through exports but primarily via its own domestic production. Since they are already in the American market, any kind of protectionist measures are likely to bring them more benefits than difficulties."
Mr. Johannpeter, Gerdau's president, was critical of Washington's stance, dismissing accusations of dumping and suggesting that the United States look more closely at larger producers, especially in Asia. "The problem is not the behavior of Brazilian steel producers, who are extremely competitive," he said. "It is the world that is bombarding the United States with steel, not Brazil."
But Mr. Johannpeter also indicated a willingness to expand Gerdau's presence in the United States once the world economy starts looking up again. Analysts said such a move would be logical and would help insulate the company from political and economic volatility at home and abroad.
"They need to digest their acquisition of AmeriSteel," Mr. Reveco of Salomon Smith Barney said. "But after that, they might very well want to consider something else."
Its rising international visibility notwithstanding, Gerdau remains very much a family company. Three of Jorge Gerdau Johannpeter's brothers -- Frederico, Klaus and Germano -- hold top management posts in the company, supervising finance, production and sales, respectively, and several members of the family's next generation have also been brought in.
Mr. Johannpeter's eventual successor will presumably be found among this young generation, a group of people who started work in the family tradition of sweeping mill floors. No matter who the successor turns out to be, the direction of Gerdau's future expansion seems clear.
"There are sectors in which you have to be a world player in order to avoid being destroyed by your competitors," Mr. Johannpeter said. "Steel is one of them."

HEADLINE: THEATER GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy Broadway and Off Broadway shows this weekend. Approximate running times are in parentheses. * denotes a highly recommended show.
+ means discounted tickets were at the Theater Development Fund's TKTS booth for performances last Friday and Saturday nights.
++ means tickets were at the TKTS booth for last Friday night only.

Broadway

"BLAST!" One ends up feeling bad about criticizing the nice young men and women whose Vegas-friendly enhancements of drum-and-bugle-corps routines make up this supposed extravaganza. Mostly in their 20's, they are brass players and percussionists, dancers and jugglers, a glowingly good-looking bunch, and irrepressibly cheery, too. But it is hard to shake the notion that this is a halftime show, complete with flag-waving, party-colored lighting and broad, bland choreography, that has wandered onto Broadway by mistake as if it had gotten lost on the way to the stadium (2:00). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $80 (Bruce Weber).

*+ "CONTACT." Susan Stroman's sparkling anthem to the transforming powers of dance has yet to succumb to the anemia that often befalls long-running musicals. A return visit to this Tony Award-winning show found it in a robust, muscle-flexing state of health. This three-part self-described dance play has ripened into mellowness, with a newly relaxed expansiveness that doesn't dilute its intoxication factor. The attitude speaks of performers who are so comfortable with the contours of their parts that they can riff on them a bit, jazz style, sounding new emotional notes. The original stars -- Karen Ziemba, Boyd Gaines and Deborah Yates -- are on board through Sunday (2:00). Beaumont, Lincoln Center (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $90 (Ben Brantley).

++ "42ND STREET" (Tony Award for best revival of a musical). There's nothing like precision tap-dancing to turn an audience into a lab full of case studies for Dr. Pavlov. Witness this opulent revival, directed by Mark Bramble and choreographed by Randy Skinner, in which every other production number has us beating our flippers together like the seals at feeding time. A largely labored resurrection of the last musical staged by the fabled Gower Champion, inspired by the classic 1933 movie, the show features Harry Warren and Al Dubin's priceless Depression-era songs, Michael Cumpsty as a tyrannical director and an extremely enjoyable Christine Ebersole (Tony winner for best actress in a musical) as his tyrannical star. Otherwise the evening's charms are largely limited to its full-strength tapping (2:40) Ford, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $90 (Brantley).

*+ "THE FULL MONTY." This hearty Americanized singing adaptation of the popular English film about a motley male troupe of amateur strippers gives off a blaze of pure mass appeal. The show calculatedly pushes as many buttons as an elevator operator, but mercifully it doesn't hammer at them. With a winning, ear-catching pop score by David Yazbek and a lively gallery of performers who seem truly in love with the people they're playing, "The Full Monty" is that rare aggressive crowd-pleaser that you don't have to apologize for liking. Well, for the most part. The book, by the multiple Tony Award-winner Terrence McNally, is sometimes as lame and pandering as a midseason replacement sitcom. Fortunately "The Full Monty" has more to do than just talk. And as long as it lets its ideally cast ensemble translate blue-collar blues into vigorous song, it's impossible not to smile. And, yes, the men do take off all their clothes (2:45). O'Neill, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $30 to $90 (Brantley).

+ "IF YOU EVER LEAVE ME . . . I'M GOING WITH YOU!" Do you by any chance make a habit of crashing wedding receptions, anniversary banquets and family reunions? Do you get your kicks from watching strangers in festive formal wear as they show home movies and make toasts of mutual admiration? If so, you may enjoy the party that Renee Taylor and Joseph Bologna have given for themselves at the Cort Theater, a self-addressed valentine to their 36-year marriage. Others will find less to savor in this anthology of old jokes, autobiographical snippets, and scenes from the couple's plays, written and directed by the two stars. Even the personal stories have hardened into shtick-shaped molds. The show's title, with its self-contained set-up and punch-line, pretty much says it all (1:30). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Today at 8 p.m.; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m.; no performance this Monday ; Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $30 to $65 (Brantley).

* "MAJOR BARBARA." The Roundabout Theater Company's elegant, eloquent and very funny production of Shaw's 1905 play sending up the societal worship of money -- and the convolutions of logic that defend it -- is less an interpretation than a celebration of this playwright's winking, topsy-turvy didactics on the subjects of politics, poverty and faith. In a world where spin-doctoring has become the rule in public discourse, inoffensiveness is prized and forthrightness has become suspicious, Shaw's notion that the rhetoric that protects a system of Darwinian economics is a hypocrisy has only gained in relevance. And the director Daniel Sullivan, whose strength is in crystallizing the dramatic voice of the playwright, has made Shaw's tasty ironies crystal clear, so that with a first-rate cast led by Cherry Jones, Dana Ivey and the British actor David Warner, making his American stage debut, the star of the show is the playwright himself (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $65 (Weber).

* "THE PRODUCERS" (winner of 12 Tony Awards). How do you single out highlights in a bonfire? Anyone who sees this sublimely ridiculous show is going to be hard pressed to name a favorite moment. (Is it the singing pigeons? Adolf Hitler doing Judy Garland?) Mel Brooks's wildly energetic stage adaptation of his 1968 cult movie is as full of gags, gadgets and gimmicks as a master vaudevillian's trunk. But the production is so much more than the sum of its gorgeously silly parts. It is, to put it simply, the real thing: a big Broadway book musical so ecstatically drunk on its powers to entertain that it leaves you delirious, too. With the assistance of the director and choreographer Susan Stroman and the happiest cast in town, led by Nathan Lane (Tony winner for best actor in a musical) and Matthew Broderick. (Mr. Broderick will be on vacation from Tuesday through Sept. 9, when Jamie La Verdiere and Jeffry Denman will alternate in the role.) in the performances of their careers, Mr. Brooks has put on a show that is a valentine to every show there is, good and bad, about putting on a show (2:45). St. James, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-5800. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $30 to $100; extremely limited (Brantley).

*+ "PROOF" (Tonys for best play and direction of a play). An exhilarating, assured new play by David Auburn that turns the esoteric world of higher mathematics literally into a back-porch drama, as accessible and compelling as a detective story. A mystery about the authorship of a particularly important proof, it is also about twin enigmas: genius and love. Without any baffling erudition, the play presents mathematicians as both blessed and bedeviled by the gift for abstraction that ties them achingly to one another and separates them, also achingly, from concrete-minded folks like you and me. Perhaps most satisfying, it does so without a moment of meanness. Directed by Daniel Sullivan with the pace of a psychological thriller and performed by an exemplary cast, most notably Mary-Louise Parker (Tony winner for best actress in a play), "Proof" reaches into the most competitive and difficult intellectual terrain and finds -- guess what? -- good people (2:00). Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $19 to $69 (Weber).

+ "STONES IN HIS POCKETS." Watching Sean Campion or Conleth Hill take a step forward is an exercise in suspense: when his foot touches the floor, it is entirely possible that he will no longer be the sex, age or nationality that he was a second before. These two human Etch-a-Sketches, the entire cast of Marie Jones's play about an American film crew in an Irish village, offer overwhelming evidence that there are special effects the movies will never do better than the theater does. It should be noted, however, that the pleasures of "Stones" are less literary than kinetic. Its satire of those superficial, egomaniacal folk who make movies is awfully familiar stuff. And Ms. Jones burdens an essentially comic play with a thudding tragic center. The evening's joys come from its two actors splitting like amoebas into different personalities (2:20). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $30 to $70 (Brantley).

* "URINETOWN: THE MUSICAL." No matter how satiric, referential or allegorical the story behind this cheeky, exuberant new musical suggests itself to be, it is fundamentally an extended bathroom joke, and that's not a bad thing. The premise is that a water shortage has rendered an unnamed city so arid that private toilets are insupportable. So everyone has to use public latrines, which are controlled by a greedy corporation that keeps raising prices until the poor revolt. Absurd? Of course. But the show's real concern is to make sport of the Broadway musical, particularly the kind with a social conscience, from "The Threepenny Opera" to "Les Miserables." And with its cagey score, grinning and mordant in a Kurt Weill mode; its boisterous choreography; and a cast that is thoroughly committed to straight-faced silliness, the show is so intelligently calibrated in its audacity that it can provoke enthusiasm even in those weary of musicals about musicals (2:10). Henry Miller, 124 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200. Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays; at 2:15 and 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $75 to $85 (Weber).

Off Broadway

+ "BAT BOY." Even if high camp is not your style, this outlandish but witty musical may very well make you laugh. Derived from a dubious tabloid story about the discovery in a West Virginia cave of a creature who is half boy, half vampire bat, it's a tongue-in-cheek Gothic morality tale bent on revealing the bat in all of us. The title role is played by Deven May, a gifted, athletic young actor with a dexterous singing voice who is equipped with Vulcan ears and pointy teeth. He's doomed, of course, particularly once the secret of his parentage is revealed. But long before the climax, the show establishes its credentials as an omnibus parody, garish in almost every respect but constrained below the bar of foolishness by the vivacious direction of Scott Schwartz and the winking lyrics of Laurence O'Keefe. Mr. O'Keefe also wrote the tuneful score, which is largely devoted to lampooning Broadway schmaltz (2:20). Union Square, 100 East 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $50 (Weber).

*+ "FORBIDDEN BROADWAY 2001: A SPOOF ODYSSEY." This 18-year-old satirical revue, which manages to see its subjects with both religious reverence and diagnostic cool, has established itself as a vital index to the health of the mainstream American musical. Never mind box-office figures. "Forbidden Broadway," created by Gerard Alessandrini, is looking for signs of creative life, and according to its current reading such a pulse is growing fainter by the minute. Fortunately, this show manages to find something deliciously tart in the current blandness of musical theater. And if Broadway has become more about marketing than about product, the show is perfectly willing to point its satirist's rifle at the appropriate corporate targets (Disney, American Airlines) as well as at the usual sacred-monster stars. Directed by Mr. Alessandrini and Phillip George, the four ensemble members bring an intoxicating energy even to the portrayal of robotic performers (2:00). Douglas Fairbanks, 432 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8:15 p.m.; Wednesday and Saturdays at 2:30 and 8:15 p.m.; Sundays at 3:30 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $49.50 and $55 (Brantley).

+ "TICK, TICK . . . BOOM!" Two round numbers, 30 and 90, glare ominously in this chamber piece from Jonathan Larson, the creator of the rock musical "Rent." Mr. Larson turned 30 in 1990, and in this self-conscious self-portrait in song he gave vent to his concern that time was running out on him. Given that the composer died of an aortic aneurysm at 35,you might expect a slightly prurient morbidity. As directed by Scott Schwartz and performed by Raul Esparza, Amy Spanger and Jerry Dixon, the show emerges as an amiable public exercise in soul searching. Compared with "Rent," it feels small and conventional. But if you look at it as a sort of sketchbook for that Broadway hit, "Tick" has its gentle fascination, while reminding us of what an infectiously tuneful composer Larson could be (1:30). Jane Street Theater, 113 Jane Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Thursdays at 8 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays at 7 and 10 p.m.; Sundays at 7 p.m. Tickets: $30 to $55 (Brantley).

Last Chance

+ "ANNIE GET YOUR GUN." Crystal Bernard as Annie Oakley and Tom Wopat, returning to the role of Frank Butler, which he originated in this production, are the current stars of this revisionist take on Irving Berlin's most famous musical. Staged by Graciela Daniele, from Peter Stone's strained adaptation of Herbert and Dorothy Fields's original book (2:40). Marquis, 1535 Broadway, near 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. Through tomorrow. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $75 (Brantley).

+ "THE DINNER PARTY." Neil Simon, in an experimental mood, has come up with one of the more bizarre mutants in theater history. This strained comedy about a gathering of mysteriously interconnected Parisians in an opulent restaurant is a French farce with a Brooklyn accent, a Strindbergian sexual slugfest with a laugh track. Those unfamiliar with Mr. Simon's earlier work could be forgiven for assuming that Doc, his professional nickname, is short for Dr. Moreau, H. G. Wells's hybrid-making mad scientist. Directed by John Rando with lots of verve and little subtlety, the play features plenty of those familiar Simon one-liners, which keep going off at the oddest moments like tardy kernels of popcorn. The prevailing mood, however, is rueful as the play considers the casualties of the sex wars. The results are as ungainly as the runners in a three-legged race (1:40). Music Box, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Through tomorrow. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $45 to $70 (Brantley).

+ "LOBBY HERO." Motives come in every shade but black and white in the convincingly muddled world of Kenneth Lonergan, the Oscar-nominated screenwriter of "You Can Count on Me" and the author of the first-rate plays "This Is Our Youth" and "The Waverly Gallery." The meaty but unfulfilled "Lobby Hero," directed by Mark Brokaw, charts the bruising relationships among four people in uniform -- two doormen and two police officers -- as they experience the corrosive effects of sexual jealousy, police corruption, racial defensiveness and a clumsy yearning for honor. Everything works intellectually, and the dialogue is often terrifically tasty. But by the end, the Ping-Pong presentation of self-deceptions and self-justifications starts to feel weary. Glenn Fitzgerald is miscast as a phlegmatic professional screw-up. But Heather Burns, Tate Donovan and Dion Graham implode with sadness and charm, demonstrating that nobody loves a loser the way Mr. Lonergan does (2:10). Houseman, 450 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. Through Sunday. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $45 and $50 (Brantley).

*+ "THE PLAY ABOUT THE BABY." This funny, harrowing dramatic fable, which features a four-member ensemble led with spectacular style by Brian Murray and Marian Seldes, is as explicit and concise a statement of what Edward Albee believes as he is ever likely to deliver. It is presented in the form of what might be called cosmic vaudeville, in which two old pros in this old world teach a pair of untried tyros just how bleak and dangerous the universe can be. Not, you might think, a subject for steady laughter, except of the dry and rueful variety. But while "The Play About the Baby," directed with sharpness and agility by David Esbjornson, offers nothing at all reassuring about human destiny, it has a marvelous time being negative. It also radiates a cocky confidence that the theater is the only place that could deliver such dour home truths so entertainingly (2:00). Century Center, 111 East 15th Street, Union Square, (212) 239-6200. Through tomorrow. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $60 (Brantley).

+ "ST. LUCY'S EYES." People who buy tickets just to see Ruby Dee onstage will find her at a kitchen table, snapping string beans and dispensing casual wisdom. This is the kitchen table on which Ms. Dee's character is about to perform an illegal abortion on a very frightened 17-year-old girl. It is Memphis in 1968, one day before the death of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Fans of Ms. Dee, who is 76, will not be disappointed in her warm, graceful performance, but it's not the production's only asset. The play is an insightful, largely satisfying drama by a promising new playwright, Bridgette A. Wimberly, whose language has the power of authenticity. The play stumbles in Act II, turning into an echo of the B movie "Madame X," but until then it is a nicely done study of comfort, karma, judgment and old women's dreams (2:00). Cherry Lane, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. Through Sunday. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 (Anita Gates).

* "TOPDOG/UNDERDOG." There are many levels of deception practiced in Suzan-Lori Parks's vibrant story of battling brothers in close quarters. Directed with high wit and flair by George C. Wolfe, and starring the wonderful Jeffrey Wright and Don Cheadle, the play divides the world into a seesawing population of hustlers and victims. It even goes so far as to suggest that any human exchange involves sham, that a person can be himself only when no one else is watching. And when the person is a black man in the history lesson that is Ms. Parks's United States, the existential lies multiply. Then again, not being yourself can be a very fine art, especially as demonstrated by actors as fine as Mr. Wright, playing a former three-card monte master, and Mr. Cheadle, as an agile shoplifter. The result: the most exhilarating fraternal standoff since Sam Shepard's "True West" (2:15). Public, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. Through Sunday. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $45 (Brantley).

The Importance Of the Box

BYLINE:  By Peter M. Nichols 

 BODY:
"People who put up money for movies now are completely star-driven," the director Michael Steinberg said. "That's their insurance. Even if you have the next Julia Stiles and a great script, they balk. They say: 'What if the movie stinks? Who do I put on the video box?' " 
 Mr. Steinberg's "Wicked," made in 1997 and released this week on cassette and DVD by Columbia TriStar, has the real Julia Stiles on the box, which leads to a tale of independent filmmaking as it has evolved over the last few years. As it often does, the trail winds through the Sundance Film Festival, where "Wicked," a darkly comic take on the Electra story set in suburban California, was shown in 1998. 
 Mr. Steinberg co-directed "The Waterdance" (1992) with Neal Jiminez, and his "Bodies, Rest and Motion" (1993) also appeared at Sundance. "Wicked," his third film, already had a distribution deal when it came to the festival. "A bad move," he said. Imagine a filmmaker thinking that. At the time, however, conditions were still encouraging for a risky film and, he said, his movie might have done better with Sundance exposure.
At the start he was unsure of "Wicked," which is about the efforts of a possibly murderous 14-year-old to seduce her father. "I needed a young girl who was going to be a movie star," he said. Rachael Leigh Cook was considered. Katie Holmes, then 17, was physically too mature. "Then, out of the blue, I got a fax from Julia Stiles," Mr. Steinberg said. "She'd gotten the script and wrote me this little letter." Later they talked on the telephone. "She had this deep voice," he said.
Ms. Stiles, a 15-year-old New York schoolgirl, was flown to California, prepped and put before the cameras. Mr. Steinberg said Paramount had planned to release the movie in 300 theaters but backed out during final negotiations. In the meantime, it had appeared at Sundance, and there were no takers after the deal fell through. "If you don't sell your film there within a month or two, they're moving on," Mr. Steinberg said. "The next crop is coming through."
"Wicked" never appeared in theaters. A dispute over the soundtrack shelved the movie for a year and a half before Columbia TriStar picked it up for video. "By then Julia was a star," Mr. Steinberg said. Ms. Stiles had appeared in "10 Things I Hate About You," had made "Save the Last Dance" and was good material for a video box. Many independent films obviously aren't that lucky, especially risky ones.
Mr. Steinberg said that paradoxically, "The Blair Witch Project" and its huge box-office success helped change the landscape for the worse. "With bigger money there are higher stakes, so movies become more general and formulaic," he said. 
As if in retaliation, independent movies that break out, like "Blair Witch" or Doug Liman's "Swingers," often have no stars. Audiences are driven by reviews and genre. 
"But the economics have changed," he said. "It's much harder to release them unless you have a lot of star power."

HEADLINE: WEEKEND EXCURSION; 
A Place Excused From Change

BYLINE:  By CHARLES STRUM 

 BODY:
Between two drowsy villages in southern Vermont -- Poultney on the north and Wells on the south -- lies Lake St. Catherine, the product of tectonic upheavals and a glacier that retreated north 12,000 years ago.
 It is not a big lake, but at seven miles long (and 833 acres), it is big enough. About 500 cottages have lake frontage; 100 others are set back. There are quiet coves, rocky shallows and a lily pond favored by dragonflies. 
 I was a boy on St. Catherine for 15 summers, from 1948 to 1962. In rented cottages called Al-Mar and Hillside, on the northwest shore, my parents and I took August vacations of two or three weeks, just long enough to last a lifetime. 
Those Eisenhower summers reappear in mind's-eye snapshots: a dewy path of pine needles leading down to the pump. A daily visit to Samson's bait dock. Blindingly hot hours in a wooden rowboat, trolling for bass. Afternoon swims. Cool nights on the sleeping porch. A drive to Poultney for iodine, Coppertone and a milkshake at McShane's Pharmacy.
As weekend destinations go, Poultney and St. Catherine were not on the A-list, nor are they now. Why would they be? Besides the cottages at the lake, where generations of summer people stay for a week, a month or the season, few places take transients, and there's not much to do; that is, you have to make your own fun. Fifty years ago, the drive from New York City was seven hours, mostly along Route 7, including bathroom breaks, lunch at the Blue Benn diner in Bennington, Vt., and the inevitable rural traffic jam -- the kind that forms behind a tractor on a two-lane road. Today, it's four hours-plus, including tractor.
Drawn by memory and something more, I drove back alone for a few days this summer. I was hoping, I suppose, to see if the past had the potency to animate the present -- a fancy way of saying that I wanted to know if village and lake had cheated time, surviving unravaged even as I had begun to trudge into middle age.
What I found was as reassuring as the Grover's Corners of Thornton Wilder's "Our Town," as described by the Stage Manager:
"Nice town, y'know what I mean? Nobody very remarkable ever come out of it, s'far as we know. The earliest dates on the tombstones up there in the cemetery say 1670. They're Grovers and Cartwrights and Gibbses and Herseys -- same names as around here now."
Wilder's observations have the comforting ring of durability, a theme he strikes in the play's famous opening lines, which note the town's precise latitude and longitude. They identify it indelibly, like a fingerprint. A community's geography and those who share it create permanence. You can add or subtract a shop or a barn. You can tear up the train tracks and close the old mill. But you cannot change what is.
Still, it is easier to say what Poultney is not. It is not famous or fancy. It is not Colonial Williamsburg, though it has many Early American and Victorian houses that have been declared landmarks. Nor is it a ski town, like Stratton or Killington, about 45 minutes away. The boutiques and outlets are in Manchester, 30 miles south. Poultney's most glorious residents -- Horace Greeley, founder of The New York Tribune, who learned the printing trade there, and George Jones, a co-founder of The New York Times -- have been dead for more than a century. They left town long before that. At its prosperous best, around 1910, Poultney's 45 square miles bulged with 3,600 people, about the same as now.

Conflicting Accounts
Settled in 1761, the village was named for Sir William Poultney, the earl of Bath, who was secretary of war in Sir Robert Walpole's cabinet in the reign of George II. The origin of the name Lake St. Catherine, also called Lake Austin on early maps, is less certain. Two accounts remain popular. The first is that more than two centuries ago, one Nov. 25, St. Catherine's Day, Jesuit missionaries arrived at the lake and so honored her name. The second suggests that nostalgic 18th-century British immigrants named a town, then in the colony of New York, for St. Catherine's Point on the Isle of Wight, the last view they had of their homeland. Vermonters, the story goes, later adopted the name for the lake.
In the early 1800's, St. Catherine supported a gristmill, a sawmill, a tannery and a cheese factory. The first hotel went up before the Civil War, a time when spending the season meant shipping wardrobe trunks by rail. By the 80's and 90's, hotels and dance pavilions dotted the shore, and summer visitors included President Grover Cleveland, Pierre Lorillard, William K. Vanderbilt, Lillian Russell and Jay Gould, the railroad tycoon.
From the 1870's on, families of means from Albany and Schenectady as well as from Granville, N.Y., and other nearby towns, began to build summer cottages. Local families built camps for fishing. Some were large, some not. Many of them are in use today by descendants of the original builders.
As the automobile made the seasonal train trip obsolete, the popularity of the hotels and amusement pavilions dwindled. Most burned or were torn down. The last well-known pavilion, Idylwild, built in 1914 and in use through the 1950's, was razed in 1969.
But St. Catherine was never gaudy, and that's the way people like it.
"It's off the beaten path," said Philip M. Alden, a retired management consultant who bought his lake cottage as a "newcomer" in 1978. "There are no interstates near here. We have not been overrun. That's one of its appeals. It's a quiet lake mostly, the exception being on Saturday and Sunday afternoons in midsummer, when we do suffer a bit with loud outboard motors.
"We are like the dinosaurs," said Mr. Alden, who is about to conclude his fifth consecutive one-year term as president of the Lake St. Catherine Association, a volunteer group that keeps its eye on the environmental and cultural health of the lake. "But we are not obsolete."

A Father's Gift
I have never known life without Poultney and the lake. They were my father's discovery. He first traipsed into town as a young man in the early 1930's during a few weeks of hiking around southern New England. The story goes that he left New York on something called the Albany night boat, then hitchhiked his way northeast to Granville, whose slate and marble industry anchored the area's economy in the 19th century and whose quarries still operate along 25 miles of the Vermont-New York border. Dad arrived in Poultney the next day and quickly made friends with people whose families had settled there before the Revolution.
Twenty years later these Vermonters became my friends as well: the Hayneses, Agnes and Joe and Lydia and Harold; Louise Greer and her elderly parents; Al and Margaret Clark, who owned Al-Mar, at the lake; and the ancient George Haynes -- father of Harold, Joe and Margaret -- whom I called Grandpa and who died in the early 1950's, 90 some years after being a water boy in the Civil War.
They are gone now, like Wilder's fictional families, and have taken up residence in the old cemeteries of the village. But they left some reminders. You can still see Joe Haynes's name, for instance, on a plaque in the United Baptist Church (originally called the Baptist Meeting House) on the Green in East Poultney. Al-Mar is now insulated and updated but still perched near Hillside, above the lake. And if you stop at the pharmacy (the McShanes sold it years ago, and the soda fountain is gone) you can chat with Pat Dillon. She has worked there since 1942 and remembers almost everyone.
This Poultney, the "Our Town" Poultney, was where I was headed when I left New York and turned the car onto the New York State Thruway, bound for Glens Falls. I had decided against scenic Route 7 and in favor of arriving in record time. My error was in forgetting that while the distance between Glens Falls and Poultney is barely 25 miles, it's on secondary roads. I lost a half hour but gained some glorious views of ripening field corn and the purple Taconic hills.
Because I was staying only a few days, a house on Lake St. Catherine was out of the question, so I reserved a room at a Victorian bed and breakfast called the Bentley House. This turreted old home sits a couple of blocks from the end of Main Street, opposite Green Mountain College, a four-year school that was a women's junior college for a time but now has wider offerings, including a well-regarded program in environmental studies.
The Bentley's owners since last October are Denise and Bob DiMaio, who also bought a deli, Preseau's Place, on Main Street. They are from the suburbs west of Philadelphia. Brian and Robin Turro -- he from Vermont, she from Massachusetts -- are also newcomers, and they opened Rockin' Robin's Cafe, an Italian restaurant a few doors from Preseau's.
Both families say the risk is worth it. While other destinations are overrun, Poultney is not. But it's not far from places that are, and its few inns, restaurants and antiques shops may become a quiet suburb for overburdened resort hubs.

Old Businesses Remain
Their entry into the local economy has been unobtrusive. Main Street evolves very slowly. Boice's meat market is gone, as is Lynch's Ben Franklin five-and-dime. The former Williams Chevrolet showroom (1922) has been put to other use. But some old, established businesses remain, among them Williams hardware and Mart's sporting goods. Joe DeBonis's law office hasn't moved. Neither has the West Dinette, now called Tot's, a slate-roofed building from the 1890's that has looked the same, inside and out, for as long as most people can remember. (It was once Dick's Dairy Bar, when Dick Haynes, Harold's son, owned it. He sold it and went to work for the power company.)
While I returned this summer as an outsider, I had some inside help. My principal informant was Ruth Czar, who, with her husband, Jonathan, has lived in Poultney since the 1950's. Mr. Czar taught at Green Mountain College for many years; Mrs. Czar is the president of the Poultney Historical Society.

A Perpetual Motion Machine
She and I met for breakfast at Perry's Main Street Eatery. It and Tot's at the other end of the street serve the stick-to-your-ribs breakfasts their customers expect.
At 76, Mrs. Czar is a perpetual motion machine. From Perry's, where she talked gaily about the past as if it were the present, we drove to the old schoolhouse (1896) at the Green in East Poultney. The tower still holds the bell -- you can pull the rope and ring it -- and the rest of the drafty two-story structure holds the files and exhibits of the historical society.
Mrs. Czar pulled out the files on Lake St. Catherine, and a handful of albums with photos and postcards of the old village. Then she went off to lunch, leaving me alone with the rusted scythes, band instruments, threadbare military uniforms and tombstone rubbings.
After an hour of browsing, it struck me that over the years I had straddled two worlds in Vermont. I had been both summer person and honorary native. I thrived in the continuity of life in the village and around the lake, arriving each summer as the sweet corn was picked and listening to my Vermont friends as they talked about buying a new car from Harold Wescott or reminisced about who had died over the winter.
On my first night in town, I drove to the lake at twilight, taking Route 140 -- Main Street -- to East Poultney, turning right at the Baptist church and crossing the Poultney River on a narrow bridge. Within two miles I approached another landmark, the cupola of the old Griffith barn on the left. The lily pond came into view on the right, and then Ferncliff Road, the lake road.
I turned in, drove slowly for about a mile and pulled up to a parking pad overlooking the lake. A boy with a big smile was dawdling on the road and asked if I had come to see the people in the dark, unoccupied camp next to his. No, I said, I actually wanted to see that other one. Hillside. Did he live there?
He did, and he led me up the slate and stone steps strewn with pine needles, past the shower room and up one more steep incline to the back door. His mother, Peg Richards, had been warming a late supper. (It's not called dinner in Poultney.)
I explained who I was and why I had come. And I was home.
But I was unprepared. The lake camp of my memory had shrunk. Everything was in the same place, but the broad, screened-in sleeping porch with the dining table on the right was narrower and shorter than I remembered. The kitchen, while newer, was galley size. The living room lacked the cast-iron Franklin stove but seemed somewhat smaller, like a ship's cabin, as did the two bedrooms upstairs. I could have sworn there were at least three bedrooms.
Yet it was the same, too. The wooden studs and beams were still exposed and sturdy. The view of the lake was unchanged.
Hillside had endured. Not only because it was there, but because of Jackson, Keisha, Kim and Jonathan, four of the Richards's seven children who greeted me that night.
"You lived here?" asked Jackson, who had met me at the car. "Did you ever catch any fish? Did you get mosquito bites like me?"
Yes, I said. Yes. Yes. I also told them about the cranky old woman who scolded me whenever I spilled water from the pump. Her cottage, fixed up and repainted, is still at the water's edge, just below theirs.
I told them about Samson, the taciturn old man in undershirt and khaki trousers with whom my father dickered for bait. Samson spoke with an unrecognizable accent, when he spoke at all. On sunny mornings, the buckets on his dock smelled of fresh, wet earth (his nightcrawler cache) and the silver minnows swam in thick schools in a pool he had built at the shoreline.

Passing the Days
In a chat a few weeks later, I asked Mrs. Richards how she and her husband, Mick -- she is an administrator and he a teacher at nearby Castleton State College -- had come to St. Catherine. Their children range in age from 8 to 14, and their summers were the main consideration.
"We wanted a place on the lake, and we had been looking for an old-fashioned cottage," she said, meaning a rustic camp, not a four-season home. When a real estate agent showed it to them, they "immediately loved it," she said. They bought it a year ago.
"It was important to have the cottage now," she said, "because we have a little less time with them to make these kinds of memories."
And how do they spend their days?
"Oh, they take the kayak out, they swim, they fish, though they don't catch much," Mrs. Richards said. "They go hiking or for walks, the big ones watch after the younger ones."
One of the older girls baby-sits for a child in a nearby cottage. They all use what's known as the neighborhood float, a floating dock just offshore that was built by another cottage owner.
On rainy days they shop for groceries or run other errands. When it's time for ice cream, they go to Sam's Dog House, a celebrated local joint on Route 22A in Hampton, N.Y.
And in the evening, Mrs. Richards said, "We play cards, games, Chinese checkers. I don't think the kids are ever bored."
Nor was I. Not at Hillside. The memories they are making are much the same as mine. And in their bathing suits and T-shirts, eating plums on the dock or catching fireflies at dusk, the children define the summer and defy the passage of time.

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption in Weekend yesterday with an article about visiting Poultney, Vt., misidentified the main building shown. It is a former factory, not a 1791 school, which is in the background. The caption also misstated the location of the home of the Poultney Historical Society. It is in an 1896 school in East Poultney, not in the 1791 school.
A set of driving directions in Weekend on Friday with an article about visiting Poultney, Vt., omitted a step. From New York City, drivers may take the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway to Exit 24 (not Exit 20), then the Adirondack Northway to Exit 20. The trip continues up Route 9 north to Route 149, east to U.S. 4, then north to Route 30 and east into Poultney.

HEADLINE: When Hot Cars Go Cold 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
THE Lexus SC 430 is the chief object of automotive desire this summer. Demand is high, supplies are short and dealers are charging thousands of dollars over the $60,000 sticker. But to Jay Shoemaker, the elegant convertible is old news.
 Mr. Shoemaker of San Francisco got his SC 430 in March, and he has already sold it, pocketing $8,000 in profit. When he ordered the car in December 1999, he was the second person on Lexus's waiting list. 
 Now he is looking ahead to his 2002 Mercedes SL500, which he ordered a year ago and plans to pick up in Europe next April. It will be the 74th car that Mr. Shoemaker, 49, has owned, most of them convertibles and all but five of them imports.
"My average tenure for owning a car is one year, although if I really like it, maybe two years," said Mr. Shoemaker, chief executive of the Coppola Companies, a collection of businesses -- including a winery and movie studio -- owned by the filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. "I generally try to be early on the curve so if I don't like it, I can always get rid of it without losing my shirt."
While the market for generic cars and trucks has been buoyed by discounts and incentives, there is strong demand for a handful of hot models. Aside from the SC 430, there are waiting lists for the Ford Thunderbird roadster, the Acura MDX sport utility and even the Honda Odyssey minivan. Their scarcity makes them all the more desirable, said Ron Pinelli, a consultant with Autodata in Woodcliff Lake, N.J.
"When something is in short supply, you feel special because you have it," Mr. Pinelli said. "Despite the economic downturn, there are still plenty of people with the money to buy whatever they want."
Automakers both love and fear trend surfers like Mr. Shoemaker. Their early-bird purchases help to kindle interest in new cars, but their fickle tastes have been picked up by the broader market. Shoppers looking at an array of vehicles, with a wide range of prices, are now eager to drive the hot new thing. Carmakers are scrambling to figure out not just how to generate heat, but how to keep hot cars from getting cold.
Wesley Brown, an analyst with Nextrend, a market research firm in Thousand Oaks, Calif., says vehicles have become personal accessories as much as transportation. "We've become a much more fashion-oriented, image-oriented society," he said. "We're always looking for what's going to make me look great, what's going to make me feel great."
That is one reason Peter Steinlauf bought his SC 430. Mr. Steinlauf, 54, chief executive of Edmunds.com, a Web site for car buyers, fell in love with the SC when he saw the first pictures of it a year ago. The romance continued upon delivery. "You sure feel very popular" behind the wheel, he said. "Strangers stop you to talk about it."
There is a price to be paid for being first. Some California dealers are charging premiums of $10,000 and more for the 2002 Thunderbird, which starts around $35,000. One dealership that is charging only the sticker price is Albion Motors in Albion, Mich., about 100 miles west of Detroit. Seven customers have placed nonrefundable deposits of $5,000, said Andrew Blackledge, the dealership's Internet sales manager.
Trouble is, Albion Motors will get just two 2002 T-Birds; its prospective buyers are on waiting lists for 2003 and 2004 models.
Even those guaranteed to get T-Birds may wait longer. Production was halted on Aug. 15 because of a cooling system problem, and resumed only yesterday.
Such glitches can contribute to a car's losing its buzz, said Art Spinella, founder of CNW Marketing Research of Bandon, Ore. His research indicates that interest in the T-Bird, which has been repeatedly delayed, may already be fading. Mr. Spinella conducts focus groups in which he shows photos of coming cars and asks consumers to rate their interest. An average score is 100. On his first test of the T-Bird, conducted in June 2000 in Florida and California, buyers gave it a score of 140. By January, its score had dropped to 129.
Another Ford vehicle, the hulking Excursion S.U.V., shows how quickly a hot vehicle can go frigid. When Ford unveiled the Excursion in 1999, the company expected it to be a huge success. But even before the Excursion came to market, environmentalists attacked it as an excessively large gas-guzzler. Soon after, gasoline prices spiked.
"A lot of high-income people just decided, 'Enough is enough,' " said Michael Luckey, analyst with the Luckey Consulting Group in Pompton Plains, N.J.
At the height of its popularity, Albion Motors sold about 10 Excursions a month. It now sells about 2, Mr. Blackledge said.
Interest remains high in the Honda Odyssey minivan, still a suburban status symbol three years after it came to market. Odyssey sales are actually down slightly this year -- not for lack of buyer interest, but because of a production quandary. Both the Odyssey and the Acura MDX sport utility are built at a plant in Alliston, Ontario, that is at full capacity. Honda has had to cut Odyssey production to build more MDX's.
At the moment, the scales are tipped in favor of MDX, which has a four-month waiting list; the Odyssey wait is generally about three weeks nationwide, said a Honda spokesman, Andrew Boyd. Supplies of the Odyssey should ease up late this year, when Honda opens a factory in Alabama that will be devoted to the minivan.
But even the biggest sensation of the late 1990's, the Volkswagen New Beetle, has struggled to stay in the limelight. When that car came out in 1998, "you could have sold truckloads if you could have gotten them," said Gary Smith, general manager of Halbinsel Volkswagen in Escanaba, Mich., who sold the first New Beetle in the country.
Since then, the cars have become widely available and deals abound. Edmunds.com says customers across the country have been paying an average of $400 below the $17,325 sticker of a basic New Beetle.
But Mr. Smith is already looking ahead. He is awaiting a convertible version of the New Beetle, for which he already has one order, though VW still hasn't said when that car will go on sale. Mr. Smith is also lobbying for VW to build a new Microbus based on a design study that was shown to the public last year. "If they ever decided to produce it," he said, "it would be a smash."

HEADLINE: Big Decision On Future Of Polish Oil Is Looming 

BYLINE:  By PETER S. GREEN 

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
The Polish government is expected to make a preliminary decision in the next few weeks on the sale of a stake in the country's largest oil refinery, a move that could reshape the region's oil industry.
 As oil companies go, the refinery, Polski Koncern Naftowy Orlen S.A., hardly seems like much of a prize. While it is relatively modern, the refinery, known as PKN, relies exclusively on imports it does not control, mainly from Russia. Many of its retail gas stations in southern Poland have been bypassed by post-Communist economic growth. And foreign companies, including a rival from tiny neighboring Slovakia, are taking its customers. 
 The planned sale by Poland's treasury ministry of a 17.6 percent stake, for about $400 million, has opened a window on the fierce competitive pressures battering the oil and gas markets of Central and Eastern Europe. The region's existing energy companies are struggling to fend off domination by cash- and resource-rich Russian energy companies and by sophisticated Western European and American oil companies.
Polish authorities are rushing to secure a sale of PKN and a second refinery in the Baltic port of Gdansk, before elections next month, when the current government is expected to lose to a left-wing slate. The opposition has said it opposes the sales.
The region's two largest players, Mol of Hungary and OMV of Austria, have put in bids that would effectively merge their companies with PKN, while PKN itself says it plans to pursue again efforts that were rejected by Polish antitrust regulators last year to acquire the refinery.
Talks on selling the Gdansk refinery to Rotch Energy Ltd., a British oil-trading company, appear stalled. The PKN bids are sealed for now, but local press reports say both Mol and OMV have proposed mergers with PKN that would make the combined company the region's largest energy concern. The deal could be the largest cross-border merger in Central Europe's history.
The reports say OMV has offered about 26 zlotys a share ($6.14) in cash and Mol has offered about 25 zlotys a share, mainly in equity, valuing the stake at more than $400 million. PKN shares are now trading at 17.5 zlotys.
Both Mol and OMV are the largest retailers in their home markets. Expanding locally is the only way they can remain independent. Their local targets are smaller companies and the most likely target, after Poland, is the state-owned Czech refining and retail conglomerate, Unipetrol. Mol recently acquired control of Slovakia's Slovnaft refinery and its retail network, and now has 800 gas stations across the region. OMV is present in 10 former Communist countries. Both also drill for oil and gas across the world. OMV has gas fields in Pakistan and Australia, while Mol is drilling for oil in Siberia with the Russian oil giant Yukos.
Demand in Central Europe's four largest countries is growing about 3 percent annually, making the oil sector in the region highly attractive for strategic and portfolio investors.
OMV's chief executive, Richard Schenz, said in an e-mail message that he expected his company to emerge as the region's strongest, but he added: "We do not believe that 'merger mania' will go on forever or to that respect is the end to all means. Studies have shown -- also for the oil industry -- that smaller companies can also achieve a very good scale of economics."
But many analysts say that by bulking up, the local companies merely make themselves more attractive takeover targets for both Russian and Western companies including the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, which recently bought the DEA gas stations from Germany's RWE group, and BP, which acquired Veba Oil from E.On of Germany last month, winning a large network of Aral gas stations in central Europe.
OMV has a market capitalization of about 2.8 billion euros ($2.55 billion); PKN is about 1.8 billion euros ($1.64 billion) and Mol is about 1.7 billion euros ($1.55 billion). By contrast, BP-Amoco has a market capitalization of $191 billion.
"All these companies believe the larger they become, the less likely they are to be takeover targets, but I argue the opposite is true," said an analyst, Gergely Varkonyi, of ING Barings in London. "This industry is about size and economies of scale. If anyone is going to expand into the region, obviously they will look at the largest player."

HEADLINE: Reckonings; 
Greenspan Stands Alone

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; Thomas L. Friedman is on vacation.

 BODY:
There are three great economic powers in today's world -- the United States, Europe and Japan. In principle, each of these has two potent recession-fighting tools at its disposal. One is monetary policy: the central bank can print money and drive down interest rates. The other is fiscal policy: the government can try to support a flagging economy by cutting taxes and increasing spending. 
 In practice, however, almost the entire burden of fighting what has become a global slowdown is being borne by U.S. monetary policy. And you have to wonder whether the Federal Reserve, acting on its own, can really do the job. 
 Why does the Fed stand alone? Start with Europe. In terms of sheer purchasing power, Europe is America's equal; now that most European countries have adopted a common currency, managed by a single central bank, you might expect Europe and the United States to be twin pillars of global economic stability.
But the institutions of Europe's Economic and Monetary Union were designed to fight the last war -- they constitute a Maginot Line protecting the Continent from inflation, but make it almost impossible to respond to economic threats that come from a different direction. In particular, the charter of the European Central Bank requires it to defend price stability -- full stop, end of sentence. And bank officials have disavowed any responsibility for growth and employment.
What about fiscal policy? European countries don't have much room for maneuver, given large public debts and the looming burdens of an aging population. And whatever room for maneuver they might have had was taken away by Europe's Economic Stability and Growth Pact, which prevents even temporary deficit spending. Hesitant suggestions by some finance ministers that these rules be relaxed have been harshly criticized by the central bankers; so European fiscal action to fight a slump is pretty much out of the question. 
Then there's Japan. After years of immense spending on public works, Japan has a debt of 130 percent of G.D.P. -- and it, too, has an aging population. So it can do no more by way of fiscal policy; in fact, retrenchment is the order of the day. 
At the same time, conventional monetary policy has reached its limit in Japan, since short-term interest rates are already zero. The Bank of Japan could do more, if it was willing to adopt unconventional measures, like targeting a positive rate of inflation -- a course of action supported by some of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's advisers. But Japan's central bank has refused to make any significant moves in that direction. And Mr. Koizumi's own finance minister has denounced calls for radical monetary policy, warning of runaway inflation even as his country slips into a deflationary spiral. 
And then there's us. What are we doing to fight the slowdown?
America does, of course, have its tax cut. But the peculiar "back-loaded" timing of that cut makes it a very poor recession-fighting measure. The rebate checks are not much more than pocket change -- $40 billion, or 0.4 percent of G.D.P. The big tax cuts, which will eventually rise to almost 2 percent of G.D.P., won't come until the middle of the decade. And the decision to lock in trillions of dollars in future tax cuts actually depresses the economy now, since those future cuts do little to encourage current consumer spending but do raise long-term interest rates.
Can we pump up the economy with additional tax cuts or temporary public spending? Not safely; those huge future tax cuts have created a grim long-term financial outlook, and any further tax cuts would make the outlook even grimmer. Of course, the administration might do the responsible thing, making room for additional tax cuts now by canceling some of those big tax cuts scheduled for 2004 and later. And pigs might fly. 
It's a dismal picture: a combination of intellectual confusion, narrow-minded officials and sheer fiscal folly has removed most of the tools that the world's major economies might be able to use to help us get through these troubled times. The only institution that isn't paralyzed is the Fed, which keeps on cutting rates, hoping that it will finally accomplish something. Or to change metaphors a bit, the whole burden of avoiding a global recession now rests on Alan Greenspan's shoulders.
Presumably Atlas won't shrug. But what if the task is beyond his powers?

HEADLINE: Army to Move Some Weapons Out of Europe 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
In the latest sign that the military is shifting its focus toward Asia, the Army said today that it planned to move combat weapons currently stored in Europe to the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.
 The move would involve arsenals in Germany and Italy that store weapons for wartime use. Military officials said there were no current plans to transfer any of the Army's 65,000 soldiers stationed in Europe, though the idea had been discussed at the Pentagon. 
 But just moving weapons and equipment out of Europe, where the American military has been a major presence for decades, is likely to raise concerns among the European allies that the United States' commitment to their region is waning. 
"It's a signal once again that we're going to shift our available resources around to fit the strategy as it evolves," Thomas White, the secretary of the Army, told reporters today at a breakfast meeting. 
Since taking office, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld has made clear he considers the Pacific to have rapidly growing military significance for several reasons: the rising power of China; the economic importance of South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore; the instability of Indonesia; and the development of long-range ballistic missiles in North Korea.
His views have fueled unease among the NATO allies and rumors in the Pentagon of imminent cuts in American military forces in Europe. More than once, Mr. Rumsfeld has had to assure the allies that NATO remained vital to American interests. 
But Mr. Rumsfeld has also pressed the chiefs and secretaries of the armed services to begin studying ways to position themselves better for possible conflict in Asia. 
The Army's decision to move so-called pre-positioned weapons from Europe to Diego Garcia is clearly one of the results. Officials said they could not immediately provide details on the amount and type of weapons being moved. The Navy stations cargo ships for transporting troops and equipment on the island, a British dependency that is 1,000 miles southwest of India, about equidistant from Indonesia and the Arabian peninsula.
"There is going to be a heightened awareness or concern about the Pacific region," Mr. White said. "I think we in the Army will have to look at that very closely, look at stationing around the Pacific rim and look to see if there are opportunities to posture ourselves better to respond to contingencies and future operational requirements in the region."
Mr. White acknowledged that there might be diplomatic fallout with Europe if the United States began reducing its military commitment on the continent. 
"We will have to very deliberately engage NATO and our alliance partners in the Pacific and consult with them as the changes are made," he said. "Certainly there are strong strategic implications both on the political and military side that have to be dealt with as we change the posture, if that's what the secretary of defense and the president decide to do."
But Mr. White also said he would prefer not to remove any American soldiers from Europe, largely because they are well positioned for moving in and out of peacekeeping missions in the Balkans. 
He also argued that even if large numbers of American troops were no longer needed to maintain stability in Europe, those European bases were ideally located for dispatching troops to hot spots elsewhere in the world.

Russians Deem Arrest Insult to Their Industry

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
The arrest and arraignment of a Russian programmer in the United States have provoked outrage in this country's computer programming industry.
 Programmers from St. Petersburg to Novosibirsk are talking about the charges brought against Dmitri Sklyarov, a 26-year-old programmer from Moscow, who was arrested in Las Vegas on July 16, after he spoke at a computer hackers' convention about his program that lets readers disable encryption software for electronic books. Mr. Sklyarov's employer, ElcomSoft, based here, also faces charges. 
 In Moscow today, the same day Mr. Sklyarov was arraigned in San Jose, Calif., a group of protesters tried to march in front of the United States Embassy, but were stopped by the police. 
"It's rubbish," said Gregory Nickonov, chief technical officer of Actis Systems, an e-business services concern that provides technical help to companies. People in information technology, he said, "have begun to think U.S. law is crazy," adding, "It's the same as buying a loaf of bread, and when you find the middle isn't baked, you come back to show the baker and get put in jail."
People here are angry mainly because they think that Mr. Sklyarov was singled out unjustly. And whatever the outcome of the case, they say, the arrest has hurt Russia's image, reinforcing stereotypes associated with this country's programmers.
"The image of Russian programmers now has a new negative," Natalya Kaspersky, head of Kaspersky Lab, Russia's leading antivirus software development company, said in an e-mail message. The company, she said, "puts enough energy into giving our partners an accurate picture of us as a stable and legitimate company," adding that "against the background of what has happened, that's harder to do."
Even before the Sklyarov case, Russia was battling an image as a center of software pirating. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the sharp drop in wages that followed, Russia was plunged into economic free fall, and pirating flourished. Today, street-side shops are packed with a wide array of pirated software. 
"Cracking and getting around things is a huge industry here -- for 10 or 15 bucks you can get anything that's out there," a Western manager of an American software company said.
ElcomSoft is one of the few Russian companies that creates commercial software products for sale outside the country. Begun in 1990, ElcomSoft began by writing software on order for companies like Hyundai and Visa International. By 1996, its founders -- two brothers, Aleksandr and Vladimir Katalov -- steered the business away from fulfilling orders for big corporations and began their own work. Now, they sell products like software that bypasses lost passwords. "We decided it's better to try to create our own programs -- that's more interesting, more alive," Aleksandr Katalov said by phone from California, where he is involved in the Sklyarov case.
The company employs about 20 programmers, who work from home in various Russian cities.
Although programmers in general here seem to be upset over the Sklyarov case, there are dissenting voices. 
Anton Nosik, president of Rambler Internet Holding, which owns the Web portal www.rambler.ru, said ElcomSoft, though not Mr. Sklyarov specifically, should be held responsible for the decryption software. The product appears to have been aimed at the counterfeiters' market, Mr. Nosik said, adding: "If you produce cracks, you should face the responsibility. It's a tool enticing someone to produce a counterfeit. This doesn't look like a libertarian move to me; it looks like commercial blackmail."

HEADLINE: Factory Jobs Move Overseas As Japan's Troubles Deepen 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
A generation ago, when America's manufacturing heartland was declining into a Rust Belt, Japan's leaders vowed to avoid the same fate as their own economy matured. Now, the global technology bust has sent manufacturing here into a precipitous decline that seems to be leading the chronically sick economy into another recession.
 One after another, giant manufacturers of chips, home electronics and other goods are announcing plans for sharp cuts in employment as Japan faces up to its high labor and production costs and the sharp slowdown in the world economy. 
Some companies, adhering to tradition, are cutting jobs abroad first. Today, the Kyocera Corporation said it would eliminate 20 percent of its work force, or 10,000 jobs, mostly in San Diego and South Carolina, and Fujitsu earlier this month announced 16,400 job cuts, mostly overseas. 
But other big manufacturers are making painful cuts at home. On Monday, the Toshiba Corporation announced that it would reduce its Japanese work force by 19,000 through early retirements and attrition. Today, Oki Electric Industry said it was cutting 2,200 jobs in Japan. 
During a decade of economic stagnation, the Japanese largely avoided the kind of company shutdowns and bankruptcy auctions that have raced through Silicon Valley in recent months and that devastated the manufacturing centers of America's Midwest and Northeast a generation ago. But the layoffs are picking up speed as Japan realizes that globalization is a two-way street; 20 years ago Japan Inc. was viewed as an invincible economic fortress by many in the West.
Unemployment figures released this week hit the psychological threshold of 5 percent, a level not seen since the post-World War II American occupation. More than 10 percent of young men between 18 and 24 years old who are just entering the work force are unable to find jobs.
Last month, Japan's trade surplus was down 64 percent from the previous July. If imports from China keep surging and Japanese manufacturers keep moving factories overseas, economists say that Japan's once fabled trade surplus could disappear by 2005 -- four decades after the first surplus was recorded.
The Japanese stock market -- which rallied last spring with the election of a new prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, who promised to undertake painful structural economic reforms -- fell today to its lowest close since October 1984. Investors are waiting to see if Mr. Koizumi, returning from a summer vacation, will act on his bold talk. Meanwhile, the weakened prospects of many of Japan's big exporters are leading the Nikkei stock index in its descent.
"Profits for this first half-year are going to be devastating," said Keiko Kondo, senior strategist for UFJ Capital Markets Securities. "Fujitsu, Toshiba -- they are just the beginning of a big trend emerging."
Given the news today that industrial production fell 2.8 percent from June to July, economists here say that Japan's economy, the second largest in the world, is contracting at an annualized rate of 4 percent.
With low odds of a rescue by a stagnant United States, Katsusada Hirose, a top government economics official here, warned reporters today, "Economic conditions are getting severe."
This year is shaping up as Japan's third recession in a decade. Today, the government released figures showing that the nation's so-called output index had fallen to its lowest level in seven years. The latest gross domestic product data will be released next Friday.
For years, Japanese manufacturers ducked downsizing, clinging to a social contract that called for lifetime employment. By shuttling workers among companies in a conglomerate and by reducing payrolls through attrition and retirements, Japanese companies avoided outright layoffs. Even now, some analysts say, Japan is dragging its feet.
"The U.S. is restructuring at warp speed -- companies are writing off bad debt; people are being laid off," Peter McKillop, a J. P. Morgan official in Japan, said after returning here from a visit to San Francisco. "Here, the bad-debt situation is excruciatingly slow. The layoffs are going drip, drip, drip. In America, it is a torrent."
Still, Japanese companies seem to be showing a new sensitivity to shareholder concerns about profits. That is a consequence, in part, of the rise of foreign ownership of shares on the Tokyo stock market, which has jumped to 20 percent from 4 percent during the last decade.
"The layoffs are a sign that the economy is indeed changing for the better," Robert A. Feldman, chief economist for Morgan Stanley Japan, said today. "There is greater awareness of shareholder value, better allocation of resources." 
Japan, of course, has been moving production offshore for years to better compete in world trade. Over the last decade, Japanese imports from Asian subsidiaries of Japanese companies increased eightfold, while Japan itself was eliminating three million manufacturing jobs, a cut of almost 20 percent.
This year, Aiwa is closing four Japanese plants to consolidate production in Malaysia. NEC is increasing its Asian production of computers; Canon is following suit with digital cameras, and Mitsubishi Electric is shifting its production of cellular phones offshore.
Lately, the biggest magnet for Japanese manufacturing investment has become China, a nation with 10 times the population of Japan.
A Chinese factory worker, just a short freighter trip away from here, will work two days for the same pay that some Japanese factory workers earn in one hour. 
So a few months ago, Toshiba announced that it would shift all its television production for the Japanese market to China. Sony is making components for its PlayStations in China. Olympus is closing its digital camera factory in Japan to build one in China. And Honda is considering constructing a plant in China to build motorcycles to export to Japan. And today, Kyocera said it would shift more production to China. 
The evolution has been gradual, and it is a seemingly inevitable aspect of Japan's economic maturation since World War II. But it nonetheless makes many Japanese uncomfortable. "China becomes the manufacturing center, taking over the role that Japan had," lamented Tomoharu Washio, a Japanese trade official. "But this time, China also becomes the market center. I am rather pessimistic about Japan."
In a survey last month of 562 major Japanese manufacturers, 49 percent told Nikkei Research that they planned to increase overseas production. Of this group, 71 percent said they were aiming at China. Increasingly beaten at its old game of exporting high-technology products, Japan experienced a 77 percent drop in July in its trade surplus with Asia, compared with last year's levels. With China, Japan registered a record $25 billion trade deficit last year, a sevenfold increase over the 1993 level.
"China is eating Japan's lunch," said Ronald Bevacqua, senior economist here for Commerz Securities. "More and more low-cost Japanese manufacturing is being shipped over there. Unlike the rest of Asia, China is doing high-end stuff as well."
To some degree, Japan is merely following the lead set by the United States a decade ago. Today, about 55 percent of production by American multinationals takes place outside of the United States. For Japan, the figure has risen to 45 percent.
Eamonn Fingleton, the American author of a book on Japanese production, "In Praise of Hard Industries" (Houghton Mifflin, 1999), says that Japan is staying one step ahead of China, shifting increasingly to capital- and knowledge-intensive processes like the manufacture of printing presses and textile machinery. 
"Where you have a capital-intensive process," Mr. Fingleton said in an interview, "high wages are not the most important of your costs."
But trade flows seem to contradict that analysis. During the first half of this year, when Japan recorded a $12.6 billion trade deficit with China, machinery and equipment surpassed textiles for the first time to become the leading category of Chinese exports to Japan.
"China will become the world's manufacturing center," Yomiuri Shimbun, a conservative newspaper, said in an editorial last week, noting that Japan's share of the global semiconductor market had dropped by half in a decade. "Unless something is done, Japan's economy has no bright prospects."
Westerners who have seen the industrial erosion of their economies are not quite as gloomy. Many predict a world several decades hence when Japan, with its aging population, is a "headquarters country," living in large part off investments overseas and brain work at home.
"The reality is that the de-industrialization is happening very rapidly in Japan," said Jesper Koll, a German who is chief economist for Merrill Lynch Japan. "I can see the Nike model here, where you do the brand management in Seattle and the manufacturing in Indonesia. In Japan, you will do the brand management in Osaka or Tokyo and the manufacturing in China."

HEADLINE: In 90's Economy, Middle Class Stayed Put, Analysis Suggests 

BYLINE:  By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
The booming late 1990's appear to have left the middle class in the New York region and California no better off than it was a decade before, an analysis of Census Bureau data suggests. The poor got a little poorer, the rich got a lot richer and the large group in the middle emerged slightly worse off than when the decade began.
 The analysis, conducted for The New York Times, compared income data from the 1990 census with data from an experimental Census Bureau survey done in 2000. It found that the median family income clearly declined in New York, California, Connecticut and Washington, D.C. 
 Andrew A. Beveridge, a professor of sociology at Queens College who conducted the analysis, said he also found that the gap between rich and poor throughout the country had inched wider during the 1990's. In Washington, D.C., for example, the average income of families in the wealthiest fifth of the population, once adjusted for inflation, grew to 24 times the average in the bottom fifth, up from 18 times. 
"There is a worsening of income inequality," Professor Beveridge said. "And in New York State, the middle class has not kept up. The poor have treaded water, more or less. The well-off have made gains. So you have this squeeze in the middle -- people like cops, firemen, people making under $80,000 a year."
Professor Beveridge's finding does not mean that particular individuals took home less money in 2000 than they had a decade earlier. It suggests a decline in the average income of families in the middle -- the ever-changing group comprising the 60 percent of all people who at any given time fall in the center of the income spectrum.
Some economists were skeptical that the decline was real. 
"I would challenge anybody to find a middle-class family in this region whose economic condition has declined," said Stephen Kagann, chief economist to Gov. George E. Pataki. He added, "Nobody's real income goes down during periods of prosperity -- no group of people. Everybody rises, but they rise at different rates."
Mr. Kagann pointed out that many middle-class people left New York during the recession of the early 1990's, and many immigrants moved in, some earning less than the people who left. "That by itself would bring the median down," Mr. Kagann said. "But that does not mean that a middle-class person is less well-off than they were in 1990. That would simply be untrue."
Meanwhile, the Census Bureau yesterday released updated estimates of the poverty rate nationally and state by state, based on several sets of federal data from 1998. When compared with 1990 census numbers, the new estimates show that the percentage of people in poverty dropped slightly nationally but crept upward in New York, New Jersey, California, Connecticut and other states.
What is expected to be a more definitive picture of state-by-state trends in income will be available next year, when income statistics from the 2000 census are scheduled to be released. In the meantime, the results of the experimental Census Bureau survey, which Professor Beveridge analyzed, are thought by many to offer a preliminary glimpse at state-level trends in the 1990's.
The bureau has warned that some of the survey data are not perfectly comparable to data from the 1990 census because the bureau asked slightly different questions of the two different groups of people surveyed. However, Professor Beveridge said the Census Bureau numbers released yesterday, and another set of annual bureau surveys, suggested similar trends.
Bruce Smith, principal economist for the California Department of Finance, expressed skepticism similar to Mr. Kagann's. The population studied by the Census Bureau changed between 1990 and 2000, he said. While the incomes of middle-class people who were in California in 1990 went up, he insisted, a lot of new arrivals probably make less that those who were there before.
Others found the findings less surprising.
Edward N. Wolff, a professor of economics at New York University who recently concluded from his own research that most families in the United States saw their net worth stagnate over the past decade, said that while median family income had risen in many places since the mid-1990's, "a lot of this was simply covering losses that occurred in the early 1990's."
Robert D. Yaro, executive director of the Regional Plan Association, a civic group that focuses on the economy in the tristate region, said that much of upstate New York suffered badly in the 1990's and that eastern Connecticut is still recovering from the loss of defense and manufacturing jobs in the early 1990's and from changes in the financial sector.
The numbers Professor Beveridge analyzed came from the Census 2000 Supplementary Survey, a survey of 700,000 households nationwide that is being used to test the feasibility of collecting census data in a new way. He compared those data with income figures from the 1990 census, adjusted for inflation using the index used by the Census Bureau.
Comparing those two sets of numbers, he found that median family income in New York State declined to an estimated $52,313, down $2,876; in California, to $53,037, off $3,288; in Connecticut, to $64,502, down $3,821; and in Washington, D.C., to $45,943, down $4,406. Median family income measures the income of relatives living together.
Median household income declined in many states, Professor Beveridge found. But some economists suggested that median family income is a more telling measure of the position of people in the middle, in part because the nationwide rise in one-person households may account for much of the drop in household income, the income of anyone, related or not, in a home.
A similar pattern is visible in the median household income numbers from another Census Bureau survey, the annual Current Population Survey, a trusted source of income and poverty data at the national level. Median household income for the tristate area around New York rose throughout the 1980's until 1990, then dropped sharply before turning around in 1996.
Looking more closely at family income, Professor Beveridge found that the biggest gains occurred among the most affluent. In New York, the average family income in the richest fifth of the population rose to $173,418, or 13.6 times the average income of the poorest fifth. Nationally, the average for the top group rose to 10.9 times that of the bottom group, up from 10.4 in 1990.
Professor Beveridge found that average income rose nationally, in part because the average was pulled upward by large increases in income among the rich. His analysis looked only at income, not at wealth or overall net worth.
Census Bureau officials said they could not say how much of any apparent decline in median family incomes might be attributable to differences in design of the the 1990 census and the 2000 supplementary survey. Ed Welniak, chief of the income surveys branch, said a test by the bureau found differences in the way people answered different sets of income questions.
When asked their income in the previous 12-month period, people tended to give a lower figure than when asked their income in the previous calendar year, he said. In the 1990 and 2000 censuses, people were asked about the previous calendar year; in the supplementary survey and the Current Population Survey, they were asked their income in the previous 12 months.
"What will help us in understanding what might be going on is when we produce the 2000 census data," Mr. Welniak said. "We will have two sets of data, both using the previous calendar year. We will have a much better comparison to compare the 1990 data with. It will negate that methodologic difference."
Jared Bernstein, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research organization in Washington, who had reservations about comparing the survey data with the 1990 census, said that even so, there were trends in certain economic sectors that could shed light on any apparent income decline in a place like New York.
"Particularly New York City was very hard hit by the recession in 1990-91," he said. "For New York, it was a much deeper recession than for other areas of the country. It didn't really come on line with the economic boom until a year or two after the rest of the country."
In addition, he said: "The financial markets and high-rolling bond traders at the very top of the economic scale did very well over the latter 90's when incomes were growing quickly. But at the same time, New York generated reams of low-end service jobs -- jobs in retail, cashiers, the tourism industry, hotels and the low end of health care. If you add a bunch of low-wage workers at the beginning of the income scale, that lowers the median."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
A Victim of Wide Economic Fears, Dow Falls Below 10,000

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
It has been a long, cold summer on Wall Street. Stock prices, which have staggered since June, fell yesterday, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average below 10,000 for the first time since April. The Dow and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index both lost 1.70 percent, while the Nasdaq composite index dropped 2.79 percent.
 Investors, who had pushed stocks higher in the spring in hopes that the economy would pick up steam by fall, have registered their disappointment by punishing stock prices. Since June, the Dow industrials have fallen 10 percent and the Nasdaq, 15 percent. 
 Technology companies continue to report plunging sales and profit, and bad economic news from Europe and Japan has investors worried that all the world's major economies may be shrinking at once. Continued spending by consumers kept the United States economy growing just barely in the second quarter, despite a sharp drop in investment by businesses.
But with corporate profits weak, Wall Street fears that further layoffs this fall could undermine consumer confidence, sending the country into a recession and worsening the slump in the rest of the world. So far, that risk remains slight, but the prospect has investors nervous.
"The problem with this kind of thinking is that there's no way to dispel it," said John Manley, senior equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. Until economic indicators point to recovery and corporate profits show signs of reaching a bottom, he said, investors will worry that job cuts will lead to a recessionary spiral.
The Dow and S.& P. 500 now stand within 5 percent of the lows they set in April, while the Nasdaq is less than 10 percent above its April low, and down nearly 65 percent from its high in March 2000. 
Technology stocks led the way down again yesterday. The Nasdaq broke through the 1,800 level, skidding 51.49 points, to 1,791.68, after Sun Microsystems, which makes computer servers, said its sales would fall short of forecasts. The Dow fell 171.32 points, to 9,919.58, and the S.& P. 500 dropped 19.57 points, to 1,129.03.
So far this week, the Dow is down 4.8 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index has lost 6.5 percent.
Microsoft, the largest-capitalization stock in the Nasdaq index and the second-largest S.& P. component, lost more than 5 percent of its value yesterday, dropping $3.31, to $56.94, after the European Commission said it had expanded its inquiry into whether the company had broken antitrust laws. Microsoft's decline accounted for about one-tenth of the S.& P. index's loss yesterday.
Lurking in the back of some professional investors' minds is a recent drop in Japanese stock prices, which initially collapsed in 1990 and have moved erratically lower since. Japan has recently received attention as the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 stocks has fallen to a point where it now trades at almost the same numerical level as the Dow industrials. (At the end of 1989, the Nikkei figures were at 14 times the Dow's level.)
"It's like something out of 'A Christmas Carol,' " Mr. Manley said of the Japanese market level. "I was once as you are now. That's the philosophical implication."
Besides, the new weakness in Japanese stock prices reflects a belief that the nation's economy will probably not recover any time soon, Mr. Manley said, adding, "You have both the nasty example of the past and the concerns about the present."
He said he thought that fears of a potential meltdown would prove to be groundless. "The tendency of the American consumer to spend probably does stand us in pretty good stead," he said. Mr. Manley expects the S.& P. 500 index to rise to a level near 1,500 by the end of 2002, although he says that the next several months could be rocky.
Robert J. Shiller, an economics professor at Yale and author of "Irrational Exuberance," said that stocks might recover much more slowly than investors would like. "We're just emerging from the biggest bull market in history," Mr. Shiller said. "We kind of lost our moorings in the stock market."
In popular mythology, booms end in panicked sell-offs, he said. But in reality, shifts in market psychology come slowly. Stocks are "gradually fading," Mr. Shiller said, "but that's how markets unwind themselves."
Some professional money managers were more optimistic. James M. Weiss, chief investment officer at State Street Research, said people forget that interest rate cuts take time to stimulate the economy. The Federal Reserve has cut short-term rates seven times since the beginning of the year to help the economy by lowering the borrowing costs of companies and consumers. Eventually, he said, those rate cuts will work, but Wall Street is impatient.
"People have forgotten the lessons of post-World War II cycles, of which we had nine from 1946 to 1990," Mr. Weiss said, "and they've forgotten the lessons of how monetary policy works." Usually, the Fed's cuts take at least six to nine months to be effective, he added.
"We have lower rates, lower taxes, lower energy prices, and mortgage refinances," Mr. Weiss said. "I just don't see the economy taking another leg down in 2002."
Douglas Eby, president of Robert E. Torray & Company and manager of the Torray Institutional Fund, said he saw many companies' shares trading at attractive prices, especially drug makers and financial services companies. 
"The dramatic drop in the Nasdaq and the rather substantial drop in the Standard & Poor's 500, in my view, has been driven by the collapse in the technology and telecom sectors," he said. "To extrapolate from this phenomenon that the whole economy is collapsing is incorrect." --------------------

HEADLINE: TREATIES MAY CURB FARMERS' SUBSIDIES 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
Every five or six years Congress argues over how to subsidize farmers. But this time around the forces against big subsidies have a new weapon: the international trade agreements the United States signed promising to reduce those payments. 
 For the first time in the tumultuous debate over farm policy, lawmakers trying to increase already ballooning farm subsidies could be forced to retreat because of limits required under the World Trade Organization for certain subsidies. 
 The trade dispute has become a major political battle within Republican ranks. Free-trading Republicans, particularly Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman, are up against several influential farm-state Republicans in the House who want to keep the large payments. This summer Representative Larry Combest, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, criticized Ms. Veneman as giving in to treaty requirements, in what he called "unilateral disarmament." 
And looming in the background is the budget problem created by the rapidly dwindling surplus that could force lawmakers to rethink the bill expected to be voted on in September in the House. In a recent report on the budget, the Bush administration warned that lawmakers would have to find other items to cut to offset some payments in the farm bill.
For her part, Ms. Veneman refused to talk specifics about the House bill, saying only that any farm bill has to respect trade agreements.
"We don't want to be left behind on trade," she said in an interview. "We have to be a lead player."
Senate leaders have just begun to write a farm bill, which they say will place greater emphasis on conservation, like paying farmers to return cropland to prairie, which would not violate trade agreements. They, too, say they are worried that the House bill would upset the United States' trading position.
When they passed the last farm measure -- the "Freedom to Farm" bill of 1996 -- lawmakers agreed to phase out a system in place since the Depression, promising to reduce subsidy payments based on fluctuating prices or the amount of crops produced. Under the World Trade Organization agreement, the payments are considered trade-distorting and have strict caps.
When farmers balked at the rigors of the free market, however, Congress approved emergency payments and loan payments. The result was that subsidies quadrupled, to $32.2 billion last year from $7.3 billion in 1995. 
Anticipating the dispute over subsidies, the House Agriculture Committee took up its farm bill one year ahead of schedule, writing a 10-year, $171 billion measure that not only keeps current payments but also includes a new subsidy called countercyclical payments, which would give farmers additional money when prices drop. Even sponsors concede that those payments could exceed international treaty limits.
Indeed, an internal analysis by the Agriculture Department warns that the House farm bill would exceed the subsidy limits imposed by the world trade agreement, a senior department official said on condition of anonymity.
"The House is on its way to producing a bill that goes against the W.T.O.," the official said. "The bill's countercyclical payments are clearly related to price, and there is no question they fail to meet W.T.O. criteria."
Also of concern to trade officials is an effort in the House measure to lift some restrictions on how much money each farmer can receive. Already, 10 percent of American farmers receive 61 percent of the subsidies.
"U.S. policy is going in the wrong direction," said Gerry Kiely, agriculture counselor for the European Union delegation here. "The new subsidies plus lifting the caps effectively remove the farmer from market signals and give greater subsidies to crops for export."
Mr. Combest, recovering from surgery, was unavailable for comment. But a senior aide to the Agriculture Committee said such disagreements over what constitutes fair and unfair subsidies were normal between Europe and the United States. 
In a letter last week, Senator Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, and Senator Richard G. Lugar, the Indiana Republican who is ranking minority member of the committee, asked Ms. Veneman to give them a report on whether the House bill complied with world trade requirements.
Sponsors of a rival House amendment that would also increase conservation payments have used the trade argument to win 125 co-sponsors to shift more money to environment-friendly programs that also adhere to trade restrictions.
"Unlike the payments made to farmers for certain commodity production, conservation payments are considered nontrade distorting," said Representative Ron Kind, Democrat of Wisconsin.
Ms. Veneman, a lawyer and the former deputy agriculture secretary in the previous Bush administration, has made trade her signature issue and said that any new farm bill must conform to trade agreements. She and the lawmakers all agreed that President Bush would not sign a farm bill that would exceed the limits of the trade agreement.
Agricultural exports have doubled in the past decade, Ms. Veneman said, and the United States has a positive trade balance for food and agricultural products.
Mr. Combest, the agricultural committee chairman with ties to his fellow Texan in the White House, made a rare public attack against Ms. Veneman in June. He accused her of wrongly declaring some crop subsidies as trade-distorting. Mr. Combest then withdrew his name as a sponsor of legislation to give the president new trade promotion authority, which allows the administration to negotiate trade agreements that Congress must accept or reject, but not amend. Ms. Veneman has promoted the measure tirelessly. 
The Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute, a federally financed institute that does independent agricultural research for Congress, has told Mr. Combest that his House bill has a 37 percent chance of breaking trade limits next year.
"It's much higher than the current policy because the new House bill carries forward current policies and puts new ones on top of it," said Chad E. Hart, an agricultural economist who wrote the report along with Bruce A. Babcock, a professor of economics at Iowa State University.

HEADLINE: Officers' Union Endorses Vallone; Green Backs Increasing Some Taxes but as a Last Resort 

BYLINE:  By KEVIN FLYNN and ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
Peter F. Vallone has won the support of the New York Patrolmen's Benevolent Association in his race for mayor, officials announced at the union's annual resort in the Catskills yesterday. In Manhattan, Mark Green said he would support "as a last resort" raising taxes to pay for police protection and improving schools.
 The union is the last of the major New York City unions expected to endorse a candidate before the Sept. 11 Democratic primary. Officials familiar with the decision said the union's executive board had been moved by what it considered Mr. Vallone's powerful advocacy of police issues while he has been City Council speaker. Mr. Vallone's aides described the endorsement as a major boost for his campaign. 
 Mr. Green's statement about taxes was a subtle if definite shift on an issue that the Democrats have, for the most part, stepped around. Mr. Green, in particular, has gone to some lengths to avoid taking positions that might reinforce his image as being liberal, and had strongly rejected the idea of raising taxes, though he had not ruled it out completely.
But in a news conference outside City Hall yesterday, where Mr. Green, the public advocate, proposed a series of programs to combat crime by youths, including the creation of courts to handle those cases, he volunteered that he might, under certain circumstances, consider a tax increase as mayor. He noted that he had made a similar remark during a candidates' debate on Tuesday.
Mr. Green said he believed he could save enough money to finance the spending he has proposed in this campaign by merging redundant departments in City Hall, cutting police overtime, and making an increased use of "e-government" -- making governmental services available via computer.
"At the same time, if I decided that it would cost more money to shrink class size, or have youth courts, which are literally nominal as an expense in a $40 billion budget, of course I'd be prepared as a last resort to pay for it with increased revenues," Mr. Green continued, speaking slowly and choosing his words deliberately. "But to propose it as a first resort, during a potential coming of a recession, I think is a bad policy fiscally, and unnecessary."
Mr. Green declined to say what taxes he might consider increasing. 
Although increasing taxes is not the kind of position that wins elections in most parts of the country, some Democrats believe it appeals to the kind of liberal Democrats who are expected to turn out in the primary.
With his remarks, Mr. Green has edged closer to the position of Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller, who has said he would support increasing taxes, as a last resort, to pay for more spending on education. A third candidate, Fernando Ferrer, has called for reinstituting part of the expiring surcharge on the income tax to pay for after-school programs. Mr. Vallone has said that increasing taxes would hurt New York's economy.
Mr. Vallone's campaign workers were clearly cheered by the police union's support. 
They pre-empted the union's plan to announce its endorsement Tuesday by sending an e-mail message about the union's support to newspapers yesterday afternoon. In the message, Mattis Goldman, a spokesman for Mr. Vallone, said, "Most New Yorkers would agree that the candidate the P.B.A. endorses will be the one who is best qualified to keep our streets safe." 
Although many of the 26,000 people represented by the union are not registered to vote in New York, the endorsement is considered extremely valuable as a way for a candidate to establish his credentials on law-enforcement issues.

HEADLINE: In Fort Greene, Prosperity Is Bittersweet; 
Some Blacks Reap Profits As Others Lament Change

BYLINE:  By ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
On a recent sweet summer evening on a sidewalk in Brooklyn, two acquaintances, middle-class black men approaching 40, got to talking. The conversation turned, as it often does in Fort Greene, to the three R's: race, riches and real estate. They played the license-plate game.
 "Look at these cars," said Dezo El, pointing at the sedans and S.U.V.'s hugging the curb of South Elliott Place. "Vermont. My man here is from Connecticut. That car over there says Virginia. The woman across the street has North Carolina plates." 
 The other man nodded his agreement. "I don't mind when a community changes," said the man, a photographer with a salt-and-pepper beard who gave his name only as Gregory. "But the way it's changing, it's not changing for me and you. It's changing for them." He turned to a passer-by, expecting an amen. But the passer-by, Earl Avery, was having none of it. 
"You can't say it's not changing for the better for us," Mr. Avery said. "A lot of black folks who owned homes here took the money and ran, moved to Staten Island or down South or wherever. I live here, and it's changing for the better for me."
The difference between the men is that Mr. Avery, 44, a solidly built former gym teacher who scrimped and saved his way out of the Fort Greene projects, is a homeowner himself -- he has several buildings in the neighborhood -- while Gregory is an increasingly skittish renter.
The city's latest wave of gentrification is hitting Fort Greene full force, pushing tenants of all races from their brownstone apartments even as it lines DeKalb Avenue with hip new restaurants.
But in a twist on the standard script, some of the prime beneficiaries of the boom in Fort Greene (besides the real estate agencies that form an economic development zone unto themselves) have been middle- and working-class blacks: nurses and mailmen and civil servants who bought their houses cheap in the 60's, 70's and 80's and kept the community together while most other black neighborhoods in the city were falling apart.
"The very people who bought their brownstones during white flight are the same people who are making money selling to the upper classes now," said Jerry Minsky, a senior vice president of the Corcoran Group, the Manhattan real estate giant, who runs its new Fort Greene office. 
Although it may be heartening to think of Grandma riding off into the sunset with a suitcase full of cash, the new order has created hard feelings. And it has brought a growing fear that Fort Greene -- a home of the black American dream with a proud history of racial integration, art and culture -- is becoming just another yuppie haven.
When Mr. Avery said that he would rent one of his apartments to the first person willing to fork over $1,500 a month if the black tenant currently paying $800 moved out, Gregory all but called him a traitor.
"That's the problem," Gregory snapped. "You got people like you renting to whoever can pay the rents, and it's mostly white folks, and there goes the neighborhood."
In fact, the white influx into Fort Greene is not as far-reaching as it may seem. In the center of the neighborhood, south and east of Fort Greene Park, where about a quarter of its 35,000 residents live, the white population has jumped 47 percent since 1980, while the black population is down 8 percent, according to the census. But over all, not even counting the overwhelmingly nonwhite projects, the percentage of Fort Greene residents who are white has increased only to 25 percent from 23 percent since 1980, and the percentage of blacks has dipped only slightly, to 59 percent from 63 percent.
The common denominator of the newcomers is not race but money. Household income tripled from 1980 to 1997, the most recent year for which statistics are available, to $55,650 from $18,250, in 1997 dollars, according to the census. The couples who pack the tables at Chez Oskar and the Butta Cup on DeKalb and stroll beneath the plane trees among the million-dollar homes on South Portland Avenue are as diverse and as striking as a Benetton ad.
But perception, to a certain extent, is reality. Earlier this summer, the opening of a sushi restaurant, that beachhead of white urban culture, was widely viewed as a sinister omen.
"The day that the sushi restaurant opened, it was packed, and the customers were predominantly white," said Letitia James, a black candidate for City Council whose campaign office on Greene Avenue is just down the street. "And I heard people in their conversations that night -- 'What it is, we're being pushed out.' "
Notwithstanding Mr. Avery's sunny outlook, many longtime homeowners who have decided to stay put feel bittersweet. Crime is way down, and there is an undeniable joy in watching one's home equity balloon. But even though they want to stay in the neighborhood, they say the neighborhood they love is disappearing.
"Most of the people here now are in and out, don't have time to talk," said Gail Fields, a nurse in her 50's who lives on Adelphi Street in a house her parents bought in 1953. "People don't stay, I guess because they can't afford the rent. You don't really bond with anybody."
Fort Greene is also changing in ways that are not so immediately obvious. On Ms. Fields's stoop, her daughter, Tanyika, 30, sat with three old friends. They all said they welcomed the improvements in the neighborhood.
"They built up the parks around here, made it better," said one of them, Denise Maynor, 38, a bookkeeper. "We've got more trees on our block."
But after a few minutes, she let slip that she did not live in Fort Greene anymore. She had been living with her parents and needed more space for her three children, so she moved to a three-bedroom in Crown Heights, where she pays $710 a month. 
"You can't live here," she said flatly. "You have to have like four incomes." 
Just as there are plenty of whites who have also profited from the transformation of Fort Greene, there are many white residents who bemoan it. "The spirit of avarice and greed has taken over yet another wonderful New York neighborhood," said Velta Kanepajs, 53, a retired hospital administrator who was forced out of her duplex in July by a landlady who raised the rent for the next tenant to $2,400, from $1,400. "They're going to choke on their bags of money."
The unease in the neighborhood has bubbled over a few times. In early summer, white paint was splattered on a billboard outside the new Corcoran office showing two of the company's white executives surrounded by smiling children, only one of them black. "It coincided with a time when there was the sushi restaurant opening," Mr. Minsky offered by way of explanation.
In February, tenant organizers held protests against another broker, Realty on the Green, for trying to evict Leonor Rodriguez, 67, her mother and her terminally ill son from the building it had just bought.
Last year, several of the trendier black-owned stores on Fulton Street were hit with graffiti warning, "We're taking back our neighborhood."
But for the most part, those in Fort Greene who do not like the way their neighborhood is changing do not seem to know what, if anything, can be done. They hold forums on gentrification and displacement, but little has come of them.
"I wish we had a miracle answer for it, but it's very complex," said Vivian Becker, executive director of the Pratt Area Community Council, an advocacy group that helped more than 700 tenants in Fort Greene, Clinton Hill and Bedford-Stuyvesant, including Ms. Rodriguez, fight eviction in the year ending June 30, about 250 more than the year before. 
Meanwhile, every moving day brings an army of yellow vans. 
As August rolled around, Ms. Rodriguez stood in her kitchen knee-deep in boxes, packing off to an apartment in Queens she had never seen.
Up the street, John Paul Tutela and his two housemates, recent graduates of New York University, were moving out of their duplex. But Mr. Tutela, who is white and was bound for medical school, said he would love to return.
"There's a brownstone for sale on the block," he said, "and I was thinking of trying to get some investors together because this neighborhood is definitely going to increase."
A few days later, his words would be echoed by Mr. Avery.
"It's not like white people got a conspiracy saying, 'Let's buy everything,' " he told his neighbor Gregory. "Since you're a brother first, why don't you get together a group of people, an investment group, and help black people buy buildings in the neighborhood?" 
Gregory seemed to ponder Mr. Avery's words for a while. Then he said goodbye, got on his bike and rode off.

HEADLINE: Central Bank In Europe Cuts A Rate Slightly 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
Conceding that Europe has been hit much harder by the American slowdown than it had expected, the European Central Bank changed course today and announced a small reduction in its benchmark interest rate.
 "The slowdown in economic growth emanating from the slowdown in the United States is larger, deeper and lasting longer that had been anticipated earlier," said Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank. For only the second time this year, the central bank reduced its main refinancing rate, trimming it by one-quarter of a percentage point, to 4.25 percent. 
 Though most analysts had been expecting a move of this sort within the next month, the ambiguity in recent signals from the central bank had left them guessing about whether it would come today and about the bank's longer-term posture. As recently as Wednesday, the president of Germany's influential central bank said that interest rates were not having a "restrictive effect" and that it was not the European Central Bank's job to "fine-tune economic growth." 
In contrast to the United States Federal Reserve, which has reduced interest rates seven times this year in a so far unsuccessful effort to jump-start American growth, the European Central Bank has until now been preoccupied with stamping out signs of accelerating inflation. 
European inflation, which had hit an annual rate of more than 3 percent, has moderated in the last month. But economic growth has slowed sharply and come to a near standstill in Germany and Italy. European leaders had been confident just a few months ago that euro-zone growth would exceed that of the United States this year, but they now concede that the difference may be negligible.
Today, Mr. Duisenberg said the central bank no longer thought that European growth could reach its normal long-term rate of 2.0 to 2.5 percent this year. That tracks with warnings from a growing number of private economists, who predict that European growth may drop to well below 2 percent.
"I don't think we underestimated the impact" of the American slowdown, Mr. Duisenberg said at a news conference today. "What we did underestimate was the length and the severity of the U.S. slowdown. We, obviously, together with U.S. authorities, tended to be too optimistic."
Mr. Duisenberg justified the decision to relax monetary policy today mainly by arguing that inflationary pressures were receding. The tone of his remarks suggested that the central bank might feel it had more maneuvering room to relax monetary policy. Consumer prices climbed 2.8 percent in July from a year earlier, still more than the bank wants but much less than prices jumped in May. 
Yet the European approach remains markedly different from that of the United States. Central bankers here show no readiness to embark on a long series of rate cuts, as the Federal Reserve has conducted. And many economists say the European Central Bank has reacted too slowly, allowing itself to follow rather than to lead market expectations. 
"In general, we think the E.C.B. moved later than it should have," said Elga Bartsch, an economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in London. Europeans are unlikely to get more than one more quarter-point rate cut before the end of the year, Ms. Bartsch added. "The situation in Europe is quite different from that in the United States," she said. "Europe is not on the brink of a recession."
That is not to say that it could not use a lift. Many of Europe's biggest companies have announced plans for big work force reductions in recent months. Ericsson, the Swedish electronics manufacturer, is eliminating 22,000 jobs; its German rival Siemens is cutting 10,000. Big reductions are under way at chemical conglomerates like Bayer and BASF; retailers like Marks & Spencer; and the European operations of American car manufacturers like Ford and General Motors. 
Europe's problems stem only partly from the cooling United States economy. Exports have indeed grown much more slowly this year than last, even though the continued weakness of the euro against the dollar makes European goods comparatively cheap on world markets. But the real problem is domestic consumption, which has fallen off because of rising prices for oil and food and because domestic business confidence has been weak. With neither domestic dynamism nor thriving exports to drive growth, Europe suddenly looks more anemic than it did just a few months ago. 
A growing number of experts contend that the European Central Bank should have seen the trouble coming and headed it off sooner. 
"I think they have waited too long to lower interest rates," said Karl Otto Pohl, who was president of the Bundesbank, the German central bank, through most of the 1990's and helped draft the law that created the European Central Bank. "If they wait too long, they lose credibility, because the market says, 'What are you waiting for?' It is a credibility problem, and the E.C.B. has this problem in particular because it is a new institution."
Sharda Dean, European economist at Merrill Lynch, said the central bank had been too worried about inflation. "The E.C.B.'s behavior over the last six months makes them look slow, almost as if they are looking at the wrong data," she said. "For this rate cut to feed through into stronger productivity, it will take eight months -- and by that time, we think the European economy will be recovering."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Regulators In Europe Add To Scrutiny Of Microsoft

BYLINE:  By PAUL MELLER 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Aug. 30 

 BODY:
The European Commission broadened its antitrust investigation of Microsoft today, introducing new accusations about the company's bundling of its Windows Media Player, and backing up existing concerns about the company's practices in the server operating systems market with new evidence. 
 The commission said that Microsoft might have violated European antitrust rules by "using illegal practices to extend its dominant position in the market for personal computer operating systems into the market for low-end server operating systems." And it raised new concerns about the bundling of the Windows Media Player, which plays audio and video files, into the Windows 2000 operating system. 
 Microsoft has amassed an almost 60 percent share of the market for low-end, or work group, servers, which are used by company departments or small businesses to connect PC's with shared printers, shared files and Web servers, according to the Computer and Communications Industry Association, an industry group based in Washington. Rivals in this market include Sun Microsystems, Novell and the Linux operating system, but none has a market share anywhere approaching Microsoft's. 
Today's complaint did not directly address Microsoft's newest operating system, Windows XP, which was sent to computer manufacturers last week and will begin appearing in new computers in September.
A spokeswoman for the European Commission, Amelia Torres, said the commission was "aware of developments in the market, but is not currently investigating Windows XP." Competitors say that Windows XP shares many of the characteristics criticized by antitrust regulators in Europe and the United States.
Microsoft has about two months to reply in writing to the latest statement of objections, but it issued a statement denying any wrongdoing.
"We are confident that once it has completed its investigation, the European Commission will be assured that we run our business in full compliance with E.U. law," Jean Philippe Courtois, president of Microsoft for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said in a statement. He added that Microsoft worked "hard to ensure that Windows works well with products from other companies."
Microsoft said that the commission's action consolidated and narrowed its previous concerns. John Frank, a senior corporate lawyer for Microsoft, called the merging of the two separate antitrust actions "a constructive step forward." He said the company would request a hearing with the commission. 
The newest element of the commission's action today involved Microsoft's integrating its Windows Media Player into Windows 2000, a move that the commission said "may deprive PC manufacturers and final users of a free choice" over which software to use for audio and video on the Web, "especially as there are no ready technical means to remove or uninstall the Media Player product."
Similar concerns have been raised in the United States by competitors to Microsoft, like RealNetworks, which makes the similar RealPlayer software. Its program is used to stream audio and video material by America Online, which competes with Microsoft on several fronts.
The commissioner in charge of competition matters, Mario Monti, said the commission "wants to see undistorted competition in the market for media players," saying that these products will "revolutionize the way people listen to music or watch videos" and experience e-commerce.
At the same time, the commission expanded on earlier charges regarding server software.
Its initial action was prompted by a complaint lodged by Sun Microsystems in 1998. It contended that Microsoft was using earlier versions of its Windows operating system software to muscle rivals out of the market for server software. It also contended that Microsoft used discriminatory licensing and refused to supply software information that would allow rival server products to work as well as Microsoft's own. 
In February 2000, the commission began a separate investigation to see if Microsoft was doing the same thing with the latest version of its operating system software, Windows 2000. As in the first case, the commission said it thought that Microsoft might have withheld crucial information from vendors of alternative server software that would allow their products to communicate better with Microsoft's dominant PC and server software products. 
Another new focus in the European Union's enlarged antitrust inquiry is whether Microsoft sought to extend its dominance from the PC to the server market through the operation of an abusive licensing policy for Windows 2000, the commission said.
Under the Microsoft policy, if customers chose not to use an all-inclusive Microsoft setup for PC's and servers, they were forced to bear additional costs, the commission said. "The effect of this abusive licensing policy may be to artificially drive customers towards Microsoft server products," the commission said. 
Lawyers involved in the case said they thought companies in the low-end server market, as well as competitors to Microsoft's streaming media software, might have raised objections about the bundling of Windows Media Player, spurring the commission to act.
"It would be wrong to assume the allegations only came from Media Player's direct rivals," said Thomas Vinje, a partner in the Brussels office of the law firm of Morrison & Foerster, which represents several information technology companies, including Sun Microsystems.
"Microsoft isn't focused on stealing share from RealNetworks," Mr. Vinje added. "It wants to use Media Player to gain leverage in the work group server market. In order for Media Player to work properly on your PC, the server you are connected to will have to carry Media Player on its operating system."

HEADLINE: Squandering Our Technological Future 

BYLINE:  By Jim Clark; Jim Clark is the founder of Silicon Graphics, Netscape, Healtheon (now WebMD) and myCFO. He is on the board of Shutterfly, myCFO and DNA Sciences.

DATELINE: MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. 

 BODY:
Two years ago I pledged to donate $150 million to create a center for biomedical engineering and science at Stanford. Now Congress and the president are thwarting part of the intended purpose of this center by supporting restrictions on stem cell research and cloning. While only a portion of Stanford's plans involve stem cells, I believe research that uses them is vital to the future of medicine. I am therefore suspending $60 million of my remaining pledge pending the outcome of ongoing political deliberations.
 After forming Silicon Graphics, Netscape and Healtheon, I felt that the next wave of exciting scientific discoveries and entrepreneurism would come from the combination of molecular biology and technology. John Hennessy, president of Stanford, who shares this conviction, introduced me to Greg Kovacs, a Stanford electrical engineering professor already working in this field. Mr. Kovacs's most fascinating project involved cultivating embryonic chicken cells. His team had coaxed them to evolve into heart cells, which were grown into a thin, beating layer over an integrated circuit. This little biocomputer was like a canary in the coal mine, detecting minute traces of chemicals that would alter the beat of the heart cells. 
 What intrigued me most about Mr. Kovacs's work was the implication that it might be possible to create human heart cells from human embryonic stem cells. I saw a new future for medicine and biology and for resulting entrepreneurship, and I was inspired to make a grant to help create an environment where this type of research could be done.
Lately, stem cell research and cloning have caught the attention of Washington. Driven by ignorance, conservative thinking and fear of the unknown, our political leaders have undertaken to make laws that suppress this type of research. 
Cloning a complete human being violates something intrinsic to our moral sense, and to my knowledge, no one at Stanford is interested in this. Nonreproductive cloning, or therapeutic cloning, however, is simply a process to create genetically compatible cells. Perhaps it should not be called cloning at all. Its purpose is simply to create cells that will not suffer rejection when combined with normal bodily tissue. To that end, it is less objectionable than destroying an embryo created by normal fertilization.
A law prohibiting nonreproductive cloning is inappropriate. A more rational approach is to regulate it, as the United Kingdom has done. It now seems that creating genetically compatible new skin cells for burn victims, pancreas cells for diabetics, nerve cells for those with spinal cord injuries and many, many other potential advances will soon be illegal in the United States.
Compounding our problem, President Bush has unequivocally stated that no federal funding will be available for human stem cell research on future embryos. Astonishingly, he insists that he will not change his mind.
Restricting our researchers to 60 or any other number of existing stem cell lines is beyond comprehension. Who can say, in such a nascent field, that existing lines will not die, that they will not become contaminated, or that they have not already specialized in unknown ways? Moreover, the problem of gaining access to existing lines wastes valuable time by directing researchers' energies in unproductive ways.
Having taught electrical engineering at Stanford and benefited there from federal research funds, I can say that with no prospect of federal support, significant scientific inquiry in a field like stem cell research will stop. No research leader can forgo federal money.
Denying financing for this biomedical research will drive the formation of a new pharmaceutical industry outside the United States. Federally funded research helped create America's economic leadership in the Internet and computer technology. It led to the formation of companies like Silicon Graphics, Sun Microsystems, Cisco and Netscape. Restricting stem cell research for even a few years simply means that scientists in the United States will not be pioneers. Others will own the patents and claims, and a new pharmaceutical industry will thrive elsewhere.
I believe our country risks being thrown into a dark age of medical research. Biologists are at the threshold of the most important set of discoveries in history, and rather than teach and lead, our politicians react and follow a conservative few. This legislative action will cause the United States to miss a revolution in biology. Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom a new industry will be born.
It is futile to think that private funding can make up what is being lost to laws driven by conservative politics. I therefore have reluctantly decided to suspend further contributions until our lawmakers decide to pursue what I believe to be a rational course in this vital part of our national future.

HEADLINE: Search for Soulmate Leads the Russians To Turn to Germany 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: KALININGRAD, Russia 

 BODY:
Those who wonder where Russia's affections turned after its American infatuation soured should come to this enclave of farms and Baltic beachfront, a prize patch of German heartland until the Red Army seized it in 1945, and talk to Irina Korobova. They'll get an earful.
 In a three-story factory where Soviet laborers once outfitted fishing trawlers, Ms. Korobova, 27, is the deputy director of Grammer AG Kaliningrad, a spotless German plant whose 380 workers produce upholstery for 5,000 BMW's, Volkswagens and Audis daily. 
 She learned German in high school. Grammer trained her in Germany after college. This year, she completed German business school. 
"Just working at these enterprises is a great experience," she said. "You learn the mentality of Germans; you learn their punctuality. And we have the German system of quality control -- calculated in parts per million."
Nobody doubts that by virtue of wealth and power alone, the United States will dominate Russia's foreign policy for decades. But when Russia seeks a Western soulmate these days, it looks not across the Atlantic, but just 230 miles west, where Poland stops -- and Germany begins.
It is not just that Russia's nouveaux nationalists now believe the American icon has clay feet. Russians are trying to rekindle a centuries-old romance. When Germany and Russia were not fighting -- often at the cost of central and east Europeans squeezed in their embrace -- they carried on a torrid affair of heart and mind.
Germany sent Russia its nobility and expertise: Catherine the Great; the last czarina, Alexandra Fyodorovna; Marx and Engels; an entire German province on the Volga (the Germans were lured by Catherine to modernize Russian farming, then exiled to Kazakhstan by Stalin). The Slavs, in turn, lent the Germans their passion, enticing them with the mystery within Russia's fusion of Europe and Asia.
The relationship has also caused great destruction. Take Kaliningrad itself: famous before World War II as Konigsberg, the capital of East Prussia, birthplace of Kant and a center of German culture. 
Today it is squalid and concrete-faced, the legacy of Soviet ambition and testimony to Russia's enduring thrust westward -- to Germany.
Only the nature of that thrust has changed. Where Nikita Khrushchev sought ideological hegemony, Russia now trolls for investment, business expertise and technology. And something equally vital: an affinity utterly lacking in its American dialogue.
President Vladimir V. Putin, a fluent German speaker who served the K.G.B. in the 1980's in Dresden, last year called Germany "Russia's leading partner in Europe and the world." He has showered Berlin with bouquets to prove it, from help for industry to his Defense Ministry's purchase of hundreds of BMW's.
He has exchanged three visits with Chancellor Gerhard Schroder (more than with any leader outside the former Soviet Union), and plans a trip to Berlin in September. And there was the Russian Christmas that the Schroders spent at the Putins' home outside Moscow.
"Russians today sort of love Germans and hate Americans," said Alexander Rahr, an expert on Russia at the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. "A lot of people tell us that. It has something to do with big, big hopes. The Russians think that somehow, in the depths, Germany understands Russia, and that Germans will help them out."
Mr. Rahr and others say that is half right. Germany does understand Russia -- so well, after centuries of military, cultural and royal intimacy, that it is not ready to help the Russians out more than it already has, at least not yet. Mr. Schroder underscored that in April, in an article in the German journal Die Zeit.
"We exclude any German 'special way' in the relationship with Russia," he wrote. "We want a new normality in the relationship between the two nations, without illusions, without sentimentality."
He reflects a Western consensus that Russia should not join their exclusive club until it proves it can play by Western rules, and that the proof is still lacking, despite Russia's promises of democratic and economic reform.
This view leaves Russia as Germany's jilted lover.
"I think that the Russians, although they would never say it, may feel that the time of their great-power glory is over, that Russia can't continue as a free agent," said Dmitri Trenin, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment's center in Moscow and author of a new book on Russian geopolitics, "The End of Eurasia." "This Russia needs a relationship with Germany." 
Russia, Mr. Trenin said, now contemplates a very real fear: "that Europe will basically stop at Russia's borders and will turn its back on an unreformable Russia."
Yet in this tale of unrequited reaching, there is a curiosity: in a way, the West longs for Russia's affections just as much. Many believe Europe's long-term stability rests on what Mr. Putin professes to want: a Russia lashed tight, by economic, political and even military ties, to Europe and to the Western traditions it embodies.
Russia has been an unstable global force for centuries, the reasoning goes, because it has seen its neighbors as potential invaders instead of allies. Security usually meant gobbling up surrounding lands to create a buffer zone. And that led to war.
Failure to find a home in Europe would leave Russia with two unpleasant options: isolation, which is a proven failure, or a problematic and precarious alliance with China.
"This is the historic nightmare of Russia, being isolated and surrounded by enemies," said Horst Teltschik, a former national security adviser to Chancellor Helmut Kohl. "And if Germany is not interested in Russia, in taking leadership on the vast question of how to handle Russia, then nobody will do it."
For better or worse (and both are accurate), that is Germany's historic role. Catherine sought to remake Russia in the German mold in the 18th century. In the 19th, Marxist thought infected Russia and Siemens, the vast German conglomerate, helped build its railways.
Between the World Wars, Germany and Russia, two diplomatic pariahs, found solace and power in secret and public alliances. After the Soviet Union turned a third of Germany into its satellite at the start of the cold war, West Germany kept top-level diplomatic contacts with Moscow, bought vast amounts of Soviet natural gas and ultimately advanced the Kremlin billions when Mikhail S. Gorbachev struggled to reform the empire. 
Today Germany is Russia's largest creditor and by far Russia's largest trading partner. Next to the United States, it is the second largest foreign investor in Russia. 
This sounds impressive but it is beer money compared with German interests elsewhere. In 1999 German direct investment in Russia, money spent on factories, equipment and such, totaled $727 million; in Poland, with one-fourth Russia's population, German investment totaled $4.87 billion.
What restrains German businesses is what restrains the German government: trust.
"It's the old question," said one former German diplomat in Russia, now a business executive. "The reform policies are hailed; things have positively changed. But it's not yet enough. They haven't reached the level of reform that we need."
Kaliningrad is a telling example, if extreme. This province, the size of Connecticut, separated from Mother Russia by 200 miles of Lithuania and Belorussia, dreams of being Moscow's gateway to Europe. Instead it is where Europe comes to a dead stop.
After 45 years as a top-secret naval base, Kaliningrad was rendered useless by the Soviets' military collapse. In response, the Kremlin laid plans for a free economic zone, a Russian Hong Kong on the Baltic.
An economic zone exists, with tax and customs benefits. But the freest market these days is the line of peddlers at border posts who seize on the tax breaks to smuggle cheap cigarettes into Poland.
One German company that relied on the incentives to establish a small assembly line, BMW, nearly saw production shut down this year when some benefits were abruptly revoked, then reinstated on the Kremlin's order.
"Every year, there are discussions about whether the laws on this special economic zone are valid or not," said Stefan Stein, a German economic representative in Kaliningrad. "There are a lot of problems, but the main problem is stability. There's no political stability."
Mr. Putin has proposed a regimen of economic incentives lasting through 2010. But when German businesses asked Mr. Stein whether he could guarantee any program to last, he said, "I had to say no."
"They'll give chances for big foreign businesses," he said. "But they'll take them away because there are big Russian interests."
Such unpredictability matters. Though Kaliningrad is half the distance to Berlin as it is to Moscow, and so historically Teutonic that maps carry German and Russian names, Germany has invested even less here than has tiny Lithuania.
And in the short term, at least, investment is likely to become harder. Kaliningrad's two neighbors, Lithuania and Poland, are on the cusp of admission to the European Union, which promises to constrict their porous borders, erect new customs and visa regimes and upend everything from Kaliningrad's electricity supply -- now piped free from Russia -- to pollution by Russian airliners.
But Yuri S. Matochkin, a former governor of the province, calls the coming isolation an opportunity, not a threat. He argues that economic incentives are beginning to take effect, and that growth now outstrips that of mainland Russia.
Ms. Korobova, at the Grammer plant, hopes so. 
"It could be difficult, because we're an enclave," she said. "A citizen of Kaliningrad couldn't survive without having a European Union passport. 
"As I see it, there are two ways to go: either return to the old way, and complete militarization, or open up to the West and become a more Western city, a little Western state."
Like many in the West, Germany is waiting to see which Russia ends up at its doorstep.

HEADLINE: Schwab to Eliminate 2,400 Jobs in New Round of Cuts 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
On Wall Street, the week before Labor Day is usually the quietest and most relaxed of the year. But the Charles Schwab Corporation sent a ripple of tension through the brokerage industry yesterday by announcing that it would cut as many as 2,400 more jobs in the next few weeks.
 Schwab's announcement of a second round of layoffs was the latest, but certainly not the last, step in a broad overhaul of an industry whose steady growth accelerated sharply at the end of the 1990's, analysts said. With no sign of a rebound in the stock market in sight, executives of Wall Street firms are likely to return from the holiday weekend with plans to intensify the cost-cutting that began early this year, they said. 
 "It's safe to say there's going to be a lot more coming on both the retail and institutional sides of the business," said Richard Strauss, an analyst with the Goldman Sachs Group. "This is as extreme an environment on the negative side as we had on the positive side not long ago."
Already, major American financial services companies have announced plans to eliminate about 30,000 jobs. Some firms are on their third round of layoffs and, with each cut, the victims tend to have higher ranks and bigger paychecks, magnifying the potential economic impact of the moves.
The next word is expected as soon as next week from Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment banking unit of the Credit Suisse Group. First Boston has already cut about 2,000 jobs -- more than 7 percent of its global work force -- and eliminated midyear raises for managers, but the firm still has one of the highest cost structures on Wall Street.
First Boston's new chief executive, John J. Mack, has said that reducing costs is a priority. People at the firm said that could mean laying off hundreds of investment bankers and traders and would almost certainly mean that year-end bonuses will be even smaller than many employees expect. Robert Baker, a spokesman for the firm, said he could not discuss details of Mr. Mack's plan.
Citigroup, J. P. Morgan Chase and Merrill Lynch also have been laying off bankers, traders and analysts and taking other steps to reduce expenses by as much as 20 percent. 
At Schwab, the biggest online broker, bonuses have been all but forgotten as the company has struggled with the biggest job cuts in its history. In its announcement yesterday, Schwab said that it would eliminate 2,000 to 2,400 jobs by the end of October. The company has already laid off 3,400 people this year. The latest cuts would leave it with about 20,000 employees, 25 percent fewer than it had at the start of the year.
Schwab's biggest problem is that individual investors have sharply reduced their stock trading since the market for technology stocks collapsed last year. Christopher Dodds, chief financial officer, said there was no rebound in sight.
"Clients are bringing in a lot of money, but a lot of that money is staying in cash," Mr. Dodds said. Schwab's customers have indicated that they do not intend to start trading more frequently any time soon, he added.
To make up for the shortfall in trading commissions, Schwab, which is based in San Francisco, is also consolidating offices in cities around the country and merging some branches, Mr. Dodds said. He said that the earlier cuts were aimed at reducing Schwab's trading capacity but that this round entailed scrapping some projects and honing the firm's strategy for growth, though he declined to be more specific.
One thing Schwab does not plan to do, Mr. Dodds made clear, is make any expensive acquisitions to diversify its business. His comments seemed to rule out the possibility that Schwab would acquire Jefferies & Company, an institutional trading firm that The Wall Street Journal reported Schwab was considering.
"We don't need some large deal that takes us outside of our core strengths," he said. "Schwab is not so desperate or hurting so badly that we need to engage in large-scale, diversifying acquisitions."
Richard Repetto, an analyst with Putnam Lovell Securities, said the only real surprise in Schwab's announcement was how much it would cost the firm to make the cuts. Schwab said it would take a pretax charge of $225 million against its third-quarter earnings, almost double the charge it took in the first quarter.
After Schwab said the cuts would save it $65 million a quarter starting next year, Mr. Repetto -- who does not recommend buying the stock -- raised his estimate of the company's 2002 earnings to 58 cents a share from 50 cents.

 BODY:
 Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about President Bush's vow to increase military and education spending referred incorrectly in some copies to an effort to make him declare that the Social Security surplus might have to be used. 
A letter in which Democratic leaders asked Mr. Bush to specify how he would pay for his proposals appeared to be such an effort. A statement from a White House spokesman that Mr. Bush had scheduled a meeting with Democratic leaders was not.
