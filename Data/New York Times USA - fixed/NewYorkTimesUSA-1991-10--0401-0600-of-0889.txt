HEADLINE: Dow Up 35.77, to 3,019.45, on Light Volume

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
Stocks notched substantial gains yesterday in light holiday trading, with analysts saying investors were buoyed by several better-than-expected corporate earnings reports and by heightened enthusiasm about the economy.
The Dow Jones industrial average leaped 35.77 points, or 1.2 percent, to 3,019.45, propped up by gains in a number of groups, including technology, oil, chemicals and airlines. 
 "When the market does well and those groups do well," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer for the First Albany Corporation, "it's a sign that people are becoming somewhat optimistic about the outlook for the economy in the fourth quarter and 1992."
Not a True Test
But Mr. Johnson cautioned against attaching too much significance to yesterday's session because many investors stayed away because of Columbus Day; a light 130.1 million shares were traded on the Big Board, compared with an already slow 148.9 million on Friday.
"We'll really find out what Monday's market was made of when most investors return to work Tuesday," Mr. Johnson said.
Nevertheless, advancing issues trounced those that declined yesterday, 1,090 to 463.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks jumped 5.02 points, to 386.47. The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.50, to 212.57, and the American Stock Exchange market-value index climbed 3, to 372.66.
The Nasdaq composite index, which tracks the performance of smaller stocks traded over the counter, was up 6.61, to 525.66.
One of the biggest percentage gainers on the Big Board was USAir, up 1 1/8, or 14 percent, to 9 1/8. The airline announced a third-quarter loss of $81.4 million, or $2.06 a share, compared with a loss of $120.3 million, or $2.87 a share, a year ago. The loss for the 1991 period, analysts said, was smaller than expected.
USAir also announced a plan designed to cut operating costs by more than $400 million in 1992 and later said it planned to increase the size of its fleet by 5 percent and its available seat miles by 4 percent in 1992.
Other airlines, analysts said, rose partly on USAir's news, including AMR, the parent of American Airlines, up 2 1/2, to 60 3/4; UAL, the parent of United Airlines, up 3 1/8, to 127 3/8, and Delta, up 1 7/8, to 67 3/4.
The only stock on the Big Board with a bigger percentage gain than USAir was the Argentina Fund, which rose 2 7/8, or 21.9 percent, to 16. The closed-end fund went public Friday at $12 a share, and later closed up 1 1/8, to 13 1/8.
The biggest net gain on the Big Board belonged to Great Lakes Chemical, up 10 5/8, to 96 7/8. Great Lakes rose on the announcement that it would increase its stake in Octel Associates and the Associated Octel Company, from 51.1 percent to 87.8 percent.
Great Lakes said its bigger stake in Octel, an international producer of motor fuel anti-knock compounds, would provide a non-cyclical flow of earnings into the future and lead to opportunities for growth.
Other chemical companies that rose included Du Pont, up 1 3/4, to 45; Dow Chemical, up 2, to 52 1/2, and Monsanto, up 3/4, to 70.
 
Earnings Surprises
 In addition to USAir, analysts said, several other stocks rose in part on corporate earnings reports that were better than expected, including Primerica, up 3/8, to 34 7/8, and NCNB, up 1 3/4, to 36 1/8.
Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall/21st Advisers, said those who predicted October would be a "difficult, dangerous, down month" compared with September should note that yesterday's market exceeded the close of 3,016.77 on Sept. 30.
"Now those of us waiting for the great bear market," Mr. Stovall said, "are analagous to Charlie Brown waiting for the Great Pumpkin, who, of course, never came."

Life Partners Group Appoints Key Officer

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
Gene H. Bishop, a powerful Texas banker before turmoil in oil and real estate ruined the region's economy and financial institutions in the late 1980's, was named chairman and chief executive today of Life Partners Group Inc., a life insurance firm with assets of $2.7 billion.
Life Partners was organized in 1990 when Hicks, Muse & Company, a Dallas investment firm, acquired seven life insurance companies from the financially troubled ICH Corporation for $495 million, with $410 million raised from loans issued by the General Electric Credit Corporation. 
 The insurance operations were consolidated into three companies with operations based in Englewood, Colo.: the Massachusetts General Life Insurance Company, the Philadelphia Life Insurance Company and Wabash Life Insurance Company.
Mr. Bishop, 61 years old, headed the second-largest banking organization in Texas, Mcorp, before most of its banks were seized by regulators in October 1988. He retired in 1990 from Mcorp, which he had led as chief executive since 1975, and since last year has been vice chairman of the Lomas Financial Corporation, a financial services firm that has been in bankruptcy proceedings since 1989.
Mr. Bishop said he would direct investment decisions for Life Partners as well as acquisitions from the Dallas headquarters of Hicks, Muse. Marketing operations will continue to be directed by John W. Gardiner, president of the Life Partners companies. He was a senior executive at ICH before the buyout by Hicks, Muse.
"We will be very prudent, cautious and maybe semiconservative on the asset side," said Mr. Bishop, referring to his approach to investing premiums paid by policyholders of the Life Partners' companies. "We want to make sure, first and foremost, that we maintain quality."
The three companies, with a combined $30 billion in life insurance outstanding, have good, or A, ratings from the A. M. Best Company, an insurance research firm in Oldwick, N.J. "They have been culling out the poor credits," said Larry Mayewski, a Best analyst.
He said the companies had few troubles with real estate assets. ICH kept most problem property loans as part of the 1990 buyout. Philadelphia Life suffered some losses on high-risk high-yield "junk" bonds, which amounted to about 20 percent of Philadelphia Life's assets at the end of last year, according to A. M. Best.
Life Partners's junk bonds now are about 7 percent of assets, said Thomas O. Hicks, chairman of Hicks, Muse. He said the company had pared its loans to G.E. Credit by $60 million because of comparatively low operating costs, aided by sales agreements with independent brokers and marketing companies.

Northwest Air Ends Talks On Financing by Minnesota

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, Oct. 14

 BODY:
Northwest Airlines has ended talks over $740 million in financing from Minnesota, raising new questions about the future of the nation's fourth-largest carrier as it seeks to expand.
After months of private and public wrangling, the final snag was the Minneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan Airports Commission's inability to come up with the full amount of a $390 million loan that was to make up more than half of the overall package, commission officials said. 
 "We ran out of gas," said the panel's chairman, Hugh K. Schilling. "I have to believe what Northwest is telling us, that it's over."
Northwest, which is based in Eagan, Minn., issued a brief statement calling the loan shortfall "an obstacle that neither Northwest nor the M.A.C. can overcome."
The plan would have paid for new maintenance operations in Duluth and Hibbing, in northeastern Minnesota. Northwest said it would begin examining other potential sites.
Mr. Schilling said the commission, which oversees the operation of Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, realized about 10 days ago that it could not issue $120 million in revenue bonds that were to have been part of the $390 million loan. He said the commission was unable to persuade Northwest to accept a smaller loan.
"We simply reached a level that we couldn't go any further," said Jeffrey Hamiel, the commission's executive director.
Gov. Arne Carlson was informed Sunday night that talks between Northwest and the commission had reached an impasse, said John Riley, the Governor's chief of staff.
Mr. Carlson talked by telephone early today with Alfred Checchi, Northwest's co-chairman, who told him that the carrier was looking elsewhere to build the maintenance bases, Mr. Riley said.
Minnesota had been negotiating a separate $350 million financing package for Northwest, a unit of NWA Inc. Mr. Riley said the carrier had insisted that the package and the $390 million loan from the commission were inextricably linked.
The announcement came after months of debate, negotiation and scrutiny of the incentive package. It had been portrayed by supporters as an economic boon to northeastern Minnesota and by skeptics as a risk to taxpayers, who would be asked to underwrite much of the deal.
Northwest, burdened by heavy debt, has been seeking to expand so as not to be overwhelmed by its biggest competitors: American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines.
 
British Air Report
 Today, Advertising Age, the industry publication, reported that Northwest and British Airways, Europe's largest carrier, were negotiating a partnership that would have the airlines team up on frequent-flier programs, as well as scheduling and route coordination.
One proposal being considered would dissolve the Northwest name and replace it with some form of the British Airways name, Advertising Age said, citing a person involved in the talks who was not identified. The report said a partnership could give Northwest an improved image and British Airways an expanded global presence.
Neither airline would comment on the report.
Last week, Northwest reached a $174.7 million deal to buy Midway Airlines, a carrier based out of Midway Airport in Chicago, that had filed for bankruptcy protection last winter. The move came shortly after Northwest was unable to make final a deal to buy the Trump Shuttle, which caters mostly to business travelers flying between New York, Boston and Washington.

HEADLINE: Japan Trade Surplus Sets A Record

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 14

 BODY:
Just as the world's top-ranking finance officials issued warnings about Japan's climbing trade surplus, the Government said today that its monthly imbalance in September hit a record high of $9.76 billion and that the long-term trend toward a shrinking surplus might have reversed.
September was the ninth consecutive month in which Japan's trade surplus expanded from levels a year earlier. 
 The increase was attributed largely to currency changes and slowing Japanese imports helped by lower oil prices since the end of the Persian Gulf crisis.
 
Possible Reversal of Trend
 Economists have been saying for months that the trend toward smaller surpluses had reversed, but a Finance Ministry official today for the first time raised the possibility that the direction "may be changing."
The official, who by custom spoke on condition of anonymity, said the future direction of Japan's trade surplus must be watched cautiously. Previously, ministry officials have insisted the overall surplus was still headed downward.
For the first half of the fiscal year, the trade surplus rose to $39.92 billion, up 38 percent from $28.92 billion a year earlier, the Finance Ministry reported. It was the fifth-highest half-year surplus ever.
September's trade surplus with the United States came to $4.62 billion, up 7.1 percent from $4.31 billion in September 1990. In August of this year, the surplus with the United States had risen from levels a year earlier for the first time in five months.
Exports to the United States in September rose 2.9 percent from a year earlier, to $8.52 billion, while imports dropped 1.8 percent, to $3.9 billion.
At the meetings of world financial officials in Bangkok, Thailand, Pierre Beregovoy, the French Economics Minister, said on Sunday that he hoped the recent increase in the yen's value would continue. Eventually that could cut into Japan's surplus by making foreign products more competitive.
After their meeting on Saturday, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the seven major industrial democracies also made a point of saying they wanted Japan's trade surplus reduced.

Surplus for Germany
 WIESBADEN, Germany, Oct. 14 (Reuters) -- The trade balance of the former West Germany returned to a surplus in August after a deficit in July, as imports fell faster than exports, the Federal Statistics Office said today.
Exports from western Germany fell 13 percent from July, to 50.2 billion marks ($29.6 billion), but imports declined by an even larger 17 percent, to 47.6 billion marks ($28.1 billion).
On Oct. 4, the statistics office announced that imports for all of Germany in August had declined for the first time since German unification, to give a trade surplus of 3.1 billion marks ($1.8 billion), up from 200 million marks ($118.1 million) in July.
In July, the trade balance of western Germany showed a revised deficit of 31 million marks ($18.3 million) after a surplus of 186 million marks ($109.8 million) in June. The office originally reported a July deficit of 26 million marks ($15.3 million).
In the first eight months of 1991, west German imports rose by 20 percent, to 422.4 billion marks ($249.4 billion), while exports fell a slight nine-tenths of 1 percent, to 427.2 billion marks ($252.2 billion).

Drug Prices Draw Political Scrutiny

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
CRITICS of the pharmaceutical industry are again urging drug makers to slow their increases in prices, which keep rising much faster than inflation. But most drug executives are keeping their heads down and their prices up. With sales growth sluggish, raising prices aggressively is still the main way most drug companies keep profits growing.
Senator David Pryor and others are expected to renew their attacks tomorrow when the Senate Labor Committee takes up Senator Edward M. Kennedy's bill to force drug makers to provide price rebates at community health centers, AIDS clinics and other federally financed agencies. 
 With help from the Bush Administration, Mr. Pryor, the Arkansas Democrat who heads the Senate Committee on Aging, pushed through a measure in 1990 that requires drug makers to provide rebates to state Medicaid programs. Mr. Pryor said he had hoped the companies would see the measure as "a strong message that skyrocketing price increases would no longer be tolerated."
But the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics says drug prices rose 10.2 percent in the 12 months ended in August, the latest available data, or nearly triple the 3.8 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index. Mr. Pryor said that to put pressure on the drug makers Congress should review the $2 billion in tax credits that he says drug companies get.
The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, a trade group in Washington, says prices have to be high to cover the $9.2 billion a year that the industry spends on research. It contends that drugs save lives and money by shortening patients' time in hospitals and sometimes eliminating surgery.
A few pharmaceutical executives warn that the industry risks retribution from Congress if prices are not voluntarily restrained. Seeking to set an example, Dr. P. Roy Vagelos, chairman of Merck & Company, the world's largest drug maker, pledged to hold price increases below the annual growth rate in consumer prices. But industry consultants say no other company has followed his example.
"The price of drugs is the industry's major vulnerability from a public policy perspective," said Wayne Pines, director of medical issues in Washington for Burson-Marsteller, a consulting and public relations firm. Mr. Pines, a former associate commissioner with the Food and Drug Administration, said that even after the F.D.A. approved a drug, companies often had difficulty persuading insurers and hospitals to accept it.
St. Mary's Health Services, a 330-bed hospital in Grand Rapids, Mich., recently barred the door to sales representatives from seven drug companies that it said had raised prices by more than 9.8 percent, the increase in the index of all medical prices. On another front, pressure from Government officials and advocates for people with AIDS influenced the pricing of DDI, a new AIDS drug approved last week by the F.D.A. The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, which developed DDI, said the factory price would be $1,745 for a year's supply at the most common dosage, or about $2,000 retail. DDI will cost about 20 percent less than AZT, made by the Burroughs-Wellcome Company, which had been the only approved treatment for slowing the progress of the AIDS virus.
Bristol-Myers licensed DDI from Federal researchers who held the patents, so the company had to agree to set a "reasonable" price. In doing so, it attracted support from AIDS groups that had attacked Burroughs-Wellcome, which at first had charged $10,000 for a year's supply of AZT. Burroughs has cut the price twice and lower AZT dosage levels were approved, again reducing the cost.
But Bristol-Myers Squibb said it was not signaling a general pricing policy with DDI. Jerry Parrott, a Bristol-Myers spokesman, said each new product was different and would be priced according to development costs and potential market.
L. John Wilkerson, chairman of the Wilkerson Group, a health products consulting firm, said the increases might be less steep as more drugs faced competition. But Hemant K. Shah, an independent securities analyst, said the companies would still raise prices "to show sales growth and meet Wall Street expectations" as a growing number of drugs lost patent protection and faced price competition.
Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, a professor of pharmaceutical economics at the University of Minnesota, said some drug companies see price controls ahead. "Many have accelerated their rate of price inflation, hoping to get all they can before the threatened price control might come into play," he said. "But if they followed the Merck pattern of restraint, it would take a lot of the steam out of the proposals for controls."

HEADLINE: Brady Says Soviet Pact on Union Is the Key to Aid

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Oct. 14

 BODY:
The Treasury Secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, said today that an agreement on the relationship between the Soviet republics and the central Government would be a breakthrough toward financial aid from the West.
"That's the key that will unlock the door toward assistance," Mr. Brady said in an interview after three days of intensive talks in Bangkok between a delegation of Soviet economic officials and the financial leaders of the seven largest industrial democracies. 
 On Sunday, the Group of Seven announced what was described as a "historic" agreement with the Soviets to participate directly in formulating a reform program for transforming their collapsing Communist system into a market-based economy. The Western financial leaders said the task was immense, but were generally upbeat because of the new openness of the Soviets, represented here by the radical reformer Grigory A. Yavlinsky, a top Kremlin economic adviser.
 
Contrast in Tone
 But over all, Mr. Brady was more sober today in assessing how difficult it will be for the West to shore up the faltering Soviet economy and help preserve the union, and how much work the Soviets themselves have to do before the West can act.
He was frank in acknowledging differences between some of the Group of Seven countries on strategies for dealing with a looming financial crisis in the Soviet Union. The United States suggested over the weekend that the West should consider a deferral of Soviet debt payments to ease a financial squeeze, but the proposal was rejected by the Europeans. Officials here did indicate, however, that while no specific debt relief plan was completed, they did agree that they would be willing to provide short-term assistance if the Soviets threaten to default on their debts to the West because of a shortage of hard currency. In addition to the United States, the Group of Seven includes Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan.
Mr. Brady also indicated that though aid could be important, money for the Soviets was not the key element in the lifeline the West was offering. "There aren't great gobs of money they are going to get," he said, adding that even after all the talks here it was still not certain how much might be needed.
"In truth, what happened here was not a watershed; it's a way station," he commented, while still underscoring the great opportunity that he felt had been opened for cooperation between the West and its one-time enemy. The next step in the process will come in a few weeks when the deputy finance ministers of the Group of Seven go to Moscow and begin deeper consultations.
The Western countries did not detail any proposals, however, or agree on financial assistance at this time. They also took a risk by throwing their prestige behind a basic reform program that would preserve a large role for a central Government, something many of the Soviet republics are rejecting.
Mr. Brady's statement today about the importance of a clear-cut agreement on the relationship between the republics and Moscow, and one that works in practice, came as the Soviets were preparing to take an important step toward that end with the signing of an economic cooperation pact by 10 of the 12 remaining Soviet republics.
[The pact is set to be signed Friday, three days later than scheduled, a spokesman for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today in Moscow. The signing appears to have been delayed by political events in several republics, Reuters reported.]
Mr. Gorbachev has called the pact vital to national reconstruction after the failed coup in August.
 
Yeltsin Aide Not Optimstic
 The depth of the complexities being faced were underscored here today by officials from some of the Soviet republics. Oleg Bogomolov, economic adviser to Boris N. Yeltsin, the President of the Russian republic, said of Mr. Yavlinsky's reform plan, "I am not sure if it will be accepted by republican parliaments, and if it is accepted, it is very unlikely that it will be implemented."
He added that the country had so lost faith in the central monetary authorities that it was unlikely the republics would agree to retain a single currency, something the Western leaders have encouraged.
In addition, Viktor Geraschenko, chairman of the Soviet central bank, told reporters that foreign currency reserves were "close to zero." Against this difficult backdrop, Mr. Brady said he had been most impressed by three aspects of the three days of talks with the Soviet delegation. First, he said, he felt more certain than ever that little progress could be made before the terms of the union were sorted out.
Second, Mr. Brady said he was impressed with how radical has been the shift from a closed society to an open one. Nonetheless, the West needs far more and more accurate information before it can completely engage in the reform process, he said.
Third, he said that one reason Mr. Yavlinsky had pressed the Group of Seven to get involved was because the current central authorities in Moscow had almost completely lost credibility with the Soviet people.
French and German officials here today criticized the American effort to arrange an immediate postponement of debt payments to Western banks and governments in coming months.
The Soviets have total foreign debt of nearly $70 billion. That is not regarded as overly burdensome for a country with the resources of the Soviet Union, but the recent economic turmoil has disrupted the economy, trade and the flow of hard-currency earnings to the central Government. That means there could be a temporary inability to meet debt payments. The Soviets have indicated that they may be unable to meet $5 billion or more of payments due in coming months. And the Western leaders are underestood to have indicated that they would be willing to help tide the Soviets over that shortfall with some kind of special loans or a temporary easing of repayment terms.

HEADLINE: THE THOMAS NOMINATION;
Compelling Evidence on Both Sides, But Only One Can Be Telling Truth

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 14

 BODY:
The Senate takes up the debate on Tuesday on the fitness of Judge Clarence Thomas to serve on the Supreme Court with public-opinion polls running in his favor, but with the stain of charges that he sexually harassed Prof. Anita F. Hill undispelled for now, and probably forever, legal experts and Senate aides said today.
The failure of three long days of hearings to thrash out the truth behind the accusations is not unusual, those experts said. But it confronts the Senate with the ugliest of choices. It can reject Judge Thomas's nomination, blotting his record without proof of misbehavior. Or it can confirm him, and run the risk -- however small -- that evidence will emerge later to show that the nominee had baldly lied to a Congressional committee under oath. 
 Each side comes to the debate on Tuesday morning armed with powerful arguments that it is the truthful one, say criminal lawyers and Judiciary Committee aides who have scrutinized more than 30 hours of sworn testimony on the harassment charges.
 
Witnesses for Both Sides
 Professor Hill has a battery of witnesses who swear that she told them of his approaches years ago, soon after they were said to have occurred. Judge Thomas has no known history of harassment and a recent reputation that friends call spotless.
She has no known ulterior motive for making charges against him, and has suffered considerably for having done so. He says she waited nearly a decade to speak against him, while two Senate committees reviewed his background and confirmed him to Federal appointments three times.
Michael Schatzow, a top Baltimore criminal defense lawyer who was a Federal prosecutor for seven years in the 1980's, said that in legal terms, Professor Hill had a jury-swaying aura of credibility and the weight of much of the evidence in her favor.
 
Power of 'Indignant Anger'
 But a Democratic aide on the Judiciary Committee said today that the judge had political and public-relations advantages, among them, a proven record of public service and a "very strong, indignant anger."
In his testimony on Friday evening, when Judge Thomas accused the Judiciary Committee of conducting a "high-tech electronic lynching," the aide said, "There was something very powerful in it."
Neither Mr. Schatzow nor others could predict who would have won this argument in a court of law. Nor would they predict how the Senate would vote when it records its own verdict at 6 P.M. Tuesday.
Nathan Lewin, a Washington lawyer who headed the legal team that assisted former Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d in two Federal investigations of his conduct, said the Senate faced the same quandary that juries regularly faced in white-collar criminal cases.
"With all the moaning about this conflict in their stories, people in the business of trying cases see that all the time," he said. "It's only on TV that a witness breaks down on the witness stand and confesses.
"Obviously, somebody is lying, and that happens all the time. People get up on the stand and lie, and lie persuasively, and each side has corroborating witnesses. And the jury goes out and comes back with result which, as a trial lawyer, I often find to be unexpected."
Following is the evidence, or information, that the jury of the Senate will be considering when it debates the Thomas nomination on Tuesday:
 
THE CASE FOR PROFESSOR HILL
 Mr. Schatzow, Mr. Lewin and others said Professor Hill's accusations gained their greatest weight from two powerful supporting factors: the inability of critics to prove the existence of any hidden motive for her actions, and the presence of four credible witnesses who, in general, corroborated her account by saying she had made the same complaints to them years ago.
Judge Thomas's supporters sought last week to raise several possible motives for Professor Hill's decision to bring her explosive testimony to the Judiciary Committee. Through the testimony of Judge Thomas's friends, they cast her as a scorned suitor who had sought revenge; as a bitter opponent of Judge Thomas's views against racial quotas as a remedy for discrimination; as a tool of "slick lawyers" running the liberal opposition to the Thomas nomination; as a gold digger who planned to parlay her celebrity into a book contract, and finally, as emotionally unstable.
Her supporters and allies managed to poke holes in each of the ideas, and none of the theories appears to have stuck with the committee, legal experts said. That was in large part because of Professor Hill's own calm performance before the Judiciary Committee and the impressive performance of witnesses who supported her, legal experts said.
The four -- Ellen M. ells, an official of the American Public Welfare Association; John William Carr, a New York lawyer; Susan Hoerchner, a California administrative law judge, and Joel R. Paul, a law professor at American University -- all testified that Professor Hill had told them of harassment by her boss.
 
A Major Piece of Evidence
 "People who are experienced in prosecution or defense would look at what happened and say that the most telling piece of evidence is the nearly contemporaneous reporting that Professor Hill made of the incident," Mr. Schatzow said. "I think it's just preposterous to think that 10 years ago, she was planting the seeds of coming forth to derail his Supreme Court nomination."
Professor Hill's case was further bolstered on Sunday by the release of the results of a polygraph test indicating that she was telling the truth about the accusations. Among the questions the tester asked her were whether she had deliberately lied about the allegations, whether Judge Thomas had described sexual acts to her and whether he had talked about pornography.
"Ms. Hill is truthful," Paul Minor, a former polygraph expert for the Federal Bureau of Investigation who conducted the tests, said later.
 
Questions on Polygraphs
 Others noted, however, that polygraph exams are not considered conclusive and are not admissible in court.
Professor Hill's account was also supported in part by a statement made over the telephone by another former employee of Judge Thomas, Angela Wright, who said that he had made "inappropriate" remarks about her body when she headed the public affairs office at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1984 and 1985. "Actually, what he said was, 'What size are your breasts?' " she said in the description of a conversation that reportedly occurred at a banquet the two attended in 1984.
Ms. Wright also stated, as has Professor Hill, that Judge Thomas asked her for dates and once showed up unannounced at her apartment. A former co-worker with Ms. Wright, Rose Jordain, also stated to the committee that Ms. Wright had admitted to her at the time that Judge Thomas's remarks about "her figure, her body, her breasts" had bothered her.
Judge Thomas's supporters have argued that Judge Thomas dismissed both Ms. Wright and Ms. Jordain and that their testimony must be discounted because they had reason to be angry with him.
Finally, Professor Hill's account is underscored, although not directly substantiated, by reports that Judge Thomas has talked with others about pornographic movies that he had frequently attended while a student at Yale Law School in the late 1970's. A Washington lawyer who is a friend and supporter of Judge Thomas, Lovida Coleman Jr., said in a statement that Judge Thomas had described and joked about the movies he had seen in conversations with her and others at Yale.
She said that she was not offended by the remarks and that she believed many Yale law students had seen similar movies at the time.
 
THE CASE FOR JUDGE THOMAS
 Judge Thomas has argued that he cannot ultimately disprove the charges because there are no witnesses. Much of his case has rested on the indignation he has expressed over the charges, and on efforts by him and his supporters to cast doubt on Professor Hill's honesty.
But lawyers and Senate aides said that his strongest defense so far is the dated nature of the allegations and the fact that his own public record until now has been unblemished by sex-related incidents.
"He's a sitting Federal judge who has been confirmed by the Senate before -- once at the E.E.O.C., again for his reappointment there, once for the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals," one Senate aide said. "And by the time he first came to the Judiciary Committee only a year and a half ago, everyone knew he was being groomed for this nomination.
"Why she didn't come forward sooner is a legitimate question in many different ways -- earlier in previous nominations, or earlier in this process."
Professor Hill has said she tried to forget the incidents, adding that she agreed to speak to the Judiciary Committee only after being approached by staff members who asked specific questions about rumors of harassment.
But the absence of potential detractors over the last decade suggests to some that Professor Hill's charges are exaggerated or untruthful.
"My own experience is that when you identify people like that, you usually would be hard pressed to find a person who hadn't experienced similar behavior," Mr. Schatzow said. The lack of a credible second or third victim, he said, "weakens her charges."
 
Testimonials on Character
 Judge Thomas's character witnesses -- he presented 16 at Sunday's long hearing on Capitol Hill -- testified to his character or sought to soil Professor Hill's. Pamela Talkin, Judge Thomas's chief of staff at the E.E.O.C., said he possessed "a feminist's understanding of sexual politics." A former aide to Senator John C. Danforth, a Missouri Republican who is Judge Thomas's former employer and his chief supporter in Congress, said that Judge Thomas had shown sensitivity when helping her get over an incident of sexual harassment.
While the testimonials were impressive, however, they did not refute Professor Hill's allegations, in large part because whatever occurred between her and Judge Thomas took place in private.
Potentially more damaging to Professor Hill's case are seeming inconsistencies in her statements that Judge Thomas's supporters have pounced upon and that she has not always rebutted effectively.
Chief among them is the fact that Professor Hill followed Judge Thomas from a post in the civil-rights division of the Education Department to another job at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, even after the time she says she was harassed by him. In testimony, Professor Hill has said that she was only 25 years old at the time, that the harassment had temporarily stopped and that she feared for her job at a time of a deep national recession. Her critics have responded that she effectively was guaranteed a job at the Education Department had she chosen not to follow Judge Thomas.

HEADLINE: An Old Irish Tale of Leaving Echoes Bittersweetly Today

BYLINE: By JAMES F. CLARITY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DUBLIN, Oct. 14

 BODY:
With more than 100,000 Irish citizens estimated to have mailed their entries for Washington's immigration lottery that in the next year will provide 16,000 of them with the green card needed to work legally in the United States, the subject of departure from Ireland was once again on the minds of those who wanted to go and those who were staying behind.
As she left Saturday on a 10-day unofficial visit to the United States, President Mary Robinson touched on the issue, saying emigration was one of her principal concerns. Mrs. Robinson, whose post is largely ceremonial, noted that she was from Mayo, in the west of Ireland, where the the famines of the 19th century were particularly hard and where emigration is a tradition.
"One of the criticisms was that once you left Ireland somehow all links were cut, and I think that most of all I'll probably be trying to say all links are not cut," she said of her trip. 
 While many Irish may consider emigration unavoidable, given an unemployment rate that recently moved beyond 20 percent, it remains a bittersweet subject. This was reflected by a sign someone posted last week at the General Post Office on O'Connell Street here in Dublin, where thousands of last-minute hopefuls, worried by a two-day postal workers' strike, lined up to mail applications. The sign said, "Rounds off our history pretty neatly standing on the spot where Ireland's independence was declared, sending off letters to America to take us out of here." The reference was to the Easter Uprising in 1916.
In his column in The Sunday Business Post, Damien Kiberd said, "It is difficult to imagine any other self-respecting Western economy in which the main item on the news would focus on the possibilities for emigration." He cited a study that showed unemployment would reach 25 percent by 1993.
Brian Friel, the nation's most prominent playwright, returns constantly to the subject, from his first major success, "Philadelphia, Here I Come!" to "Dancing at Lughnasa," which was acclaimed in Dublin and London before it moved to New York last week.
After several years of relative prosperity, the Irish national economy slid in the last year, to a degree a reflection of the world recession, and net emigration has virtually stopped.
In the boom of the late 1980's, about 35,000 emigrants a year left the country to work abroad, mostly in Britain, Australia and the United States. They sent back millions to their families and kept unemployment relatively low, but the rate is still one of the highest in the European Community.

Millions Apply, U.S. Says
 MERRIFIELD, Va., Oct. 14 (AP) -- United States postal officials said today that two million applications for green cards had been processed so far from immigrants in a lottery to become one of 40,000 new legal residents.
"We have approximately another four million to five million waiting in the wings to either be processed or verified," said a Postal Service spokesman, Robert Faraq. Many immigrants tried to improve their odds by delivering more than 1,000 petitions each over the weekend.
The State Department, in total, is accepting the first 40,000 valid applications for immigration visas received after 12:01 A.M. today.

New for Season: To-Do at Post Estate

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PALM BEACH, Fla., Oct. 12

 BODY:
In another town, the construction of eight mansions on $2 million lots might not be viewed as bringing down the neighborhood's property values. But in this enclave of wealth and privilege, Donald Trump's proposal to turn his 17.8-acre Mar-a-Lago estate into a subdivision for the elite has been met with a crusade to keep the town's most famous property intact.
By a unanimous vote on Oct. 8, the town council refused to allow the financially pressed real estate tycoon to break up the former Marjorie Merriwether Post estate, built in the 1920's and designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1980. A spokesman for Mr. Trump said he was pondering the council's suggestion that he revise his plan. 
 "We frankly don't know what he is going to do," said Frank Chopin, a lawyer for the Preservation Foundation of Palm Beach, one of the groups leading the opposition. "He once threatened to sue if the town did what it now has done. But you have to believe he knows he has to do something different from what he's done."
Mr. Trump bought Mar-a-Lago in 1985, happier days for him, paying $10 million for the grounds, buildings and sumptuous antique furnishings in the main house, reports said. He initially used the estate as a weekend and winter getaway. But in February, amid divorce proceedings and mounting financial woes, he asked for approval to build eight homes, each on 1.5 acres of land, while retaining for himself the main house and its sweeping ocean-to-lagoon view.
Residents here say they have mixed feelings about the 118-room mansion, which is built in Hispano-Moorish style and includes 58 bedrooms, three bomb shelters, a five-story observatory, a park and a golf course. A council member, Paul Ilyinsky, calls the estate "a monument to man's indulgence," while Lillian Jane Volk, head of the Landmarks Preservation Commission, describes it as "a symbol of the elegant era of Palm Beach and the life it represents."
Mr. Trump's two closest neighbors have hired lawyers to fight the project. But the strongest opposition has come from architectural, preservation and landscape groups, including the National Park Service, which inherited the property after Mrs. Post's death but later gave it to her heirs.
Another council member, Hermine Wiener, said she initially expected "no great hue and cry over this" because "a few years ago, a plan vastly inferior to this was approved one, two, three" when the Post heirs were trying to sell the property to a Texas land developer. Other beachfront properties in the neighborhood have also been approved for subdivision recently, including one, according to Mr. Trump's lawyer, that has local landmark status.
Others here are certain that Mr. Trump's status as a brash and flamboyant newcomer has hurt him. "There's a double standard in this town, and that's what this is really all about," one official said. "It's not necessarily Donald Trump himself. Anyone who is not part of that clique would be in the same situation."
Mrs. Volk of the landmark commission denied that the Palm Beach establishment was trying to block Mr. Trump because they regard him as a parvenu. "I would think that is really complete hogwash," she said. "We want to do the best for the town. It wouldn't occur to me to treat him any different than anyone else."
But she added: "If he has aroused ire in this town, it's his own doing. He creates this atmosphere."
Mr. Trump antagonized some here last month when he challenged the $17.5 million property assessment on Mar-a-Lago and the $376,101 he would owe in taxes at a time when his creditors have put him on a tight budget. .
The situation was further complicated when Mr. Trump submitted an alternative plan in late September that would allow him to build as many as 11 homes on the site and seek approval through different channels. Mr. Chopin described the action as an attempt to "circumvent the whole process," but Mr. Trump's lawyer, Peter S. Broberg, said his client was merely considering "two different remedies, both of which are designed to achieve the same thing."
Mrs. Volk said the ideal solution to the controversy would be for Mr. Trump simply to sell the estate intact. "There seems to be very large money around," she said. "A miserable little house right up the street just sold for almost $15 million."
But Mr. Trump's advisers describe that idea as "improbable," pointing to the state of the economy and the estate's high maintenance costs.
Mr. Trump's architects are apparently willing to draw up a revised plan that would incorporate some design changes demanded by preservation groups. But both sides recognize that the dispute could end up in court.
From the town's perspective, the most important thing is to make sure it does not inherit the property by default. "Otherwise, Trump will get wiped out," said Charles E. Kimball, a real estate economist based in Palm Beach County. "Nobody, not even the town, could maintain that house without a substantial tax increase."

HEADLINE: Poor Youths Swarming to Las Vegas Are Blamed for Rise in Gang Violence

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev.

 BODY:
Two months ago, at the age of 16, Cesar Lara decided a change of scene would be good for him. He had been arrested and put on probation in Southern California for carrying a dagger and rifle and wanted to get away from his gang, the El Centro Dude Boys, whose main activities, he says, were "getting drunk and looking for trouble."
So he came to this sprawling casino city to stay with his uncle and look for a job. He has ended up jobless, watching the gang violence on 28th Street, a dusty road of rundown homes and frequent shootings just a few miles from the city's glittering Strip. 
 "I was trying to get out of trouble from down there in El Centro," he said, idly inspecting the three tattoos on his left arm as he sat on the step outside his uncle's one-bedroom home. "But it's worse here. Everywhere you go, it's the same gangs."
Gang violence, which has claimed more than 3,500 lives in Los Angeles over the last decade, is spreading throughout the West to cities like Phoenix; Portland, Ore., and Seattle. In Las Vegas the spreading gang violence has been accompanied by a doubling of the metropolitan area's population to 800,000 in the last 10 years, creating pressure to relieve shortages in schools, housing and other services that could lead to more gang violence.
 
Nine Killings in Nine Months
 Today the police say they are far more preoccupied with gang violence than with the dwindling presence of organized crime linked to the Las Vegas casinos.
On Sept. 4, for example, one man was killed and another wounded outside Cesar Lara's home in a gun battle between two Hispanic gangs, the Sanchucos and the 28th Street Gang. Gang-related homicides and gunfights have surged, with nine killings and 135 shootings in the first nine months of this year, up from seven killings and 97 shootings in all of 1990.
The Sept. 4 incident formed part of "a worsening spiral of gang shootings, stabbings and beatings linked to the spread throughout the West of youth gangs from Los Angeles," said Lieut. Charlie Davidaitis of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.
As in Los Angeles, where 690 people died in gang conflicts last year, the police say gang battles in Las Vegas are generally over drugs, territory and old vendettas. They see poor youths, raised in troubled homes and largely unschooled, increasingly drawn to gangs because of the status that comes with membership.
"The gang problem is going from here to Las Vegas and all over the country," said Sgt. Wes McBride of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. "These kids are generally born and bred in poverty, their familes are busted up, they have a series of fathers and no internal discipline. Gangs give them a sense of belonging."
 
Rise in Gang Membership
 Lieut. Mike Hawkins, who heads the Las Vegas police department's gang unit, estimated the number of youths belonging to gangs in the Las Vegas area at 5,000. This compares with about 1,500 three years ago. Many have come here from the Los Angeles area, where gang membership is estimated at more than 100,000.
Among the gangs now in Las Vegas are the rival black Crips and Bloods, the Asian Kickboxers and several Hispanic groups.
"There's an epidemic of gang violence, and it's probably going to get worse over the next few years because of the shortage of schools and homes," Lieutenant Hawkins said. "Obviously, we are very concerned that it could spill over to downtown and the Strip, because tourism is our No. 1 industry here."
Up to now, however, very little of the violence has reached the Strip from places like 28th Street and North Las Vegas, where the gangs are concentrated. Tourists are generally oblivious.
Cesar Lara, at his uncle's house on 28th Street, starkly described the divide between his world and the tourists' world: "This is the underworld; this is hell," he said. "The Strip is heaven."
 
A City's Growing Problems
 Still, Robert R. Maxey, chief executive of the MGM Grand Hotel and a prominent Las Vegas businessman, described the gang situation as disturbing. "Some of the problems are related to the simple fact that we became a large city," he said. "We were a cow town."
Indeed, the population growth -- attributed largely to inexpensive housing, low taxes, a good climate and a resilient economy -- has been so intense that the Las Vegas School District was obliged to build 18 new schools last year.
Despite this effort, "our schools are way overcrowded," said Carmen Cunningham, a demographer in the school district's planning department.
Karen Layne, the planning director for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, added that all the city's services were under heavy pressure because tax dollars lagged behind the population influx. For example, she said that despite a costly recruitment drive aimed at insuring that there were 1.7 police officers for every 1,000 residents, the ratio was now 1.4 per 1,000, well below the national average of 2.7.
"Every city agency I know is facing problems," she said, "and this is the backdrop in which the gang problem grows."
 
Federal Legislation Urged
 The rapid growth of youth gangs throughout the West has led Senator Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona, to propose legislation that would provide Federal support for a national statistic information center and other programs to fight against gangs. But the bill, the Outlaw Street and Motorcycle Gang Control Act of 1991, was rejected in committee.
"I believe a national campaign against this problem is essential," Senator DeConcini, said, "and so far the Federal Government has done nothing."
He added: "In Phoenix, gang violence is the highest it has ever been this year. These kids can't find jobs but they can join gangs. We are paying the price of rejecting our municipalities."
Sergeant McBride of the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department has been angered by the Government's attitude. "If I had to blame one sole source for gangs spreading across the country, it's the inaction of the Federal Government. We need schools, social programs and enhanced law enforcement, but that costs big bucks, so politicians hate to address the issue."
Meanwhile, everyone seems to think the situation will get worse. In Las Vegas, the schools have recently started a program intended to convey to children up to seventh grade the idea that joining a gang is a dead end. But Lieutenant Hawkins of the Las Vegas police conceded that the program, up to now, undermined what he called "the strong mystique of gang membership."
As for Cesar Lara, he does little more than watch the day go by with his uncle, Jose Flores, who is unemployed. "I sit here all day and do nothing, and at night I get drunk," he said. "If I do join a gang I'll join the 28th Street gang. But if my girlfriend mails me some money I'll go back to El Centro."

HEADLINE: Message to Myanmar

 BODY:
By awarding the 1991 Peace Prize to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the inspirational leader of Myanmar's democracy movement, the Norwegian Nobel Committee gives fresh hope to a people oppressed by one of the world's ugliest remaining tyrannies.
This recognition may shame Asian nations like China and Thailand into withdrawing economic and political support from Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's jailers, the State Law and Order Restoration Council, or Slorc. Even if these neighboring regimes remain unmoved, Myanmar's democrats can be heartened by the examples of previous Peace Prize winners like Lech Walesa and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, whose causes passed from hopelessness toward splendid triumph. 
 To be heartened, Myanmar's people have to learn the news. The Slorc, which holds Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest, will make that as difficult as possible. So tight is its grip that her husband, now residing in the U.S., cannot be certain that his wife is even alive.
Her prestige has probably spared her. She is the daughter of the man who led the country then called Burma to independence, and she carried her party to overwhelming victory in last year's parliamentary elections. Yet thousands of others have been killed in Myanmar's struggle for democracy. And the Slorc still brazenly refuses to honor those decisive election results.
Fortunately, the world is now too small for tyrants to feel protected by the old conventions of absolute national sovereignty. The U.S., thanks in large measure to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, now pressures the Slorc with economic sanctions. The European Parliament, which awarded Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi its Sakharov Prize, and now the Nobel Committee exert another kind of useful pressure.
This faith that Myanmar's people are as entitled as any other to share in the emerging new world of democracy and basic human rights will eventually be vindicated. If China and Thailand believe that too, they have it in their power to accelerate democratic change. How long will they choose to hold themselves apart from the conscience of the world?

HEADLINE: Lasting Tragedy and Trauma for the Country;
Lowest Kind of Politics

 BODY:
To the Editor:
While it may be true that Judge Clarence Thomas acted improperly and that Prof. Anita F. Hill was truly offended by any sexist comments on the part of Judge Thomas, the context, timing and volume of the accusations are nothing short of the lowest political campaign this country has ever seen. This is the real issue. 
 While morality and politics seem to be ever more exclusive, smear campaigns like this one insure that only the incompetent or the amoral hold the most important offices in this country.
At a time when we face greater threats to our economic and intellectual well-being than ever before, the special interest groups only serve to divide us against ourselves. A Congress that chooses to overlook such accusations and the high crimes and misdemeanors of its members is not only unfit to judge others, but also must have its own fitness questioned.

HEADLINE: Coke Bottler Has First Loss

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Oct. 15

 BODY:
Coca-Cola Enterprises, the largest bottler of Coke products, today reported a $1.9 million loss for the third quarter, its first quarterly loss in its five-year history.
The company also said a special board committee was considering whether it should go through with its previously announced proposal to buy the Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling Group Inc. in Chattanooga, Tenn., for Coca-Cola Enterprises shares valued at the time at about $440 million. 
 The loss in the three months ended Sept. 30 compares with a profit of $18 million, or 13 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year ago. Its operating revenues edged up almost 1 percent, to $1.07 billion from $1.06 billion.
On the New York Stock Exchange today, the bottler's shares rose 25 cents, to $12.375.
Coca-Cola Enterprises, which became public in 1986, is 49 percent owned by the Coca- Cola Company.
Brian G. Dyson, Coca-Cola Enterprises' president, attributed the loss to "the economic impact of the recession, combined with the competitive environment."

Mixed Results in Philadelphia Plan to Curb Business Flight

BYLINE: By David J. Wallace

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
THE decision of a record retailer to expand its distribution center in northeast Philadelphia rather than move to another city illustrates the mixed results of a tax policy this city uses to help it compete with suburban industrial parks.
Under the tax policy, adopted in 1985 to help stem the flight of companies and jobs out of the city, companies pay taxes only on the portion of sales or net income generated within the city limits. 
 "The business privilege tax is indifferent to whether a company is profitable, since it's based on volume," said William P. Hankowsky, president of the Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation, a quasi-public agency.
While that policy has been a factor in retaining some business, it has not stopped all from moving elsewhere.
For Wee Three Record Shops Inc., the tax policy and other incentives adopted by the city have been a benefit. Because only one of its 63 stores is in Philadelphia, the company largely avoids paying city taxes. In addition, the company's warehouse space in the city has a tax abatement that helps lower the net rent.
Such benefits were also a factor in the decision of Ikea, the Swedish home furnishings retailer, to lease 430,000 square feet in Philadelphia in the late 1980's, but they did not stop Sears, Roebuck & Company from announcing last summer that it would move its retail distrbution center from Philadelphia to Wilkes-Barre, Pa.
The building used by Wee Three is in the Roosevelt Business Center in northeast Philadelphia, an industrial park on land purchased by the city's development corporation to lure back manufacturing and warehouse companies that had left the city in the early 1980's. Using tax abatements and subsidized property, city officials tried to offset the high taxes that drove companies away.
Mark Andreassi, president of Anvil Construction, which built the building occupied by Wee Three, said that in the past, the program of incentives and tax abatements helped city developers like himself compete with out-of-town sites.
He said that city land valued at $50,000 or $60,000 an acre could be bought at substantial discounts from face values because of Federal and city subsidies. Comparable suburban land had cost $100,000, he said.
"In their day, those subsidies programs were the only things going for you," Mr. Andreassi said. "It was great for Philadelphia while it lasted."
Such subsidies are no longer widely available, but the city still provides a five-year delay in assessing real estate taxes of $1 a square foot on newly occupied developments.
At Wee Three Records, Peter Bamford, the president, said the company remained in Philadelphia largely to retain employees who joined the company since its acquisition in 1989 by the W. H. Smith Group P.L.C., a British retailer. At the time it was acquired, Wee Three had 19 stores and an 11,000-square-foot warehouse in Philadelphia's Manayunk section.
About a year after it was bought by Smith, Wee Three moved into 32,000 square feet of space in a Roosevelt Center building just completed by Anvil Construction. It has since expanded to take all of the building's 52,000 square feet. Mr. Bamford would not discuss rent figures, but the property carries the five-year city real estate tax abatement.
Wee Three, which now operates stores under four names from Boston to Pittsburgh to Norfolk, Va., had considered many options in its move from Manayunk. Popular suburban sites like Lansdale, Pa., about 45 minutes northwest, had suitable access to Interstate 95, the Pennsylvania and New Jersey turnpikes and other major arteries, but few would have allowed the company to hold its 90-employee work force intact, Mr. Bamford said.
"We built up a team of people when we were in Manayunk who we wanted to remain with us," he said. "After a year and a half in the business we didn't want to rebuild. If we had put our distribution center in Lansdale, probably none of our employees would have traveled out there, so that wasn't an option."
While the city's business incentives provide substantial initial benefits, they do not last forever, according to one of Wee Three's neighbors in the Roosevelt Business Center that is nearing the end of its tax holiday.
Kenneth Shaw of Fred Hill & Son, a maker of materials-handling equipment, said that if he had to make the same decision again, he might have relocated his company outside Philadelphia. The end of Fred Hill's five-year tax-free window next year will mean an eightfold increase in city taxes, Mr. Shaw said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Is Mostly Higher In Absence of Fed Moves

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against major currencies yesterday as traders re-evaluated their earlier speculations that the Federal Reserve might push interest rates lower.
Gold prices fell, with a troy ounce slipping $1.20 on the New York Commodity Exchange to $357.70. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $356.85, off $1.55. 
 Analysts said the Fed's failure to ease monetary policy and nudge interest rates downward helped lift the dollar.
The United States currency had fallen recently amid evidence of economic weakness -- signs the foreign exchange markets believed would prompt the Fed to act.
Mike Faust, a currency analyst with MMS International, said there has been "some dampening of easing expectations" as the days have passed and there has been no move from the central bank.
The dollar is supported by stable or higher rates, so inaction by the Fed has turned into a buy signal for currency traders.
 
Looking to the Mark
 Mr. Faust said that if the dollar could climb to 1.7150 German marks, an important threshold for traders, it would likely advance further. But, he warned, "there's quite a bit of risk out there for an ease" by the Fed.
The dollar rose to 1.71275 German marks in New York trading yesterday, up from 1.70175 late Monday. In earlier European dealings, the dollar climbed to 1.7115 marks from 1.6990.
The dollar also rose against the Japanese yen, advancing to 130.10 in New York, from 129.95 on Monday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar closed at 129.72 yen, up 0.67 yen from Monday's 129.05-yen finish, and in London, it was quoted at 130.15 yen.
The British pound fell against the dollar, dropping to $1.7005 in New York, from $1.71225 late Monday. In London trading, sterling was quoted at $1.7010, compared with $1.7145 late Monday.
Other late rates for the dollar in New York, compared with quotes late Monday, included: 1.4950 Swiss francs, up from 1.4865; 5.8335 French francs, up from 5.79175; 1,280.25 Italian lire, up from 1,239, and 1.12975 Canadian dollars, up from 1.12925.
In the precious metals market, gold fell 75 cents in London to a late bid of $358.25. In Zurich, the bid was $358, down from $358.50 late Monday. Gold dropped $1.52 in Hong Kong to close at $359.19.

Decision for Continental Air's Chief

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
For Robert R. Ferguson, the chief executive of Continental Airlines, the carrier's fate has narrowed largely to two choices -- either it will be taken over by Northwest Airlines or remain independent and come out from under the shadow of bankruptcy by spring.
"Northwest Airlines is meaningfully interested," he said in an interview yesterday at the midtown offices of Continental Airlines Holdings Inc., the parent company. 
Talks with Alfred Checchi, Northwest's co-chairman, and his managers are continuing, he added, and Northwest is working with the unions representing its pilots, machinists and flight attendants to bring them around to accept a buyout.
 
Effects of a Forced Merger
 What worries both sides is that a forced merger could end up alienating the airlines' work forces to where service would deteriorate and cause years of turmoil. That is what happened in the takeovers by Northwest of Republic Airlines and by USAir of Piedmont, both in the late 1980's.
Service at Northwest and USAir suffered for a time, causing them to lose the support of many business fliers and earning the Minneapolis-St. Paul carrier the nickname "Northworst."
Mr. Ferguson recalled yesterday that during his days at the Texas Air Corporation, the takeover of People Express and Frontier Airlines in the mid-80's had led to a widespread erosion of service at Continental that took years to repair.
"We've been through a lot of mergers and know how not to do it," he said.
 
Business Travelers Still Wary
 Continental still does not have the same support of business travelers as other leading carriers. Only about 25 percent of its passengers pay full coach and higher discount fares, compared with about 50 percent for American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines.
Although concerns also exist that Northwest may further increase its debt by buying Continental, Mr. Ferguson said, these were smaller worries compared with those that concerned bringing together a largely nonunion work force at Continental with the highly unionized workers at Northwest.
"If we can figure out the labor question, the financial question will work itself out," he added.
Northwest greatly increased its debt when Mr. Checchi led a leveraged buyout of the company in 1989.
There has been concern among some analysts on how Northwest will be able to handle its higher debt, now totaling about $2.7 billion, if the airline industry and the economy should stay in a long recession.
The high debt has also left the carrier at a disadvantage when other large airlines with lower debt, like Delta, United and American, have been able to finance large acquisitions of overseas routes.
 
A Fit With British Air
 To finance a takeover, Northwest may have to attract other investors like British Airways, Europe's largest private carrier. Strategically, the carriers make almost a perfect match with little duplication.
Northwest has a large presence in the Pacific and has a domestic route system that runs largely north to south, with primary hubs in Minneapolis, Detroit and Memphis. Continental has mostly an east-west route network, with major hubs in Houston, Newark and Denver.
If no combination results, Mr. Ferguson said, Continental could go it alone. Airlines and investors who had been interested in the airline like USAir and Marvin Davis, the West Coast investor, have dropped out of the running.
He said Continental expected to file a reorganization plan as early as next month.
If its traffic holds up and its cost- cutting comes out on target, the airline should be bringing in more cash than it spends by spring, Mr. Ferguson said. He predicted that Continental could then have its reorganization plan accepted by the bankruptcy judge.

HEADLINE: Yields Fall On C.D.'s and Bank Funds

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on certificates of deposit and money market accounts declined for still another week, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, the North Palm Beach, Fla., publication that covers interest rates.
"There has been no letup in the downward speed of certificate of deposit yields," said Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor. "This evidence continues to suggest that another cut in the Federal discount rate and the banks' prime rate could occur soon." 
 At New York area institutions, rates are still being cut at a rapid pace, The Monitor said.
The largest change in money market funds among New York area banks was made by Astoria Federal Savings, which cut its money market fund yield by 11 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.01 percent. Chemical Banking made the largest cut in three-month certificates of deposit, dropping the yield 11 basis points, to 4.33 percent. As for six-month certificates, First Nationwide made the biggest move, cutting the yield by 25 points, to 5.10 percent.
Among the commercial banks in New York, the average yield on money market accounts has been cut to 4.69 percent, down a basis point; the average yield on three-month certificates of deposit was down 4 points, to 4.88 percent, and it dropped by the same amount for six-month certificates, which now average 4.97 percent.
For depositors at savings institutions in the New York area, yields were cut to 5.26, down 3 basis points for money market accounts; to 5.32, down 4 basis points for three-month certificates, and to 5.53, down 6 basis points, for six-month certificates.
The Monitor reported the average yields at 20 major banks outside the New York area had been cut by 2 basis points, to 4.92 percent, on their money market accounts, and by 3 points, to 5.17 percent, for six-month certificates.
By comparison, at the Treasury Department's weekly bill auction yesterday, the three-month bill was auctioned at an average discount rate of 4.99 percent, well below the rate the previous Monday, while the six-month bill averaged 5.03, also sharply lower.


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, October 16,1991. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums may vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

Lukens Looks Ahead In Naming a President

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Lukens Inc., which specializes in making plate steel, said yesterday that R. William Van Sant, a former president and chief executive of Blount Inc., a construction company that also makes power equipment, would become the steel producer's president and chief operating officer.
Lukens also said that Mr. Van Sant, a director since 1988, would become chairman and chief executive after W. R. Wilson retires next June. 
 The company, based in Coatesville, Pa., is the nation's third-largest producer of plate steel, which is used in construction, shipbuilding and transportation. The company has also developed a growing business making highway products, as well as providing goods and services for the mining and energy industries.
Lukens's financial health has been notably stronger than most steel producers. But a strike that began two weeks ago by the United Steelworkers union might affect results for the rest of the year. Despite the company's lower sales and earnings for the first half of this year, analysts say its performance should improve along with the economy.
Mr. Van Sant, 53 years old, who has extensive experience in manufacturing, aerospace and construction services, replaces Harry I. Skilton, who resigned in September. The company said Mr. Skilton left "to pursue other business interests."
In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Van Sant said his primary objective would be to "continue the strategy that has been set for growth and value." He added: "Lukens is a very strong company that is positioned for continued growth. The company's financial health and strength is an asset that we want to be sure to build upon."
Mr. Van Sant joined Blount in 1987 and had been president and chief executive the company, based in Montgomery, Ala., since 1990. Before that, he served as president and chief operating officer of the Cessna Aircraft Company. He had eariler served as vice president of manufacturing and engineering at Deere & Company, where he worked for 26 years.
He holds bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Iowa. He is married and has three sons and two daughters.

HEADLINE: Why Seidman Stayed On For an Extra Year of Duty

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15

 BODY:
In his last full day as the nation's senior banking regulator, L. William Seidman said he would have left more than a year ago had he not been assailed by the White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu.
"Absolutely no question about it," Mr. Seidman said as he prepared to relinquish the chairmanship of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Resolution Trust Corporation. Referring to his visit to the White House in the spring of 1990 and the personality clash with Mr. Sununu, who sought very publicly then to push him out the door, Mr. Seidman said, "I went over there with the purpose of arranging an amicable, friendly and smooth transition." 
 In an interview over sandwiches in his bare sixth-floor corner office overlooking the Washington Monument and the Mall, Mr. Seidman made these other points:
*None of the nation's largest banks are in danger of failing.
*In the first three months of next year, the F.D.I.C. may be forced to consider another increase in the premiums it charges banks to insure deposits.
*The Administration's attack on bank examiners and regulators, accusing them of helping cause tighter credit, could lead to dangerously lax supervisory standards.
*As long ago as 1986, senior regulators, including himself, saw many of the warning signs for the crises now afflicting the banking and savings and loan industries but did not move vigorously enough to contain the problems.
*If the economy grows next year at a rate slower than 3.5 percent to 4 percent, as measured by the gross national product, the costs of bailing out banks and savings and loans might be significantly higher than current Administration estimates. Many economists have forecast a growth rate lower than that, but Mr. Seidman stood by the Administration's estimates today. He did say, however, that the estimates might be revised based on a new F.D.I.C. review that will be sent to the Office of Management and Budget this month.
Mr. Seidman leaves office as the bank insurance fund is on the verge of borrowing tens of billions of taxpayer dollars and regulators are seeking another $80 billion for the savings and loan rescue.
In his six years as its outspoken chairman, he has built the F.D.I.C. from a backwater agency to one of the most powerful institutions in the nation, doling out billions of dollars in contracts and determining the fate of the country's most important financial institutions. He also supervised the growth of Resolution Trust into one of the largest financial institutions in the world, but one that is struggling to unload a huge portfolio of real estate.
At points during the hour-and-a-half interview, the 71-year-old regulator from East Grand Rapids, Mich., recounted his ups and downs with the Bush Administration and his running battles with Congress and its investigative arm, the General Accounting Office. Other times he was politely evasive, clearly saving his juiciest anecdotes for his memoirs.
 
A Rough Draft
 "The first chapter on the Administration," he said, "starts out with the sentences: 'If there was one thing I learned in my first tour of duty in Washington, it was not to get in a battle with the President's chief of staff. Here follows the story of how I was unable to carry that out.' "
He said he would disclose his future plans, besides writing the book, on Wednesday.
He said that while the savings and loan bailout would probably wind up costing $250 billion, as a practical matter, Americans would pay for it forever because of the long-term borrowing costs. He said it would be unwise to pay for the bailout costs now by either raising taxes or cutting other Federal programs, particularly as the economy struggles to rebound.
He also took a swipe at the General Accounting Office, which in recent months forced the F.D.I.C. to drastically lower its valuation of the bank insurance fund from about $8 billion to about $4 billion and refused to certify the finances of Resolution Trust.
While acknowledging the accounting office's legitimate role as as auditor, he criticized it for issuing what he said were misleading news releases. "They should stop acting like they were a part of the ball game instead of an observer," he said.
In looking back at how the banking industry's troubles grew, Mr. Seidman recalled that as early as 1986 he had spoken about how banks were making too many risky loans and that private and public debt was growing at unprecedented rates.
 
Yellow Light, Red Light
 "I said in a speech in 1986 in San Francisco that we must decrease high debt levels and proceed with care and that the flashing yellow caution light is operational," he said. "The mistake was that I should've said the red light is flashing, not the yellow light."
Recalling his speech, which denounced large debt levels, he said, "What I'm saying is: My greatest regret is that I didn't listen to what I said carefully enough."
Of the economy and the weak condition of many large banks, Mr. Seidman observed: "Banks are so time sensitive because the longer recession lasts, the more capital is used up for those who are losing money. If we see an estimate that's higher than $10 billion in losses to the bank insurance fund, then I think we will have to raise bank premiums."

HEADLINE: Economics Nobel to a Basic Thinker

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Ronald H. Coase, a British-born 81-year-old economist retired from the University of Chicago Law School, was awarded the $1 million Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences yesterday.
The work for which he was cited is almost as remarkable for its brevity and accessibility to non-economists as for its profundity. Unlike many of the recent economics prize winners, Mr. Coase is known for his thinking on the role of institutions in the economy -- work that contains little or no mathematics. 
 One of his key articles explains why companies exist -- why, for example, there is a McDonald's rather than 100,000 individual entrepreneurs selling hamburgers and french fries on every street corner.
 
Regulating Noxious Behavior
 Another important work argues that markets may be better than laws in regulating pollution and other noxious behavior of producers. And while some of his conclusions seem obvious now, they helped redirect thinking in critical areas of economic theory.
The new Nobel laureate was vacationing in Europe and could not be reached for comment. But fellow professionals were eager to sing his praises, crediting him with revolutionizing the way economists and legal scholars analyze the push-and-shove of the marketplace.
"He is the most original thinker I've come across in economics," said Michael E. Levine, dean of the Yale School of Management.
"He knows markets with every fiber of his being," added Daniel Kasper, a researcher at Harbridge House in Boston.
The core of Mr. Coase's work -- the work cited by the Royal Swedish Academy -- is found in just two academic papers. A 1937 article, "The Theory of the Firm," asks why companies exist if production can also be organized as a chain of individual market transactions among people who are buying and selling everything from the labor to mine the iron ore to a finished car.
The answer, that the company eliminates uncertainty and costly one-time negotiations by creating stable contractual relationships, seems too simple to be important. But Michael Levine of Yale points out that by focusing on how companies are constructed around contracts between parties with disparate knowledge and diverse interests, Mr. Coase breathed new life into the stagnant field of industrial organization.
The second article, "The Problem of Social Cost," published in 1960, is the stuff of myth in law and economics. Here Mr. Coase challenged the classic economic logic behind the common law practice of enjoining behavior that damages others.
He offered the example of a steam locomotive that spews sparks as it crosses a farmer's field. By the standard view, laws and courts are needed to settle the question of who is responsible for preventing fire damage. But Mr. Coase argued that a clear assignment of rights and responsibilities was not necessary to minimize losses. What is needed, he said, are low "transactions costs" -- creating a method for the farmer and the railroad to bargain easily and speedily.
The farmer can prevent fires by keeping the right-of-way free of crops. Or the railroad can prevent fires by equipping the locomotives with equipment to suppress sparks. Regardless of the legal equities, it pays both to work out a way to assign the responsibility on whomever does the job at least cost.
 
Complicating Problems
 The real world, of course, is rarely so simple. There may be dozens of farmers along the right-of-way growing a dozen different crops at different seasons. Bargaining may be complicated by the fact that only the railroad knows what it would cost to suppress sparks. And negotiations over even simple issues may fail to achieve low-cost solutions because parties misread each others' intentions.
But by forcing economists and lawyers to rethink the question, Mr. Coase focused the attention of legal scholars on what it takes to make markets work efficiently without government to call balls and strikes. And in the process, said William Landes, an economist at the University of Chicago Law School, it has pushed scholars to think more about how to drive conflict toward negotiation rather than litigation.
Other research by Mr. Coase has had less impact, but was important in its own right. His barely noticed 1950 analysis of the Federal Communications Commission, which introduced the idea that access to the airwaves was a form of property, was decades ahead of its time. Economists now believe that Washington's failure to treat the radio spectrum as a scarce resource, to be allocated via markets to those who value it most, is reducing national productivity by billions of dollars.
His work on regulation attacked the longstanding paradox that "natural monopolies," like telephone systems and electricity grids, could never operate efficiently unless they set prices below cost. Richard A. Posner, a Federal appeals court judge who was formerly a colleague of Mr. Coase at Chicago, credits the argument with "deflecting economists from a research dead end."
Born in England in 1910, Mr. Coase graduated from the London School of Economics in 1932, and taught there from 1935 to 1951. He moved to the Univerity of Buffalo in 1951, and then to the University of Virginia. Since 1964 he has taught at the University of Chicago.
In this six-decade academic career, he published just a dozen research papers of significance. But for Robert Cooter, an economist at the Boalt School of Law at the University of California, that is just one more reason why Mr. Coase is a scholar's scholar. "Most economists maximize the amount they write," he said. "Coase maximized the amount others wrote about his work."

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Net Fell 84.5% In 3d Period

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
I.B.M. came out with some grim earnings numbers yesterday, but after the company indicated that the worst might finally be over, its stock price rose sharply, buoying the whole stock market.
The International Business Machines Corporation, the world's largest computer maker, said its third-quarter earnings fell 84.5 percent, on a 5.6 percent revenue decline, but it also said it had made progress in reducing its work force and bringing several important product lines to market. 
 Central to its positive outlook is success in cutting costs. I.B.M. has been struggling for years to reduce its costs significantly and yesterday's report showed that its sales, general and administrative costs declined for the first time in almost 20 years.
 
Cuts in the Payroll
 These expenses were down 1 percent after discounting for the effect of a special $100 million charge to cover the additional costs that arose when more employees than were expected took incentives to leave the company. The company told analysts that research and development expenses also declined by about 1 percent last quarter.
The stock market liked the company's assessment. After an initial decline of $2.125, I.B.M.'s stock recovered strongly, ending with a $3 gain, to $104.25. It was the fourth-most-active issue on the New York Stock Exchange, with more than three million shares changing hands. The Dow Jones industrial average followed the leader, rising 21.92, to 3,041.37. [Page D10.]
"The year-to-year numbers were ugly, but under the surface it was a pretty good report," said Stephen Cohen, a computer industry analyst at the Soundview Financial Group. "Expenses were under excellent control."
 
Trouble Is Industrywide
 Steven Milunovich, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, added, "Any technology company earnings report that is not a disaster is pretty much good news these days."
I.B.M. has been trying to alter its business model in recent years to survive in a more competitive industry by slashing staff through a series of voluntary inducements. The company's work force has now declined by about 50,000 since it peaked at 406,000 in 1985. Yesterday the company said it expected to reduce the head count by about 20,000 this year, almost 3,000 more than it had previously stated.
"Although business conditions remain unsettled, we expect improvement in the pace of our business as shipments of our new product line build," I.B.M.'s chairman, John F. Akers, said in a statement.
For the quarter ended Sept. 30, the Armonk, N.Y., computer maker's revenue was $14.43 billion, down from $15.28 billion. Earnings were $172 million, or 30 cents a share, compared with $1.11 billion, or $1.95, in the 1990 period.
A number of analysts said they still saw signs for concern based on continued pressures from price competition and the recession.
Rick Martin of Prudential Securities said he was cutting his estimate for the fourth quarter based on an unexpected decline in gross margins on equipment. He said he estimated that gross margins were probably no better than 47 or 47.5 percent for the quarter compared with an expected 55 percent. He said he spoke to the company yesterday and was told that I.B.M. expects margins to only partly return at the end of the year.
 
'A Nasty Situation'
 "It's really a nasty situation," he said. "I think that Wall Street earnings estimates are going to trail off during the quarter."
He said he attributed the margin decline to pricing pressures, underuse of capacity during the recession and the effect of product introductions, which slow initial sales.
The company appears to be making a strong transition to its new line of mainframes, several analysts said. I.B.M. began shipping its new family of top-of-the-line processors last month, and its strength in the fourth quarter is largely dependent on the success of the new machines. But a number of questions remain on price issues analysts said. If the company is forced to offer deep discounts to sell its new machines, which are for the largest corporations, it will subtract significantly from fourth-quarter earnings.
"The big question is price," Mr. Milunovich said.
 
Aggressive Offerings
 Separately, I.B.M. told analysts in a telephone conference call that it believed its market share in the personal computer market would hold for the year, after a decline in the first half. Several analysts said that the company would show a number of aggressive desktop offerings shortly and that it expected its new machines to make up ground that it had lost recently to clone companies like Dell Computer and Zeos.
During the morning conference call the company said United States sales continued to decline during the quarter, but that the decline was slower than the previous quarter. As a result the company said that the economy might have bottomed out and that it expected an improving economy in the fourth quarter.
I.B.M. also said sales of mainframes, computer storage devices and low-end personal computers had declined so far this year on a year-to-year basis, while its AS-400 minicomputer and RS/6000 work station lines had shown increases.
The company also said its European business declined compared with the second quarter of 1991.

HEADLINE: Iacocca Urges U.S. Limits on Japanese Car Sales

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AUBURN HILLS, Mich., Oct. 15

 BODY:
Lee A. Iacocca said today that the Big Three auto makers should consider promoting Federal legislation to limit the Japanese car industry to a fixed percentage of the American market.
Speaking at the dedication of the Chrysler Corporation's $1 billion technology center outside Detroit, Mr. Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman, said: "We've never favored a complete restriction, but we'll have to decide our collective position. We have to deal with our own self-interests. At some point, you have to decide what you stand for." 
 The nation is "out of the electronics business, the VCR business, and soon we could be out of the car business," he added.
 
Others Not Consulted
 Mr. Iacocca said he had not discussed the idea with executives of the Ford Motor Company and the General Motors Corporation or the Bush Administration. A G.M. spokesman said he was not aware of any such proposal under consideration by the company, and a Ford official did not provide an immediate response to a telephone call seeking comment.
The Chrysler chairman's remarks seemed to be motivated by a growing sense of desperation that Japanese competition and a weak economy were mortally wounding the nation's largest manufacturing industry.
But the 67-year-old Mr. Iacocca, who will retire at the end of next year, dismissed questions about Chrysler's viability over the coming 10 months, saying the company thought its new products, including a four-door Jeep that goes into production in early 1992, would increase cash-flow substantially.
"We're in good shape, and have plenty of backstops," he said. "We still have a $1.75 billion revolving credit line that we've paid fees on for 10 years that we haven't touched."
A limit of market share, like the 16 percent cap imposed last summer by the European Community through 1999, would cover all cars and trucks sold by Japanese manufacturers, including those assembled at American factories, or transplants, like the Honda Motor Company's plant in Marysville, Ohio. Japanese producers now sell about 31 percent of the cars sold in the United States.
It was not immediately clear today how Mr. Iacocca's proposal would treat Japanese components, which are found in most domestic models, or vehicles built in joint-venture plants but sold by domestic manufacturers. General Motors's Geo Prizm car, for example, is built in Fremont, Calif., but has an engine made by the Toyota Motor Corporation.
The European laws on market share do not cover Japanese vehicles built in North America, like the Honda station wagon now sold in several European countries.
A ceiling on the number of vehicles that could be sold by Japanese auto makers is the most extreme proposal so far to help ailing American car makers, whose cumulative losses in the last year have totaled about $6 billion. Despite voluntary export restraints by the Japanese starting in 1981, the industry has steadily lost ground against Japanese auto makers.
In recent years, the number of Japanese imports has fallen as the number of vehicles produced by their transplants has increased. Indeed, most Japanese producers are importing substantially fewer vehicles than are permitted under the voluntary restraint agreement.
Democratic legislators have recently been exploring the possibility of following the European model to cap overall sales of Japanese cars. No one has offered a bill yet, but prospects for passage would be uncertain, given the Japanese industry's efforts to build an American infrastructure of plants, workers, research labs and lobbyists.
 
Most Damage to Chrysler
 Chrysler, as the smallest of the Big Three, has experienced the most serious financial damage. Its debt securities have been downgraded to junk-bond status, and it was recently forced to raise equity capital when its stock price was at a 10-year low.
In recent weeks, the car maker's rhetoric against the country's trade imbalance with Japan has grown sharper. Robert A. Lutz, Chrysler president, criticized American trade policy, comparing United States consumption of Japanese-made products to the behavior of an alcoholic.
Separately, Mr. Iacocca acknowledged that Chrysler was close to agreement with the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation for the sale to Mitsubishi of Chrysler's 50 percent stake in the companies' Diamond-Star assembly plant venture in Bloomington, Ill.

HEADLINE: Early-Month Vehicle Sales Down 11.4%

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 15

 BODY:
Sales declines of 11.4 percent for domestically built cars and light trucks in early October were reported today.
Analysts said the drop was expected, because widespread incentives helped increase sales late last month. They also noted that car sales over the last 30 days were in line with recent months. 
 "We're in a holding pattern," said Harvey Heinbach of Merrill Lynch & Company in New York.
 
Ford Battles G.M.
 Some of the biggest incentives last month were offered by the Ford Motor Company, the nation's No. 2 car maker, and the General Motors Corporation, the leader. The Chrysler Corporation also offered incentives on many of its cars and light trucks.
"Now we're getting pay-back for sales shifted forward into late September by Detroit's race for bragging rights," said Ronald A. Glantz, an analyst with Dean Witter Securities in San Francisco.
Dealers said low consumer confidence remained a drag on sales. Some shoppers are also finding prices of the new 1992 models, which average more than $16,000, out of reach, the dealers said.
"They're saying they'd like to have it, but they can't afford it," said Quitman Tisdale, the sales manager of Andalusia Motor Company, a Ford and Mercury dealership in Andalusia, Ala., near the Florida line.
Tom Webb, the chief economist of the National Automobile Dealers Association, an industry group based in McLean, Va., said: "It's simply a matter of money; people don't have enough. Household net worth continues to erode, job prospects have failed to brighten, and nominal wage gains are modest at best."
 
Brighter Days Ahead
 Nevertheless, many automobile industry experts have predicted that car sales will improve, in part because of the aging fleet of cars on the road -- the mean age is 7.5 years.
George Koulouris, the general manager of J. Thomas Honda in Watertown, Conn., said a growing number of his recent sales had been from so-called need buyers. "We're seeing a lot more older vehicles coming back," he said, some with more than 100,000 miles.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, cars sold at an annual rate of 5.5 million in the Oct. 1-10 period. Last year, cars sold at a 6.5 million rate in early October. Sales have shown gradual improvement in the first three quarters of the year, rising to about 6.3 million in the third quarter, from 6 million in the first.
The 10 domestic car makers sold 160,286 cars in early October, and 79,595 light trucks, a category that includes mini-vans and four-wheel-drive vehicles, as well as pickup trucks.
 
Big Three Down 18.9%
 The Big Three posted a collective sales decline of 18.9 percent in car sales during early October, while Japanese companies with factories in the United States, or "transplants," reported an overall increase of 38.5 percent. Models that posted strong gains include the Honda Accord, for which sales jumped by 60 percent, to 9,481, in the period.
The transplants raised their share of the American car market to 16.8 percent in early October, from 10.6 percent a year earlier.
Of the Big Three, G.M.'s car sales dropped by 19.2 percent, to 71,921, and the company's light-truck sales dropped by 9.7 percent, to 31,828.
Ford reported a drop of 3.4 percent in its car sales, to 47,506, and in its light-truck sales, to 26,447, or 17.5 percent.
Chrysler does not report its monthly sales, but Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry publication, estimated that the company's car sales dropped by 47 percent, to 13,900. But Chrysler's truck sales jumped 6.2 percent, to 17,800, Ward's estimated.
Of the transplants, the Honda Motor Company reported a sales increase of 45.6 percent in the period, to 13,560, on its cars.

HEADLINE: Japanese Coin Word for Their Unease About U.S.

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 15

 BODY:
A former national security director for Japan, Atsuyuki Sassa, wrote recently that Americans were still "intoxicated with a war-victory mood," though they had done little to overcome economic stagnation, drugs, declining schools and other problems.
Kazuo Inamori, chairman of the Kyocera Corporation, a major high- technology company, also took this general theme, an increasingly popular one, writing in a recent article that Japanese were growing tired of feeling that "America doesn't like us or respect us despite our efforts." 
 In fact, a new word has has been coined here to describe the phenomenon behind these thoughts. The word is "kenbei," meaning "dislike of the United States," and its use appears to be growing.
"There have always been ups and downs in the image of the United States in Japan," said Seizaburo Sato, professor of political science at Tokyo University. "But there is a growing concern in Japan over the decline of American work ethics, moral principles, the quality of American products.
"Most Japanese realize that the world needs a strong, healthy and economically dynamic United States," Mr. Sato said. "So all these trends are a source of concern."
 
New Word for Old Feeling
 The term kenbei has been used only since the beginning of this year, reflecting the pent-up feelings of frustration and criticism of the United States accumulating for many years on the basis of friction over trade issues, cultural differences and a number of other points of disagreement between the two countries.
For Japanese, these feelings were sharply focused by the negative reaction in this country to the seeming eagerness of the United States to go to war in the Persian Gulf. Criticism of Japan's role in the gulf appears to have brought these emotions out into the open, resulting in some criticism of the United States that is unusually harsh and direct by Japanese standards.
Still, the Japanese remain in love with American culture, from jazz to blue jeans to movies with Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Moreover, many polls show that there is now a national consensus supporting the existing Japan-United States security treaty.
"Only a small minority of Japanese have a deep-rooted antipathy to the United States," said Yukio Okamoto, a former diplomat who is now a business consultant.
 
U.S. as Bully
 But he added that "there is a growing feeling that on trade issues, the United States is bullying Japan, arrogantly making demands on every trivial matter that does not comply with the American standard of justice."
A senior Foreign Ministry official said the pattern was caused by American pressure on trade issues and accusations that Japan did not respond quickly or generously enough to help the war against Iraq. In the end, Japan contributed $13 billion, or a quarter of the cost of the war.
"We may have been somewhat clumsy and slow, but we did our best," the official said. "Now we in Japan don't like it that the United States is not giving us any credit."
Whether the demand is that Tokyo end its ban on rice imports or that Japanese fishermen stop using big drift nets, or that Japanese stockbrokers and businessmen end what are deemed collusive business practices, the criticism is increasingly seen here as "Japan bashing."
 
See America as Threat
 The Foreign Ministry has become so concerned about the issue that it commissioned a study by Professor Sato this year to uncover the factors involved in kenbei. Professor Sato and others said they were not at liberty to discuss the poll numbers that document the trend.
But just as Americans now have a different view of the world after the cold war, so 24 percent of those polled by the Yomiuri newspaper three months ago said they regarded the United States as a security threat, while only 22 percent said they saw the Soviet Union as a similar threat. Among people in their 20's, the group regarding the United States as a security threat was 33 percent.
The existence of rising kenbei is considered important especially as Japan chooses a successor to Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu. Kiichi Miyazawa, the former Deputy Prime Minister who has the support of the largest faction of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, said he foresaw no major changes in Japan's relations with the United States, but he was said to have been a skeptic on the Persian Gulf war.
 
Hopes for Bush's Visit
 American and Japanese officials are sufficiently concerned about the kenbei trend that they are pinning great hopes on President Bush's visit to Japan, scheduled for November. Diplomats are working on a document reaffirming the alliance, called the "Japan-United States Charter," as a way of rallying popular support for the relationship.
To many scholars and critics, the word kenbei itself tells a lot about the complicated nature of Japanese feelings. The sense of the word is that one can be in favor of the Japanese-American security relationship, for instance, but still feel dislike or distaste about American tendencies perceived here as arrogance and the sense that Japan is being blamed for problems that are of America's own making.
In contrast, Japanese have long had the term "hanbei," roughly equivalent to "anti-American" with a connotation of distinct opposition to the United States; hanbei is a mostly ideological concept, in the context of the cold war. While there has always been a strong left-wing anti-American strain in Japan, hanbei has by all indications declined since the days of anti-American riots in the 1950's and 1960's, only to be replaced by rising kenbei.
In the current Bungei Shunju, a prestigious monthly magazine, Tsuneo Iida, professor of economics at the International Research Center for Japanese Studies in Kyoto, accused Americans of being too critical of Japan's recent stock market scandals.
 
Defense of Scandals
 To American businessmen, the scandals have revealed shocking levels of insider trading, favoritism and market manipulation by big brokers on behalf of their well-heeled clients. Rather than criticize, Professor Iida said Americans should recognize that such practices were once common in the United States.
"American manufacturing in the old days closely resembles Japanese manufacturing today," he wrote. "If Americans call that 'unfair,' they are only spitting on their forefathers."
Discussing kenbei, Professor Iida said: "I personally do not hate America. I am not saying Americans are all bad. But at least I would like to say, 'You Americans have no right to blame us.' "
Mr. Inamori, the president of Kyocera, wrote in one of several symposia in Japanese magazines on the topic of Japanese-American relations that "the debate over the gulf war has only abetted the kenbei tendency, particularly among the young generation that does not know World War II and its aftermath."
In another article, Yoshimi Ishikawa, author of a book on farm workers in California and other non-fiction books, wrote, "In response to the force displayed by America, there is emerging among Japanese a move from fear toward something like nascent hatred."
 
Focus on an Infamous Date
 Several recent articles have focused on plans to observe the anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. Many say they fear that Americans will use the anniversary to revive criticism of Tokyo as untrustworthy and aggressive.
Takanori Irie, a professor at Meiji University in Tokyo, said Japan suffered from the aftermath of three wars: World War II, the cold war and the gulf war. He said Japan had an "Anglo-Saxon neurosis" that made it slavishly follow the views of the West, particularly the United States.
Perhaps the most revealing recent criticism of the United States came in articles by Kazuo Ogura, director general of cultural affairs at the Foreign Ministry. Indeed, the Ministry translated the articles and included them in a pamphlet of "representative" thinking in Japan.
Mr. Ogura wrote in the Gaiko Forum, a Japanese-language magazine published by the Foreign Ministry, that criticism of Japanese investments in the United States showed that "American people are not yet psychologically prepared to accept dependence on Japan."
 
New Suit of Clothes
 Japanese, he said, feel "a vaguely unsettling sensation" when they are asked by Americans to fight and die for such concepts as "freedom, democracy and the market economy." These values, he said, have no Japanese roots and feel like "a new suit of Western clothes" to most Japanese.
"To many Japanese," Mr. Ogura wrote, "the American approach to Japan comes across as an attempt to create a spiritual colony of the United States on Japanese soil." Such an approach, he said, violates "the fundamentals of friendly relations between countries."
Mr. Ogura used such words as "unease," "anguish," "agony" and "despair" to describe Japanese reactions to American pressure nowadays.
"Those on the U.S. side are still leaning heavily on Japan, never reflecting on their own country's shortcomings," he concluded. "And those on the Japanese side are still bowing before the American demands, as if doing so was Japan's fate."

HEADLINE: Chicago Journal;
A Library Opens to Revive and Heal

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 15

 BODY:
At a time when cities around the country are either closing libraries or cutting their hours to save money, Chicago has opened a $144 million neo-classical library building in an ailing downtown business area.
The new library, the Harold Washington Library Center, is named for Chicago's first black Mayor and, city officials say, is the nation's largest municipal lending library. It is already seen as a healer of political bruises and a symbol of urban revival. 
 The 750,000-square-foot central library is intended to be the first of several renovation projects in the South Loop, an area largely neglected by developers in the boom years of the 1980's. Until recently, the area consisted mostly of fast-food restaurants and parking lots.
The former Goldblatt's department store building, which is a block north of the new library and has been vacant for 10 years, was bought last winter by DePaul University, which plans a $70 million renovation to include classrooms, offices and retail stores. And the nearby former Sears building, also empty for several years, has already been converted into offices.
City officials are working on a development strategy for South Loop property owners, and hope the library, on State and Congress Streets, will fuel a revival of the area.
"The library was located at that site as a revitalization project for that area," said Marcel Acosta of the city's planning department. "We hope to use it as a development catalyst."
The library's other, and perhaps less tangible, role is in healing some of the scars left by the bitter racial politics that Mayor Washington had to deal with in his six years in office.
In the dedication ceremonies and in the news media's coverage of the library's opening, public officials, some of whom were vociferous opponents of Mr. Washington, praised his love for books and his pride in Chicago, and seemingly put aside the divisive politics of that era.
Noting that the former Mayor's name adorns the stone arch above the library's main entrance, Vera Wardlaw, a special-education teacher who sat with her West Side students at the ribbon-cutting ceremony on Friday, said: "Harold Washington is a name that all the children know. This is just going to enhance the name as well as the library."
Although Chicago's budget is stretched as thinly as those of other major cities, officials said the library, which was financed largely by a bond issue, was a priority. The city has budgeted $11 million for book acquisitions this year and embarked on a program to renovate 15 of the system's 84 branch libraries at a cost of $30 million.
The new library houses two million books in 90 languages, a 400-seat auditorium, an 18,000-square-foot children's library and a glass-enclosed winter garden on the ninth floor.
"Yes, budgets are tight, but you have to spend money for some things, and this is something we consider a priority," said Avis LaVelle, the spokeswoman for Mayor Richard M. Daley.
It has taken almost 70 years for the city to get around to building a central library. In 1922 the president of the library board announced that the city's book collection had outgrown its home on Washington Street, and since then succeeding boards have pushed for a new library.
It was not until 1973 that most of the central collection was moved to a temporary site in a warehouse along the Chicago River. After 15 years of debate over where to build a new library, city officials settled on the current site.
The new central library has generated some debate. Librarians at the city's 84 branches contend that it is syphoning money and staff members from the already underfinanced and understaffed branches. And some architects charge say the building's massive brick exterior is intimidating and conservative.
Such arguments are unlikely to deter library users. A dozen people waited outside in 35-degree temperatures for the library to open on Monday.
Carrie Staley, an unemployed sales clerk, was seated in the periodicals section reading a paperback autobiography of the basketball star Magic Johnson. "I've been waiting for this," she said. "It gives me a place to go and sit and read and think about a few things. We all need a place for that."

HEADLINE: New York Seen Facing New State Budget Gap

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 15

 BODY:
After receiving a State Comptroller's report showing the state with a modest cash imbalance, Cuomo administration officials said today that the state may once again be facing a gap in its budget.
The report, which analyzes the state's cash flow after the first six months of its fiscal year, showed a cash imbalance of $155.2 million in the state's approximately $29 billion general-fund budget. The general fund is the part of the budget financed with state taxes and fees. 
 The $155 million imbalance is considered mild, particularly in light of recent budget gaps that have soared into the billions of dollars. But aides to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo expressed concern about some of the recession-driven trends suggested by the Comptroller's report, particularly softness in personal-income-tax collections and unexpectedly heavy expenditures on Medicaid and other social services.
 
Impact of Recession
 "It confirms what the Governor's been saying for weeks, that our state's economy, like other states' economies, is continuing to feel the impact of the national recession," said Anne W. Crowley, the Governor's press secretary. "We don't think it's incorrect that there's a softness and there may be a gap at the end of the year."
Mr. Cuomo's budget office will spend the next two weeks analyzing the raw data in the report prepared by the State Comptroller, Edward V. Regan. The budget office is scheduled to release a midyear economic forecast on Oct. 30 that would project the size of any potential budget gap.
Last year, the Legislature had to return to Albany for a special session in December to close a $1 billion gap in the 1990-91 state budget. Because only three months were left in the fiscal year, which begins on April 1, the lawmakers and Mr. Cuomo had to enact the largest package of midyear spending cuts in state history.
Even then, the cuts did not go far enough. The state ultimately had to borrow $900 million more through the sale of short-term notes to close that deficit at the end of the fiscal year.
 
Largest Source of Funds
 As it did last year, Mr. Regan's midyear report showed that the personal income tax, which is the largest source of state funds, was generating less revenue than anticipated. It was down by $127.5 million.
Some of the softness in the personal income tax was offset by the better-than-expected performance of business and sales taxes. But what has created the most concern is spending on social services. The Comptroller's report showed that disbursements to local governments for social services, which pay for grants to welfare and Medicaid recipients, was up 17 percent over the first six months of last year.
The driving force seems to be Medicaid spending, which has risen by 18 percent. The state had anticipated growth of 3 percent in Medicaid spending for the fiscal year, said Claudia Hutton, a spokeswoman for the State Budget Division.
 
Delayed Reimbursements
 Ms. Hutton said her office could not yet gauge the real impact of the Medicaid and income-tax figures on the size of a potential budget gap.
The Medicaid numbers, for instance, could be skewed by delayed reimbursements from the Federal Government, faster than expected billings from health-care providers, and cost-containment initiatives that will not be felt until the second half of the year.
But they could also be the product of unexpected increases in the Medicaid caseload. The state had budgeted for 7 percent growth in the Medicaid caseload, and it has been 9 percent so far this year, Ms. Hutton said.
The income-tax problem is largely due to a miscalculation of how many jobs would be lost in the recession. The state has lost about 300,000 jobs since May 1990, 140,000 more than the Cuomo administration had projected earlier this year, Ms. Hutton said.

HEADLINE: They Came to California for the Good Life; Now They're Looking Elsewhere

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 15

 BODY:
The enormous migration to California from other states, which brought profound political and economic consequences over the last decade, appears to have slowed substantially.
Demographers and geographers attribute the slowing largely to the recession, which has hit California particularly hard, leaving its once-robust economy to bring up the rear of the national recovery. But they also point to many other factors, including high housing costs, air pollution, traffic congestion, crime, deteriorating social services and fear of earthquakes and other disasters. 
 Most tellingly, for the first time since these figures have been tracked, more young people from the age of 30 to age 44 left California for other states than moved in during the 12 months ending June 30, based on figures from the state's Department of Finance. Among them were Robert and Mara Shlachter, who recently pulled up their roots in Los Angeles, took a cut in income and moved to Portland, Ore.
 
Concern Among Leaders
 "We wanted to be in a smaller community," said Mr. Shlachter, a 44-year-old lawyer. "We wanted to get around more easily, see friends more easily and enjoy the outdoors readily."
The loss of such families is stirring deep concern among California's leaders. "It's troubling when it's people in their productive years," the State Treasurer, Kathleen Brown, said in an interview. "But it's not surprising, given the problems California faces that have not been solved."
She added, though, that the state could benefit from a pause in immigration to allow it to "catch up" in rebuilding roads and schools and other needs.
In addition, the outflow of such younger people comes as a growing number of companies are relocating to other states, galvanizing officials and business leaders in efforts to retain jobs.
 
Total Population Is Up
 Despite the slowing of domestic migration, the population of California continues to grow substantially because of a high birth rate and foreign immigration.
The lure of California has not always been irresistible to other Americans. During two other recent recessions, in the early 1970's and early 1980's, the flood of migrants narrowed to a trickle and then rebounded with a vengeance when the economy improved.
But some economists see the current shift as part of a broader and more enduring movement of population and economic activity inward, away from both the East and West Coasts to the Rocky Mountain, Midwestern and Southern states, where the costs of living and doing business are much lower. If so, the validity of numerous forecasts of continued swelling of the California population may be called into question, with implications for politics, schools and many industries, including housing and retailing.
A slowdown will be welcomed by many Californians, especially environmentalists, who say uncontrolled population growth has caused traffic congestion, pollution and other problems that have ruined a state that many once considered something of an earthly paradise.
 
Working With Assuptions
 On the other hand, numerous business and government agencies, like homebuilders and school districts, have drawn plans based on the assumption that the state's population would continue to grow at extremely high rates.
The new trends emerge from shifts of driver's licenses between states, which demographers say offer a more current picture of domestic migration than the decennial census. According to data compiled by analysts at the California Department of Finance, the number of licenses that were changed to California from the 49 other states and the District of Columbia dropped to 376,000 in 1990-91 from a peak of 437,000 in 1988-89, while the number changed to other states has increased even faster.
Demographers estimate that every change in one driver's license corresponds to a shift of 1.5 people; if so, the net movement of Americans to California dropped to about 55,500 during the last fiscal year from 208,500 two years ago.
 
Big 'Natural Increase'
 This does not suggest that the state has stopped its rapid growth. Even with no domestic migration, California's "natural increase," the term demographers use for the excess of births over deaths, continues to outpace the national average because of the large population of Hispanic residents and other minorities in the state whose birth rates tend to be high.
In addition, there is immigration from foreign countries, both legal and illegal; in recent years, California has received by far the largest number of such immigrants of any state. Recent data from the Immigration and Naturalization Service show that legal foreign immigration to California has remained constant since the current recession started, at a rate of about 185,000 a year.
According to the 1990 census, the state registered a staggering 26 percent increase in population in the last decade, to 29.8 million in 1990 from 23.7 million in 1980. That was more than twice the national average and gave California seven new seats in Congress. Of that growth by 6.1 million, natural increase accounted for about 3.4 million, foreign immigration 1.9 million and migration from other states 824,000.
The domestic migration, about 13 percent of this growth, was important politically because, unlike newborns and foreign immigrants, most of these new residents could vote almost immediately.
The slackening of domestic migration comes against a backdrop of deepening economic troubles here. Even as the national unemployment rate dipped slightly in September to 6.7 percent, California's rate rose to 7.7 percent, with a 9.3 percent rate for Los Angeles County, the most populous county in the United States and about a third of the state's population. The county has been hard hit by layoffs in the military and aerospace industries,banking and retailing. As a whole, the state lost 240,000 jobs during the last fiscal year.
According to a survey for the California Business Roundtable, a group of corporate executives, 14 percent of California's business leaders said they planned to relocate outside the state, and 41 percent said they planned to expand operations out of state.
The population data suggest that Los Angeles County, which has 8.8 million people, accounts for the bulk of the change in migration patterns. For some years now, the net migration to the county from other states has been slowing, and in the last year the flow turned negative for the first time.
 
'People Are Leaving'
 " People are leaving," said Professor James P. Allen, a geographer at California State University at Northridge. "L.A. used to be a mecca for people seeking climate and job opportunities. It has lost that rosy image. That's quite realistic, given problems of crime, pollution, congestion, housing costs and lack of funds for an increasing number of children."
The driver's license records show that Californians are migrating mainly to Nevada, Washington State, Oregon, Arizona and Florida, in that order. California remains a net importer from most other states, mainly from New York, Massachussetts, Texas, Michigan, New Jersey and Illinois. For example, during the last fiscal year, 23,459 New Yorkers converted to California driver's licenses while only 12,188 did the opposite.
While older retired people have been leaving California for cheaper areas for years, the loss of younger families is new. Mr. Shlachter, the lawyer who recently moved to Portland with his wife and two children, ages 6 and 10, originally moved to Los Angeles from Cleveland. He drank deeply in the good California life, but ultimately found it not to his taste.
"We had a very comfortable life and we liked L.A.," he said. "We studied this move for almost a year. I lost a lot of sleep for six months. We were very well established in L.A. and had a lot of friends. The kids were the primary stimulus. We believe in the public-school system, but we put our older child in private school in L.A. We did it reluctantly."
Though he misses friends and the baseball Dodgers, Mr. Shlachter said the family had been pleased by the move. "When I told people that I was leaving, the typical comment was: 'Congratulations, you've got a lot of guts. I've been thinking about something like this for a long time.' " he said. "At least 100 people have told me that."
Many others leapt at the chance to leave when it came. Last October, Smart Telecom Inc., a small company that makes optics and stobe lights for the military, moved from Orange, Calif., to Reno. The company's plant manager, 28-year-old Kenneth J. Miner 2d, married with two children, did not hestitate for a moment.
He had been commuting to Orange from Riverside, about 50 miles, and the drive often took two hours each way. "Some days it would be three, three and a half hours," he said. "We called it the carpool from hell. There would be times when I would not see my kids for days. I'd leave at 4 A.M. and come home at 8 or 9 at night."
In March he bought a 1,800-square-foot home in Sparks, Nev., just a five-minute drive from work, for $98,000. A similar home in Orange County would have cost three times as much.
"We love it up here," Mr. Miner said by telephone. "There's not the traffic. There's no smog. I haven't been on the freeway in months."
Similarly, Adam N. Lane, a 27-year-old Oregonian who moved to Los Angeles seven years ago and worked as a senior consultant at the Price Waterhouse accounting firm's office in the Century City area of Los Angeles, was looking to leave when his boss announced he needed volunteers for a new office in Portland last year. "I knocked people down in the hallway getting to his door," he said. By May 1990 he was gone, buying a house in Portland that he could never afford in Los Angeles and thinking about getting married and having children. As he put it, "I can't even imagine raising kids in L.A."

HEADLINE: Bargains End at Public Colleges As States Force Tuition Increases

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
Bargain-rate tuitions for students at state-run colleges and universities have been a source of hope for American families, regardless of their incomes, but the crisis in state financing is pushing lawmakers across the nation to raise tuitions and force students who can afford it to pay more.
Pressed by the recession and budget deficits, states have been unable to fully support their colleges with tax revenues and are increasingly looking to tuition to cover more of the cost of a student's education. Last year, tuition at public colleges increased by 12 percent, the biggest single-year jump since 1983, according to figures released yesterday by The College Board. 
 Average tuition and fees at four-year private colleges is $10,017 and at public colleges it is $2,137, the board said.
At the same time that tuition has been rising, there has been increasing resentment over the fact that the children of upper-income families benefit from low state tuition. As a result, California, Minnesota, New York and other states are treating their universities more like private colleges, where the tuition paid by students from middle- and upper-income families subsidizes financial aid for poorer students. Other states are studying similar plans.
 
Fundamental Tenet
 Some education officials fear that these strategies will prevent many students from attending college and diminish a fundamental tenet of America's system of public higher education.
"The basic issue undergirding all of this is whether we are going to be able to keep our public universities affordable," said James B. Appleberry, president of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. "Every time tuition goes up, some people who are most in need lose hope that they are ever going to go to college."
Supporters of higher tuition, like David Longanecker, executive director of the Colorado Commission on Higher Education, say that asking those who can afford a college education to pay more "is not unreasonable." But critics of the plans assert that higher tuition, even with expanded financial aid for some students, will eventually scare away needy students and hurt the already hard-pressed middle class. They also say states may try to shift even more of the cost of education from taxes to tuitions, thereby decreasing state spending on higher education.
 
Big Growth Over 50 Years
 "My fear is that we're going to end up with a situation of high tuition and low aid, because the states just don't have the financial resources to pay for something like this," said Richard J. Novak, director of the Center for Higher Education Policy and Finance, a not-for-profit research organization in Washington.
The debate over tuition comes at a time of unparalleled success for the state-run colleges, the high point of nearly 50 years of continuous growth since World War II. Those years saw the system expand tremendously and quickly mature. Today, seven of every 10 students in higher education attend a public college.
The public colleges now compete with the private colleges in almost every way, from recruiting the best students to raising money from corporations and alumni. For instance, the University of Houston is expected to announce soon that it has received the largest gift ever given a public university.
But even with such achievements, the public universities have been hurt by the poor financial conditions of the states that support them. Even as the University of Houston was preparing to accept its big gift, it was proceeding with plans, already approved by the legislature, to raise tuition in the 1992-93 school year.
In most state budgets, higher education is given a lower priority than entitlement programs like medical care and social services that must be financed at ever-increasing levels.
Last year, 29 states cut their budgets for colleges and universities in the middle of the academic year by an average of 3.9 percent. Forty-five states either had already imposed or were planning to impose a tuition increase.
 
12 Percent Increase
 Public tuition still lags far behind the rate for private colleges. According to the figures released yesterday by The College Board, tuition at private colleges rose 7 percent last year while public college tuition rose 12 percent. It was the biggest one-year jump since 1983, the end of the last recession.
Some of the biggest increases were in California, where the state budget deficit was $312 million. The cost of attending the University of California system increased 40 percent, or by $650, to $2,274. But accompanying that increase was a package of financial aid that completely shielded students from families with income of less than $30,000 from paying any of the increase. A sliding scale also increased financial aid for families with incomes up to $60,000 to cover part of the tuition increase.
The tuition increases in New York and Washington State were also accompanied by more generous financial aid for low-income students.
 
Debate in Minnesota
 It was Minnesota that most fully debated the tuition question last year. The state's private colleges and universities, which had a competitive stake in seeing public tuitions rise, led the campaign. They argued that across-the-board tuition subsidies had become too big a burden for the state to support.
Minnesota had set tuition at 33 percent of the actual cost of educating a student. A bill backed by the Minnesota Private College Council would have pushed that percentage to 66, with sizable increases not only in the amount of student financial aid but in the number of middle-income families who would be eligible to receive assistance.
The Legislature did not pass the bill, but it did raise tuition to 38 percent of actual costs for this academic year, and 43 percent next year.
"We were pleased and optimistic with the results," said David B. Laird, Jr., president of the council. "The terms of the debate have now changed. People are talking directly about subsidies and equity."
But some educators see the debate as overshadowing a more basic issue.
"Some people are portraying this as a fundamental rethinking of how higher ecucation will be financed," said James R. Mingle, executive director of State Higher Education Executive Officers, a national association based in Denver. "I take a more practical view. This is being done as a result of the states having financial problems. It's cheaper to subsidize a few students than a lot of students."
The theoretical underpinnings of keeping tution low for all students go back to the 1950's, when states were rapidly expanding the public higher education system , in part to handle the increase in students, many of them using the G.I. Bill. Deep subsidies for higher education for all students, regardless of need, were seen as a good investment because they would raise the nation's rate of productivity.
That might represent an ideal, say critics like Thomas P. Wallace, president of Illinois State University. But, they say, the system has gotten too big, the subsidies too deep.
Kent Halstead, president of Research Associates of Washington, a group that tracks financing of higher education, said students had been footing a bigger part of the tab anyway. In 1978, on average, tuition covered 21 percent of actual costs; last year that figure had increased to 26 percent, he said. Some states are far higher: Vermont 73 percent, New Hampshire 53 percent, and Delaware 49 percent.
Mr. Halstead said that while tuition costs had been "creeping higher," tuition at public universities is still modest.
"Even if it goes up to one-third," he said, "imagine anything else in the U.S. today that you could personally buy for one-third of the cost and still benefit so much."

HEADLINE: Schools Go Outside Districts For Money

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LANCASTER, Pa., Oct. 10

 BODY:
Despite a budget increasingly buffeted by recession, the school district of Lancaster has been able to provide programs and services that other school systems have been forced to eliminate because of costs.
By the end of the year, for example, the high school will be outfitted with a $65,000 electronic classroom, with television cameras and monitors that will allow the school to broadcast lessons to other schools or tap into classes broadcast by colleges and universities in the area. 
 These enhancements are not financed by property tax increases, but by the two-year-old Lancaster Foundation for Education Excellence, a not-for-profit organization established by parents and business leaders to help the urban working-class district of 10,300 students plug its budgetary holes.
 
Growing Trend in Country
 "Given the fiscal restraints, the foundation is able to do special things that the school district can't do," said Robert J. Shekletski, the Lancaster school superintendent.
In these penny-pinching times, increasing numbers of school districts like Lancaster are setting up independent education foundations created especially for public schools. About 1,000 foundations have been established around the country in a movement that took root in California after voters there approved Proposition 13 in 1978, limiting tax increases and reducing the amount of money available to schools. The state now has 160 education foundations.
"It's kind of the last opportunity for people to do something for their own public schools," said Allan Odden, a school finance expert at the University of Southern California. "States can't give a whole lot right now, and local property taxes don't go far enough. Foundations are an outlet for people to do a little bit more."
 
Big Interest in Northeast
 Now in the Northeast, the lingering recession and voter animosity to tax increases have forced fiscally strapped schools to look at foundations as financial sources of last resort. About 25 percent of all the foundations now operating have been established in the last three years in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut and other Northeastern states, and interest in them continues to grow.
In July, for example, Educational Foundation Consultants, a Williamston, Mich., concern that helps school districts establish independent foundations, mailed 60 letters to New Jersey school districts outlining the benefits of the foundations. So far, 30 have responded.
"I would not be surprised if another 1,000 foundations form in the next two to three years, with a lot of them in the Northeast," said Kenneth A. Grounds, the vice president of the concern, which charges an average of $18,000 to $22,000 to help a school system establish a foundation. "The Northeast is the last untapped area, after the South."
Through money-raising efforts ranging from the raffling of a BMW automobile at one California school district to telethons like the one scheduled later this month in Lancaster, these foundations raise an average of $60,000 to $80,000 by their fourth year, Mr. Grounds said. Overhead expenses average about 5 percent because few of the foundations have large permanent staffs, he said.
As these foundations mature, they have taken up the slack in helping schools to improve curriculums, raise teacher salaries and award small grants to teachers who are testing pilot programs in the classroom. In some cases, foundations have helped finance the construction of new schools or enlarge existing ones.
 
Some Problems Seen
 But the growing popularity of these foundations has disconcerted some education finance experts. They assert that these organizations can upset efforts to equalize school spending between school districts rich in taxable property and poor school districts; that issue has provoked lawsuits in 22 states.
While no foundation has ever been legally challenged, the effect of their contributions on state formulas for supplying financial aid to school districts has been scrutinized by the California Department of Education, among others.
"It raises questions," said Joseph Remcho, a San Francisco lawyer who specializes in school financing issues. "If foundation contributions became exaggerated, they would have the potential to undermine the principle of equal educational opportunity."
Parents in poor school districts, like the Edgewood Independent School District in San Antonio, agree. One parent, Alexander M. Rodriquez, worries that if education foundations spread throughout the state they could upset a new state school financing plan that went into effect this fall that attempts to equalize the spending between rich and poor districts by forcing affluent systems to give up some of their money to poor districts.
"Rich districts could raise more money," said Mr. Rodriquez, who has a 10-year-old daughter and a 5-year-old son enrolled in the Edgewood system, which does not have an independent foundation to help it. "Edgewood would be at a disadvantage."
Mr. Remcho and others believe that in these perilous fiscal times for school systems any community support that helps preserve school programs should be encouraged.
Seizing on the idea, Lancaster citizens and school officials created their school foundation two years ago. The first year was spent organizing the foundation, establishing a wish list and convincing the citizenry in this city of 70,000 people that the idea was worth pursuing.
In its second year, the foundation now has results to show for its work. At J. P. McCaskey High School, for example, science teachers and students this fall have used a garden created last year and financed in part by the foundation for a variety of lessons.
When a blueberry patch failed, students studied the soil and discovered that it needed more acid to grow. The variety of leaves from plants in the garden has provided biology teachers with a rich source of subjects for the microscope.
"Actually looking at the leaves under the microscope is better than trying to explain it," said George Savitsky, a science teacher. "It just makes it easier."
The foundation uses the garden as example that not all projects need to be big-ticket items to have an effect. The garden, for instance, cost the foundation only $300, to buy various plants and other items. "Some trustees believe we should be further along," said Jane T. Pelland, the foundation's administrative assistant. "But no matter how small the project, kids can benefit."
 
A $350,000 Budget Item
 Other foundations, especially those in wealthy districts, can be major sources of money in their districts' annual budgets. The foundation serving the Beverly Hills Unified School District in California, for example, accounts for $350,000 of the district's annual budget.
"There is a myth that Beverly Hills doesn't need the money," said Linda Kinnee, executive director of the foundation. "This recession is affecting everyone."
That is why the Fort Lee school district in New Jersey is expected to create its own foundation in about two months. Recession-induced budget cuts have resulted in the elimination of foreign language classes in middle schools and counselors in elementary schools. Also scuttled because of the budget cuts was an advanced mathematics program for students.
"Under the circumstances, it has become quite clear to me that there needs to be some auxiliary source of funding to meet the needs of the district," said Alan W. Sugarman, the superintendent of the Fort Lee district, with 2,850 students. Given the way the California foundations helped school districts there cope with the recession and an anti-tax mood among voters, Mr. Sugarman said, he expects his school board to approve the creation of a foundation.
"Hard times," he said, "are here."

HEADLINE: THE THOMAS CONFIRMATION;
Senate's Futile Search for Safe Ground

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15

 BODY:
At the end of the bitter fight over Clarence Thomas, Senators sat quietly and listened to dignified speeches. They usually don't. Then, even more unusually, they listened to each other vote, wondering how other senators had decided the issue.
At its simplest political level, tonight's 52-to-48 vote to confirm Judge Thomas as a Supreme Court Justice was a search for safe political ground. But, despite the dignity of the last minutes, it was not a moment that is likely to do much to heal the self-induced doubts about the Senate and its confirmation process or to salve the anger of many Americans. 
 As individuals, a solid majority of senators had announced for Judge Thomas before last weekend's hearings on his former aide's accusation of sexual harassment. When the roll was called, with all their colleagues and a national television audience watching, three of them, all Democrats, admitted by switching their votes that they had found the record of that confrontation clear-cut and convincing. The rest stayed put.
Those switches, and the decisions of most unannouced senators to vote no produced a much lower, closer vote than the 60 or so expected a week ago when the vote was first scheduled. Close votes are sometimes exhilarating, but tonight even the victors showed little joy.
Indeed there were laments on all sides. Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the president pro tempore of the Senate and a classic defender of the institution, claimed it had yielded to "blatant intimidation" by Judge Thomas and the White House. Other senators saw other failings: indifference to women, unfairness to the judge, the Judiciary Committee letting down its senators. And before the end the debate was as raw as it gets, with two Republican Senators challenging Senator Edward M. Kennedy's role as a defender of women, one of them with an apparent reference to Chappaquidick that was later withdrawn.
 
Southerners Look Home
 All day long there were different tones and nuances in the floor debate. Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, who faces re-election in 1992, pressed ahead with his politically risky accusation of perjury against Anita F. Hill, Judge Thomas's accuser. Senator James Exon, Democrat of Nebraska, said he was simply not impressed by her explanations of why she continued working with him if she found his conduct as vulgar as she said. Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas, denounced the tactics used to discredit Professor Hill by the judge's backers in her own party, but said she stuck by her earlier decision to vote for him, having seen "no compelling reason to overturn that judgment."
But race was never far from the minds of the senators considering the second nomination of a black to be a Supreme Court Justice, and to succeed the first, Thurgood Marshall, the leading civil rights lawyer of his age.
Senator Kassebaum, Senator Byrd and Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, rejected Judge Thomas's claim that the hearings were "a high-tech lynching of uppity blacks." But whatever its merits, that phrase had underlined a main reason for Judge Thomas's confirmation, and Southern Democrats dependent on many black voters provided his margin of victory. None them switched their votes.
After the emotion of the hearings, votes loyal to the judge were easier to cast when one national poll after another found far more Americans, men and women alike, saying they believed Judge Thomas and not Professor Hill. The Senators, of course, are not just influenced by constituents. They are like them, too, glued to television sets, wondering about the clash of testimony of two intense, proud black Americans, and in the end finding her story harder to believe.
But those polls don't solve their political problems.
The hearings, which proved so damaging to the Senate's reputation, were conceived as an emergency, institutional defense against what Senator Kennedy called today the "tidal wave of anger among the women of America." Their anger grew out of the disclosure that the Senate had heard of the sexual harassment charges and done hardly anything to measure their truth or gravity.
 
Unabated Fury
 That "tidal wave" remains a political concern even if it represents a minority. Voters who are angry at politicians always have the potential to do them more harm than larger numbers who are satisfied. Moreover, the Democratic leadership knew that their angry feminist critics, usually their allies, are organized, articulate and political.
And that anger is not slaked. Perhaps nothing but the defeat of Judge Thomas would have put an end to it. But the hearings themselves deepened that anger among many women.
Nan Aron, executive director of the Alliance for Justice, one of the groups that fought hardest against the nomination, said after the vote that Judge Thomas won "because the Democrats were wimps -- they let the Republicans destroy Anita Hill."
Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, told her colleagues that the "backers and the handlers" of the nominee wanted nothing but "to win at all costs." She said the Senate sent the message to women that if they come forward with sexual harassment complaints "your courage in coming forward will be met with suspicion and scorn, with unproven unsupported charges about you being mentally unbalanced."
Some of those attacks were renewed on the Senate floor today. Senator Specter made his perjury argument. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, assailed the witnesses who testifed on Sunday that Professor Hill had told them of being sexually harassed at work. He said they were not "corroborating witnesses," as most had seen them, but "collaborating witnesses, collaborating with the special interest groups that pounced on Anita Hill and her story in their effort to assassinate the character and integrity of Clarence Thomas."
Many Republicans, seeking the votes of those women outraged at the treatment of Professor Hill, avoided that approach and chose instead to concentrate on praising Judge Thomas.
Senator Kassebaum said she had "no intention of being a party to an intellectual witch hunt against Professor Hill." She made it clear that she found no evidence that the accuser was "mentally unstable, is inclined to wild fantasy, or is part of a decade-long conspiracy to get Clarence Thomas."
The Senate got to this bitter point only a week ago, when its initial arguments for inaction -- that the process had already gone on too long or that new hearings would never prove truth or falsity -- impressed hardly anyone.
But even though the senators thought they were overcoming the specter of white males indifferent to the plight of a black female by holding new hearings, they may have only deepened the initial dilemma while creating another problem, revealing to Americans who ordinarily watch ball games or soap operas that the Senate could be as feeble when it mattered as the Toronto Blue Jays.
Judge Thomas and his White House allies saw to it that the Judiciary Committee did not find an easy way to get off the defensive. The deferential, conciliatory nominee of September was replaced by an intense, angry man who said he didn't care if he got the job or not and who attacked the Senate, its committee and the process it oversees even harder than he attacked Professor Hill.
He scowled and lectured through Saturday, in a manner that probably would have insured his rejection a quarter century ago.
The hearings seemed repetitive and nitpicking. The Senate's television image, so high when it debated the war with Iraq 10 months ago, was shabby.
For every occasion when a Senator seemed to be pressing to understand the truth, there were two or three more when a lawmaker came across as a self-important windbag. When the Senators squabbled over procedure, recessed endlessly, or took 15 minutes to complete 5 minutes of questioning, the American people were seeing the Senate the way it is far more often than they way it was at 6 P.M. tonight.

Chart: "Other Contested Supreme Court Appointments in This Century"
 
Louis D. Brandeis, 1916
 President Woodrow Wilson nominated Brandeis, a renowned legal champion of the redress of economic and political inequities, who had detractors in many segments of the business community. The first Jew to be nominated for the Supreme Court, Brandeis was seen by his foes either as a dangerous radical who would destory institutions or as a dreamer who subordinated the Constitution to preconceived notion. After months of debate, the Judiciary Committee turned up no valid grounds for rejection and he was confirmed by a vote of 47 to 22 in the Senate.
 
John J. Parker, 1930
 President Herbert Hoover nominatet Federal Judge Parker of NOrth Carolina, who had a reputation for antilabor, conservative decisions. A labor-led campaign to reject Parker was based partly on an objection to the highly conservative, antilabor majority already on the Court. Civil rights groups opposed his nomination and brought out statements of racial bias made by the nominee when he ran for governor of North Carolina. He was rejected, 41 to 39, by the Senate, with progressive Northern Republicans joining the opposition to the Republican President's choice.
 
Hugo L. Black, 1937
 A Senator from Alabama, Black was a passionate partisan of the New Deal when President Franklin D. Roosevelt nominated him in 1937. During the confirmation debate there was talk that he might have been a member of the Ku Klux Klan. His supporters denied it; he said nothing. He was confirmed in five days by a vote of 63 to 16, but then a storm broke. Newspapers printed the story that he had once been a member of the Klan. He was denounced as a racist and there were demands for his resignation. The new Justice made a nationwide radio address in which he said that he had belonged to the Klan only briefly and had no racial or religious prejudice.
 
Abe Fortas, 1968
President Lyndon B. Johnson nominated Associated Justice Fortas to fill the seat of retiring Chief Justice Earl Warren. The nomination was reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee and was late September before debate began on the Senate floor. Justice Fortas was criticized for his liberal opinions while a Justice, his continuing practice of advising President Johnson on policy matters, and for what a number of senators viewed as excesses of the Warren Court. When his supporters in the partisan and often bitter debate, failed to end a filibuster, Justice Fortas asked that his name be withdrawn.
 
Homer Thonrberry, 1968
 At the same time that President Johnson nominated Justice Fortas as Chief Justice, he named Judge Thornberry to fill the vacancy that Justice Fortas's promotion would create. Judge Thornberry was an old friend of the President, who had named him a Federal district judge and then appointed him to a Court of Appeals. When his promotion to the Supreme Court was proposed, the question of "cronyism" arose, but the matter became moot when Justice Fortas withdrew. When Richard M. Nixon became President the next year, he appointed Warren E. burger as Chief Justice.
 
Clement F. Haynsworth, 1969
 President Richard M. Nixon nominated Judge Haynsworth, who met the Presiden't specifications as a jurist with a conservative judicial bent. The chief jduge of the Fourth Circuit, he was also a judge of some distinction, and at first the Senate seemed disposed to confirm him. But during the confirmation hearings as he was attacked as antilabor, called a "laundered segregationist" and accused of "ethical insensitivity" because he ruled insome cases in which he had a small stake though stock holdings. He was rejected by the Senate by a vote of 55 to 45.
 
C. Harrold Carswell, 1970
 After Judge Haynsworth was rejected, President Nixon nominated Judge Carswell. Mr. Carswell was a little-known and little-distinguished judge with six months of experience on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. During his tenure as a Federal judge, he compiled an almost unequaled record for being reversed by higher courts, and earned a reputation for shallow and dubious rulings. Doubts were also raised about his objectivity in racial matters and his civil rights record. The Senate rejected the nomination 51 to 45.
 
William H. Rehnquist, 1986
 President Ronald Reagan nominated Associated Justice Rehnquist to fill the seat of retiring Chief Justice Warren E. Burger. Opponents questioned his judicial ethics, his candor and integrity, and his record on civil rights, including whether as a young Republican Party worker in Phoenix in the early 1960's he had intimidated minority voters at polling places. The Senate confirmed the nomination to 65 to 33.
 
Robert H. Bork, 1987
 President Reagan nominated Circuit Court Judge Bork in 1987 to replace Justice Lewis F. Powell, who was knows as a "swing vote" on the Court. Judge Bork was acknowledged to be profesisonally qualified, and his judicial philosophy was clear enough even as its merits were hotly debated. His opponents succeeded in framing two questions that proved fatal to his nomination: whether he would "turn back the clock" on civil rights and other pressing social issues, and whether he was "out of the mainstream" of modern legal thought. He was rejected by the Senatae by a vote of 58 to 42.
 
Douglas H. Ginsburg, 1987
 After the Bork nomination failed, President Reagan announced his intention to nominate Circuit Court Judge Ginsburg. Nine days after he was chosen, Judge Ginsburg asked that his name be withdrawn. He acted after several disclosures about his personal and ethical conduct stirred a storm of criticism. He admitted that that he had smoked marijuana. Questions wre also raised about his truthfulness regarding a form h had filled out when nominated to the Federal appeals court, and ethical concerns wre voiced about his action as a Justice Department official in handling a cable television case when he held stock in a cable company.

HEADLINE: Review/Cabaret;
Curmudgeonly Reminiscing In Oscar Levant Impression

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
Barbed epigrams fly from the stage of Michael's Pub (211 East 55th Street), where the pianist and composer Stan Freeman is portraying Oscar Levant in his one-man show, "At Wit's End."
"I am a deeply superficial person," he announces early in the evening. The only difference between the Democrats and Republicans, he asserts a little later, is that "the Democrats allow the poor to be corrupt, too." "Integrity is a lofty attitude assumed by someone who is unemployed," he declares further on. As nasty about others as he is about himself, he recollects taking Elsa Maxwell to a Halloween party and ripping off her mask "to find I had beheaded her." His first embrace with Judy Garland, he speculates, "may well be the greatest moment in pharmaceutical history." 
 The stream of self-deprecating remarks and insults is the glue that holds together a highly entertaining two-act, two-hour portrait of the pianist, composer, actor, television personality and professional neurotic who died in 1972. The show, which plays at Michael's Pub through Nov. 3, was written by Joel Kimmel and directed by Barbara Karp. It presents an imagined 1950's Levant concert performance in which he aphoristically reviews his life and times, directs occasional remarks offstage to his wife, June, and plays the piano. The numbers range from Falla's "Ritual Fire Dance" to Levant songs like "Blame It on My Youth" and "Wacky Dust" to several selections by Levant's hero, George Gershwin.
If the recollections are amusing, they are somewhat helter-skelter. The opening anecdotes recall Levant's days on the radio show "Information Please" and move ahead to the late 50's, when he became seriously addicted to painkillers and was hospitalized several times. His childhood and early Hollywood experiences are covered in the second act.
Mr. Freeman doesn't attempt an exact impersonation of his subject. The character he creates is a debonair sophisticate whose airs suggest an American Robert Morley with the soul of a Woody Allen character run amok. The show's tenderest moments are devoted to Levant's memories of Gershwin, whom he regarded with "undiluted idolatry." In the decades after the composer's death in 1937, Levant became the foremost interpreter of Gershwin's piano music and a crucial keeper of the flame.
The bilious undertone of much of the dialogue is balanced by Mr. Freeman's interpretations of Gershwin preludes, a lushly ornate "Somebody Loves Me," and especially "Rhapsody in Blue," which closes the show. His solo version of the Gershwin classic has a vigor and passion that echo Levant's own memorable interpretation.

HEADLINE: Stranding the Jobless

 BODY:
President Bush vetoed the Democrats' bill to aid the long-term jobless because it wouldn't pay for itself. Yet the Republican proposals he prefers are a sham. They help too few people and depend on gimmicks that waste future revenue.
More than three million of the nation's eight million jobless are collecting unemployment insurance. New claims have mounted slowly but steadily. Mr. Bush has made much of his measures to boost the economy by easing credit. But he ignores the depressing effects of job insecurity. People don't spend when they fear being laid off. 
 The vetoed bill and two Republican bills all offer added benefits to workers who exhaust, or have exhausted, the basic 26-week maximum. The Democrats' $6.5 billion bill offered up to 20 weeks more. The Republicans propose a maximum of 10 more weeks in one bill, for $3.5 billion, or up to 15 more in the other, for $3.9 billion.
All three bills would aid workers whose benefits expire in months to come, if they work in states where the unemployment rate exceeds a specified level. But Democrats and Republicans are far apart on helping idle workers who have already exhausted the basic entitlement. The Democrats would have helped more than a million in 34 states; the Republicans, with a much tighter formula, would help only 200,000 in six states and Puerto Rico.
The other big difference is financing. The Democrats' bill has none; it would add to the deficit and to the Federal debt. That's forbidden by last year's budget pact between Congress and Mr. Bush, except in undefined emergencies.
The Democrats argue that the distress of the long-term unemployed warrants emergency treatment, no less than the emergency aid that went to Iraq's Kurds. Mr. Bush says he wants to help the unemployed but must also protect all taxpayers. Thus he rejects new deficit spending. But he's wrong to think the Republican approach protects taxpayers. It avoids new taxes or more borrowing now, but it robs the future.
Some of the Republican financing comes from student loan delinquencies. Washington already duns delinquents by deducting their debts if they claim tax refunds. Authority for this expires in 1994. The Republicans want the authority renewed now, so that future collections can be counted on the 1992 books. Federal budget accounting may tolerate such trickery, but it's still trickery.
The bulk of the Republicans' revenue scheme rests on a fire sale of unused radio frequencies. Mr. Bush has proposed an auction starting in 1994. To rush it through in the next 12 months is throwing money away. The Congressional Budget Office estimates a quick selloff could yield as much as $2 billion but that a properly managed sale later could yield up to $4.5 billion.
The Democrats are rightly concerned. But even though Communism's collapse has invalidated last year's assumptions, the budget pact still stands, giving Mr. Bush a reason to veto.
Voting to override the veto is expected today. If the President prevails, the wisest, most honest course would be to pay for extended benefits with a higher tax on employers. But given that 1992 is an election year, that's not likely. What is likely is that the losers will be America's jobless.

HEADLINE: Family Leave Makes Economic Sense Too

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Family Leave: Fine, in Modest Doses" (editorial, Sept. 26) falls far short of the kind of support this important legislation deserves. You miss the fundamental truth about family-leave policy, which is that it makes both human sense for today's working families and economic sense for American business. 
 We have to stop talking about "cost" in dollars and cents only and recognize the social costs when we make people choose between caring for very young children or sick relatives and their jobs. Employers must recognize that money spent on family leave is an investment in the stability of their current work force and the nurture of their future work force.
If we look at recent experience with government mandates for unpaid parental leave on the state level, as a recent study by the Families and Work Institute in New York did, there is no evidence to support your gloomy predictions of job loss and wage suppression. There is, however, increasing data on the erosion of America's stature as a leading player in the world marketplace. American companies will not be able to compete in the global economy of the 21st century if they nickel-and-dime young children and their families in the 1990's.
Our businesses and our Government need to join all the other industrialized countries around the world (with the exception of South Africa) and adopt a national family-leave policy. If President Bush can take leadership in nuclear arms reduction, surely he can also reduce the stress on millions of American working families.

HEADLINE: $508.5 Million Loss at Security Pacific

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
Like Citicorp, the Security Pacific Corporation yesterday reported a stunning third-quarter loss and said it was suspending its dividend because of large real estate loan problems.
The announcement came on a day when the nation's other large banks -- including Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover -- issued third-quarter earnings indicating that for them the rapid rise in troubled loans appears to be leveling off. 
 Security Pacific, which is about to be merged with the BankAmerica Corporation, reported a loss of $508.5 million, after taking a $1.2 billion provision for future losses on bad loans. That the Los Angeles-based Security Pacific would increase its reserve for bad loans had been anticipated by analysts in light of the merger, but the size of the reserve was larger than expected.
Also in California, Wells Fargo & Company reported a drop in profits to $86 million, about half its earnings in the 1990 third quarter, because of higher problem loans.
"West Coast banks are catching up to the problems that have visited other parts of the country over the last few years," said James J. McDermott Jr. of the bank analysis firm of Keefe Bruyette & Woods. "The industry profile suggests stabilization. But there will be episodic outbreaks of new problems."
 
Improvement for Some
 On the East Coast and in the Midwest, however, banks that last year reported staggering real estate losses appear now to have begun to put these problems behind them. This is a sign, analysts say, that the end of the recession is beginning to be felt at some of the nation's largest banks. Earnings at many of these banks were also helped by strong trading profits.
Despite these positive trends, the industry has yet to rebound fully. Even at strong banks, earnings were tempered by slow loan growth, continued high loan losses and higher premiums paid to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation fund that protects depositors in bank failures.
"The signals are that we are getting fairly close to the end of the recession, and earnings are better than expected," said Ronald I. Mandle, a bank analyst at Sanford Bernstein & Company. "With the end of the recession and the fact that regulators have forced banks to recognize problem loans more quickly, nonperforming loans should be nearing their peak and should begin to decline."
Following are details of the companies' results:
 
Security Pacific
 Security Pacific's $508.5 million loss compared with profits of $135.3 million, or $1.05 a share, in the comparable period last year. The bank, California's second largest, announced plans in August to be acquired by BankAmerica, the state's biggest banking company and second largest in the nation, in a $4 billion stock merger. Both companies said yesterday that the merger, scheduled to be completed by the end of the year, would not be affected by this large loss.
Security Pacific also said that "it is anticipated" that the suspended quarterly dividend of 38 cents a share would be restored after the BankAmerica merger when Security Pacific common stock would be converted to BankAmerica stock.
Robert H. Smith, Security Pacific's chief executive, said the large loan-loss reserve "reflects current and anticipated adverse economic conditions." And he said he expects that loan losses will "remain at high levels" through the rest of the year.
Much of Security Pacific's loan problems are a result of bad real estate loans, a particular problem in California.
The $1.2 billion loan-loss provision was $965.6 million more than the loan-loss provision taken in the 1990 third quarter. It brings the total reserve for future bad loans to $2.3 billion. Charge-offs for bad loans in the 1991 third quarter came to $392.6 million, compared with $204.3 million in the 1990 third quarter.
Campbell K. Chaney, a bank analyst at Sutro & Company, suggested that the large loss might cause BankAmerica to change the terms of the merger. But Peter Mangnani, a BankAmerica spokesman, said there was no provision in the merger agreement that would allow for such a change.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Security Pacific's stock rose $1.325 a share, to $32.50, as investors apparently were encouraged by the measures taken by the bank to position itself for the merger.
 
Wells Fargo
 Wells Fargo's earnings of $86 million, or $1.59 a share, were down 47 percent from a 1990 third-quarter profit of $163 million, or $3.03 a share. The drop was attributed to a large increase in the loan-loss reserve and more write-offs at the San Francisco-based bank, California's third largest.
The provisions for anticipated loan losses increased to $350 million in the quarter, compared with $200 million in the 1990 quarter. And more bad loans were written off in the latest quarter: $123 million compared with $46 million in the 1990 quarter.
The total amount of troubled loans in the quarter came to $2.2 billion, compared with $1.2 billion in the 1990 period. This includes foreclosed real estate that is now owned by the bank.
"Earnings at Wells Fargo were lower than I had anticipated," said Mr. Mandle of Sanford Bernstein. "I was looking more for a loan loss of $150 million and a lower rise in nonperforming assets, say to $200 million to $225 million. Most of their problems were real estate-related."
Wells Fargo shares rose $3.875 each on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $71.25.
 
Chemical
 Earnings at the Chemical Banking Corporation were $131.6 million, or $1.22 a share, compared with a loss of $43.7 million in the third quarter last year that was attributed to a large loan-loss provision.
The earnings in the recent quarter were aided by record profits of $34.7 million from Chemical's Texas Commerce Bancshares subsidiary. In addition, third-quarter trading profits at Chemical reached $77 million, a record high.
Total nonperforming assets, which include bad loans and foreclosed real estate, were $3.4 billion, a slight increase from the 1990 third quarter. Chemical's reserve for bad loans decreased to $1.9 billion, from $2.2 billion in the 1990 third quarter, and the latest provision for bad loans decreased to $145 million, from $250 million in the 1990 third quarter.
Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover said in July that they planned to merge to speed their recovery from loan losses. Both have been severely weakened in recent years by bad loans, mostly in real estate at Chemical and to developing nations at Manufacturers.
Chemical's stock gained $1.75 yesterday, to close at $26.125 on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Manufacturers Hanover
 At Manufacturers Hanover, third-quarter earnings were $77 million, the same as in the 1990 third quarter. Trading-account profits reached $81 million, compared with $34 million in the 1990 third quarter.
Total nonperforming loans increased only slightly from the year earlier, to $3.2 billion. At the same time, the reserve for future loan losses decreased slightly, to $1.8 billion, while loan charge-offs, excluding third world debt, totaled $168 million, nearly double the level of the 1990 third quarter and up from $142 million in the second quarter of 1991.
Manufacturers stock rose $1.875 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $29.25.
 
Banc One
 In the Midwest, the Banc One Corporation, based in Columbus, Ohio, reported record third-quarter earnings of $133.9 million, or 81 cents a share, up 22.8 percent from $109 million, or 68 cents a share, in the 1990 quarter.
An increase in retail loans brought an increase in the bank's net interest margin, the spread between what it pays for funds and what it earns on loans, to 6.13 percent. In the 1990 quarter, the margin was 5.28 percent.
The bank reported a slight increase in its problem loans and provisions for loan losses. Its total nonperforming loans rose to $513 million, from $405 million in the 1990 third quarter, although write-offs rose modestly, from $66.6 million, to $73.5 million in the quarter last year.
The reserve for future bad loans increased by 12 percent from the 1990 third quarter, to $85.5 million, but fell slightly from the amount set aside in the 1991 second quarter.
Banc One shares gained 37.5 cents each, closing at $44.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
First Chicago
 Earnings at the First Chicago Corporation fell 32 percent, to $24.6 million, or 19 cents a share, in the quarter, from $36.2 million, or 45 cents a share, in the 1990 period.
Earnings were hurt by a $35 million restructuring charge, which included layoffs, and an increase to $40 million in expenses associated with foreclosed real estate. Trading profits at First Chicago, however, rose to $30 million, from $2 million in the 1990 third quarter.
In anticipation of a drop in future loan problems, the bank set aside $105 million in reserves for future bad loans, compared with $155 million set aside in the 1990 third quarter.
First Chicago's shares rose $1 each on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $25.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 17, 1991, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about the third-quarter earnings of a number of large banks misstated the provision for loan losses at Wells Fargo & Company in the latest quarter and a year ago. It was $200 million in this year's third quarter and $75 million in the 1990 third quarter; a provision of $350 million was taken in the 1991 second quarter.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Money-Fund Yields Continue to Decline

DATELINE: ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields of both tax-exempt and taxable money funds continued to decline in the week ended yesterday, according to IBC/Donoghue's, which monitors the funds and issues The Money Fund Report.
Walter S. Frank, chief economist for IBC/Donoghue's, reported that total assets of tax-exempt funds rose by $495 million in the last week, to $89.7 billion, a modest increase coming after a $2.9 billion surge of buying the previous week. 
 "The huge inflow of a week ago put some pressure on municipal bond fund yields," he said. "I would expect that if yield declines continue we will see some drying up of the inflow." He also said that "there is some seasonal effect involved in the huge total inflow of the past two weeks."
The maturity of portfolio holdings of the tax-exempt funds rose to an average of 62 days, up from 60 days, he reported, explaining that the fund managers were reaching out for longer maturities to bolster the yields.
The seven-day compound average yield for the tax-exempt funds dropped from 4.23 percent to 3.93 percent, while the seven-day simple yield declined from 4.14 to 3.86 percent.
In the 30-day period, the compound yield dropped from 4.35 percent to 4.28 percent, and the simple yield dropped from 4.26 percent to 4.19 percent.
The highest-yielding fund among those with assets over $100 million continued to be the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund, with a seven-day compound yield of 5 percent, down from 5.22 the previous week.
Among funds investing in New York State securities, Salomon Brothers New York Municipal Money Market continued to head the list with the highest seven-day compound yield of 4.75 percent, down from 4.95 percent.
There was a tie between the Dreyfus Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund, with a yield of 4.22 percent, compared with 4.5 percent last week, and the Fidelity Spartan Connecticut Municipal Fund, also yielding 4.22 percent. A week ago it yielded 4.39 percent.
The leader in New Jersey funds again was Calvert N.J. Tax Free Reserves, reporting a seven-day compound yield of 4.5 percent, declining from 4.89 percent the previous week.
Assets of the taxable funds rose by only $87 million, to $461.3 billion, with most of the rise coming from individual investors. The funds showed a $220 million outflow of institutional money.
Average maturities of portfolio holdings of the taxable funds moved up by one day, to 63 from 62.
 
Taxable fund Yields
 Among the taxable funds, the average seven-day compound yield dropped to 5.14 percent from 5.21 percent, and the simple yield dropped to 5.02 percent from 5.08 percent.
The 30-day compound yield dropped to 5.25 percent from 5.29 percent and the 30-day simple yield was down to 5.12 percent, from the 5.16 percent yield a week ago.
The taxable fund with the best return continued to be Riverside Capital Money Market Fund, with a seven-day compound yield of 6.34 percent, up from 6.32 percent, possibly because of capital gains or stretched-out maturities.
By comparison, bank money market accounts, a main competitor of money funds, dropped to a yield of 4.98 percent, from 5 percent, according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Closes Mostly Lower As Traders Await Reports

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mostly lower yesterday in lackluster trading on world currency markets.
Gold prices advanced after settling lower in foreign markets. On the New York Commodity Exchange, bullion for current delivery settled at $358.20 an ounce, up 50 cents from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank said gold gained 85 cents an ounce, to $357.70. 
 Analysts said trading was extremely light as investors stepped aside ahead of today's release of fresh economic data. The Government is scheduled to report on consumer prices and industrial production for September. Merchandise trade figures for July are also scheduled to be announced.
"It was an extremely quiet day," said Robert Hatcher, a corporate dealer at Barclays Bank P.L.C. "The market was kind of marking time waiting for the economic numbers."
 
Watching Price Index
 Traders are expected to key in on the Consumer Price Index, which will give an indication as to whether inflation is being held at bay.
"If inflation is tame, the market will anticipate a Fed easing," Mr. Hatcher said. Low inflation enhances the chance that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates to stimulate the economy.
Low interest rates are generally bearish for the dollar because they decrease the value of dollar-denominated securities.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 130.02 yen, from 129.72 yen on Tuesday. Later in London, it fell to 129.95 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 130.10 yen, unchanged from Tuesday.
In London, the pound fell to $1.7105, from $1.7115 late Tuesday. In New York it cost $1.7070 to buy one pound, more expensive than Tuesday's $1.7005.

HEADLINE: COMPANY EARNINGS;
Philip Morris Climbed 20.6% in 3d Quarter

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
The Philip Morris Companies announced a 20.6 percent rise in third-quarter earnings yesterday, based on the strong growth of its cigarette sales abroad and the sound performance of its food products.
The results were marred only by a decline in its Miller Brewing Company. The company spent heavily on marketing a number of its beer brands, including Miller Genuine Draft, Sharp's and Milwaukee's Best. 
 Earnings at the world's largest cigarette company rose in the latest quarter to $1.13 billion, or $1.22 a share, from $937 million, or $1.01 a share, in the third quarter last year. The gains came as Philip Morris increased its presence in the fast-growing world cigarette market and increased its share of the domestic cigarette market, with brands like Marlboro, Benson and Hedges and Virginia Slims and Bucks, a lower-priced brand. The growth came even as the domestic cigarette market is shrinking.
Most analysts described Philip Morris's report as uplifting news for the company, which is attempting to expand its food and tobacco business to new and growing markets overseas.
The earnings came on operating revenues for the third quarter of $13.77 billion, an increase of 7.4 percent over the $12.82 billion reported in the corresponding quarter in 1990. For the first nine months of 1991 operating revenues were $42.76 billion, up 15.7 percent, from $36.95 billion in the period last year.
"Despite a recessionary trend in the U.S. and a general weakening of the economy in certain foreign countries," said Michael A. Miles, Philip Morris's chairman and chief executive, "the company's results for the quarter and year to date reflect the strength and depth of our domestic and international consumer brands."
In the tobacco arena, revenues for Philip Morris USA rose 12 percent, to $2.8 billion from $2.5 billion. With more than 47 percent of Philip Morris's income coming from the domestic tobacco business, analysts looked favorably on an overall increase in its domestic unit sales of eight-tenths of 1 percent. Industrywide, unit sales declined 1.8 percent during the quarter.
Philip Morris USA recently introduced Marlboro Medium cigarettes, as well as lower-priced brands to continue its growth of market share.
"Their ability to grow in a declining category is impressive," said John McMillin, an analyst with Prudential. " They are increasing their presence in value-added brands and they are shifting their emphasis overseas, where there is plenty of room for growth."
Philip Morris's cigarette revenues outside the United States and Canada increased 10.4 percent, to slightly more than $3 billion in the quarter, from $2.7 billion in the third quarter of 1990. Profits abroad rose 20.4 percent, to $501 million, from $416 million the year before. Volume of unit sales increased 11.6 percent in the third quarter.
Analysts also noted a strong performance for the company's Kraft General Foods International, with products like Toblerone chocolate, Kraft mayonnaise and Tang. Revenues rose 12.6 percent, to more than $1.7 billion from $1.5 billion.
Domestically, however, operating revenues were flat, compared with an income increase of 8.4 percent over last year. Analysts attributed slack food sales in North America to consumers' concerns about the economy and their shift to less expensive cheese and meat products and to store brands.
The Miller Brewing Company reported a decline in income of 4.8 percent in the third quarter, to $99 million from $104 million, although revenues increased by 17.7 percent, to $1.1 billion, from less than $964 million in the third quarter of 1990.
Despite the generally good earnings report, the company's stock slipped 50 cents, to $73.50 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange. One analyst called the decline "a mystery."

Coca-Cola Profit Up 15.8% On Strong Overseas Sales

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
Bolstered by strong sales overseas, the Coca-Cola Company said yesterday, profits rose 15.8 percent in the third quarter.
Earnings rose to $456.3 million, or 69 cents a share, it said, compared with $394.1 million, or 58 cents a share, a year earlier, while sales increased 13.6 percent, to $3.17 billion, from $2.79 billion a year ago. 
 Robert C. Goizueta, chairman and chief executive of Coca-Cola, said that the earnings growth was "particularly rewarding, given the tough economic environments in some key international markets and in the U.S."
Internationally, sales to retail customers increased 8 percent, and sales of flavoring to bottlers increased by 6 percent.
Martin Romm, an analyst at First Boston, said, "Their international business, which really is the driving force behind Coca-Cola's earning performance, continues to be fairly strong."
The international market accounts for 80 percent of Coca-Cola's operating profits, and the company has been investing heavily in building its international distribution system.
Coke's results were in line with expectations, and the company's stock fell 37.5 cents yesterday, to $62.875, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Sales Climb 20% in Germany
 Retail sales climbed 20 percent in Germany, fueled by new business from the eastern region. In France, retail sales grew by 17 percent, and in Italy 10 percent. But in Britain, retail sales declined 8 percent.
George E. Thompson, an analyst with Prudential Securities, said the "great thing" about Coke's far-flung empire was that subpar performance in one country could be counterbalanced by strong performance in another.
In Japan, which produces more operating income for Coke than the United States, flavoring sales to bottlers increased by 17 percent in the quarter. Retail sales were up only 2 percent, which Coke attributed to heavy rains caused by several typhoons.
Mr. Romm of First Boston said that the once-lagging Latin American market was beginning to show strong volume and profit growth for Coca-Cola. Retail sales grew 11 percent in Latin America in the quarter, with flavoring sales to bottlers up 6 percent. Retail sales in Argentina grew by 23 percent.
For the company as a whole, soft drink sales increased by 5 percent during the quarter.
In contrast to the strong international performance, sales were sluggish in the United States, which Coke attributed to the soft economy. Retail sales in the United States increased by less than 1 percent during the quarter. Sales of Coke flavoring to bottlers increased by 1.5 percent.
"In a business that is seemingly immune to a recessionary environment, there has been some impact," said Mr. Thompson, the Prudential analyst. "That gives you an idea of the impact of the recession."
Yesterday, the company took additional steps to expand overseas, announcing that it had formed a joint bottling venture in the Ukraine, called Rosinka, Coca-Cola Bottling. Mr. Goizueta, Coke's chairman, said the Ukraine represented a market of 50 million new consumers.
The announcement of such international ventures is "going to be a continuing event," Mr. Thompson of Prudential said.

McGraw-Hill Profits Down

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
McGraw-Hill Inc. said yesterday that third-quarter earnings dropped 18.2 percent because of the soft advertising market.
The New York-based publishing conglomerate said earnings in the three months ended Sept. 30 were $55.1 million, or $1.13 a share, down from $67.4 million, or $1.38 a share, for the period a year earlier. Revenue totaled $489.5 million, down from $502.8 million a year earlier. 
 Joseph L. Dionne, the chairman of McGraw-Hill, said in a statement that "the economic recovery remains invisible to many of our customers and spending restraints are still the norm for U.S. business."
McGraw-Hill's trade magazines and broadcasting operations were hurt by lower ad volume, while the domestic and overseas textbook divisions suffered from reduced financing for schools.
Only McGraw-Hill's financial news services unit and Standard & Poor's Ratings Group reported gains in operating profits.

Georgia-Pacific Posts Loss, Citing Depressed Markets

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The Georgia-Pacific Corporation, citing a downturn in the market for pulp and paper and building products, reported a net loss yesterday of $27 million for the third quarter.
In the comparable period last year the company, the nation's largest paper producer, earned $95 million, or $1.11 a share. 
 Like others in the paper industry, Georgia-Pacific is suffering from sagging prices for a number of products. Also, analysts attribute the company's problems, in part, to its acquisition of the Great Northern Nekoosa Corporation last year. Great Northern had a siginificnt share of its business in many of the products that have been affected by the recession.
 
Several Depressed Markets
 "Business conditions continue to reflect depressed markets in both pulp and paper and building products," said T. Marshall Hahn Jr., the company's chairman and chief executive.
Analysts said the Atlanta-based company was affected by price weakness in a number of areas. For exmple, prices for linerboard, the material used for making boxed and packaging materials, have declined 18 percent from the corresponding period last year. And market pulp prices have tumbled by about 30 percent from the 1990 period.
Georgia-Pacific's sales declined to $2.97 billion in the third quarter, compared with sales of $3.43 billion in the comparable period last year.
The company reported operating profits of $72 million in its pulp and paper division, compared with operating earnings of $279 million in the period in 1990. For the building products division, Georgia-Pacific said its operating profits increased to $130 million, compared with $111 million in the third quarter last year.
"The hope for the company is that linerboard appeared to have bottomed," said Sherman Chao, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. "Also, there are announcements for price increases for uncoated free sheet," the material used for copier- and computer-printer paper.
 
Future Problems Seen
 Still, Mr. Chao said, the fourth quarter was likely to be worse than the third. That forecast was endorsed by Mr. Hahn, who said he was "not overly optimistic" about the prospects for that business for the rest of the year.
Georgia-Pacific's stock rose $1.25 yesterday to close at $56.375 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts said the stock action was related to a general upward movement in the market.

Profit Off at 2 Baby Bells; United Telecom Net Up

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
A stagnant economy took its toll on third-quarter earnings reported yesterday by three telephone companies, setting a pattern for the industry that is in line with Wall Street expectations.
The Pacific Telesis Group and Ameritech, the first two "Baby Bells" to report, had slight declines in net income from normal operations. 
 United Telecommunications Inc., which owns U S Sprint, the nation's third-largest long-distance company, reported a modest gain. Declines in local telephone operations partly offset relatively strong growth in long-distance operating income. But United Telecom's revenue growth looked weak compared with the previous quarter, and the company warned that its fourth-quarter operating earnings would be about the same as its third-quarter results.
Following are the details of the companies' results:
 
Ameritech
 Ameritech said its net income from operations declined 1.7 percent, to $305.8 million in the third quarter, from $311.2 million a year ago. Including a special gain of $73.6 million from the sale of the company's interest in the Telecom Corporation of New Zealand in an initial public offering, Ameritech's net jumped 21.9 percent from last year's comparable period, to $379.4 million, or $1.43 a share.
Ameritech's revenue edged up 1.5 percent, to $2.71 billion in the quarter, from $2.67 billion a year earlier. The Chicago-based company said that return on equity climbed to 18.7 percent, from 16.2 percent a year ago.
Customer telephone lines in service edged up 1.7 percent from last year's third quarter, to nearly 16.5 million. But the number of mobile phone customers grew more rapidly, to 424,000, up 50 percent from last year's period.
The company's shares slipped 12.5 cents to close at $60.625 today on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Pacific Telesis
 Pacific Telesis said its net income for the third quarter fell 3.5 percent, to $275 million, or 70 cents a share, from $285 million, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier. Earnings were down even though revenue edged up 1.2 percent, to $2.50 billion from $2.47 billion.
"Telesis earnings are reflecting the continuing weakness in the economy and the restructuring taking place in our industry," said Sam Ginn, chairman and chief executive of the San Francisco-based company.
Pacific Bell, the Telesis subsidiary that provides basic service in California, earned $263 million, a 6 percent decline from the comparable three months in 1990, although revenue grew 1.6 percent, to $2.24 billion.
The figures for the company's cellular subsidiary were positive, although modest by historic standards. Net income was up $1 million, or 4.8 percent, compared with $22 million a year earlier, despite a 31.6 percent increase in the number of subscribers to 512,000. Cellular revenue rose to $151 million, from $122 million in last year's period.
The company's shares were down 37.5 cents to close at $41 in today's trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
United Telecom
 United Telecom's net income rose 7.9 percent, to $96.8 million, or 44 cents a share, from $89.7 million, or 41 cents a share, in the third quarter of 1990. Revenue rose 5.2 percent, to $2.21 billion from $2.10 billion.
U S Sprint was the bright spot, said William T. Esrey, chairman and chief executive of the Kansas City-based company. The long-distance unit's operating income climbed 67 percent, to $90 million, from $54 million a year ago.
Analysts were less impressed than might have been expected, however, saying that Sprint had achieved the gains through strict cost controls that had hampered its ability to compete for new customers with A.T.& T. and MCI, the two larger companies in the long-distance market.
Mr. Esrey said that Sprint would be increasing its marketing outlays in the current quarter, which would probably put a halt to the company's string of gains in operating earnings gains.
United Telecom's local phone companies, which serve 3,000 communities in 17 states, earned $159 million in the quarter, down 5.9 percent from $169 million a year ago. Revenues for the units rose 4.4 percent, to $709 million from $679 million.
The company's stock declined 12.5 cents, to $23, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
A Shake-Up Of Licensees In British TV

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
The biggest shake-up in the 36-year history of British commercial television occurred today, when a Government-appointed commission announced that four leading companies had lost their licenses in the country's first auction of television franchises.
Three American companies -- Disney, NBC and Home Box Office -- were members of some of the 40 groups bidding for what is called here the national breakfast franchise and 15 regional franchises, whose advertising revenues last year totaled 1.67 billion, or about $3.22 billion. The breakfast slot is one of the most coveted franchises, presenting morning news and interviews. 
 The auction was a result of legislation passed last year that was aimed at exposing the overmanned, clubby world of commercial television to the rigors of the marketplace.
The winning bids for the 16 Independent Television franchises totaled 231.9 million at anticipated 1993 prices. That is about $396.8 million at current exchange rates.
The licenses, which begin in 1993, are for 10 years but are expected to be rolled over when they expire. But starting in 1994, hostile takeovers of television companies will be permitted.
The winning bids ranged from a low of 1,000, or about $1,712, for the small Channel Island franchise, to a high of 43.2 million, or about $73.9 million, for London weekday television. The latter went to a group led by Carlton Communications P.L.C., one of Britain's leading independent television producers and a big provider of services to the film industry.
The losers included some of the biggest names in British television: TVS Entertainment, owner of the American production company MTM, which had the franchise for south and southeast England; Thames Television, a subsidiary of Thorn EMI, which is one of Britain's largest program producers and which had the London weekday franchise, and TV-am P.L.C., whose light breakfast news and interview show is watched by about 70 percent of morning viewers.
Along with the national breakfast slot, the franchises for weekday London and south and southeastern England are among the most coveted franchises in the industry.
The fourth loser was TSW Television Southwest, the holder of the southwestern England franchise.
The Walt Disney Company was a member of the group that won a three-way battle for the national breakfast broadcast, while NBC was part of a losing group. Home Box Office, a Time Warner Inc. unit, was in the losing TVS group.
Advertisers had been among those lobbying the Conservative Government for changes in the television industry. They had been upset by what they saw as excessive increases in charges for commercial time, which had risen in the 1980's at an average annual rate that was 2.5 times faster than inflation, said Paul Styles, head of media consulting at KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock, the accounting firm.
 
Upheaval in the Industry
 The industry has already gone through upheaval. Companies have dismissed thousands of employees as they frantically tried to slash costs so they might have the financial strength to prevail in the auction. Many of the winners now plan to rely heavily on programs bought from independent producers.
Besides saving money, there is another reason that independent producers can expect more business: the new broadcasting law also requires the commercial television stations and the British Broadcasting Corporation to buy at least 25 percent of their programming from independent producers.
The growth of satellite and cable television is also expected to put pressure on the commercial television stations, predicted John Perriss, chairman of Zenith Media Worldwide, a media-buying company owned by Saatchi & Saatchi P.L.C., the advertising giant.
British Sky Broadcasting, the service whose main owner is Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, "is now in about 12 percent of Britain's 22 million homes, and I believe in five years it could easily be in a third," he said. "It will take revenue from the commercial franchises."
 
Four Free Channels
 Britons now can choose from four free channels. Channels 1 and 2 belong to the Government-supported BBC and carry no advertising. Channel 3 consists of the 16 commercial franchises, which carry advertising. So does Channel 4, whose charter, like Channel 2's, is to carry programs that might not appeal to a mass audience. Channel 3 has about a 45 percent share of the television audience, compared with 38 percent for the BBC's Channel 1.
There are also plans to create a fifth commercial channel that will be able to reach most of Britain. It is expected to be sold in a similar auction.
Today's auction will have a significant impact on what programs Britons watch -- or at least where they watch them. There was speculation today that Thames would sell some of its popular series programs now shown on the Independent Television network -- like "The Bill," a police drama -- to the BBC or British Sky Broadcasting. And many bidders had promised to increase the time devoted to regional public-service issues and local news.
Insuring that programming quality did not suffer was a reason the Government commission did not award eight of the franchises to the highest bidders. For instance, TVS bid 59.8 million, or about $102.3 million, but the commission chose a group that bid 36.5 million, or about $62.5 million, maintaining that TVS would not have been able to maintain its proposed service.
Besides the size of the bid, the law also required the commission to take into account the quality of each bidder's proposed programming and the viability of its business plan. The commission used both criteria to reject contestants. Several losers said they would mount court challenges.
"Clearly, the concern about sustaining high-quality programming is very much at mind in the commission," said David W. Byles, media director in the London office of J. Walter Thompson, the ad agency.
The auction comes at a time when the commercial television industry is reeling from Britain's recession. Advertising revenues were flat last year and are expected to fall by 5 percent or more in 1991.
 
Plenty of Complaints
 As could be expected, there were plenty of complaints today about the auction system. Executives of losers like Thames, which has been broadcasting for 23 years, and TV-am complained that the system did not take into account their records as broadcasters. Some consultants and advertising executives complained that the auction did not shake up the system enough. And The Evening Standard, a London newspaper, called the outcome "The Great TV Auction Farce" in its front-page headline.

HEADLINE: MAN IN THE NEWS: William Pelham Barr;
Attorney General Choice With Low-Key Style

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
William P. Barr, President Bush's nominee as Attorney General, is a bagpipe-player, China scholar and one-time employee at the Central Intelligence Agency who got his law degree in night school and has never prosecuted a criminal case in court.
He has served as Acting Attorney General since Dick Thornburgh left two months ago to run for the Senate in Pennsylvania, and his affable, unpretentious style at the Department of Justice has been an antidote to the aloof and sometimes imperious approach of Mr. Thornburgh. 
 Mr. Barr's most difficult test so far came just three days into his tenure as the department's top official, when Cuban inmates at the Talladega Federal Correctional Institution in Alabama seized 10 hostages in an effort to avoid being returned to Havana.
 
Trial by Fire
 The incident thrust Mr. Barr into a tense drama in which he was forced to make a difficult choice between equally dangerous alternatives. He decided early that the Government could not agree to the inmates' demands for freedom, but he became increasingly fearful that the lives of the hostages were at risk.
It was Mr. Barr who ordered the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Hostage Rescue Team to storm the cell block where the hostages were held in a pre-dawn assault, armed with high-powered weapons. The hostages were rescued unharmed and no shots were fired.
Mr. Barr, who is 41 years old, has a solid conservative track record, working mainly behind the scenes to advance the Administration's main law-enforcement programs, including its crime bill and its proposals to attack savings and loan fraud.
Less clear are his views on other matters in which the department plays a role, including civil rights and abortion. But Mr. Barr agreed with the department's decision to file a motion in Federal court in Wichita, Kan., last August that was widely perceived as siding with an anti-abortion group. The group was fighting an order by a Federal District Judge restricting demonstrations at abortion clinics in the city.
Department officials insist that the motion was not an effort to take a stand on behalf of the demonstrators but a restatement of the department's legal position that the Federal courts lack jurisdiction in such cases.
Mr. Barr has also assumed a role in a long-running dispute with a House Judiciary subcommittee over a 1989 legal opinion that concluded that United States law allows F.B.I. agents to arrest people charged with crimes in this country and who have fled overseas, without obtaining the permission of the country involved.
 
An Early Showdown
 The efforts by the panel, the Judiciary Subcommittee on Economic and Commercial Law, to obtain the opinion, which was written by Mr. Barr, nearly provoked a showdown on the Constitution. The two sides eventually agreed to negotiate a compromise that would provide limited access.
William Pelham Barr was reared in New York City, the son of an educator who was once dean of the Columbia University engineering school. He is married and lives in suburban Virginia with his wife, Christine, a school librarian, and their three children.
After graduating in 1973 from Columbia University with a master's degree in Chinese studies, Mr. Barr worked at the C.I.A. and completed George Washington University law school at night. He entered private practice in 1978, mainly in civil law and Federal administrative matters.
Mr. Barr landed on the fast track when he took a job in 1982 as a lawyer for the Domestic Policy Council in the Ronald Reagan White House. It was there that he met allies who have helped him since then, including C. Boyden Gray, who was counsel to Mr. Bush when he was Vice President.
After Mr. Bush's election as President, Mr. Barr joined the department as Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Office of Legal Counsel, which provides advice to the White House, other executive branch departments and the Attorney General.
Not long after Mr. Barr took over as the department's No. 2 official, he said he hoped to apply the law with fairness and integrity, but he added a cautionary note. "Apart from that, my main goal is to survive," he said. "There are mine fields every day, and I just hope I can get through the day without stepping on one."

HEADLINE: MITTERRAND JOINS KOHL IN PROPOSING A EUROPEAN ARMY

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 16

 BODY:
Hoping to influence NATO and European Community summit meetings in the next two months, France and Germany called today for creation of a corps-strength Western European army as a step toward giving the region an independent defense capability.
The two Governments said they would strengthen an existing 5,000-member French-German brigade and indicated that units from other countries in the European Community could eventually join the force. Officials here in Paris said the expanded French-German force could have 30,000 troops. 
 In a letter to other European leaders, President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl also proposed that the Western European Union, a moribund military group comprising nine of the 12 European Community members, become the pillar of a joint European security and defense policy.
 
Britain Challenges Proposal
 The French-German initiative was immediately challenged by Britain as a potential threat to NATO.
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, speaking from Harare, Zimbabwe, where he is attending a Commonwealth conference that opened today, warned that it would be "useless and dangerous" to duplicate what the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization is already doing.
Britain has maintained that the 42-year-old alliance should remain the region's principal military organization, and has frequently cautioned that any weakening of NATO could lead the United States to reduce its commitment to Western Europe's defense.
The initial American reaction to today's proposal was that Washington was not alarmed by the general notion of a European security arrangement with a distinctly European character. An American official said, however, that any European defense structure should be compatible with NATO.
A French spokesman insisted today that, under the new plan, the Western European Union would complement NATO. "It will not become a rival of the alliance," he said. "But the identity of a European security system is being created. It's a fact. It exists."
A German spokesman in Bonn, also seeking to reassure the alliance, emphasized that the creation of a European army was "a long-term proposal" and recalled that the United States has often urged its European partners to assume greater responsibility for their defense.
Some military experts said the difficulties of forming a European army would become apparent as France and Germany try to expand their joint force, not least because of their armies' different equipment, training and command structures.
But the experts said the Mitterrand-Kohl letter suggested that Germany was moving closer to the position of France, which is not a member of NATO's integrated military command and which has long favored a more independent European defense stance.
 
Anticipates Summits
 European officials said the French-German move was timed to anticipate debates on European security expected at a NATO summit meeting in Rome on Nov. 7 and 8 and another of European Community leaders in Maastricht, the Netherlands, on Dec. 8 and 9.
The NATO meeting is expected to define the alliance's strategy for the post-cold-war era, including plans to cut back American troops in Europe, to eliminate short-range nuclear weapons from the region, to create a rapid-reaction force and to establish new relations with members of what was once the Soviet bloc.
The community meeting has the much broader mandate of leading Western Europe toward greater economic and political union, a concept that includes establishing the rules for a common foreign and defense policy.
European officials said today's French-German initiative was intended to break the deadlock in the community's debate on political union and to send a signal to NATO that Western Europe is ready to assume new defense responsibilities both inside and beyond the region.
They said the plan was also a response to a joint British-Italian proposal made two weeks ago that called for the creation of a European rapid-reaction force, but that emphasized any regional military group should remain subservient to NATO.
While Britain indicated today that the French-German idea could hurt NATO, Italy's Foreign Minister, Gianni de Michelis, said during a visit to Paris that he saw "no contradiction" between the two plans. Mr. Mitterrand is to visit Rome for further talks on Thursday.
The French-German proposal, presented in the form of language to be included in a community treaty on political union, also went further than the British-Italian proposal by specifying key areas in which the community's members should work to adopt a common foreign policy.
These included relations with the Soviet Union, Central and Eastern Europe, the United States and Canada, the Mediterranean and the Middle East as well as issues like disarmament and arms control, nuclear nonproliferation and United Nations peacekeeping activities.
The French and German statement did not address one of the crucial questions dividing the community -- whether the community should define its position on specific foreign policy questions by majority vote or, as at present, through consensus. Britain, for one, is unwilling to give up its right of veto.
European officials said that, while the 12 community members were still far from agreement on the substance of their political union, today's initiative demonstrated that France and Germany, the traditional motors of European integration, were again working together.
In recent weeks, Paris has expressed fear that Bonn's growing influence over Eastern Europe was weakening its commitment to their special relationship, one that gave France political leadership and Germany economic domination within the community.
Germany has also recently found itself squeezed between its loyalty to Washington and to Paris. Just two weeks before joining today's initiative, for example, Germany endorsed an American plan to strengthen NATO's ties with the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe. "We see Germany going in both directions," a Western diplomat said.
For France, which first advocated political union as a way of anchoring a powerful united Germany to the European Community, the action today is a boost to its faltering prestige within Europe, and gives it hope of working with Germany through the community meeting in the Netherlands.

HEADLINE: JOBLESS BILL VETO SURVIVES IN SENATE BY NARROW MARGIN

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
The Senate today narrowly failed to override President Bush's veto of a $6.4 billion bill to provide extended unemployment benefits to millions of jobless workers, and Democrats warned that the veto would become an issue in next year's elections.
The vote was 65 in favor of an override and 35 against, two votes short of the two-thirds necessary to overcome the President's rejection and the same tally by which the Senate passed the bill two weeks ago. 
 As before, all 57 Democratic senators favored the bill today, joined by eight Republicans. But they were not enough to prevail over the 23d veto that Mr. Bush has cast in his Presidency. The vote today marked then 12th attempt by Congress to override a Bush veto, and the 12th failure.
 
Democrats and Domestic Issue
 Democrats, laying the groundwork for a campaign against Mr. Bush next year that will emphasize domestic issues, have called the benefits bill a test of compassion for Americans buffeted by the recession, and they plan to cite White House opposition as a evidence that Mr. Bush does not care about economic hardships.
While conceding that Mr. Bush has dominated foreign policy issues, Democrats say he is vulnerable on economic policy, and he has already adopted a defensive posture when discussing the economy and domestic concerns.
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York was one of the Republicans voting to override the President's veto. "We have too many middle-class New Yorkers who have always worked and would be working now, but for the fact of economic dislocation and job loss due to no fault of their own," he said in an interview tonight. "We should give them the benefit of the doubt, give them additional time to find jobs and relocate in a different job market.
"I always attempt to support the Administration, the President, but here we are talking about a situation where American workers need help."
 
The Opposing Republicans
 The Republican Senators who voted to override President Bush's veto, besides Mr. D'Amato, were John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, William S. Cohen of Maine, James M. Jeffords of Vermont, Robert W. Kasten Jr. of Wisconsin, Mark O. Hatfield and Bob Packwood of Oregon and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.
Senators D'Amato, Kasten, Packwood and Specter are up for re-election next year.
Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the chief author of the bill to extend unemployment benefits, said: "The members of this body have an obligation to the working men and women of this country, those who are out of work in the third-longest recession since World War II. These are mothers and fathers who have a long-term commitment to the labor force."
"If the President is right, that the economy is going to surge and come out of this recession, then these benefits will not be paid," said Mr. Bentsen, the chairman of the Finance Committee. "These unemployed will be working at jobs and paying taxes and not drawing these benefits." On the other hand, he said, if the economy remains stalled, "these benefits put bread on the table and will help pay the mortgage, and they will help decent Americans hang in there until they can find jobs."
The bill would have provided from seven to 20 weeks of extra unemployment insurance benefits to jobless workers who have exhausted the basic 26 weeks of benefits. The number of extra weeks of benefits available under the bill depended on the severity of unemployment in a given state. Thus, for example, the bill would have given 20 additional weeks of jobless benefits to workers in Michigan and West Virginia, 13 additional weeks of benefits to those in New York and California, and seven additional weeks to jobless workers in New Jersey and Texas.
 
Many Reasons for Opposition
 The Administration dislikes the bill for many reasons, not least because it defies the Administration's confident predictions that the nation is recovering from the recession.
In vetoing the bill on Friday of last week, Mr. Bush said, "The Administration is deeply concerned about the needs of the unemployed and their families." But he complained that the measure would "destroy the integrity of the bipartisan budget agreement" reached in October of last year.
Mr. Bush said the bill "would significantly increase the Federal deficit," because Democrats had not found a way to pay for it, as required under the budget agreement.
The number of unemployed workers reached 8.4 million in September of this year, up from 7.1 million in Sept. 1990. The civilian unemployment rate, 6.7 percent last month, was a full percentage point higher than in Sept. 1990.
More than three million Americans used up their regular unemployment insurance benefits in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. The Government estimates that 3.4 million additional workers will exhaust their regular benefits in the coming year.
The bill vetoed by Mr. Bush was originally passed on Oct. 1 by votes of 65 to 35 in the Senate and 300 to 118 in the House of Representatives.
Democrats like Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the majority whip, said it was absurd for the President to cavil at the cost of the bill because there was already plenty of money in the Federal Unemployment Trust Fund, derived from taxes levied on employers.
"These benefits are already paid for," Mr. Bonior declared. "They have been paid for by insurance premiums taken out of the paychecks each month and put into a trust fund, set aside exactly for this purpose."
Mr. Bonior suggested that Mr. Bush and many other Republicans were "so dazzled by emergencies in Kurdistan or Turkey or the Soviet Union or Bangladesh that they are blind to the emegrencies of our own people right here at home."
In a preview of themes sure to be used by Democratic candidates for President and Congress, Mr. Bonior said of the benefits bill: "This is the issue that divides the Democrats from the Republicans. This is the issue that cuts at who we are and who they are."
Democrats, who control both houses of Congress, said today they would revise their proposal, pass it once again and send it to Mr. Bush.

HEADLINE: Nonprofit Groups in Line For New Wall St. Home

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Wall Street, the profit center of New York City, would become a nonprofit center in the near future under a plan announced yesterday by the Dinkins administration.
Twenty floors in a 34-story office tower at 120 Wall Street, owned by Larry A. Silverstein, would become the Association Center, available for use as headquarters by national and international nonprofit organizations. The exodus of such organizations from New York is a source of worry at City Hall. 
 "There are more than 18,000 not-for-profit organizations in the City of New York and they account for more than 10 percent of all employment in this town," Mayor David N. Dinkins said. "This industry helps drive our economy, and, I am proud to say, no other city has set up this kind of facility to foster it."
What the organizations would receive from the plan are lower occupancy costs, with one year's free rent, among other concessions.
What Mr. Silverstein would receive is a higher occupancy rate for a 62-year-old building that overlooks the East River and is more than one-third empty. Some 225,000 square feet of space is available.
The center would eventually occupy 400,000 square feet in the 615,000-square-foot tower. Depending on tenants' needs, it might include conference rooms, classrooms, printing and mail services and a day-care center.
To reduce or eliminate real-estate taxes, the building would be divided into condominium units, and the city's Industrial Development Agency would take nominal title to the floors that make up the Association Center. That property would thus be tax-exempt. Mr. Silverstein would lease the space from the city and sublease it in turn.
Tenants might be liable for some payments in lieu of taxes, but the amount has not yet been determined. They would also benefit from the use of Industrial Development Agency bonds to finance basic office construction work, for which there would be an allowance of $35 a square foot. With the exemption of taxes, rents would be less than $20 a square foot in the first year of the lease, Mr. Silverstein said, a figure that "covers fully the operational costs of the building."
Tenants would pay their shares of increased operating costs over the life of the lease, as well as a share of the costs of common services.
As to how he could afford the year's free rent, Mr. Silverstein said through a spokeswoman, "It was one element among many in the negotiating process." She did not elaborate.
Rents for secondary office space in the eastern financial district have been about $22 a square foot, according to the Cushman & Wakefield brokerage.
The Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, Sally Hernandez-Pinero, said 120 Wall Street was chosen from 13 buildings because Mr. Silverstein's plan was the most responsive to a city request for proposals.
This is the second time in a decade that the city has tried to create an Association Center. The first was to have been a new building financed by the State Dormitory Authority. That effort foundered in 1982, when the authority was dragged down by the collapse of the Lombard-Wall financial concern, with which it had invested most of its portfolio.
 
Prospective Tenants Lost
 A number of prospective tenants for that center have left the city. According to the city's Economic Development Corporation, they include the Young Men's Christian Association, which went to Chicago; the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which moved to Baltimore; the American Cancer Society, which has gone to Atlanta, and the Presbyterian Church, which has gone to Louisville, Ky.
"Other large cities have been trying to steal our not-for-profit glitter," Ms. Hernandez-Pinero said yesterday as she addressed a meeting of the New York Society of Association Executives in the Drake Hotel. "Not any more, with this Association Center. I'm pleased to announce that the Association Center is up, airborne and, folks, I think it's going to fly."
The president of the executives' group, Joel A. Dolci, chose a different metaphor. "We've been thrown a life raft by the city," he said. "And we will be quick to reach for it."
The executive vice president and general manager of the Magazine Publishers of America, P. Robert Farley, stood up just after the announcement and said: "If anyone had bet me $1,000 three months ago that we'd be looking at a picture of the building, I'd have taken the bet. I have a date with the developer and agent for tomorrow afternoon to look at the building."
Mr. Farley said later that his group's lease at 575 Lexington Avenue would expire "in a couple of years" and that the group was looking for 12,000 to 16,000 square feet of space.

HEADLINE: Commissioner Of Labor Quits Post in Albany

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 16

 BODY:
The State Labor Commissioner, Thomas F. Hartnett, is resigning to work as an arbitrator for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Mr. Hartnett and other Cuomo administration officials announced today.
Mr. Hartnett, who has been commissioner since 1987, plans to leave at the end of next week. His successor has yet to be chosen, but the officials said that John F. Hudacs, the State General Services Commissioner, is under consideration. 
 "He is clearly a contender for the job," one official said. "But this is not a done deal." The official said a decision is expected in a week or so.
 
Mediating Disciplinary Cases
 In his new job, Mr. Hartnett will serve as a mediator on disciplinary cases involving Transit Authority employees. The cases are heard by a three-member panel, with one member appointed by the Transit Authority, one by the Transport Workers Union and one a neutral member approved by both sides. Mr. Hartnett will be the neutral member.
The 46-year-old Commissioner said he would be paid about $75,000 a year in his new job. His state salary was nearly $92,000, but Mr. Hartnett said he would also be lobbying and negotiating labor contracts as a private consultant. State law prohibits public employees from lobbying or appearing before their former agencies for two years.
As labor commissioner, Mr. Hartnett has overseen the gradual conversion of the state's unemployment offices into community centers where labor-related services are provided on issues ranging from health and safety to literacy.
 
Backed Child Labor Bill
 He lobbied for a child labor bill that became law this year. It placed restrictions on the number of hours children can work while in school.
He also backed legislation in 1989 that raised unemployment insurance payment levels and he represented Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in several recent labor disputes, including those at The New York Post and The New York Daily News.

HEADLINE: New York Urged to Improve Tourist Services

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Warning that the New York City tourist industry is being threatened by competition from other American cities as well as by the erosion of the city as a gateway from Europe, a study by the Urban Research Center of New York University has suggested a variety of improvements.
They include a direct rail service from New York to Newark International Airport and the adoption of a year-round tourist policy rather than one based on attracting political conventions and other high-profile events with short impact. The study also suggests that hotels and retailers sponsor shopping trips for tourists and that arts institutions sponsor cultural weekends. 
 The report, "Tourism in New York City: Threats and Opportunities," is scheduled for release at a conference on tourism this afternoon at N.Y.U. It was written by the director of the research center, Prof. Mitchell L. Moss, and Georgia Manganaris-Decavalales.
 
Diversity Helps and Hurts
 In the report and in an interview, Professor Moss said New York remained a strong tourist city. But its very diversity is a source of strength and weakness. "It enhances the appeal of New York," the report said. "But it also requires greater effort and skill to consume the activities that New York has to offer."
Sally Hernandez-Pinero, deputy mayor for finance and economic development, who has not seen the report, said the Dinkins administration was "working closely with all the agencies involved in encouraging tourism and is supportive of a much more aggressive marketing program for the city, in the boroughs as well as Manhattan."
"But we always welcome creative approaches and new ideas," she added.
A spokesman for the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, Steven E. Trombetti, endorsed the recommendation for cultural and shopping weekends. He said 25 million people visited the city last year, adding that despite a weak economy this year, "we're predicting an increase of maybe 3 or 4 percent."
 
Attracting Foreign Tourists
 The report emphasizes foreign tourism, which it says is growing at a much faster annual rate than the domestic segment. Noting that about half of all foreign travel to the city originates in Europe, the report cites the need to attract visitors from Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, especially because airline deregulation is eroding New York's pre-eminence as a gateway.
The city and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey should focus on the role of foreign carriers, the report says. To attract international travelers, the study proposes rail service linking the Amtrak Northeast Corridor Line with Newark International Airport.
A spokesman for the Port Authority, Mark Marchese, said the suggestion was "highly questionable."
"Only 14.1 percent of Newark Airport patrons come from New York," he said. "And a lot of them are using buses."
The authors of the report said too little attention was given to information needed by foreign tourists, including information at subway stations and bus stops.

HEADLINE: Ticonderoga Journal;
A Mayor Who Protests That His Pay Is Too High

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TICONDEROGA, N.Y.

 BODY:
Just a few months into his term as Mayor here, Michael Diskin is in a major feud with Village Council members over his salary. But this is no garden-variety pay dispute. He says the council is giving him too much money.
"I feel the people are paying too much for what they are getting," said Mr. Diskin, who receives an annual salary of $10,500 for a 30-hour week. A few weeks ago he introduced a measure to the Village Board that would cut the job to a $3,500, 10-hour-a-week position. 
 The Council, which upgraded the salary in 1988, balked. It not only refused to cut the salary, but it also passed a resolution effectively ordering him to be at the Village Hall from 9 to noon and 1 to 4 every weekday, even if he felt that he had nothing to do.
"So maybe Mike doesn't want to sit around in an office 30 hours a week," a Council member, Paul Salstead, said. "I really don't blame the man. But he ran to be in the office, and he should be there."
Many residents in this Adirondack village in the area bridging Lake George and Lake Champlain say Mr. Diskin is a local hero or, as one admirer put it, perhaps even a potential tourist attraction, somewhat akin to a five-legged cow: come and see the bureaucrat who tells the world that he is underworked and overpaid.
But others here are skeptical of his pronouncement. They describe it as either a case of mayoral disgruntlement that the job is taking too much time from his real livelihood, a metal-salvage shop he runs out of his front yard on Champlain Avenue, or a clever political ploy.
Mr. Diskin does appear to have the best of both worlds right now. Railing against the Council's fiscal irresponsibility for refusing to cut his pay, the Mayor continues to collect the full salary on what he calls a point of principle. As long as the council forces him to be at the Village Hall for 30 hours a week, making him a hostage of sorts, he says he certainly should be paid for it.
Paradoxically one of the things that Council members say should keep Mr. Diskin occupied is a study that the village is conducting on dissolving itself and merging services into the surrounding Township of Ticonderoga. If there is a merger, of course, there would be no more Mayor and no more Council, and no one would be paid anything. Mr. Diskin said he was still weighing the matter, but might well come to the conclusion that his services as mayor are not needed at all.
For the moment, though, the controversy over how much to pay the 43-year-old Mr. Diskin continues and he comes to work -- grudgingly -- even though he frequently complains of boredom. He seemed genuinely grateful to have a visitor at his office the other day; he was so far ahead on his work, he said, that he had just finished writing a proclamation thanking a local doctor even though it would not be issued for another month and a half.
"This requirement to just sit there and wait for something to happen kind of goes against my grain," Mr. Diskin said. "I don't like to be idle."
Many Ticonderogans agree that the controversy has also provided a refreshing diversion from the usual subjects of conversation in this village of 2,700, which has an economy largely dependent on nearby mills and annual attractions that include the International Festival of Paper and Pencil.
The pay dispute is apparently not a partisan issue. The Mayor is a Republican, as is virtually everyone in the drama. But it has stirred many people to take sides.
Dale (Freshy) Wallace, owner of Freshy's Donuts, described the dispute as comical, but added that he thought the Mayor had a point. "I mean, if Mike says he can do it for less, I think I'd take Mike's word for it," Mr. Wallace said.
On the other hand, as Candy Geiser, a waitress at Bob's TV Bar and Restaurant put it, many people wondered "whether there was some kind of catch" when the Mayor started campaigning to reduce his salary. But if there was, she said, "I haven't been able to figure it out."
Council members say that with a $1.6 million budget and 21 employees to oversee, there is plenty of work for the Mayor to do.
Hazel Flack, the previous mayor who lost to Mr. Diskin in her race for re-election in March and who supported the salary increase, said there were many good reasons to have a full-time mayor.
"I think it saved us from a lot of lawsuits, frankly," Mrs. Flack said. "I had people call me up all the time really furious about something and I could say, 'Come right down and let's talk about it.' "
Mrs. Flack, who is running for town supervisor, dismisses Mr. Diskin's plea for a lower salary as a stunt that he may use if he ever campaigns against her again.
But the Mayor says that with all those other full-time employees on the payroll, his main task is to make sure that they are doing their jobs, and that certainly does not require 30 hours a week, he said.
"There's no trick here," he said, leaning back in his office chair and smiling broadly. "I'm really not a politician. I know it sounds like a cliche, but I've just got to be me, and I say what I think. And I think it's an injustice to spend all that money on a mayor."

HEADLINE: The Sputtering California Miracle

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 16

 BODY:
California, a big engine of growth during the 1980's, is turning out to be an economic caboose in 1991, as it suffers from consistently high unemployment, a weakening real estate market and troubles in key industries like aerospace,
While many other parts of the country appear to be pulling out of the recession, economists here said California might not yet have hit bottom. Even after it does, they said, myriad problems are likely to dampen the strength of its recovery. 
 "It's arguable that the U.S. economy is in the early stages of a modest economic recovery, but California is still locked in a recession," said Mark Green, an economist at Wells Fargo & Company in San Francisco. "The recovery in California, once it gets going, may not be as strong as on the national level."
California's troubles are already rocking the state's big banks. With fewer businesses being formed or expanding, developers can no longer find tenants to fill office buildings and shopping centers. That is adding up to large and growing losses on real estate loans and investments.
The Los Angeles-based Security Pacific Corporation, the state's second-largest bank, posted a $508.5 million loss for the third quarter on Tuesday, and the company said it expected loan losses to remain high in the fourth quarter, largely because of problems in California.
"The California economy appears to be lagging a very slow national economic recovery, and the timing and the strength of the recovery in California is uncertain," said Robert H. Smith, Security Pacific's chairman.
But its very size makes the state's economy an issue far beyond California's borders. If California were a country, its economy would be the world's eighth largest, ranking just behind Britain and ahead of China and Canada. As measured by personal income, California accounts for 13.3 percent of the national economy. By that yardstick, the state is more than a third larger than No. 2 New York and is more than twice as large as all of New England.
As a result, the lingering California recession is clearly putting a crimp in the national economy's sputtering attempts at revival.
Being the laggard is a sharp role reversal for California. The state has typically not suffered as much as the rest of the country in downturns. The only other time the state has fared worse than the nation as a whole since World War II was in 1970, when deep cuts in military spending led to widespread unemployment in the aerospace industry.
California's economy boomed during most of the last decade, spurred by high rates of home and commercial real estate construction, the growth of Pacific Rim trade, big new Pentagon contracts for aerospace and weapons companies and a rapid growth in population. These strengths helped keep it strong through much of last year as the rest of the country slipped into recession.
But early this year, the downturn finally arrived here -- and with a vengeance. By some key measures, the state has been hit harder by the recession than the nation as a whole. The unemployment rate jumped to 7.7 percent last month from 7.3 percent in August, while the national rate declined to 6.7 percent in September from 6.8 percent in August. Unemployment for both California and the nation peaked in June, with the state rate standing at 8.2 percent and the national rate at 7 percent.
 
Picture Becomes Gloomier
 This month California officials said the state had lost many more jobs in the recession than previously estimated. They said employment declined by 240,000 jobs from mid-1990 to mid-1991 rather than by 35,000, as previously announced.
And the Ccommission on State Finance cut its estimate of personal income growth for 1991 to 2.5 percent from 4.5 percent, a level it said was "the weakest in recent history." Officials said the economic problems helped push state tax receipts for the three months ended September to 3.7 percent below projections, raising the possibility of another fiscal crisis just months after officials increased taxes and slashed spending to close a budget gap. The Wall Street firm of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company recently projected that the state is in danger of losing its triple-A bond rating.
"Clearly, California is in a much steeper recession than we imagined back in March or April," said Kathleen Brown, the State Treasurer.
California continues to enjoy many strengths, and most economists expect it to bounce back eventually and outperform most of the rest of the country over the next decade.
Despite some recent signs that migration into the state is slackening, population growth remains robust, creating considerable demand for new housing, services and consumer products. A steady flow of new immigrants has provided the state with wave after wave of entrepreneurs as well as skilled and unskilled laborers. The state will remain a primary gateway not just to the Pacific Rim, but to Mexico, with which the United States is negotiating a free trade agreement. Few states can match the technological resources found in Silicon Valley and in California's computer, aerospace and biotechnology companies.
But this time around, California is being battered simultaneously on a number of fronts, and the problems keep getting worse instead of better.
"We had hoped that if the U.S. economy were pulling out of recession by May, California would be showing signs of growth by now," said David G. Hensley, head of the Business Forecasting Project at the University of California at Los Angeles. "There are no signs to support that. To the contrary, new signs of weakness have emerged."
Real estate, perhaps the clearest gauge of the state's economic health, remains moribund. The pace of new-home construction is depressed. Existing-home sales rallied earlier this year but have eased despite falling prices and low mortgage rates.
New offices buildings that were started during the boom are now opening, at the same time that banks, law firms and other service businesses are retrenching, sending commercial real estate vacancy rates to distressing levels in many cities. In downtown Los Angeles, for example, the office vacancy rate stood at 22.6 percent as of June 30, up from 15.7 percent a year earlier, according to Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial real estate firm.
 
The Battered Banks
 All of this has meant big problems for the state's banks.
Security Pacific, which is in the process of merging with the San Francisco-based BankAmerica Corporation, is just one of the California financial institutions battered by the problems in commercial real estate. The merger, which the two banks said is still on track, is intended to make the banks stronger and more dominant throughout the West. But it will do little to help the California economy, at least initially. In fact, analysts expect the merged companies to cut thousands of jobs in California as they close branches and combine back-office operations.
Other banks are also suffering. Wells Fargo said on Tuesday that it had added $350 million to its provision for anticipated loan losses, most of them real estate-related and that it had written off another $123 million in bad loans. As a result, Wells Fargo said its earnings for the period were down 47 percent from last year's third quarter, to $163 million.
The First Interstate Bancorp, based in Los Angeles, is expected to post a $200 million loss, largely because of commercial real estate problems in California, when it releases its third-quarter results later this month. The bank said last month that it would have to lay off 1,500 people last month.
 
Military and Farm Losses
 California has already lost tens of thousands of jobs in the aerospace and military field because of declining military spending. And just when some analysts thought the worst was past, a new round of cuts is in the works. President Bush's recent cancellation of several nuclear weapons programs led the Rockwell International Corporation to lay off 400 workers last week, and the Northrop Corporation would have to eliminate thousands of jobs if Congress, as many analysts expect, cancels the B-2 Stealth bomber program.
Other sectors of the economy are at risk, as well. Farmers in California, the nation's largest agricultural producers, remain endangered by a drought now heading into its sixth year, though there was just enough rain this year to postpone a crisis.
The state has brought some of its problems on itself. High labor rates and land costs, combined with strict environmental controls, are pushing some companies to relocate some of their operations outside the state. The McDonnell Douglas Corporation, for example, has decided that it will not build its next commercial jetliner at its huge plant in Long Beach.
"Short term, it's a very bleak picture for our state," Ms. Brown said. "In the long run, our growing population will really fuel our strengths in the decades to come. But to be truly competitive, we need an attitude check about how we regard business and industry in our state, and we need to be more thoughtful about retaining jobs and growing new jobs."

HEADLINE: Weld Denting Massachusetts' Liberal Framework

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
In nine months in office, Gov. William F. Weld has begun a profound transformation of Massachusetts, a state long regarded as a bastion of liberalism, the only state to vote for George S. McGovern for President.
After years of fiscal chaos here, Mr. Weld, the state's first Republican Governor in 16 years, has managed to win passage of a a budget with no new taxes. His budget for the fiscal year 1992, which started in July, even cut spending by 6 percent, making Massachusetts the only state to reduce spending from the previous year. 
 To his supporters, Mr. Weld is a conservative savior. To his critics, the 46-year-old Mr. Weld, a descendant of a founder of Harvard College in 1636, is a callous patrician who has cut benefits to the poor and reduced state aid to education in a single-minded quest to make government smaller.
But the real Mr. Weld is more complex, a politician who defies labels, a blend of libertarian and liberal. To some of his closest friends, he is seen as a new-age political leader.
"Bill Weld is totally locked into the concerns of the baby boomers," said Charles Manning, a Republican consultant who serves as an adviser to the Governor. "Anyone who tries to characterize him as conservative or liberal is missing the picture."
Mr. Weld jokingly refers to himself as a "filthy supply-sider," an apostle of Ronald Reagan's economics. But he is also pushing, for example, for a bill that would require tough standards for packaging materials, a measure backed by environmental groups and opposed by businesses.
On crime, Governor Weld likes to describe himself as "to the right of Attila the Hun," and he is working to restore the death penalty and end parole for prisoners. But he recently introduced a package of bills to liberalize the state's stringent abortion laws, including a proposal to lower the age until which a teen-ager requires parental consent to 16 from 18.
 
Starts Pilot Condom Program
 Mr. Weld has also said he would oppose any effort to repeal the state's homosexual-rights law. And under his direction, state health officials started a pilot program in 10 communities that makes condoms available in schools and community agencies to teen-agers.
But at the same time he has won praise from national conservative groups, like the Reason Foundation in California, for initiating a plan to contract with businesses to perform what are normally state functions and to sell state agencies to private enterprise. As a first step, in an executive action last month, he hired a Florida concern to provide medical services to the state's 9,300 prison inmates. He calculates that the change will eliminate 400 employees from the state payroll and save about $10 million annually. Mr. Weld hopes eventually to sell the Massachusetts Turnpike to a private owner who would operate it for the tolls. This would require legislative approval.
"I'm not opposed to all government," the tall, red-haired Mr. Weld said in a recent interview in his office. He said he recognized the need for government to preserve public security, foster economic development and "make sure that the safety net is there for people who cannot help themselves."
But he believes that Massachusetts residents became spoiled by what he calls "the Cadillac style" of government services provided by his Democratic predecessors. Massachusetts, for instance, is second only to New York in the amount it spends on welfare, $765 a person a year as against the national average of $423, according to the United States Census Bureau. New York spends an average of $824.
Given a state economy that is in its worst slump since the Great Depression, with 10 percent of the work force having lost jobs over the past three years, Mr. Weld asserts that the Cadillac must be traded in for a Chevrolet.
When Mr. Weld took office last January, he at first clashed openly with the leaders of the Democratic-controlled Legislature who opposed his drastic budget cuts. But Mr. Weld's insistence that the only way to balance the budget was through cuts rather than new taxes prevailed, and he has now forged a good working relationship with the Legislature.
Mr. Weld's first budget reduced state spending to $12.9 billion, from $13.7 billion in the fiscal year 1991. He cut 3,962 workers from the state payroll of 72,000, cut $400 million out of the state's $2.4 billion Medicaid program, and reduced the amount of financing the state provides to cities and towns for education, police and other services, by 11 percent, according to state budget figures.
 
Cuts Aid of Last Resort
 Last week, Mr. Weld proudly signed a new law that will end weekly payments averaging $330 to one-third of the 38,000 residents who had been on General Relief, the state's welfare program of last resort.
But advocates for the poor and for public education have been growing increasingly critical of Mr. Weld. Bernard Cardinal Law, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Boston who has also assailed the Governor for his abortion stance, told worshipers at a recent church service, "There's a mean-spiritedness abroad in our land."
James Braude, the executive director of the Tax Equity Alliance for Massachusetts, a public interest group, accused Mr. Weld of deception in pretending that his cuts had not hurt people. Mr. Braude pointed to the Governor's elimination of state aid to low-income families to help them pay their fuel bills. The legislation cut all assistance to 7,000 families and reduced benefits to more than 30,000 other people.
Mark Roosevelt, a Democratic State Representative and chairman of the House Committee on Education, asserted that the reason that Mr. Weld has been able to carry out his cutbacks is that he is "an incredibly cold and aloof person."
Because of the cut in state aid, the city of Holyoke has reduced its school budget 25 percent this year, laying off 221 teachers, or 36 percent of the total teaching staff. The result is that some schools have classes with up to 40 students.
"There is no teaching going on; it is just caretaking," said Mr. Roosevelt, who lives in Boston. "I don't know what Weld's tax cuts are going to do to prepare our children for the future."
But many other politicians believe that Mr. Weld has given Massachusetts voters, angered by years of rising taxes and fiscal gridlock in the State House, precisely what they asked for in last November's election. "He is giving people confidence in the Commonwealth again," said Lucile P. Hicks, a Republican State Senator.
 
'A Working Government'
 Peter Lucas, a spokesman for State Representative Charles Flaherty, a Democrat who is Speaker of the House, said Mr. Weld "has re-established a working government," after several years in which Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, a Democrat, and the leaders of the Legislature came close to paralysis. "The atmosphere is much better," Mr. Lucas said. "You can sense it."
Mr. Weld has stumbled a few times. He tried, unsuccessfully, to get a major pay raise for his new Cabinet officers, when other state employees have had their wages frozen for two years, raising charges that he was too upper class.
But Mr. Weld, who is the son of a wealthy investment banker, has developed a relaxed -- some say nonchalant -- style that has kept him from becoming obsessed with criticism.
"Bill is easy going and doesn't sit there and let steam come out of his ears," said John Moffitt, the chief secretary of his Cabinet. In part this is because Mr. Weld knows that "criticism comes with the territory," Mr. Moffitt said, adding that it is also because "he is very secure and has a good family life."
Mr. Weld and his wife, Susan, have five children, all of whom attend private schools.
 
Making Fun of Himself
 Mr. Weld does not mind poking fun at himself, and on the conference table in his office he keeps a stuffed armadillo. "They are extremely slow and dumb animals, and I'm just fond of them," he said.
On the wall behind his desk, where Governor Dukakis had a portrait of Sam Adams, the hero of the Revolution, Mr. Weld has installed a portrait of James Michael Curley, the longtime Congressman, Governor of Massachusetts and Boston Mayor, who last held office in 1950, and who was sent to jail on corruption charges.
It seems a strange selection. Mr. Curley was the archetype of the Democratic Irish Catholic politician who made a career out of campaigning against Yankee bluebloods like Mr. Weld. Moreover, Mr. Weld was a United States Attorney in Boston and later, an Assistant United States Attorney General in charge of the criminal division.
Why then pick the Curley painting? "He was a man of the people and I'm intrigued by the guy," Mr. Weld replied, deadpan, relishing the mischief in his choice.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
2 Key Statistics Are Due to Shift

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
IS the American economy in a recovery, a recession or a no man's land? The answer is not easy to come by because economic statistics lag behind current events and because data on past growth or contraction are complex, crude and continually being revised.
For instance, the first estimate by the Commerce Department of real gross national product -- total output adjusted for inflation -- for the second quarter had the economy growing at an annual rate of four-tenths of 1 percent. Hats went off to hail the recovery. The second estimate moved that figure down to one-tenth of 1 percent, and some economists, including Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board's chairman, said the recession was over but the recovery had not yet begun. 
 Then department's third revision put the growth rate of real G.N.P. down further, to minus five-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter, provoking worries that the economy was still in recession.
But that is not the end of the changing picture. Two new sets of data, to be released in late November, will indicate that the recovery did begin in the second quarter after all.
The first is an updated version of the price index used to correct G.N.P. for inflation, shifting the base year of the index to 1987 from 1982. Periodic updates of the "G.N.P. deflator" are necessary as inflation or deflation affects different goods differently over the years, and the mix of goods that make up total national output changes. A price deflator based on outdated weights for different goods and services would distort the calculation.
Using the new 1987-base G.N.P. deflator, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis finds in a preliminary study that instead of falling at an annual rate of five-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter, as measured in constant 1982 dollars, real G.N.P. rose by four-tenths of 1 percent, when measured in 1987 dollars.
When the department releases its first estimate of the just-completed third quarter on Oct. 29, real G.N.P. will still be measured on the old 1982 price base. The new figures for real G.N.P. on the 1987 price base will not be released until Nov. 26.
In addition to shifting from 1982 to 1987 dollars, the department's second change will be to emphasize gross domestic product, rather than gross national product, as the primary measure of the national economy. G.D.P. is already used by almost all countries as the main indicator of growth.
G.D.P. covers the goods and services "produced by labor and property located in the United States," while G.N.P. measures the market value of goods and services produced by property and labor "supplied by United States residents," whether the production is here or abroad.
Thus, G.D.P. measures the value of goods and services produced within the United States, while G.N.P. includes the profits or other income received by Americans overseas. Production by, say, Toyota or Siemens in plants in the United States is included in America's G.D.P., but I.B.M.'s or General Motors' earnings brought back from Japan or Germany do not count in United States G.D.P. although they do count in G.N.P.
G.D.P. is considered by the Commerce Department the better measure of what is happening within the American economy, since income flows to businesses or residents of this country from abroad are influenced mainly by economic developments in the rest of the world. No measure gives all one wants to know; the Commerce Department will continue to report on both G.D.P. and G.N.P.
Though new official data for G.D.P. will not be introduced until late November, preliminary estimates by the Commerce Department show that real G.D.P., measured in constant 1982 dollars, rose at an annual rate of 1.4 percent in the second quarter of 1991, even more than the revised figures for G.N.P. in 1987 dollars now indicate.
The evidence is that the recovery is in motion, but slow motion. An Experimental Index of Coincident Indicators, developed by the leading mapper of the business cycle, the National Burerau of Economic Research, points to continuing but slowing economic growth. This slowdown in the rise of the so-called X.C.I., the bureau says, reflects the modest growth in industrial production and the net declines in real personal income and employee-hours of work during July and August. The figures released yesterday by the Government on industrial production, capacity use, trade and inflation confirm this picture of a weakening recovery.
The economy is shaping up as the key election issue. This week President Bush narrowly defeated Democrats' efforts to override his veto of the bill to extend unemployment benefits, but called a meeting of Republican leaders to discuss tax cuts and other measures to spur the economy.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls in U.S. Trading After Some Gains Abroad

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished lower against most leading currencies in domestic trading yesterday after posting some gains overseas.
Gold prices rose, with gold for current delivery gaining $1.80 an ounce to close at $360 on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Later, the Republic National Bank of New York quoted an after-hours bid of $360 an ounce, up $2.30 from Wednesday. 
 Analysts said the dollar's mixed showing reflected confusion about the prospects for interest rates as a result of a new report that showed inflation in the United States was unexpectedly strong in September.
The Government said consumer prices jumped four-tenths of 1 percent last month in the biggest inflation spurt since January. That was about twice the increase many economists were expecting.
The report initially sent the dollar higher on European markets and in early American dealings, as it appeared to dim chances that the Federal Reserve would move promptly to encourage lower interest rates.
The Fed generally tries to encourage economic growth with lower rates but has hesitated to drive rates lower when inflation appears to be accelerating.
The inflation report was one of several Government reports released yesterday, however, and the others indicated that the economy remained sluggish. Industrial production rose a lackluster one-tenth of a percent in September, while the United States merchandise trade deficit widened dramatically, to $6.8 billion, as overseas demand for American products dropped.
Kevin Lawrie, the head of strategic trading in the foreign exchange division at the Bank of Boston, called the reports "an avalanche of news" that did not warrant a big move up in the dollar.
While the inflation report could ward off an immediate cut in rates, he said, most traders still expected a decline in interest rates by the end of the year.
The dollar finished at 129.45 yen in New York, compared with 130.10 yen late on Wednesday. That was lower than its close earlier in the day of 129.53 yen in Tokyo, which was down from 130.02 yen on Wednesday. In London, the dollar was quoted at 129.75 yen.
The dollar also finished lower in New York against the British pound. The pound rose to $1.7175 in New York, from $1.7070 late on Wednesday. Earlier in London, the pound fell to $1.7090, from $1.7105 late on Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late on Wednesday, included: 1.6965 German marks, down from 1.7060; 1.4815 Swiss francs, down from 1.4905; 5.7760 French francs.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
BankAmerica Net Higher Than Expected

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 17

 BODY:
The BankAmerica Corporation today reported third-quarter earnings above what Wall Street analysts had expected, despite the recession. The bank also said its merger with the Security Pacific Corporation was proceeding according to plan in spite of that bank's higher- than-expected losses for the quarter.
For the quarter, BankAmerica said it earned $285 million, or $1.20 a share, up 1 percent from $283 million, or $1.26 a share, in the period a year ago. The 5 percent decrease in per share figures primarily reflects a 3 percent gain in the number of common shares outstanding, to 221.7 million. 
 Analysts had estimated that the bank would earn about $1.12 a share. BankAmerica shares closed today at $42.75, down $1.625, on the New York Stock Exchange after closing up $2.125 yesterday.
"BankAmerica achieved solid results in the third quarter, despite the continued weak economy and in a period of intense activity and change for the corporation," Richard M. Rosenberg, BankAmerica's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. "Growth in net interest income, coupled with effective management of expenses, helped keep the corporation's financial performance on track."
The bank decreased its provision for loan losses, a key benchmark for loan performance, to $210 million from $260 million in the period a year ago. But the provision was substantially above the $175 million taken in the second quarter of this year, and above most analysts' estimates as well.
"The loan-loss provision was relatively high," said Donald K. Crowley, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in San Francisco. The higher-than-expected provision "is clearly a function of the recession; that will probably continue to be a drain," he said. But the bank's fundamentals and financial results remain strong, particularly relative to other large banks at this time, he said.
Frank Newman, BankAmerica's chief financial officer, said at a news conference that the provision reflected some increase in bad loans, but also some internal reclassification of loans that was not disclosed. He said the bank had not seen any improvement in commercial and consumer loan performance that would indicate a recovery in the economy. "In some sectors we see status quo -- no further deterioration -- but we don't see much improvement either," he said.
Security Pacific took a $1.21 billion loan-loss provision earlier this week, rather than the $1 billion provision it had been expected to take. Mr. Newman reiterated that this would not affect the merger proceedings and would help bring Security Pacific's classification of the bank's loan portfolio in accord with BankAmerica's own policy. "Nothing about that provision at all changed our assessment of the transaction," Mr. Newman said.

Gannett Profit Declines 25.1%

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The Gannett Company, publisher of 87 daily newspapers including USA Today, said yesterday that its net income dropped 25.1 percent in the third quarter.
The Arlington, Va., company said it earned $59.5 million, or 42 cents a share, in the quarter, down from $79.4 million, or 50 cents, a year earlier. 
 Gannett, which also operates 10 television stations, 15 radio stations and owns the nation's largest outdoor advertising business, said the recession affected advertising spending disproportionately, hitting all its units.
Newspaper advertising revenues fell 3 percent in the quarter, while circulation revenues rose 6 percent, the company said. Broadcasting revenue fell 12 percent.
Over all, Gannett said, its third-quarter revenues totaled $819.7 million, down 1.2 percent from $829.9 million a year earlier.
Gannett's shares lost 75 cents yesterday to close at $39.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Industrial Output Weakens With Increase of Only 0.1%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
Industrial production weakened in the third quarter, the Government said today, and analysts called it a sign of fading momentum in manufacturing, which had been leading the nation out of recession.
"There is a real question as to whether the solid recovery on the industrial side of the economy will persist as we move into the fourth quarter," said Allen Sinai, an economist with the the Boston Company. 
 The Federal Reserve said output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose an anemic one-tenth of 1 percent in September after showing no change at all from a month earlier.
The Fed attributed the September output gain entirely to a 7.7 percent gain in motor vehicle production. Excluding automobile and truck output, production actually fell two-tenths of 1 percent.
Sung Won Sohn, an economist with the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, suggested the growth in the automotive component would not continue. "Due to slackening car sales, Detroit already is cutting back production of 1992 models," he said.
President Bush cited the report as one of several recent economic trends that look good, saying industrial production "has risen for five straight months."
In an accompanying report on capacity utilization, the Fed said the operating rate of the nation's factories, mines and utilities slipped one-tenth of a percentage point, to 79.7 percent.
After falling for six months through March, industrial production rebounded from the recession, including a 9 percent gain in May. It remained at 8 percent in June before slowing to 6 percent in July.
At the same time, the housing sector and consumer spending remained sluggish, leading many analysts to suggest the industrial sector was in the unusual role of leading the economic recovery. But the flat performance in August showed output was weaker than first thought.
Production at factories manufacturing both durable and nondurable goods advanced five-tenths of 1 percent in September after remaining flat in August and rising eight-tenths of 1 percent in July.
Durable goods output gained eight-tenths of 1 percent after falling one-tenth of 1 percent a month earlier. These are usually expensive goods ranging from cars to computers that are expected to last more than three years.
Production of nondurable goods like chemicals and clothing were flat, however, following a two-tenths of 1 percent advance in the previous month.
Mining output lost another nine-tenths of 1 percent after plummeting 1.2 percent in August. Utility production plunged 2.5 percent after a four-tenths of 1 percent gain.
The Fed said its industrial production index in September stood at 108.1 percent of its 1987 base of 100.

Times Co. Says Its Income Dropped 79% in 3d Quarter

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
The New York Times Company reported yesterday that net income in the third quarter fell 79 percent, to $1.9 million, or 3 cents a share, from $9.2 million, or 12 cents a share, for the third quarter of 1990.
Revenue for the quarter dropped 6.5 percent, to $393.4 million from $420.7 million. 
 The company said the principal reason for the drop was a continuing decline in advertising linage at The New York Times because of the national recession and New York City's weak economy.
Profit for the newspaper group, consisting of The New York Times, 32 regional papers and a 50 percent interest in The International Herald Tribune, fell to $10.1 million on revenues of $289.8 million from $19.6 million on revenues of $320.6 million.
Advertising linage at The New York Times in the third quarter declined 16.4 percent from the period in 1990.
 
Market Share Gained
 The advertising categories hurt most were help wanted, down 47 percent, and real estate, down 24 percent. But the company said it had gained market share in both categories and remained the market leader.
The company said that daily and Sunday circulation reached record highs in the quarter.
For the six months ended Sept. 30, The Times reported to the Audit Bureau of Circulations an average daily circulation of 1,114,800, a gain of 6,400, and Sunday circulation of 1,700,800, an increase of 13,800.
Circulation at the company's 32 regional newspapers was also up slightly, while advertising linage for the group declined 5.1 percent in the quarter from the 1990 quarter.
The company's magazine group reported an improvement in operating performance for the quarter with a loss of $900,000 on revenues of $85.3 million, compared with a loss of $2.3 million on revenues of $81.1 million a year ago.
Lower costs associated with the July 1989 acquisition of McCall's magazine were given as the principal reason for the improved results.
 
Broadcast Operations
 The company's broadcast operations had an operating profit for the quarter of $2.9 million on revenues of $18.2 million, compared with profits of $3.3 million on revenues of $19.1 million for the quarter in 1990.
After-tax earnings in the forest products group were $1.5 million, compared with $2.4 million for the quarter last year. The decline was attributed to higher discounts on newsprint and an unfavorable Canadian currency exchange rate.
In August, the company and the Kimberly-Clark Corporation agreed in principle to give their shares in the Spruce Falls Power and Paper Company to the company's employees.
Net interest expense rose to $7.7 million for the quarter, compared with $4.8 million last year at this time. The increase came principally because interest on a new plant in Edison, N.J., which was completed in 1990, is now being added to current interest expenses. Previously it was added to the cost of building the plant.
The company said the highly automated color printing plant in Edison would not begin operating until current labor negotiations with several unions were resolved. Depreciation of the building began in 1989, but depreciation of the equipment will not begin until the plant goes into operation.
In American Stock Exchange trading yesterday, the share price of The New York Times class A common stock was unchanged at $20. The earnings were released after the market closed.

HEADLINE: Trade Gap Widened In August

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
After shrinking sharply in the first half of 1991, the merchandise trade deficit swelled in August as foreigners unexpectedly slowed their buying of American goods.
The deficit widened by $1 billion, to $6.8 billion, its highest level in seven months. It had dropped as low as $3.8 billion in June. 
 Trade deficits typically widen in economic recoveries as Americans buy more imported goods. Economists had been expecting imports to climb in August, but they also anticipated exports would remain steady. The combination would have been a healthy sign for the United States recovery.
Instead, exports fell by about $1 billion, to $34.2 billion, and imports, at $40.9 billion, were basically flat. Exports had been hovering around a $35 billion since April.
 
Sense of Lost Momentum
 The drop in exports, along with a small rise recorded for industrial production in September, reinforced the worrisome sense that the economic recovery lost momentum after midsummer.
"It strengthens the case for lower interest rates," said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services.
But while economists expect the trade deficit to widen further in coming months, they also expect the August pattern of declining exports and stagnant imports to change. "It's always very dangerous to overreact to one month's numbers," Mr. Hale said, referring to the bumpy nature of monthly trade data.
In particular, exports, which have been one of the economy's few bright spots, should resume their growth, several forecasters said.
 
'I Don't See Anything Wrong'
 "I don't see anything wrong with exports," said David Rolley, an international economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill.
Even with the August drop, exports are up 5 percent from a year earlier. And the details of the export report, Mr. Rolley said, were less discouraging. Capital goods exports, nearly 40 percent of United States exports, edged down to $13.3 billion because of slower aircraft deliveries. But they were still substantially higher than last winter.
Similarly, industrial materials exports, which encompass everything from perfume essences to paper, barely fell, slipping $60 million. And food shipments, which were supposed to decline with good harvests overseas, have remained within the range of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion as they have been since January.
Auto exports did drop but the decline mostly reflected a slowdown in shipments of parts and subassemblies to plants in Canada and Mexico. Their decline, Mr. Rolley said, mostly reflects the cautious production plans of Detroit carmakers.
A pickup in growth abroad should help United States exports in coming months. Even though Germany and Japan are beginning to wheeze, Mr. Rolley said, the Britain and Canada are coming out of their recessions. And not only do American companies sell more to the latter two countries than the former, but the economic rebounds in Britain and Canada are also apt to be stronger than the slowdowns in Germany and Japan.
 
Imports Likely to Grow
 Imports are likely to grow faster than exports, Mr. Hale said, as the United States economy expands and business stops cutting inventories. Indeed, although they did not rise in August, imports are already $2 billion higher than they were in June.
Machinery and equipment imports fell by $500 million in August. But capital goods imports have been fluctuating along a flat trend all year, reflecting, most likely, flat capital equipment spending by American businesses.
What is noteworthy is that imports of industrial materials actually rose in August, as did imports of foreign cars, by a total together of nearly $900 million. And imports of other consumer goods, not including food -- which dipped from a very strong July level -- were still 7 percent higher than in June.
"What you're seeing is an import revival as the inventory cycle comes to an end," Mr. Rolley said. "Business has been meeting consumer demand out of inventories, so you didn't need to import much. That game's over."
Inventories, which were shrinking at roughly the rate of half a percentage point a month last winter and spring, basically held steady in July and August. Economists say the common explanation both for higher imports and September's five-tenths of a percent rise in factory production is that businesses have stopped depleting inventories.
This year's merchandise trade deficit, which has averaged $64 billion at an annual rate in the first eight months of 1991, is down sharply from last year's $102 billion.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Long-Term Rates Are Up Sharply

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Long-term interest rates rose sharply yesterday, as investors dumped large amounts of Treasury securities after an unexpectedly bad inflation report was released by the Government.
In fact, the selloff began minutes before consumer price data were released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics at 8:30 A.M., Eastern daylight time. That led some traders to voice suspicions that the contents of the report had been leaked. 
 The report showed the Consumer Price Index rose by four-tenths of a percent in September, and four-tenths of a percent when energy and food prices are excluded.
The rise was about twice as large as most Wall Street economists had anticipated.
 
Sell Order Begin to Surface
 Traders said that at 8:28 sell orders began to appear at the Chicago Board of Trade, where Treasury bond futures are traded. The selling quickly spilled over into the cash market.
As a result of the selling, traders said that bond prices had fallen about 10/32 before the number was released.
"I can't prove it, but I think some guys had the number," one government bond trader said. "I think there should be an investigation."
Patrick Jackman, chief economist for the Consumer Price Index at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the sudden move in prices came to his attention early in the day.
"We did some extensive checking," Mr. Jackman said. "We don't know why the bond market reacted as if it had prior information. To the extent that we can determine, it wasn't because it was released early."
Mr. Jackman said that while release of the consumer price statistics is embargoed until 8:30 A.M., major news organizations, primarily television and radio stations, receive the report early.
"At least three times in the past couple of years news organizations have inadvertently released the information a couple of minutes early," he said.
Mr. Jackman said that based on his review the consumer price data released yesterday were not put on the air before the embargo was lifted.
Mr. Jackman said the policy of providing the information early to news organizations would be reviewed.
Bloated dealer inventories had much to do with the market's virulent reaction to the inflation report, analysts said. The numbers also appeared to erase the widely held notion that the Federal Reserve Board was on the verge of easing monetary policy.
"A Fed ease had been completely built in to the market's mind," one government bond trader said. "Now it appears there will be no ease for a month or so. With huge amounts of supply coming over the next few weeks, it is time to wake up and smell the coffee."
Between now and the middle of November dealers will be asked to place bids on around $50 billion worth of Treasury securities at a variety of debt sales, including the quarterly refunding auctions.
Samuel Kahan, chief financial economist at Fuji Securities Inc. in Chicago, said: "The inflation report wasn't as bad as it appeared, and the market's reaction was overblown. But when investors are fully invested, they are vulnerable to adverse numbers."
Aside from the inflation report, market participants also reacted negatively to a report from the Federal Reserve Board that showed that all three aggregates of the nation's money supply rose much more sharply during the week ended Oct. 7 than analysts had anticipated.
The selloff in the secondary market for Treasury securities was most pronounced among long-term notes and bonds.
By late in the day, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 101 1/4, down nearly 1 1/2 points, or just under $15 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, to yield 8.01 percent. Late Wednesday the benchmark bond was offered at a price to yield 7.87 percent.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 102 1/8, down 29/32, to yield 7.56 percent. And prices of the 6 1/8 percent two-year notes fell by 7/32, to 100 9/32, to yield 5.96 percent.
Bids at an auction of one-year Treasury bills produced an average yield of 5.42 percent, down from an average rate of 5.26 percent at the last one-year bill sale on Sept. 19.
In the secondary market for Treasury bills, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.05 percent, up 10 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by 9 basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.08 percent.
In its money report, the Fed said that all three monetary aggregates rose during the week ended Oct. 7.
M-2, the aggregate most closely monitored by the Fed, rose by $4.5 billion, a much bigger increase than expected.
But analysts said that even with the increase, M-2 growth since the fourth quarter of 1990 remains below the 2.5 percent increase that is the low end of the Fed's target growth range for the year.
"The rise suggests that M-2 growth will be flat to up slightly" in October, said Wayne Smith, an economist at Reid Thunberg & Company, an investment advisory firm in Westport, Conn., "But I don't see this signalling any improvement."

HEADLINE: A.T.&T. Loses $1.8 Billion; Other Phone Results Mixed

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
A.T.& T. and MCI, the nation's top long-distance companies, yesterday reported slow third-quarter revenue growth, with a huge loss at A.T.& T. because of one-time charges and an earnings gain at MCI. Three of the regional Bell operating companies reported mixed results, with profits off at Nynex and up at BellSouth and Southwestern Bell.
Analysts said A.T.& T.'s performance was surprisingly strong, despite the reported net loss of $1.8 billion. The loss was entirely attributable to previously reported one-time charges, mostly related to its acquistion of the NCR Corporation. MCI apparently gained a small amount of market share in the quarter, analysts said, but at the expense of smaller competitors.
The weak economy was apparent in both the volume of calling and the rate of new line installation reported by the three "Baby Bells." "From a telephone industry perspective, the recession is still with us," said Joel Gross, who follows the companies for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
Following are the details of the companies' results:
 
A.T.& T.
 One-time charges resulting from the takeover of NCR reduced net income for the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in the quarterby nearly $2.65 billion, producing a net loss of $1.8 billion, compared with combined profits for the two companies of $803 million, or 62 cents a share, a year ago. Combined revenues rose 1.2 percent, to more than $11.04 billion, from $10.91 billion in the third quarter of 1990.
Nearly all of A.T.& T.'s operating profits for the quarter came from the telephone business. The company's third-quarter net profits from what it owned before acquiring NCR rose 13.5 percent, to $808 million, from $712 million a year ago. About a fourth of that improvement was attributable to a one-time gain on the sale of Sun Microsystems stock. The rest came from strong operating revenues, including improved product and service margins.
By contrast, NCR's operating earnings were just $40 million on revenues of $1.38 billion, compared with $91 million on sales of $1.53 billion a year ago. A.T.& T. attributed the decline to "general softness" in computer markets and the negative impact of a stronger dollar.
"The good news in all these numbers is the continuing strength of A.T.& T.'s long-distance business and the strong actions we're taking for future earnings growth," said Robert E. Allen, A.T.& T.'s chairman and chief executive.
Phone service sales rose 5.1 percent, to $5.24 billion, on volume growth of 6.5 percent. The company said that "800" numbers, WATS services and international and residential calling led the growth. Product and systems sales declined 5.5 percent, to $3.81 billion, from 1990's third quarter, mostly because of a 17.3 percent decline in computer sales to $818 million.
Analysts believe A.T.& T., which is estimated to have between 63 and 65 percent of the long-distance market, has maintained that share.
A.T.& T.'s write-off will include the severance costs for 14,000 employees to be laid off by the beginning of 1994.
A.T.& T. shares fell 12.5 cents yesterday, to $39, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
MCI
 The MCI Communications Corporation earned $133 million, or 51 cents a share, in the third quarter, compared with a loss of $176 million in the 1990 period, when the company took a one-time charge of $550 million for modernization of its network.
The Washington-based long-distance company's revenues were $2.15 billion, up 7.5 percent from $2 billion a year ago. The revenue gains came on a 12.4 percent increase in calling volume in the last year.
Excluding the impact of last year's special charge, MCI's third-quarter operating earnings in 1990 would have been $334 million, nearly 22 percent higher than the $274 million reported yesterday for the recently completed quarter. That gap highlights how heavily MCI has been spending on programs to build market share, particularly a promotion gives 20 percent discounts to customers who create a personal circle of telephone contacts, all using MCI. Marketing and operations expenses for the recent quarter were $645 million, up 21 percent from a year ago.
MCI's shares lost $3, to $27.125, in over-the-counter trading. The trading reflected, in addition to earnings, a report that I.B.M. was exploring the potential private sale of its $400 million in MCI preferred stock. I.B.M. said last night that the possible sale does not represent a loss of confidence in MCI.
 
Nynex
 The Nynex Corporation said that it earned $291.8 million, or $1.44 a share, in the quarter, down 1.7 percent from $296.7 million, or $1.50 a share, last year. Revenues for the White Plains, N.Y.-based parent of New York Telephone and New England Telephone fell 3.5 percent, to $3.27 billion, from $3.39 billion a year ago.
Nynex's operating income actually rose 3.3 percent, to $600.2 million, from $580.9 million a year ago, but that increase did not compensate for a $24 million rise in taxes and interest expenses. Operating expenses were $2.67 billion, down nearly 5 percent from $2.81 billion a year ago.
Nynex is currently in the midst of a program to reduce both its hourly and managerial work forces. A one-time charge for the cost of the program will be estimated and taken against earnings in the current quarter, the company said yesterday.
Nynex's shares rose 12.5 cents, closing at $75.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
BellSouth
 The BellSouth Corporation, based in Atlanta, said net income fell 12.5 percent, to $352.4 million, or 73 cents a share, from $402.9 million, or 84 cents a share, a year ago. But the current quarter included $42.9 million in one-time charges for an early-retirement program and another $11.4 million charge stemming from accounting changes in the company's cellular telephone operations. Without the one-time charges, earnings were essentially unchanged from a year ago.
Revenues rose 2.3 percent, to $3.63 billion, from $3.55 billion a year ago. The number of access lines rose 2.9 percent, to 513,000, in the the last year.
BellSouth said that continuing rate reductions, a weak economy, competition and the costs of its rapidly expanding investment in cellular and paging services affected its earnings.
On the Big Board, BellSouth stock fell 37.5 cents, to $46.875.
 
Southwestern Bell
 The Southwestern Bell Corporation said that net income for the quarter rose 12.2 percent, to $363.1 million, or $1.21 a share, from $323.6 million, or $1.08 a share, a year ago.
The strong income gain came despite an increase of just more than 2 percent in revenues, to $2.42 billion, from $2.37 billion in the 1990 period.
"Strengthened performance by our cellular and Yellow Pages subsidiaries contributed substantially to our growth," said Edward E. Whitacre Jr., the St. Louis-based company's chairman and chief executive.
Analysts said the figures represented a mildly pleasant surprise.
Southwestern Bell stock rose 37.5 cents, to $56.375, on the Big Board.

HEADLINE: Dow Slips 8.72, Ending 5-Day Rally

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
After scaling new peaks on Wednesday, stocks finished down yesterday, as falling bond prices and disappointing earnings halted the market's five-day rally.
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 8.72 from Wednesday's record to 3,053, and the New York Stock Exchange composite was off by 0.25 to close at 215.80. 
 Blue-chip stocks were also weakened by the bond market, which collapsed on a stronger-than-expected consumer price number.
Gene J. Seagle, director of technical research at Gruntal & Company, noted that the market's 115-point rise over the previous five sessions may have gotten a bit too much for the market in the face of inflation and a weak bond market.
"The economic data proved an excuse for some buyers to take a respite from the market," he said. Mr. Seagle said, however, that the Dow could reach the 3,150 and 3,200 levels before the end of the year, and even 3,400 by year's end, as a result of the Fed's easing of credit conditions.
 
Big Board Volume Heavy
 Volume on the Big Board was heavy at 206 million shares, but was down from 225.4 million shares traded on Wednesday. Losers outpaced gainers 846 to 776.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks slipped 0.88, to 391.92, while the American Stock Exchange composite was off 0.80, to 381.11.
In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index was off 4.67 from Wednesday's high, to 536.27.
The stock market was under pressure from bonds most of yesterday, as the Dow took initial losses and recovered some by its close. Traders said the market's strong momentum going into yesterday might have limited the day's losses, as trading was choppy, and the Dow fluctuated within a 20-point range.
A surprisingly strong consumer price report raised concern that the Fed might delay easing rates, as weakness in technology and consumer product stocks also undermined the market. Some analysts called yesterday's market pullback "a healthy correction."
Technology stocks came under pressure after Digital Equipment's earnings came in at the low end of analysts' estimates. The stock fell by 3, to 57 1/4, while Microsoft fell 1 1/2 to close at 89 1/4 and Intel fell 1 3/4, to 43 5/8.
Traders said major airline issues traded down, as County NatWest USA downgraded the group to underperform from hold. UAL fell 1 3/8, to 134 5/8; AMR dropped by 1 1/8, to 64 1/2, and Delta Air Lines fell 1 1/2, to 68 1/2.
Analysts at Piper, Jaffray and Paine Webber repeated their buy recommendations on St. Jude Medical. The stock fell 2 7/8, to 49 7/8, after reporting earnings that were below Street expectations. The analysts called the selloff in the stock an overreaction. Edward Mutsch, analyst at Paine Webber, noted that the company returns 40 percent of every sales dollar to the bottom line, compared with about 5 cents at most other American companies.
AST Research, a manufacturer of personal computer systems, fell 4, to 28, after the company's first-quarter earnings dipped below some analysts' estimates, and it said it was cutting prices on its premium executive notebook line by 30 percent.
Citicorp and Wells Fargo shares were mixed, as George M. Salem, analyst at Prudential Securities, cut his earnings forecast on both banks. He was a little harder on Wells Fargo, which dropped 1 3/8, because he says the California commercial and residential real estate prices are in for a major downturn. Citicorp, which he did not reduce badly, led the active list and was up 1/4, to 12.

HEADLINE: Slack Credit Demand Seen

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
Bankers told President Bush today that slack demand and not excess regulation was responsible for the slowdown in bank lending.
The message delivered to President Bush by a dozen banking executives at a White House meeting came a week after the Administration issued proposals intended to prod banks into making more loans. 
 The package would provide a new way for banks to appeal unfavorable examinations and ease other rules.
After today's meeting, bankers said they told President Bush that they welcomed the initiative but cautioned that it would not get at the root causes of the slow growth in bank lending that some analysts believe is holding back the economic recovery.
"Bankers are quite willing to extend credit, are eager to extend credit, to anyone that is halfway creditworthy," said John Medlin, chairman of the First Wachovia Corporation of Winston-Salem, N.C. "There is simply not the demand coming forward."
And Hugh McColl, chairman of the NCNB Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., said, "We told him we felt loan demand was very slack, that people were nervous."
Nevertheless, the bankers said Mr. Bush's proposals could contribute to easing the credit squeeze. Alan Tubbs, president of the American Bankers Association, said, "We felt his initiatives were certainly headed in the right direction."

HEADLINE: Biggest Increase For Price Index In Eight Months

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
In an inflation report that many investors and analysts found disturbing, the Consumer Price Index climbed four-tenths of 1 percent in September, the biggest increase since January.
Prices for food and energy, which have been restraining the inflation rate for much of 1991, were two of the main factors pushing it up last month. 
 The broadly based increase was higher than generally expected and contributed to a big selloff in the bond market, raising interest rates. The rationale was that the Federal Reserve would be less inclined in the face of fresh evidence of inflationary pressure to take further steps to ease interest rates as a stimulus to the economy.
 
3.7% Rise in Benefits
 The report on the Consumer Price Index also means that nearly 50 million recipients of Social Security and other Federal benefits tied to inflation will get increases of 3.7 percent in January. This is the smallest adjustment in five years. It is the amount by which prices in the third quarter exceeded those a year earlier. [Page A10.]
But while the inflation figures captured much of the attention, a sizable proportion of economists found other indicators published today, particularly industrial output, of equal if not greater importance. Industrial production rose a scant one-tenth of 1 percent in September, the Federal Reserve reported, and what was initially reported as a three-tenths of 1 percent advance for August was revised to zero. Although industrial production covers only about one-third of the economy, it is an important indicator because it reflects the part of the economy most sensitive to the business cycle.
"The recovery to date has been modest, and now it looks even more modest than we thought," said Lyle E. Gramley, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association. "We have very little momentum going into the fourth quarter."
Mr. Gramley, a former research chief and board member at the Fed, said that while there was no danger the economy would slip back into recession, the usual forces to sustain recovery were missing. He also said the data would seem to increase, not reduce, the chances for additional Fed rate-cutting.
"I'm a little puzzled about what it is they're waiting for," he said.
At a briefing for reporters, Michael J. Boskin, the President's chief economic adviser, said that the Fed "may well have to consider further action" if neither the economy nor the nation's money supply perk up.
Figures on international trade published today for August showed the American deficit rising for the second straight month, to $6.8 billion, with exports down 3 percent. Exports, which have been relatively robust of late, are counted upon to help sustain the recovery, which most economists believe began during late spring or early summer.
In still another report, the Labor Department said that initial claims for state unemployment insurance fell 13,000 in the first week of October, to 423,000, but continued to rise a bit on the four-week moving average that many analysts use to smooth out gyrations. That average rose to a seasonally adjusted 432,500 from 427,000.
Michael W. Keran, chief economist at the Prudential Insurance Company, joined Mr. Gramley in minimizing the significance of the inflation figures and contending that the Federal Reserve will pay more attention to the weak production results.
 
No Change in Outlook
 "We don't think this represents a major change in our outlook about inflation," he said. In any event, Mr. Keran added, the Fed's long-run strategy may be to bring down inflation, "but its short-run strategy is to not have recession."
On the other hand, Paul W. Boltz and Norman Robertson, chief economists for T. Rowe Price Associates and the Mellon Bank, respectively, found the inflation data worrisome.
"This is an alert," Mr. Boltz said, that modest inflation is unlikely to continue into the new year. Noting the turnaround in food and energy prices, he said, "They stopped helping -- and there it was." He also argued today that the recovery "is on increasingly firm footing."
Mr. Robertson said he was disturbed by both the inflation and output data, which reflect what he called a weak and hesitant economy and inflation so stubborn that it flares up in a protracted period of recession and sub-par growth.
The report on consumer inflation came as such a surprise today in part because it followed a favorable reading last week on producer prices, which rose only one-tenth of a percent in September.
 
Rise Without Food and Energy
 Even without food and energy, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers rose four-tenths of 1 percent last month, the fourth straight advance of this size. A leading contributor was a five-tenths of 1 percent jump in housing, which makes up 41 percent of the index and showed no price change in August.
Both renters' costs and homeowners' costs rose five-tenths of 1 percent, more than offsetting a three-tenths of 1 percent decline for maintenance and repairs. The price of household fuels and utilities turned up, rising six-tenths of 1 percent over all, with fuel oil up 1.7 percent, natural gas up 1.4 percent electricity up seven-tenths of 1 percent. Household furnishings and operations rose two-tenths of 1 percent following a small decline in August.
Food prices rose just one-tenth of 1 percent, but this followed two months of larger declines. Fresh fruits jumped 3.1 percent, dairy products advanced six-tenths of 1 percent and pork and fish prices also moved up. Prices for beef, poultry and eggs, however, fell.
 
Surge in Motor Fuels
 In transportation, a two-tenths of 1 percent advance was mainly attributable to a nine-tenths of 1 percent surge in motor fuels. A drop in automobile finance charges held the costs of new cars to three-tenths of 1 percent and used-car prices fell. Public transportation dropped seven-tenths of 1 percent, reflecting a 1.4 percent cut in airline fares.
Clothing fell four-tenths of 1 percent following two large increases, the result of earlier-than-usual introductions of fall and winter wear.
The cost of medical care continued to bound ahead, rising seven-tenths of 1 percent to a level 8.4 percent above that of September 1990.
In the entertainment and other goods and services categories, prices of sporting goods, fees for participant sports, tuitions and other school fees and tobacco products all moved up by more than 1 percent last month.
Viewed another way, services in the C.P.I. rose five-tenths of 1 percent, compared with three-tenths of 1 percent in August, while commodities rose two-tenths of 1 percent for the third straight month.
For the third quarter, prices rose at an annual rate of 3.3 percent, up from 3 percent in the second quarter and 2.4 percent in the first, a combined rate less than half the 6.6 percent pace during the first nine months of 1990.
The the index covering all urban consumers now stands at 137.2. This means that a basket of goods and services that cost $10 in 1982-84 now costs $13.72.

HEADLINE: Portrait of Texas Killer: Impatient and Troubled

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELTON, Tex., Oct. 17

 BODY:
At 5:30 Wednesday morning, the last day of his troubled life, George J. Hennard walked into a convenience store here and bought a sausage and biscuit sandwich, orange juice, a candy bar, a newspaper and a pack of Old Fashioned Dunkers doughnuts.
He had been buying breakfast at the store six mornings a week for months, but Wednesday there was something different about the darkly handsome son of a former Army doctor. 
 "George never smiled when he came in here," a clerk at the store, Mary Mead, said today. "He just seemed like he had the world on his shoulders. He was a loner. He never talked. But yesterday he seemed almost calm, even a little friendly, for the only time I can remember. Usually, I was scared of him."
Seven hours later, Mr. Hennard smashed his light-blue pickup truck through a plate glass window at Luby's cafeteria in nearby Killeen and methodically shot to death 22 people. Then, wounded by police officers who had moved in, he put an automatic pistol to his head and killed himself.
 
Search for a Motive
 As investigators tried to piece together a motive for the slayings, former co-workers and acquaintances today described Mr. Hennard, a 35-year-old merchant seaman who lost his job after marijuana was found in his room on a ship, in similar words: "loner," "combative," "rude," "impatient," "troubled."
Tim Snyder of Killeen said he and Mr. Hennard, whom he called "Big George," were "drinking buddies."
"He wasn't particular about what he drank," Mr. Snyder said. "When he was drunk, that's when he'd talk crazy. But he's a nice guy when he's sober."
An autopsy will determine if Mr. Hennard had used drugs or alcohol before the shooting.
Today, as investigators continued to sift through details of Mr. Hennard's life and the bloody debris at the cafeteria, a fuller portrait of the killer began to emerge.
But it is only a portrait, not an explanation for the worst mass shooting in the United States. The chances that such an event could be explained may have died along with Mr. Hennard and the 22 people he killed in 10 minutes on a sunny afternoon in Texas.
Francis L. Giacomozzi, the police chief of Killeen, a town of 63,500 people that borders the nation's largest military base, Fort Hood, said investigators were pursuing the prospect that Mr. Hennard might have been driven by an intense hostility toward women.
"That is one avenue we are pursuing," Chief Giacomozzi told reporters this morning in Killeen. "A greater percentage of women were killed or injured." Fourteen of the 22 people killed, many at close range, were women, as were many of the 23 people wounded. Several people who survived said Mr. Hennard passed over men to shoot women.
 
Two Remain Critical
 Two of the wounded, Lou Carabello, 42 years old, and Kriemhild Davis, 62, were listed in critical condition today at Darnall Army Community Hospital at Fort Hood. Mr. Hennard's father, a former Army colonel, was the hospital's commanding officer in 1978 and 1979, Army records show.
A 19-year-old dishwasher, Mark Matthews, who had been missing since the shooting, was found unharmed at 7 A.M. today, sleeping on a conveyor belt inside an idled dishwasher in the restaurant's kitchen. "He said he never felt safe enough to get out of there," said Luby's chief executive, Ralph (Pete) Erben.
Mr. Hennard's father, Georges, was born in Switzerland, where he received his medical degree, and speaks French, German and Spanish as well as English, the Army said. His mother, Jeanne, once sold antiques. The Hennards and their four children moved a a dozen times from base to base by the time George J. was 18 years old.
Born in Pennsylvania, Mr. Hennard graduated from Las Cruces High School in New Mexico in 1974 while his family was living on the White Sands Missile base there. Mr. Hennard had transferred to Las Cruces from Bangor Area High School in Five Points, Pa.
The Hennards moved to Fort Hood later in 1974. In 1980, the family purchased a large red brick house with six white columns in front and a swimming pool in an expansive backyard in Belton, several miles of east of Killeen.
A few years later, Mr. Hennard's parents divorced. Dr. Hennard moved away from the area, and now lives in Houston. Mrs. Hennard moved to Henderson, Nev., where she works as a manicurist at Miss Faye Nail Salon.
Her son also apparently lived at least part time in Henderson. A neighbor of Mr. Hennard there, Beverly White, said today: "He didn't seem out of line or out of the ordinary at all to me. I certainly wasn't afraid of him."
Mrs. Hennard also kept the house in Belton and Mr. Hennard frequently lived there for extended periods.
"Whenever he was home, he was in the yard working," said George Rakowitz, the Hennards' postman. "He was always in the yard, raking leaves, cleaning things up. He was a workaholic. He was always doing something."
And when he worked in the yard or when he washed his shiny blue pickup truck, he often went shirtless, showing off his muscles and a tattoo, according to a neighbor, Jana Jernigan.
A police spokesman in Belton said Mr. Hennard appeared to have been unemployed at the time of the shooting. But for most of his adult life, Mr. Hennard earned his living on the high seas in the Merchant Marine.
Isaiah (Ike) R. Williams, a port agent for the national maritime union in Wilmington, Calif., said Mr. Hennard first shipped out from the port on the John Lykes on Nov. 9, 1981.
As an able bodied seaman, Mr. Hennard worked on deck, steering the ship while on watch or standing guard when in port, Mr. Williams said. He particularly liked to sail on vessels bound for the Far East, the agent said.
"He was very loud," Mr. Williams said. "And he appeared to be combative at times. He would come in with a very cold look and be very argumentative, loud, boisterous, sometimes cursing and swearing."
 
Trouble on the Job
 Mr. Williams said Mr. Hennard did not last long on any ship and worked for a lot of people over the years.
On May 11, 1989, Mr. Hennard was taken off a ship in Oakland, Calif., after authorities found drugs in his room. Mr. Hennard's seaman's papers were confiscated by the Coast Guard. A few months later, he entered a drug treatment program in Houston.
In 1990, Mr. Hennard called Mr. Williams, saying he needed a letter of recommendation so he could regain his papers and return to sea.
"I don't recall having given him one," Mr. Williams said.
Mr. Hennard's lawyer, David McCormack said his client learned in mid-February that his attempt to be reinstated had been denied.
"He desperately wanted to get his license back and go back to sea," said Mr. McCormack.
On Feb. 21, Mike's Gun House in Henderson, Nev., sold a Glock 17 pistol to a member of the Hennard family, said a spokesman for Glock Inc. in Marietta, Ga.
The shop, owned by Michael O'Donoghue, on March 29 also sold the Ruger semiautomatic that Mr. Hennard used along with the Glock in the shooting, The Associated Press reported. The news service reported that a Las Vegas undersheriff, Eric Cooper, said that Mr. Hennard signed for both guns and listed himself as unemployed on both registrations.
 
Signs of Trouble
 There have been more recent signs of trouble. Four months ago, Miss Jernigan, 19, and her married sister, Jill Fritz, 23, received a five-page letter from Mr. Hennard, whom Miss Jernigan described as a "weird, good looking guy" in the big red house up the street.
Apparently, Mr. Hennard had been admiring the two sisters when stayed at his mother's house in Belton. He did not know their names and addressed them as "Stacee" and "Robin." He also sent the letter to a neighbor's house by mistake.
In the letter, he complained about women being "vipers" but praised the sisters' high virtue.
"It is very ironic about Belton, Texas. I found the best and worst in women there," the letter said. "I will no matter what, prevail over the female vipers in those two rinky-dink towns in Texas. I will prevail in the bitter end."
About a week after the letter arrived, Miss Jernigan and her mother, Jane Bugg, were taking a walk on a Sunday evening when they heard Mr. Hennard screaming at a women in the street.
"He was screaming obscenities, some words I never heard before," Miss Jernigan said. "He was screaming he couldn't believe she had gone to Killeen the night before and danced with all those G.I.'s."
She said the woman tried to walk away but each time Mr. Hennard grabbed her by the wrist and dragged her back. Several times, she said, he raised his hand as if to strike the woman, but he did not.
The red brick house, where Mr. Hennard spent so much time, was put up for sale several weeks ago by Jeanne Hennard, and Mr. Hennard was reportedly reluctant to see it sold.
Two months ago, he walked into the convenience store in Belton to buy breakfast. Mrs. Mead, the clerk, recalled that he leaned over the counter and told her: "I want you to tell everybody, if they don't quit messing around my house something awful is going to happen."
Mrs. Mead's daughter-in-law, Nancy, who owns the store with her husband, said Mr. Hennard "made us all nervous whenever he came in."
She said a couple of months ago, a young woman was writing a check at the counter in the store when Mr. Hennard walked in. He pushed the woman aside and put a soda he was purchasing onto the counter.
"He didn't apologize or say excuse me or nothing," she remembered. "He just pushed her out of the way, paid his bill and left. He acted like he hated everybody."

HEADLINE: The Thomas Confirmation;
Hill's Case Is Divisive To Women

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, Oct. 16

 BODY:
Rebecca Moody, a 59-year-old retired secretary, watched the Anita F. Hill-Clarence Thomas drama on television and came away thinking "it's unbelievable that a woman couldn't stop something like that at its inception."
Tammie Lee, a 33-year-old worker at the House of Ruth, the shelter for battered women here, said: "I was harassed, and I nipped it in the bud; I stopped it right then and there. One guy said, 'I see you don't take any guff.' " 
 Theresa Lowry, 52, an elementary school teacher, asked: "Wouldn't you haul off and poke a guy in the mouth if he spoke in that manner?"
In the blue-collar corners of this city, the women who keep house or bag groceries, nurse patients or work in construction have little sympathy with Professor Hill.
They are angered by sexual harassment, which many say they have experienced. But that anger does not translate into support for the soft-spoken law professor who accused the Supreme Court nominee of intimidating her with graphic discussions of pornographic films a decade ago.
 
Matter of Disrespect
 In part, it is a matter of disbelief. But perhaps in greater measure, it is a matter of disrespect. The feelings of these women provide some clue to the reasons why, although nearly 40 percent of American women said in recent polls that they had been sexually harassed, only about 25 percent of women said they believed Professor Hill's versions of the events more than Judge Thomas's.
Interviews with about 20 women in Baltimore in a variety of occupations showed sharp divisions, with lawyers, human services professionals and politicians showing strong sympathy for Professor Hill. At a retreat Thursday for all the women in the State Legislature, all but one believed her version of the events, said State Senator Paula Hollinger of Baltimore.
But white and black women from the low-rent neighborhoods of this city look at Professor Hill as cowboys might look at a dude adrift in Dodge City, their incredulity spiced with contempt. The workplace they know is an untamed frontier where bad men roam and smart women learn how to take care of themselves or leave.
 
'Women Against Women'
 Roberta Gayle, a radio talk-show host on WCBN here, calls the phenomenon WAW, or "women against women." Yet women here are not stuck in some pre-feminist time warp. About 46.5 percent of the work force in the Baltimore area is composed of women, slightly higher than the national average.
Forty-four members of the Maryland State Legislature, not quite one in four, are women. Gov. William Donald Schaefer made national headlines in February when he commuted the sentences of eight battered women convicted and imprisoned for attacking or killing the men who beat them.
But that does not mean Maryland is an oasis of enlightenment. Women in state government say that examples abound of demeaning conversations with men.
At the House of Ruth, which 14 years ago was founded as one of the country's first shelters for women beaten by their husbands or live-in partners, the executive director Carole Alexander was still shaking with anger over the hearings and the Senate's 52-to-48 vote confirming Judge Thomas as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.
"The potential for backlash here is very great," Ms. Alexander said. "For men inclined to minimize this problem, it'll enhance their minimization."
She said women who believe they can take care of such situations, when Professor Hill could not, will continue in this belief. She said this was mistake.
"If we minimize the issue of sexual harassment and say it's not a problem," she said, "we're sending a very very bad message to the community."
Her colleague, Judy Wolfer, 33, a lawyer who defends battered women on trial for attacking their partners, said: "If you have a case where the battered woman fights back, the last person you want on your jury is a formerly battered woman. She'll say: "I got myself out of it. Why didn't she?' "
Valerie Gebre-Amlak, who, like Ms. Lee, works at the center and sees its clients regularly, had far less sympathy for Professor Hill. "I might have stayed on one job, if I needed the money," she said. "I sure wouldn't have followed him to another job. I honestly think something happenned."
None of these women said that sexual harassment did not exist, and many said they believed Judge Thomas had said or done something to Professor Hill. Her story, in fact, made them talk about their own.
 
View From Another Era
 "There was a guy who was pinching my bottom at work years ago," said Honey Ashel, 48, who does volunteer work in Pikesville, a suburb just northwest of the Baltimore City line. "I waited, and eventually he started pinching someone else's bottom because he liked their's better."
Senator Hollinger said: "I know an elderly woman, 82 years old, who, after these hearings, told a friend for the first time about something. When she was 12 and just beginning to develop, a pair of men who lived in her building started chasing her one day. They chased her around the yard, grabbing at her breasts. She didn't tell anyone about it for 70 years, not until this week."
But only rarely did the personal experiences provoke feelings of empathy for Professor Hill.
"A lot of women do handle this sort of thing themselves," said Nancy Gregor, 43, a lawyer with the firm of Kramon & Graham. " But when you're younger, for some women it may be more difficult. You have to develop in some fashion a feeling of power. As you move on in life, you have some more resources to handle it."
Darby Carrington, 30, an unemployed construction engineer, said: "What he was supposed to have said to her, I've had said to me, jokingly, and I've had said seriously by people trying to get a reaction. You have to make sure you get across that you're a professional. If someone isn't willing to accept that, you make sure you're not in a room alone with him."
But some women like Ruth Ennis, the director of human resource services for PHH Fleet America, a subsidiary of the business services firm PHH Corporation, said that their work made Professor Hill's lack of reaction to what she said was harassment believeable.
"A number of things are hauntingly true in her testimony," said Ms. Ennis, who used to investigate sex harassment complaints in Jefferson County, Ky. "She was afraid of losing a career track, a person who would be a valuable resource to her networking. This is not her fault, but it shows the mark of an insecure person."
She added, "If what Professor Hill said was true, the man was not seeking a date, he was seeking to intimidate and control her. Sexual harassment is not an act of lust or a compliment or an attempt to get a date. It's an action of control. One should first and foremost say, 'No!' in a loud clear voice and mean it.

" Ms. Lee talked with a fellow worker, Valerie Gebre-Amlak.; Carole Alexander, director of a shelter for battered women, said, "If we minimize the issue of sexual harasment and say it's not a problem, we're sending a very very bad message to the community."

HEADLINE: Social Security Benefits to Go Up 3.7%

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
The 40 million Americans who receive Social Security benefits will get a 3.7 percent increase starting in January, the Government announced today. That is the smallest cost-of-living adjustment in five years.
The increase, while smaller than those allowed from 1988 through this year, is larger than the increases from 1984 through 1987. 
 Under Federal law, the increase, intended to help beneficiaries keep up with rising living costs, is automatic. It is determined by increases in the Consumer Price Index.
For retired workers, the new cost-of-living adjustment will increase the average Social Security check by $22 a month, to $629 from $607. For an elderly couple, both receiving benefits, the average monthly Social Security check will rise by $38, to $1,067 from $1,029.
 
Others to Get Increase
 The same 3.7 percent increase will raise payments to nearly 10 million people receiving benefits under other Federal programs. Among those who will receive the cost-of-living adjustment are 4.6 million aged, blind and disabled people enrolled in the Supplemental Security Income program; 2.2 million people who receive Civil Service retirement pay; 1.7 million people who get military retirement pay, and more than a million veterans who receive pensions based on financial need.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that these automatic increases will cost the Government at least $13.5 billion next year. Ten billion dollars of that amount is for Social Security. As a rule of thumb, each percentage point in the cost-of-living adjustment increases Federal spending for Social Security benefits by $2.7 billion a year, Social Security officials said.
The American Association of Retired Persons, which has 33 million members, said the cost-of-living adjustment was relatively small because overall inflation was comparatively low in the last 12 months.
"While low inflation is good news for most Americans, a 3.7 percent increase does not offset health-care costs that are rising at double or more the rate of overall inflation," said Horace B. Deets, executive director of the association. "Twenty-two dollars may not be enough for even one month's medicine, much less needed medical treatment." Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, generally does not pay the costs of drugs for people outside a hospital.
 
Rise in Medicare Premiums
 The monthly premium for Part B of Medicare, which covers doctors' services, will increase in January as a result of the comprehensive budget law approved last year by Congress and President Bush. The monthly premium, now $29.90, will rise to $31.80.
Conservative members of Congress have often proposed reducing the cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security and other benefit programs. But organizations representing the elderly have adamantly opposed such cuts, saying they would lead directly to an increase in poverty among the elderly, many of whom are heavily dependent on Social Security as a source of income.
In addition, spokesmen for the elderly note that many Social Security beneficiaries are children, disabled workers and nonelderly survivors of deceased workers. Of the 40.4 million Social Security recipients, 6.6 million are under 62 years old and four million are in the 62-to-64 age range.
Benefit programs that offer assistance to all people who meet certain eligibility criteria, account for more than 40 percent of all Federal spending. They account for $574 billion of $1.3 trillion in total outlays in the last 12 months, the budget office says.
Many such benefit programs grow steadily from year to year, largely insulated from the fierce debates in Congress over annual appropriations for the armed forces and domestic "discretionary" programs like highways, education and science.
The annual cost-of-living adjustment reflects the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index from the third-quarter of one year to the corresponding period of the next year.
Gwendolyn S. King, the Commissioner of Social Security, said the cost-of-living adjustment assured more than 40 million people that their "benefit checks will continue to allow them to pay for needed goods and services."
The maximum earnings subject to the Social Security payroll tax will rise next year to $55,500, from $53,400. Philip A. Gambino, a spokesman for the Social Security Administration, said this change would cause a tax increase for nine million people who earn more than $53,400 a year.
Eileen P. Sweeney, a lawyer at the National Senior Citizens Law Center, which represents many elderly poor people, said the automatic cost-of-living adjustment was "one of the best things Congress ever did for people who are elderly or disabled."
Social Security was created in 1935 and did not have an automatic cost-of-living adjustment until Congress established that mechanism in 1972. Before then Congress periodically legislated increases in benefits.
Although now seen as a factor driving up the cost of Social Security, the cost-of-living adjustment was originally adopted to control the growth of the program. The first automatic increases took effect in 1975.
P. Royal Shipp, senior specialist on social legislation at the Congressional Research Service, said indexing was "sought largely by conservatives as a means of curbing even larger ad hoc benefit increases" approved by Congress in previous years.

HEADLINE: Renewed Republican Call For Tax Cut Is Led by Bush

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
President Bush and Republican Congressional leaders argued today that the way to reduce unemployment was through a capital gains tax cut that would create more jobs, while Democrats renewed their effort to pass legislation extending unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless.
Politics dominated both arguments in the aftermath of Wednesday's Senate vote to sustain Mr. Bush's veto of a $6.5 billion Democratic bill to provide up to 20 weeks of additional benefits for people out of work for at least half a year. 
 Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip in the House, said Republicans "would go to the country very hard this fall and refuse to adjourn" until Congress acted on proposals for economic growth.
Mr. Gingrich said those proposals, which would go beyond the capital gains cut and include a smaller unemployment plan than the Democrats want, would be outlined next week and produced in legislative form as early as next week.
But House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, renewing the assertion that Democrats have consistently made since July, complained that Mr. Bush supported deficit spending to help foreigners but not jobless Americans. He called the Administration's jobless proposal "totally inadequate."
Mr. Bush renewed his calls for a capital gains tax cut in a televised address to the Associated Press Managing Editors' Association, which was meeting in Detroit. He said that "a capital gains tax cut will set off an explosion of small business formation" and "give our economy a much needed boost."
"It would raise real estate prices and cut the overall cost of the savings and loan cleanup," he said. "It would help people of imagination and drive."
The Bush view that a capital gains tax cut would stir a sluggish economy is disputed by many economists, and Republican enthusiasm for the issue has waxed and waned in recent months.
But Senate Republicans keep trying to raise the issue. That has led the Democrats to go to considerable lengths to keep any tax bill from coming up in the Senate, thus preventing the Republicans from seeking to amend it to cut capital gains taxes.
Mr. Bush also maintained that the economic "trends look good," although he acknowledged that "a lot of people are still hurting."
He said, "The unemployment rate in September fell to 6.7 percent, down three-tenths of a percent in three months and the lowest rate in nearly five years." In fact, the rate is not the lowest in five years; for all of 1990 it averaged 5.4 percent.
A White House spokesman said later the President meant "nearly five months."
Congressional Republicans and Mr. Foley agreed on one thing: that if the economy is recovering, it is doing so feebly. Mr. Foley called it "a recovery that either has not occurred or is the most technical and vapid and inactive recovery that we have seen in this century."
After meeting with Mr. Bush at the White House, Senator Phil Gramm, the Texan who heads the Senate Republican campaign committee, said of the economy, "We should recognize that if it did turn the corner, it didn't leave any skid marks."
Mr. Gramm maintained that what the country should do to bring recovery was to enact a growth package starting with cutting capital gains taxes, broadening the reach of Individual Retirement Accounts so they could be used to pay college tuition, make down payments on first homes, pay catastrophic medical charges and raise the limit on earnings by Social Security recipients. He also said that it was important to frame the plan in a way that would not increase the deficit.
Mr. Foley's focus was on the unemployed. He said Mr. Bush had been wrong to veto the extended benefits bill, and, reflecting the views of most House Democrats, insisted that any package ultimately adopted should be paid for by increasing the deficit. This would be permitted under last year's budget act with the declaration of an emergency.
His insistence on the emergency provision suggested there was not movement toward a compromise that would get checks to the jobless. He wants any extended benefits to be paid out of an $8 billion Federal trust fund created to pay the extended benefits to people who have been out of work for more than the 26 weeks that are covered in most states.
Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the Committee on Ways and Means, is planning to introduce another bill to help the unemployed in the next few days. It would pay extended benefits of up to 13 weeks in states with average unemployment of 7 percent or more and 7 weeks in all others. It would cover about one million people.

HEADLINE: Oklahoma School Plan Survives Vote

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
An Oklahoma referendum to repeal a $574 million education improvement plan produced the state's largest turnout ever for a special election, but after months of nasty debate, the result of Tuesday's vote surprised many: the referendum was defeated.
The plan, which voters retained by a tally of 428,204 to 361,293, was seen by education analysts as a national litmus test of states' resolve to finance education improvements in a weak economy. Although the plan survived the referendum, it created a maelstrom of debate. A month before the vote, the offices of the Oklahoma Taxpayers Union, one of two statewide citizens' groups opposed to the education plan, was firebombed. 
 "Oklahoma was a crucial vote because it is a conservative state," said Chris Pipho, director of state relations for the Education Commission of the States, an education research and policy organization in Denver. "People are seeing a need to make changes in education and if it means more money, so be it."
 
Second Attempt
 The Oklahoma referendum also marked the second time in as many years that a state education package already approved by legislators was placed on the ballot by citizens attempting to repeal it because of cost. Last November, Nebraska voters similarly rejected a referendum that would have rescinded $416 million in new taxes for education. As in Nebraska, opponents of the Oklahoma plan groused that the cost was too high for too few changes.
Approved in April 1990 by the Oklahoma Legislature, the plan calls for new curriculums, tougher teacher accreditation standards, smaller classes and a recruitment center for minority teachers. Also, higher minimum teacher salaries were mandated, with $15,060 minimum for a first-year teacher and $24,060 in the fifth year. The plan is scheduled to be phased in over five years.
To finance these improvements, the Legislature approved increases in the state sales tax, to 4.5 percent from 4 percent; in corporate taxes, to 6 percent from 5 percent, and in personal income taxes by a range of 1 percent to 16 percent, with the wealthy bearing the heaviest increases.
 
'Very Reassuring'
 "It's very reassuring that the voters of Oklahoma are ready to recommit to education," said Terry Almon, executive director of Growth Oklahoma, a citizen's group that spent about $1 million to support the education plan through television, radio and print advertising. "Now we can try to move Oklahoma to match its football standing."
In defeat, opponents of the plan continued to maintain that it was too expensive and did little to advance educational improvements.
"This is faulty education reform," said Dan Brown, chairman of the Oklahoma Taxpyers Union. "We're putting more money into a system of education that is broken."
Stanley M. Ward, a lawyer who is chairman and a founder of Stop Taxing our People said: "We don't want any of these cram-down-your-throat, tax-and-spend bromides. We are trying things that have been tried previously without any basic success."
Indeed, opponents to the Oklahoma plan received a boost before this week's vote from the recent distribution of President Bush's national report card, which showed that for all the money spent in the 1980's on education improvements, some of them similar to those in the Oklahoma plan, students today are performing at 1970 levels.
Mr. Brown and other opponents of the plan said they were defeated because they were outspent by an estimated 15 to 1 by supportors in statewide advertising campaigns. "They had the organization and the money," he said.

HEADLINE: Dinkins, in a Shift, Is Paying His Own Way to South Africa

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Reversing his earlier position that he would not contribute to the cost of his trip to South Africa next month, Mayor David N. Dinkins said yesterday that he had donated $5,000 to pay his own way.
But because money for the trip is being raised by a nonprofit city-controlled entity, the New York City Business Assistance Corporation, Mr. Dinkins will be able to claim a tax deduction, as will the city commissioners, business people and news organizations paying to join him on the trip Nov. 10. 
 "Of course it's deductible," the Mayor said. "But you've still got to pay the $5,000." That would be 40 times the size of Mr. Dinkins's $125 donation to charity last year; his salary is $123,500, and he has since made other donations.
 
City Pays for Bodyguards
 Even so, Mr. Dinkins's check would not cover the entire cost of the trip for himself and his wife, Joyce. Mayoral aides have said it will cost perhaps $4,500 per person. He is still raising money from private contributors to pay the way of an undetermined number of aides and advance team members. As always on mayoral trips, the city will pay for his police bodyguards, more than a dozen, officials said.
The weeklong trip is aimed at forging economic and cultural ties with the South African black majority.
The Mayor again declined yesterday to name the contributors or say how much had been raised, saying the effort was still under way. He said the full list would be made public eventually, and that questions about possible conflicts of interest involving donors who might have business with the city were legitimate.
But he also complained that fundraising for the trip had drawn far more criticism and scrutiny than past efforts by the Assistance Corporation to raise corporate and private donations for the ticker-tape parade for Persian Gulf veterans and a meeting of big city mayors last year. For example, he noted, The New York Times Company contributed $75,000 toward a "living memorial" to help aid veterans of the gulf war and the families of those who died.
Mr. Dinkins suggested some of the criticism had a racial cast.
"I'm just simply contrasting it with the other," he said. "And I suggest that it's because not enough people appreciate the significance of a trip to South Africa, the only place where we have legalized slavery in the world."
Later, asked if he meant that the public was not sufficiently aroused by the injustices of apartheid, he said, "Come on, what public -- the press." When pressed why he thought that was so, he said: "I wish I knew. I wish I knew."

HEADLINE: THE WATER MAIN BREAK;
After 87 Years of Change, Some Water Mains Remain

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
When work crews laid a 20-inch cast-iron water main into 42d Street between Park and Lexington Avenues in 1904, New York was a very different place. Horse-drawn carriages shuttled the well-to-do around town. The city's first subway line was about to open.
Then everything changed. Except the pipe.
Steam pipes, telegraph wires, sewers, telephone wires and electrical and television cables elbowed their way under the street and around the water main. 
 Another subway line, the IRT No. 7, was built along 42d Street beneath the first line that had run from City Hall to East 42d Street and then across town to Times Square. The East Side line was expanded, heading north beneath Lexington Avenue.
 
Confluence of Factors
 Today, high-rise office buildings line both sides of 42d Street, with deep foundations to support them. Heavy trucks and buses rumble almost incessantly on the street. Below, the ground trembles every few minutes as modern subway trains thunder by.
The city's engineers do not yet know why the 87-year-old pipe burst early yesterday morning, disrupting traffic and mass transit throughout midtown and the East Side, but they recognize the confluence of factors that made the water-main break possible.
Age, congestion, vibrations from subways and street traffic, corrosive soil conditions, the material used to make the pipe, the presence of high-rise structures with deep excavations -- all contribute to the stress that can cause a water-main break and create turmoil in a densely populated city.
During the 1980's about 540 water mains broke each year, city officials said. Most are small and cause little damage. Even the larger ones -- when they occur on quiet streets away from business districts -- are seldom noted, except by those directly inconvenienced.
 
6,000 Miles of Main
 But when a large main breaks in a major intersection in Manhattan or downtown Brooklyn, as happened every year or two over the last decade, the impact can be extraordinary.
The city replaced about 10 percent of its 6,000 miles of water mains during the 1980's and is to replace another 10 to 15 percent of the mains during the next 10 years, said Edward C. Scheader, a deputy director of water supply and waste-water collection.
Even so, Mr. Scheader said, the city will not be able to replace all of the most vulnerable mains, which includes small mains, those built before 1930, those with a history of breaking and those that have persistent problems with low pressure.
Money is one reason why the city cannot eliminate the risk of ruptures: It will cost about $850 million to replace mains over the next 10 years, he said.
But even if money were not an impediment, Mr. Scheader and other engineers said, the city is still limited in the amount of repair work that it can do. Streets have to be torn apart to replace water mains. If too many streets were disrupted, they said, travel in New York would be brought to a halt, with profound economic consequences.
 
Cooper Union Study
 "I don't know if it's possible to do more during the next 10 years without creating chaos on the streets," Mr. Scheader said.
But some experts contend that the city must accelerate its pace in replacing water mains or endure a different kind of chaos: an increase in large, disruptive pipe ruptures.
A study released two months ago by the infrastructure institute at Cooper Union estimated that by the year 2030, more than 1,600 water mains would break each year -- three times the current rate.
That prediction was based on several assumptions, all of which were challenged by city water engineers. The study estimated that water mains should last about 100 years. It also calculated that the city's current replacement cycle is 150 years, said Samuel I. Schwartz, an engineering professor at Cooper Union who directed the study.
"We're going to see more of these unless we have more preventive maintenance and we accelerate the replacement cycle," Mr. Schwartz, who was a deputy transportation commissioner in the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch, said yesterday.
When parts of Madison Avenue, the Avenue of the Americas and Eighth Avenue in midtown were rebuilt in recent years, the water mains were also replaced, Mr. Schwartz said. But the water mains under Fifth Avenue, built around the turn of the century, have not been replaced. "We can expect to see water main breaks along Fifth Avenue," he said.
 
200 or 600 Miles
 "Our problem is that we have kind of backed ourselves into a corner," Mr. Schwartz said, in part because the city's public works were allowed to languish during the 1960's and 1970's. He said it would require a major increase in the city's replacement effort to catch up for the lost time.
But city officials said they had begun to do precisely that. The Cooper Union study estimated that 200 miles of water mains were replaced during the 1980's, based on city documents, said Clark Wieman, who was research director for the report.
Mr. Scheader said the city actually replaced 600 miles of pipes during the decade. He also disputed the study's assumption that water mains can last for 100 years.
"It makes the assumption that age by itself is the major contributor to the problem," he said. "I don't honestly believe that that is true."
Small pipes break much more often than the larger, stronger pipes, Mr. Scheader said. Location can also be critical, he said.
"The big ones don't break all that often," Mr. Scheader said, "but when they do, we all know about it."

HEADLINE: Foreboding in Connecticut As State Employees Depart

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Oct. 17

 BODY:
About 1 percent of the state's public employees turned off the lights and walked out the door today, laid off from jobs to which they may never return. It was the single largest exodus since Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. announced the first of more than 3,700 layoffs in late September, and by far the most departures in one day since the state's budget troubles began several years ago.
By the close of business on Friday, at least 545 people who had jobs when the week began will be facing unemployment, out of a work force of about 45,000. Most are secretaries, clerks and typists, including the entire four-member secretarial pool at the University of Connecticut School of Nursing, which formally disbanded as of 4 P.M. 
 "There's no one to tell them where the disks or the files are," said one of the four former nursing secretaries, Diana Moore. "I don't know what they'll do."
State administrators and union leaders who are tracking the layoffs said that most residents would not feel the effect of the cutbacks quite yet. Rather they described a government structure being gnawed at from the inside and weakened in ways that will only be felt over time.
 
'Delays Will Become Longer'
 State lawmakers who are seeking repeal of the income tax and even further reduction in the size of Connecticut's government expressed sorrow today at the human cost inflicted by the cuts, but guarded joy at the evidence that government could make do with less. They also chose to outline a major plank of their proposed repeal bill that will be considered at a special legislative session next month: a package of proposals to squeeze more money out of state workers by extending the work week from 35 to 40 hours, while eliminating the arbitration rules that have given some union members generous pay raises.
"We weren't all that good to begin with," said the state's chief court administrator, Judge Aaron Ment, describing the cuts in clerical staff and probation officers that his department has faced. "We already had long delays in some areas of the state -- those delays will become longer."
The Senate minority leader, M. Adela Eads, a Republican from Kent, also conceded that layoffs will likely be needed if the income tax is repealed next month, but said the number would depend on the unions' willingness to grant concessions.
For people on their way out the door today, or those left to hold the pieces together, such talk has made Connecticut's pared-down government a deeply troubled place where few jobs or benefits seem completely secure and where long-term planning consists of trying to hold one's position through at least the next round of layoffs.
At the Department of Correction, which administers a still-expanding prison system, 140 prison guard posts are being eliminated in various detention centers as a result of layoffs. A spokesman for the department, Bill Wheeler, conceded that the average Connecticut resident will never know those guards are not there, but he said that every guard will know it and know that he or she is perhaps a bit less safe as a result.
At the Department of Mental Health's three largest hospitals, staff workers who normally oversee two wards of mentally ill residents will supervise three wards, a 50 percent increase in their caseloads. Another 90 patients will be released to community programs because of insufficient staffing levels.
Some of the effects of the layoffs are almost unmeasurable.
At the Judicial Department, for example, where about 10 percent of the state's probation officers have either received pink slips or have already left their jobs, Judge Ment said that many of the gaps in probation officer ranks have been filed by supervisors transferred back into the field. That means the caseloads are still being more or less maintained, but with the supervisors gone, the immediate gauge of how well or poorly the systems works is also gone.
 
Is Tenure Safe?
 What could be one of the single most wrenching effects of the cuts is still to be addressed. At the state's public colleges and universities 335 professors have been selected by the Weicker administration for dismissal. But actually issuing a pink slip to a tenured professor also means publicly declaring that the hallowed rules of tenure can no longer be trusted as a job guarantee in Connecticut.
The technical and community college system has already made that declaration, known as financial exigency, and the state university system has begun the process. The University of Connecticut, the flagship of the system, has vowed to resist as long as possible. Officials said that a declaration of exigency would cripple the university's ability to attract new professors or keep good ones.
"Once you have done that, you send out a signal that is very very difficult to alter," said the University's president, Harry J. Hartley.
Union leaders said today that discussions were still under way with the Weicker administration on a package of concessions that could rescind the layoffs.
But for people like Ms. Moore at the nursing school, it may be too late. Under state rules she was considered a "durational" worker who only worked 34 hours a week instead of 35 and so was not entitled to all the benefits. If her job is resumed, someone else who is fully vested into the state employee system will get the first crack at the job she held for the last two years.

HEADLINE: D'Amato's Rating Falls to Low in Poll

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 17

 BODY:
A statewide poll released today shows that Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato's job-performance rating has dropped to its lowest level ever, despite the Senator's efforts to advertise the Senate Ethics Committee's decision to clear him of charges of improper conduct.
The poll by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, taken from Oct. 7 to 10, also showed Gov. Mario M. Cuomo with his lowest rating ever and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan with his lowest rating since early 1984.
 
Recession's Impact Cited
 The results led the Institute's director, Lee M. Miringoff, to speculate that anti-incumbent sentiment is being fueled by the recession and by disillusionment with government. 
 Mr. Miringoff said that Mr. D'Amato's ratings were particularly notable because they suggested that the court of public opinion had not been favorably influenced by the verdict of the Senate Ethics Committee in August. The committee found that Mr. D'Amato, who was charged with improperly exerting his influence on behalf of friends and relatives, had not violated Senate rules or Federal laws.
The two-term Republican Senator, who faces re-election next year, spread the word of the committee's findings with a mailing sent to 3 million New Yorkers at a cost to taxpayers of more than $400,000.
But the Marist poll showed that only 34 percent of those questioned rated Mr. D'Amato's job performance as excellent or good. That was down from 42 percent last March. The poll of 624 voters has a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.
 
Abrams Leads the Challengers
 The poll showed that Attorney General Robert Abrams, one of the four Democrats vying to challenge Mr. D'Amato, would run ahead of Mr. D'Amato by 45 percent to 41 percent if the election were held now.
City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman was in a dead heat with Mr. D'Amato, with each at 40 percent. Geraldine Ferraro, the former Vice Presidential nominee, trailed the incumbent, 46 percent to 38 percent, and Representative Bob Mrazek of Long Island trailed 41 percent to 19 percent.
Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for Mr. D'Amato, said he was encouraged that he had outpolled three of his four challengers. "It's clear that the obituaries on Senator D'Amato are premature," she said.
Mr. Cuomo's job performance was rated as excellent or good by 45 percent of those polled, down from 48 percent in March. Fifty-four percent of those surveyed said they had a favorable impression of him and 56 percent said he generally has been a good governor since first elected in 1983.
But 72 percent of those questioned said the state was headed in the wrong direction, an increase from 59 percent a year ago, and 86 percent said they believed the state was in a recession.
Mr. Moynihan, a Democrat, was rated excellent or good by 48 percent, down from 60 percent in March.

Mystery (but No Spies) From a Young le Carre

BYLINE: By JOHN J. O'CONNOR

 BODY:
Pre-empted last week by the Senate hearings starring Judge Clarence Thomas, Prof. Anita F. Hill and a mixed roster of bit players, the premiere of the 21st season of "Masterpiece Theater" on Channel 13 is instead taking place tonight at 9, with a repeat at midnight. The chosen production is "A Murder of Quality," a two-part version of a 1962 John le Carre novel, his second published work, adapted for television by the author himself. The second hour will be broadcast, as originally scheduled, on Sunday at 9 P.M.
"A Murder of Quality," a rare le Carre novel not about spies, is a mystery story, and a slight one at that. In a foreword to a published edition, the author calls the work a "flawed thriller," albeit one that is "redeemed by ferocious and quite funny social comment." The writer has never been especially enthusiastic about British institutions, most notably the boarding schools ("I found them monstrous and still do"). The fictional one in this story is called Carne, but it could be easily mistaken for Sherborne, once attended by Mr. le Carre. In fact, the filming was done on location at Sherborne. 
 The detective turns out to be a reluctant George Smiley, now being played by Denholm Elliott instead of Alec Guinness. On sabbatical from the Circus, the headquarters of British intelligence, Smiley is called by a former colleague who has received a letter from a woman claiming that her husband is going to kill her. The gloomy agent finds this little reason for him to interrupt his listening to Mahler on the phonograph, but then it turns out that the woman has indeed been found dead. Smiley sets out for Carne to assist the local police in their confrontations with smug headmasters and traditions.
No more of the plot need be revealed here, although it might be noted that Mr. le Carre, conceding youthful fury when he wrote the novel, does not apologize for what he now describes as "a spray-gun, frontal assault, not just on the British private educational establishment, but on our whole class structure -- religious, social, economic." The author's coup de grace: "Carne was the Circus made School. Both were rotten through and through."
Chronic Anglophiles can be assured that Mr. le Carre's fury is generally conveyed with ingrained British understatement and good manners. A top-notch cast makes sure of that. Mr. Elliott is perfect as the gray, piercingly intelligent Smiley; and his co-stars are sparkling. There's Glenda Jackson, as Smiley's rather dotty but thoroughly efficient former colleague, and there are Joss Ackland, Ronald Pickup and David Threlfall as the more prominent oddities on the school's staff. Lurching in and out of the story as Mad Janie is the wonderfully gifted Billie Whitelaw.
"A Murder of Quality" is a small piece seething with enormous anger. It gets a prestigious series off to another season with customary style.
 
'Brooklyn Bridge'
 CBS
 Tonight at 8:30
A good new series is being made better with the addition of Carol Kane in the role of Aunt Sylvia, a Greenwich Village habitue who enters reading Allen Ginsberg's "Howl." The Silver boys are delighted with their aunt's offbeat ways. Sylvia's mother is not impressed, especially when she hears that her daughter has decided to leave her nice but dull husband. You can imagine what the neighborhood will think of that. Ms. Kane gets a rare chance to be quite touching, and makes it shine.
 
The World Series
 CBS
 Beginning tomorrow at 8 P.M.
It's going to be baseball vs. the stunts. CBS, already reeling from poor ratings for the playoffs, will no doubt be looking at its billion-dollar investment in baseball-broadcast rights with something approaching classic panic. Meanwhile, the competition has geared up for counterprogramming, which this Sunday puts its bets squarely on the past.
 
'I Still Dream of Jeannie'
 NBC
 Sunday at 9 P.M.
Barbara Eden does a reprise of a role that she first played in 1965 when, popping out of a bottle, the remarkably well-preserved genie was a mere 2,000 years old. This time Jeannie is looking for a new master. The original was Larry Hagman who, having since snared stardom in "Dallas," was obviously not about to touch this labored project.
 
'Dynasty: The Reunion'
 ABC
 Sunday at 9 P.M.
A two-parter that will conclude on Tuesday. The network is keeping this one under wraps so as not to give away the story lines, but it has been reported, breathlessly of course, that one long scene will feature a violent mano-a-mano between Alexis (Joan Collins) and Krystle (Linda Evans). What more could any fan ask for, unless it be the return of the once-dismissed Al Corley as Steven, the oft-sexually confused Carrington son? He now lives happily in Washington with his male lover. Blake (John Forsythe) will presumably be released from prison. And all's well in the loopy world of television entertainment.
 
Masterpiece Theater
A Murder of Quality
 
Directed by Gavin Miller; written by John le Carre, based on his novel; produced by Eric Abraham; a Portobello Film for Thames Television; Brian Walcroft, executive producer for Thames Television; Rebecca Eaton, executive producer for Masterpiece Theater. Tonight and Sunday at 9 P.M. on Channel 13; at 11 P.M. on Channel 21.

A Couple Try to Buy What They Can't Make

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
Any chronic theatergoer is sooner or later asked, "What is the worst play you've ever seen?" There is no answer, of course, but if pressed to the wall, I might be tempted to start such a discussion with "The Wayward Stork," a short-lived farce of 25 years ago in which the late, great comedian Bob Cummings, his hair all but aflame with red dye, played a husband caught up in a botched effort at artificial insemination. There were, if memory serves, many jokes about chicken basters. Loved that Bob.
"The Baby Dance," the new play at the Lucille Lortel Theater, is nothing if not a "Wayward Stork" for the 1990's. Though the quality of the writing is a couple of rungs above rock bottom and though the tone is lugubrious rather than antic, it takes the same sad situation, that of an infertile couple eager to have children, and exploits and trivializes it to equally numbing effect. Reflecting its own time, "The Baby Dance" is much more pretentious than "The Wayward Stork," and, instead of being cooked up by a Broadway schlockmeister, it has been nurtured by three nonprofit theater companies that list themselves in a wayward honor roll in the Playbill: the Pasadena Playhouse, the Long Wharf Theater and the Williamstown Theater Festival. 
 No doubt reflecting this parentage, the play's plot, about an affluent Los Angeles couple buying the impending baby of a poor Louisiana couple, touches on such matters as class conflict, racism, abortion, birth control and the ethics of surrogate parenthood, among other aspects of the present-day baby market, legal and not. But the author, Jane Anderson, has nothing to say about these issues; she just milks them for cheap melodrama in the apparent hope that she'll bring forth a commercial entertainment, an "Other People's Baby."
Ms. Anderson condescends to all her characters except the unborn. The baby-makers, a redneck couple living in a rural Louisiana trailer court, wear tattoos, eat both Cool Whip and Miracle Whip, own a Princess phone and use a Crisco can as a flower vase. Yet they have primitive parental instincts and animal sexual passions beyond the ken of sterile rich folk. The California couple -- damningly employed at the lowest end of the film-industry food chain (he's in business affairs, she's in development) -- are defined by such brand names as Honda, Evian and Williams-Sonoma. The husband in this couple, a Jewish man who will only buy a baby commensurate with his own economic and intellectual status, is presented so mean-spiritedly that the characterization comes across as anti-Semitic. For added measure, a stereotyped baby-bartering lawyer wanders in for Act II; he may be one of those two-bit slick operators that Senator Orrin Hatch warned the nation about during the Judiciary Committee hearings last weekend.
Under these circumstances, the actors deserve sympathy, especially in Act I, when, in keeping with the Louisiana weather noted in the Playbill ("Highs are in the 90's and the humidity is 100 percent"), they are all drenched in sweat. It is also in that act that Linda Purl is asked to end a scene with the center-stage declaration, "I got to get my tubes tied!"
At least she and Richard Lineback bring some fierce passion to the white-trash couple, who might otherwise seem to have stepped out of "The Beverly Hillbillies." As the wealthy husband and wife, Stephanie Zimbalist and Joel Polis are to the mannered born. In keeping with the soapy text, Jenny Sullivan's direction is stagy in the extreme, with far more pregnant pauses than even this play's subject demands.

HEADLINE: Promising Courtship in the Pacific

 BODY:
Tokyo and Moscow are moving ever so gingerly to settle their longstanding territorial dispute, and that should suit Washington just fine. The territory at issue, inhospitable islands in the Kurile chain north of Japan, were seized by the Soviets at the end of World War II. Their return would do much to thaw Japanese-Soviet relations, still frozen in cold war antagonism.
Deft diplomacy by both sides has removed some stumbling blocks. Japan has astutely offered the Soviets $2.5 billion in aid and credits, even though Moscow has not finally agreed to return the islands. That unlinks the issues of territory and aid, and spares Moscow the embarrassment of appearing to conduct a fire sale of the Soviet Union's assets. 
 Soviet leaders have also taken steps to speed negotiations. They have announced a troop cutback on the islands and agreed to a joint committee to discuss reversion.
Significantly, the Soviet delegation will be headed by a Deputy Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation; the islands are now part of Russian territory. The leader of Russia's parliament, in a visit to Tokyo, pointed the way to a settlement by saying that it "should not be based on who won or lost World War II," but on international law. That implies eventual return of the islands to their rightful owner, the Japanese, who settled the islands three centuries ago.
The collapse of the coup against Mikhail Gorbachev and Moscow's acceptance of the Baltics' independence undermined hard-line resistance to redrawing Soviet borders. Still, some advisers to the Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, fear that reversion could trigger the disintegration of the Russian Federation. But an even greater threat to Russian stability would be economic collapse -- which Japanese aid might avert.
Some in Washington worry that a Japanese-Soviet rapprochement would devalue the U.S.-Japan security treaty. But a prosperous and peaceful Soviet Union would help stabilize a region where the interests of Russia, China, Japan and the U.S. converge. It would reduce the need for a defense buildup by Japan, which alarms its neighbors. And it would allow the U.S. to maintain a more modest presence in the Pacific.
A deal on the Kuriles clearly deserves Washington's encouragement.

HEADLINE: Your Taxes;
Push for a Break On Real Estate

BYLINE: By Robert D. Hershey Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
With the economy pulling out of recession at an agonizingly slow pace, real estate interests hope to find fresh support for a campaign to undo what they consider a singularly mischievous provision of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. And they seem to have picked up an important ally in the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Government agency created to take over failed savings and loans and sell off their assets.
While passage of any tax-related legislation this year seems increasingly unlikely, there is a certain logic to the argument that making investment in rental real estate more attractive would spur overall economic activity while helping the agency dispose of its $12 billion inventory of rental properties, about 25 percent of the total portfolio. 
 The sweeping 1986 law, introducing the notion of "active" and "passive" investments as part of a drive against tax shelters, generally made rental real estate automatically passive no matter how much time or energy somebody devoted to it and prohibited investors from using passive losses to offset other types of income.
Those now seeking to put passive rental activity back onto equal footing want to limit this provision to people in the real estate business, an unintended 1986 target, and would still require the so-called material participation test.
The R.T.C. would enjoy more demand for its properties, many of which tend to generate losses and have relatively values as tax deductions. The revenue loss to the Treasury of this legislation, with some 340 Congressional co-sponsors, is estimated at $3 billion over five years.Meanwhile, Senator John B. Breaux, a Democrat from Louisiana, home of much R.T.C. property, has introduced a bill offering purchasers of all commercial property held by the agency a tax credit of up to 80 percent of the purchase price, to be claimed over five years. This measure, the subject of a Senate Finance subcommittee hearing next Tuesday, is opposed by the people who support change in the passive-loss rules. They say the tax credit would skew the market.
 
Deduction for Food

In the tradition of legislators seeking to spur demand for home-state products -- not to mention the sales point of seeking to solve two problems at once -- Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota and three other Midwest Democrats have introduced a bill that would effectively double the charitable deduction for individuals who buy surplus food and donate it to charity for use in famine and disaster relief or in economically depressed areas.
"Nothing frustrates a farmer more than to have grain wasting away in a bin because prices are too low to sell it while he watches television news stories about the growing numbers of hungry people around the world," Senator Daschle said.
In analyzing the bill, the Joint Committee on Taxation finds that it would both shrink surpluses of eligible commodities (cutting Federal subsidy payments) and raise their market-clearing price. Lower subsidies save the Government money, but the analysts note that consumers not receiving donations would pay more for some commodities, and that the bill might result in costly duplication of existing food-distribution channels.
At a hearing on Wednedsay, the Bush Administration opposed the bill on the ground that some of the extra food donations would come at the expense of other contributions and that the augmented deduction would lose revenue for the Treasury. "This legislation," said Bruce L. Gardner, Assistant Secretary for Economics at the Agriculture Department, "implicitly contains a judgment that food aid is socially twice as valuable as other charitable donations."
 
Footnotes
 The Florida Tax and Budget Reform Commission recommends ending the sales-tax exemption for professional and other personal services, but the state seems unlikely to repeat its short-lived 1987 levy that applied to services used in Florida but performed elsewhere.
Median salaries for chief tax executives at $1 billion-plus companies ranged from $75,000 to $164,000 in 1990, according to a survey by D. E. Foster & Partners, a search firm.

HEADLINE: Caterpillar Reports a Loss

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill., Oct. 18

 BODY:
Caterpillar Inc. said today that it lost $37 million in the third quarter of 1991 and expects to lose more money in the fourth quarter as its markets continue to shrink.
The construction-equipment maker's loss compared with earnings of $54 million, or 54 cents a share, in the corresponding quarter a year ago. Revenue fell 15.7 percent, to $2.36 billion from $2.80 billion. 
 "Almost all the markets we serve in the United States have not recovered from the recession," said Len Kuchan, Caterpillar's treasurer. "And in the rest of the world, markets have weakened, with the exception of the Middle East and Latin America.
"It's clear 1991 is not a year we can be very happy with. Our prospects for 1992 heavily depend on economic activity in the United States."
Caterpillar last suffered annual losses in 1982-84.
It has warned investors for months to expect a loss because of deteriorating economic conditions around the globe.
"The marketplace will improve; it always does," Mr. Kuchan said. "It's just a question of when."
Caterpillar's share price rose $1.125 today on the New York Stock Exchange to $48.625.

HEADLINE: U S West's Net Off 11%; Bell Atlantic Posts Gain

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Continuing the mixed profit results reported by the nation's telephone companies for the third quarter, U S West Inc. said yesterday that its earnings had dropped 11 percent from a year earlier, while another regional Bell company, the Bell Atlantic Corporation, reported a profit increase of nearly 7 percent as the sale of an investment helped to override the weak economy. 
 Following are the details of the companies' results:
 
U S West
 U S West, based in Englewood, Colo., said its earnings fell to $269.3 million, or 66 cents a share, from $302.6 million, or 77 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 5.6 percent, to $2.62 billion, from $2.48 billion a year earlier.
The company said the 1991 quarter included a $17 million accounting charge to pay for a Washington State incentive regulation plan.
Richard D. McCormick, U S West's president and chief executive, attributed the earnings decline primarily to the impact of interstate telephone rate reductions and expanding international investments.
U S West owns U S West Communications and companies involved in data, marketing and financial services.
The company's shares were unchanged yesterday at $35 on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Bell Atlantic

Bell Atlantic, based in Philadelphia, said profits rose to $382.7 million, or 98 cents a share, from $358.4 million, or 91 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue was nearly flat at $3.1 billion.
The company said earnings were bolstered by the sale of a significant portion of its investment in the Telecom Corporation of New Zealand. The stock sale increased quarterly earnings by 19 cents a share, but there were costs of 3 cents a share.
Bell Atlantic's telephone subsidiaries reported small volume gains, reflecting the economy, the company said.
The average number of access lines for the quarter totaled 17.7 million, a 1.6 percent increase from the 1990 quarter. The number of cellular subscribers was about 295,000 at the end of the quarter, up about 58,000 for the last year.
Bell Atlantic is the parent of Bell of Pennsylvania, New Jersey Bell, Diamond State Telephone of Delaware and the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone companies of Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.
Bell Atlantic stock rose 75 cents yesterday, to $45.125, on the Big Board.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Oil Prices at Highest Level Since the Persian Gulf War

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The price of oil soared yesterday to its highest level since the Persian Gulf war, wrapping up a week when traders decided that just about every bit of news or rumor was a good reason to buy.
Crude oil for delivery in November settled at $24.14 a barrel, up 21 cents, at the New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil had not closed that high since Jan. 22, in the early days of the gulf war, when the price was $24.18. 
 Trading focused on stormy weather in the North Sea, which forced one platform closing and delayed oil shipments. Given the tone of a market that has pushed up the per-barrel price by more than $2 over the last month, that was enough to prompt more buying.
"The way this market is acting, it's kind of a run-up with blinders on," said Victor Yu, vice president of futures at the Nikkhah Energy Group of Refco Inc. in New York. "It only looks at things that are bullish, not at things that are bearish."
An oil analyst, Peter Beutel of Pegasus Econometric Group Inc., in Hoboken, N.J., agreed that the market was nervously jumping at anything, even more than it did during certain points of the Iran-Iraq war.
"There were times a couple of years ago when we had a tanker hit every day by a missile, and it didn't do a darn thing," Mr. Beutel said. "Now, we have tankers being delayed and it sends the market scurrying."
Analysts are reluctant to speculate on how high prices could go, saying there is concern among many market participants that oil could become overbought and that a selloff would follow. But some experts who have been forecasting a selloff for some time were wrong again this week.
Crude declined only on Wednesday, when it fell 19 cents a barrel. For the week, oil for next-month delivery rose $1.05 a barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Petroleum products have also been strong, at times leading the market higher.
Home heating oil for delivery in November settled at 69.81 cents a gallon, up 0.41 cent for the day and 2.27 cents for the week. Unleaded gasoline for delivery in November settled at 65.73 cents a gallon, up 1.30 cents for the day and 3.38 cents for the week.
Natural gas prices were mostly lower yesterday. But contracts for delivery in November settled at $2.025 for 1,000 cubic feet, up 1.1 cents for the day and 7 cents for the week.
In London, North Sea Brent blend crude oil for delivery in December settled at $22.59 a barrel, up 17 cents for the day, at the International Petroleum Exchange. For the week, Brent for next-month delivery rose 55 cents.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Steep Decline On Weak Economic Report

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply against most currencies yesterday as traders took profits after another bearish report on the United States economy.
Gold prices advanced. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery gained $2.20, to $362.20 an ounce. The Republic National Bank said gold rose $2.30, to a late bid of $360. 
 Analysts said the dollar sold off in Europe and continued to lose ground when trading shifted to the United States.
"The dollar finished at new lows for the week against key European currencies," said Marc Chandler, an analyst with the advisory firm IDEA. He said investors were bent on selling as hopes for an economic recovery continued to dim.
The Government reported yesterday that housing starts fell 2.2 percent in September, breaking a string of five advances and raising fresh doubts about the viability of a recovery in the housing sector.
Analysts said the dollar was also depressed by a news service report quoting an unidentified Federal Reserve official as saying the central bank is more concerned about the choppy economy than inflation. The report said the Fed viewed Thursday's report of an increase of four-tenths of 1 percent in consumer prices in September as a blip that would not stop officials from lowering interest rates.
Lower interest rates are generally bearish for the dollar because they lessen the value of dollar-denominated securities.
Another factor depressing the dollar was the University of Michigan's latest survey of consumer sentiment, which showed a further erosion of confidence in the economy.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 129.85 Japanese yen, from 129.53 yen on Thursday. Later in London, it fell to 129.70 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 129.65 yen, up from 129.45 yen on Thursday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7245, from $1.7090 late Thursday. In New York it cost $1.7270 to buy a pound, more expensive than Thursday's $1.7175.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.6865 German marks, down from 1.6965; 1.4750 Swiss francs, down from 1.4815; 5.7480 French francs, down from 5.7760; 1,261.25 Italian lire, down from 1,267.00, and 1.1268 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1284.

HEADLINE: Panel Endorses F.D.I.C. Choice

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
The Senate Banking Committee voted 21 to 0 today to approve William Taylor as the new chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
His nomination is expected to be confirmed quickly by the full Senate next week.
Mr. Taylor is currently the director of banking supervision at the Federal Reserve. 
 One of his first tasks in his new job will be to decide whether the F.D.I.C. should raise the premium that banks pay to the insurance fund that protects banking deposits. Mr. Taylor has taken no public position on the premium level, which was increased to 23 cents for each $100 in deposits in July.
Even though some banks are complaining that the new level is onerous, many bankers attending an annual conference in San Francisco last week said a rise to 30 cents appeared inevitable.
The chances of an increase were heightened Wednesday when L. William Seidman, on his last day as chairman of the F.D.I.C., sent a letter to Senator Donald W. Riegle, Democrat of Michigan, chairman of the Banking Committee, warning that prolonged economic weakness could raise the cost of strengthening the bank fund.
Mr. Riegle responded by calling on the F.D.I.C. to consider higher premiums in order to limit future taxpayer costs.

HEADLINE: Bonds Rise as Inflation View Is Reassessed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury notes and bonds rebounded yesterday after Thursday's sharp selloff, and interest rates moved lower.
Traders and analysts said a reassessment of Thursday's consumer price report, coupled with the release yesterday of figures showing September housing starts were weaker than expected, had much to do with the turnaround in prices. 
 The housing report said starts fell by 2.2 percent in September. Most analysts had expected starts to be unchanged or slightly higher.
 
Some Worries About Inflation

On Thursday, the Government said that consumer prices rose by four-tenths of a percent during September. The increase was about twice what had been anticipated, and, in response, long-term bond yields moved above 8 percent.
"The selloff has taken some of the complacency out of the market," one trader of government bonds said. "But I couldn't get too excited about that inflation number, because I don't think inflation is a problem. In my view, the economy is losing steam. If that's right, there isn't much chance that inflation is going to take off."
The sense that the economy was losing momentum as it entered the fourth quarter was reinforced yesterday by the release of the University of Michigan's survey of consumer sentiment in early October. The survey showed a marked decline in confidence from September.
The survey and the weak housing-starts figure "reawakened hopes that the Fed will ease credit in the near future," said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. "The economic data suggest that the economy is losing momentum, and that the consumer price report was an aberration."
Yesterday's increases in bond prices erased about half of Thursday's decline.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 101 31/32, up 29/ 32, to yield 7.95 percent, compared with 8.01 percent late Thursday.
 
Higher Than a Week Ago

Despite the improvement, bond yields were higher than a week ago, when they stood at 7.88 percent.
Among Treasury notes, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 102 18/32, up 14/32, to yield 7.49 percent. The 7 percent five-year notes were offered at 100 19/32, up 11/32, to yield 6.85 percent. And the 6 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 13/32, up 5/32, to yield 5.89 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates moved lower.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.01 percent, down 4 basis points, or four one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by 7 basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.03 percent.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 24.15, to a High of 3,077.15

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
For the second time this week, the Dow Jones industrial average reached a record high. It closed yesterday at 3,077.15, up 24.15 for the day and 93.47 for the week.
After a one-day pause, the momentum from previous sessions sparked by an improving outlook on corporate earnings and by a strong bond market again moved blue-chip stocks to higher levels. On Wednesday, the Dow had reached its previous high of 3,061.72. 
 "The key to this market is that many investors are concentrating on 12-month new highs in stocks," said William Raftery, a technical analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. "This is a nice rally, but under the surface it still lacks some strong fundamentals. Sometime within the next two weeks, the market should shake out, and we will see if this rally is substantial. The key could come from the bond market."
Blue-chip stocks began their rally in the morning, as bond prices rose on a lower-than-expected report on September housing starts, which fell 2.2 percent. That raised expectations of another move by the Federal Reserve to invigorate the economy by lowering interest rates.
 
Volume Heavy Again

Volume was again heavy, at 205.3 million shares, down just slightly from 206 million shares on Thursday. Gainers outpaced losers by 900 to 723.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 0.58, to 392.50, while the New York Stock Exchange index rose by 0.35, to 216.15. Trading on the American Stock Exchange moved the composite up 1.38, to 382.49.
In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite was up 2.63, to 538.90, and the Russell 2,000, a more precise measure of the small issues, was up 0.57, to 183.41, breaking its previous high, reached Wednesday, of 182.84.
Mr. Raftery noted that many of stocks listing new highs were preferred stocks and thus reactive to interest rates. A weak bond market could erase a good many from that list and give a different picture of the strength of the market.
 
Marvel Entertainment Gains 3 5/8

In yesterday's market, the shares of the comic-book publisher Marvel Entertainment jumped 3 5/8, to 39 7/8, as the company reported surprisingly strong third-quarter earnings. Traders said Lauren Fine, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, raised Marvel's 1991 and 1992 earnings estimates, noting the profits would include money that Marvel would make from the Spiderman movie.
Schlumberger, the big oil service company, fell 1 1/2 to 68 7/8, on higher earnings. Philip J. Kehl, an analyst at Dean Witter, said he thought the earnings were good and could only speculate that some investors might have been expecting more.
Owens-Corning fell 8 1/8, to 24 3/4, after the company said it would increase 1992 reserves -- to cover an estimated 20,000 asbestos liability cases -- to $96 million, from $24 million in 1991. The company also reported third-quarter earnings that came in on the low side of analysts' estimates.
 
United Technologies Up 3 3/4

Reporting stronger-than-expected third-quarter results, United Technologies stock jumped 3 3/4, to 47 1/8. Analysts at Smith Barney and Dean Witter raised their ratings as a result.
Caterpillar reported a larger-than-expected third-quarter loss and predicted a loss in the fourth quarter. The stock, however, rose 1 1/8 to close at 48 5/8, indicating the loss was not surprising, the analysts said.
Eli Lilly was down 3 3/4, to 73 3/4, as analysts at Paine Webber and Smith Barney cut their ratings on the company. Traders said concern about earnings derived from the sale of Prozac, a drug for depression, and a $4.25 million lawsuit settlement may have been among the factors.

HEADLINE: Firm Cuts Its Rating On Citicorp

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The rating on short-term securities of Citicorp and its subsidiary Citibank was reduced yesterday by Thomson Bankwatch, a rating firm that specializes in bank securities.
The rating cut did not prompt any immediate increase in the interest rates that Citicorp and Citibank must pay for short-term borrowings, traders and investors said, but it was another blemish on the reputation of the nation's largest banking company. 
 Earlier in the week, after Citicorp announced an $885 million loss for the third quarter and suspended its common stock dividend, the Standard & Poor's Corporation reduced its ratings for short- and long-term Citicorp issues. Moody's Investors Service, which had reduced its ratings earlier in the year, left its ratings unchanged.
 
Rating Dropped to a C
 Nancy Newcombe, Citicorp's chief funding officer, was not at the New York office yesterday and unavailable to comment on the company's market reception. On Wednesday afternoon, when the loss was announced, she said that there had been no discernible market reaction to the announcement.
Thomson, whose bank ratings are closely watched by corporate treasurers and bankers who invest cash in bank certificiats of deposit, lowered its rating on Citicorp to C, the fifth highest of nine ratings, from B/ C the fourth highest. Companies with a C rating, according to Thomson's definition, are "inherently a sound credit, with no serious deficiencies." The C-rated companies "may have recently have experienced a period of difficulty, but those pressures should not be long-term in nature."
The ratings measure the probability of repayment, as well as the risk of adverse news that could depress prices of securities and make them harder to sell over the next two years.
Thomson also lowered its Citcorp numerical rating to 1 from 2. The numerical ratings, which range from 1 through 4, measure only the likelihood that debts will be repaid on time.
 
Rating Termed Justified

Because of its size and well-developed network of contacts with investors, Citicorp has long carried short-term debt ratings that were higher than some other banks that had larger cushions of capital and reserves to absorb future losses. With the latest reduction, Thomson's ratings for Citicorp are the same as those it has for other large New York banking companies, including Chase Manhattan, Manufacturers Hanover and Chemical.
Gregory Root, president of Thomson, said the lower rating was justified for Citicorp because "they still face earnings pressure and have capital needs that must be addressed." Although he expects that Citicorp's financial health and earnings will improve as it reduces costs, he said, "That process is going to take some time."
Among the 199 American banking companies rated by Thomson, only 7 have the highest rating of A, followed by 20 with A/B, 38 with B, 29 with B/ C, 35 with C, 29 with C/D, 23 with D, 7 with D/E and 11 with E.
The subdued response to Citicorp's earnings announcement contrasts sharply with the turmoil a year ago, when it paid interest rates above 12 percent at some auctions of preferred stock amid unconfirmed rumors that it was having trouble borrowing in short-term markets. Since that episode, Citicorp has redeemed all $925 million of the auction-rate preferred stock.
 
Longer-Term Impact
 In the long-term bond market, the reaction to Citicorp's third-quarter loss was more noticeable. Yields on issues due in 5 to 10 years increased 15- to 20-hundredths of a percentage point, as prices fell a full point, or $10 per $1,000 bond, while most other bank issues were unchanged to slightly higher. One actively traded Citicorp issue, the 9 3/4 percent subordinated capital notes due in 1999, dropped 1 1/8 points since the earnings announcement, and the bid bid yesterday was 98 5/8, to yield about 10 percent.
Similar securities of other banking companies ranged from a low of about 8.20 percent for the top-rated J. P. Morgan & Company, to 8.95 percent for First Fidelity, a medium-grade regional banking company in Newark whose quality is improving, to 9.45 percent for Chemical and 9.85 percent for Chase Manhattan.
"Citicorp paper is like Teflon -- bad news just seems to slide right off," said Andrew Tarica, head of corporate bond trading at Kidder, Peabody & Company. Since the earnings announcement, he noted, there has been very little selling of Citicorp paper, but he warned that the paucity of bids for Citicorp issues could mean that larger price declines could result if more sellers emerged.
 
Cutting Out 'Hot' Money
 Like many other banking companies whose losses on commercial real estate loans have led to lower ratings, Citicorp has been adjusting its financial structure to reduce its reliance on "hot" money borrowed from investors who would be likely to withdraw their funds at signs of trouble.
Despite the recent changes, Citicorp relies heavily on the continued good will of investors around the world. At midyear, it had borrowed about $4.75 billion from other banks in the Federal funds market, down from $8.89 billion at the end of 1989, and its commercial paper sales were down to $1.46 billion from $7.12 billion. Other short-term borrowings, like deposits purchased in the Eurodollar market, were down to $13.07 billion from $18.93 billion.
Citicorp was able to reduce the borrowings by cutting its total size to $217.35 billion from $230.64 billion, and by increasing its consumer deposits to $95.02 billion from $87.29 billion.
One Federal funds broker, who asked not to be identifed because he does business with Citibank, said that there was no unusual borrowing by Citibank. After news of the Thomson rating reduction is spread, he said, some smaller banks around the country might reduce the amounts they are willing to sell to Citibank, "but the changes are not significant."
 
Rates Not Publicized

By reducing their short-term borrowings, and increasing the staff needed to raise funds from institutions around the world, Citicorp and other large banks are generally able to keep the interest rates they pay for borrowed funds from being widely publicized.
"You rarely hear from them," said James McDonald, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price Associates, a Baltimore-based mutual fund company. He noted that the interest rate offered on 30-day commercial paper by the Corporate Asset Funding Corporation, a special purpose company created by Citicorp to issue commercial paper and finance loans of Citicorp's business customers, was offered yesterday at about 5.20 percent, not much different from the 5.15 percent rate offered by the highest-quality industrial companies.

HEADLINE: Minnesota Cancels Plan to Play Lottery on Nintendo

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Minnesota, under fire by its own legislators, has dropped its plan to use Nintendo video games in the home as a way to play the state lottery.
With the revenue growth of state lotteries tapering off, the Nintendo plan had created a great deal of interest in other states as an innovative use of the most widely available and easy-to-use computers in homes. But Minnesota legislators criticized the use of a children's toy to allow adults to gamble, and some also expressed concern about what they say is the already-high level of gambling in Minnesota. 
 George R. Andersen, director of the state lottery, said earlier this week that he had decided to drop plans to test the Nintendo lottery in 10,000 Minnesota households next June. The plan, which would have linked Nintendo video-game systems to a central lottery computer, included safeguards aimed at preventing children from playing the lottery.
The test would have been one of the first wide-scale instances in the United States of Nintendo computer equipment's being used for something other than playing video games.
"But it rubbed me and the rest of my colleagues the wrong way," said Roger D. Moe, a Democrat from Erskine and the State Senate's majority leader. "It was taking a children's game, using it for gambling in the home, and giving the whole thing the state's seal of approval."
Senator Moe said the Legislature received numerous letters of criticism after Minnesota's plan was given nationwide publicity last month. "I got a letter from some former Minnesotans sailing off the East Coast who heard about it on the radio," Senator Moe said. "They said it wasn't the right thing to do."
Mr. Andersen, the lottery director, was asked yesterday if legislators had put pressure on him to cancel the program. He laughed, and said, "We had a lot of frank, open discussions."
The Control Data Corporation, which is based in Minneapolis and provides equipment for the lottery, had developed the Nintendo idea. A company spokeswoman said yesterday that Control Data had received several inquiries from other state lotteries but that it was unclear what impact the Minnesota decision would have elsewhere. The company had hoped to market the plan in other states, but that seems less likely now with the cancellation of Minnesota's test.
Nintendo, the Japanese video-game company, is the world's largest maker of home computers. There are more than 30 million Nintendo systems in the United States; nearly a third of the nation's households have one. In Japan, people trade stocks and do their banking on Nintendo machines. But American companies have had little success in efforts to get consumers to use home computers for services like banking at home or reading the news.
 
A Step Too Far

Senator Moe said he had no criticism of Mr. Andersen because of the situation. "George did exactly what we wanted him to do, and that was to be creative," Senator Moe said. "But this went one step beyond what we could stomach."
Senator Moe had been circulating a letter among his 66 Senate colleagues urging that Mr. Andersen drop the plan. The Senator said he was certain a substantial majority, if not all, of his colleagues would have signed the letter.
The state lottery says Minnesota has one of the highest levels of gambling in the nation, principally because of the popularity of "pull tab" instant-winner games that raise money for local charities. Begun in the mid-1980's, the games have mushroomed into a $1.3 billion business in a state with a population of 4.3 million.
Also, there are 13 full-scale casinos on Minnesota Indian reservations, where blackjack and other games bring in $450 million. The two-year-old lottery brings in only $320 million.
 
A Senator's Concerns

"I'm fairly uneasy about all this gambling," Senator Moe said. "We should rein this in." He noted that the state had banned offtrack betting on horse races, and he said the Nintendo plan had parallels to offtrack betting.
Mr. Andersen, the lottery director, said of the legislators' reaction, "It was basically a call for a 'time out' on gambling, and I can't really quarrel with that."
Under the Nintendo plan, players would have deposited up to $200 in a special account to be used for wagering, with winnings credited to the account. Players would have been given an 11-character password to keep out children and unauthorized players. The lottery numbers would have been selected on their television set using a Nintendo control deck and then transmitted through a telephone modem to the central lottery computer.

HEADLINE: Housing Starts Fell by 2.2% in September

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
Construction of new homes and apartments fell 2.2 percent in September, the Commerce Department said today, ending a mini-boom of five consecutive monthly increases and adding further evidence that the economy is struggling.
The September decline left housing starts at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.03 million units, somewhat less than Wall Street economists had expected. In August, housing starts rose seven-tenths of 1 percent. 
 "What this illustrates is the recovery in general and the housing recovery in particular is far more anemic this time around," said Wayne Ayers, chief economist at the Bank of Boston.
The weak housing numbers helped revive market hopes for lower interest rates, prompting rallies in stock and bond prices. In the stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average reached its second record high of the week, gaining 24.15 points yesterday to close at 3,077.15. [Page 38.]
So far this year, housing starts are 19.5 percent below the comparable period last year, when they fell 13.3 percent from 1989. Economists nonetheless expect housing starts to improve gradually in the months ahead.
"I think the mortgage rate decline we have seen in the past six weeks may be reflected in the October numbers," said Ram Bhagavatula of Citicorp Global Finance.
Home building was one of the few bright spots last spring as the economy struggled out of a recession that began in mid-1990.
Lower interest rates meant more affordable monthly payments for buyers, although fears about jobs and accumulated debts from the 1980's have constrained consumers from taking on new long-term financial commitments.
The housing report was another in a long series of mixed economic reports. It came a day after the Government reported a one-tenth of 1 percent rise in industrial production in September.
There were some positive elements in the housing report. Building permit applications, an indicator of future building plans, rose 2.7 percent, to a seasonally adjusted 979,000-unit annual rate, after a 5.2 percent drop in August.
 
Pickup at the Low End

"If you look at levels of the last three or four months, there is a little bit of strength showing the beginnings of a pickup in lower-priced" housing, said Allan Leslie, an economist at the Discount Corporation.
But even if starts improve, some economists doubt that they will rise back to the levels of some previous recoveries, notably the comparative boom years of the 1970's.
Among the housing report's details, construction of single-family homes fell in September by 2 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 868,000 units. It followed an eight-tenths of 1 percent rise in August.
New apartment building construction fell by 2.9 percent in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 165,000 units after being unchanged in August at a 170,000-unit rate.
Regionally, housing starts fell 3.5 percent last month in the Northeast, to an annual rate of 111,000 units a year.
Starts fell 4.5 percent in the Midwest, to a 235,000-unit rate. In the South, starts rose 1.6 percent in September, to a 433,000-unit rate, while in the West they fell 5.6 percent, to a 254,000-unit rate.
The number of houses actually started in September fell to 87,800 before seasonal adjustment, compared with 95,200 in August and 93,100 in September 1990.
Permits for building of single-family homes rose 1.4 percent, to a 780,000-unit rate in September. Permits for apartments rose by 8.2 percent, to a 199,000-unit rate.

Creditors Approve Carter Hawley Bailout

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 18

 BODY:
Creditors of Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. approved a $280 million bailout by the Zell-Chilmark Fund, it was announced today.
Zell-Chilmark, which is led by Samuel Zell, the Chicago investor whose dealings in troubled real estate and distressed companies have made him one of America's wealthiest men, specializes in bailing out troubled companies. It is now poised to take over Carter Hawley, the parent of the Broadway, Broadway Southwest, Emporium and Weinstock's stores, and the biggest department store operator in the West. 
 Chicago-based Zell-Chilmark said about 80 percent of Carter Hawley's creditors had accepted its offer to pay them 47 cents on the dollar for the retailer's debt to them.
The close of the tender offer for that debt on Thursday set the stage for Zell-Chilmark's eventual takeover and the company's emergence from bankruptcy proceedings within the next six months.
As Carter Hawley's largest creditor, Zell-Chilmark will negotiate with it to trade the debt for a controlling ownership stake.
"I don't know what we will end up with, but it will be significantly more than a majority of the company," Zell said.
The fund has also promised to lend Carter Hawley $50 million to help dress up aging stores.
"We feel terrific about this," said the retailer's chairman, Philip M. Hawley. "This is the most constructive thing that's happened to this company in a long time."
Mr. Hawley said the modernization program, intended to win customers back from specialty stores, will begin after the Christmas season.
Carter Hawley filed for Chapter 11 protection from its creditors in February. Hammered by the recession and debt from a restructuring in the late 1980's, it had been struggling to pay suppliers.

HEADLINE: Israel and Soviets Restore Full Relations

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Oct. 18

 BODY:
A quarter-century of diplomatic estrangement ended today when the Soviet Union and Israel restored full relations and expressed hope that their renewed ties would help the cause of peace in the Middle East.
On many practical levels, little will change just because ambassadors will again be exchanged after a 24-year lapse. 
 The two countries established consular ties in 1987, and the political climate has steadily improved to a point where Soviet Jews are largely free to emigrate here after years of severe restrictions. Nearly 350,000, including many from the now-independent Baltic republics, have flocked to Israel in the last two years, making them the country's largest Jewish group by country of origin.
But today's action carried great symbolic importance. For Israel, a young nation still craving world recognition, it means that it has finally regained approval from a superpower, albeit a diminished one. For the Soviet Union, it erases a diplomatic anomaly that helped shove it to the political sidelines in this region.
"This brings us to a more open dialogue so that they will hear Israeli positions face-to-face," said Foreign Minister David Levy of Israel. "We will also hear their positions. We need not agree on everything."
 
A 'Historic Mistake'
 His Soviet counterpart, Boris D. Pankin, making only the second trip to this country by a Soviet Foreign Minister, suggested agreement with Mr. Levy that the long rupture in relations had been a "historic mistake."
"In the past, the Soviet Union tended to sort of side with the Palestinians and the Arab states, while the United States sided with Israel," Mr. Pankin told a news conference. "This did not bring any tangible fruit."
"The new approach now," he said, "is certainly not to have any proteges and support their positions no matter what they say and no matter how legitimate they may be."
That remark was certainly welcome to Israel, which had chafed for years over Moscow's policy of favoring -- and arming -- Arab nations and the Palestine Liberation Organization at every turn. The Soviet Union was one of the first countries to formally recognize the nascent Israeli state in 1948, partly to gain a diplomatic foothold in the Middle East and partly to counter British dominance in the region. But relations soured in the late 1950's, when Moscow became the principal arms supplier to Egypt and Syria during their short-lived United Arab Republic. The Soviet Union severed all ties at the time of the 1967 Middle East War, which to Moscow's dismay was won by Israel on all fronts in six days.
The rupture in relations led to virulent anti-Zionist campaigns in the Soviet Union, which prompted hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews to seek to emigrate.
 
A Question of Support
 It was not clear if the new relationship would actually translate into Soviet decisions to line up behind Israel on at least some disputes with its Arab neighbors.
On one point there was no question: Diplomatic ties went hand in hand with a signal from Israel's leaders that they would ask the Cabinet on Sunday to accept a joint United States-Soviet invitation to attend the opening of a Middle East peace conference in Madrid on Oct. 30. The Soviet side was unwilling to act unless Israel seemed likely to stay in the peace process, and, similarly, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir had said repeatedly that without formal Soviet recognition, Israel would stay home.
In a statement issued by both Foreign Ministers, the two sides said that their resumption of ties "fully serves the interests of a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East, the establishment of a lasting peace and stability in this region and a further development of international cooperation."
Mr. Levy suggested that for starters Israel would ask the Soviet Union to put pressure in the peace process on Syria, now Moscow's chief Arab ally. He also said that Israel and the Soviet Union had set up a committee on economic cooperation and other matters that would meet soon in both countries' capitals.
Despite the sense of occasion, there was also an air of anticlimax, partly because the Soviet Union, despite its co-sponsorship of the Middle East peace conference, has clearly forfeited to the United States the power to shape the regional agenda. Some Israeli officials have gone so far in recent days as to say that it is debatable who is doing whom the bigger favor by restoring relations.
 
Playing Second Fiddle
 Moscow's shrunken status was clear over the last two days as Mr. Pankin's trip overlapped with that of Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. Not too long ago, their convergence in this ancient city would have carried enormous significance and sense of drama. But there was little of that today, for clearly Mr. Pankin was playing second fiddle to his American colleague.
Moreover, Moscow, which had led its Warsaw Pact allies to break relations with Israel 24 years ago, is now the last of that bloc to restore them in the wake of Communism's collapse.
Although the Soviet Union became a strident enemy of Israel after 1967, it started off as an enthusiastic supporter, having been the third country, after the United States and Guatemala, to recognize the new state after the British mandate ended on May 14, 1948.
Many Israeli pioneers, fired with Socialist fervor in the early days, saw a kindred spirit in the Soviet Union that seemed worth emulating. But the goodwill faded and then disappeared after 1967. Bitterness still lingers, raising questions about how long it will take the two sides to turn cordial relations into truly friendly ones.
"The circumstances in which they announced the severance of ties were very humiliating," said Reuven Mershav, a former Foreign Ministry director-general. "Their behavior was insulting."
"Walls like this don't come down in a day," Mr. Mershav said, "but there is no question that what the Soviets did signals a lot."

HEADLINE: VIETNAMESE RESIST REPATRIATION PLAN

BYLINE: By BARBARA BASLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Oct. 18

 BODY:
Vietnamese refugees who fear they may be forcibly returned to Vietnam from Hong Kong have been staging demonstrations inside the largest of this British colony's detention camps and have been making plans for armed resistance should Britain and Hanoi conclude an agreement on the repatriations.
Officials here had confidently expected an agreement on the mandatory return of tens of thousands of Vietnamese to be signed in Hanoi this week. 
 But late today a British Foreign Office spokesman in the colony said: "We have indicated we are ready to sign, and they have indicated they are not. We don't know for certain at this stage what's causing the delay."
 
Tension in the Camps
 Inside the gritty camps, which house 59,000 Vietnamese refugees, the suspense and tension over their fate has grown "almost unbearable," said a relief worker who requested anonymity.
"The people inside are afraid they will go to sleep one night, and without warning, the guards will come to take them away," the worker said. "Even the sensible people are so afraid they can't think very straight anymore."
For three years, the Hong Kong authorities have insisted they had a right to deport Vietnamese who have been classified as nonrefugees through a screening process monitored by United Nations officials. But the process has been criticized by human rights groups as being unfair and inaccurate.
In 1989, the British authorities carried out the first forced return of Vietnamese from Hong Kong, using riot police to herd 51 refugees, most of them women and children, onto an airplane in what they hoped would be a secret nighttime operation. But news of the action was reported and photographed, and it led to an international outcry that so embarrassed Hanoi it refused to accept any more refugees who were forced to return.
Hong Kong officials said the delay over the new agreement has been because the Vietnamese were trying to work out the logistical problems of reintegrating the thousands of returnees.
One Western diplomat said, however, there could also be internal political problems in Hanoi, with some officials there opposed to the agreement because of the American opposition.
The United States led the protest over the 1989 incident, arguing that it was wrong forcibly to return people to a repressive government that might persecute them for their original flight. Hanoi is currently sensitive to American opinion because it wants to establish diplomatic and economic ties with the United States.
United States Assistant Secretary of State Richard Solomon said today that America's position "has been clear for a long time. We are opposed to the forced repatriation of people from Hong Kong to Vietnam, particularly given the current circumstances in that country."
 
U.S. Response Critical
 But it is uncertain how strongly Washington would protest a new British-Vietnamese deal on forced repatriation, and officials in Hong Kong have said the American response will be critical to the accord.
Whatever the cause, the delay has only added to the wrenching tensions in the Hong Kong camps.
In Whitehead Detention Center, the largest and most volatile camp, thousands of refugees have been staging peaceful demonstrations for the past two weeks, and some of their leaders said some have begun to plan hunger strikes, armed resistance and even suicide if guards come to take them away.
Whitehead, which houses 25,000 people, is populated largely by Vietnamese who have been through the screening process and were told they do not qualify as genuine refugees fleeing persecution.
Reporters are not allowed inside the detention camps, but they can sometimes get close enough to see the demonstrations at Whitehead, where as many as 15,000 Vietnamese march in circles behind high mesh fences looped with barbed wire. The protesters carry homemade banners and signs that read "Freeworld Save Us,' and "Dead Better than Red."
"So far the demonstrations have been peaceful and orderly, but everyone is very, very anxious, and some extremists are pushing for more violent actions," said David Liu, a spokesman for Refugee Concern Hong Kong, an umbrella organization of relief groups that work inside the camps.

HEADLINE: Thomas Hearings as Testimony to the Power of Race in American Politics

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Oct. 17

 BODY:
It was billed as a watershed drama about sexual harassment, but in the end, as has been the case so often in the past, the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court turned on something else -- race.
The particulars were new -- a black conservative defended by Southern white Senators. But in its imagery, in the emotions it engendered and in the way both blacks and whites reacted, the fight over Judge Thomas's nomination was a stark evocation of the eerie continuity and the startling power of race in American life and politics. 
 "When you put all the hot buttons out in front of you, clearly race is the one that's white hot," said Harrison Hickman, a Democratic political consultant.
 
Flux in Race Relations
 The furor, particularly the emotion-packed Senate hearings last weekend, reflected much of the flux in the nation's race relations. Not only was the Thomas nomination salvaged by white Southerners, who were clearly concerned with the power of the black vote, but it also presented television audiences -- perhaps for the first time -- with a view of cadres of conservative black professionals very different from the general stereotypes of blacks.
But beneath the surface, the emotions engendered were so familiar as to be almost primal.
For blacks, there was a solid show of support for an embattled black man, even one assailed as an enemy of civil rights, that reinforced the degree to which blacks have behaved as a unified political force.
For whites, there was a melodrama in which a black man was seen as either a long-suffering figure assaulted on all sides or Willie Horton in a suit and tie -- a division that mirrors the traditional racial iconography of the South.
For the nation, there was the reminder that racial politics remain the most emotionally charged divide, one that is so powerful that a black conservative critical of the civil rights agenda could raise the specter of racism and the Democrats questioning him were all but silenced.
There was also the reminder that more than three decades after the beginning of the civil rights revolution in the South, the racial dilemmas that once haunted the South now play the same role nationally.
"The role that blacks play today is the role they have always played in the South," said Joel Williamson, a humanities professor at the University of North Carolina who is the author of "The Crucible of Race: Black-White Relations in the South Since Emancipation" (Oxford University Press, 1984). "If you just look at the black and white bodies and their mutual proximity to one another, there's been a revolution. But if you look at ideas, opinions and notions, if you push it out toward the subconscious, very little has changed."
In some ways, the Thomas nomination, the hearings and the vote helped destroy the idea of a monolithic black community. Instead, Judge Thomas's conservative views and the savvy black professionals who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, provided a rare view of the philosophical and economic diversity among blacks.
But most striking may have been the way that many black Americans vigorously supported Judge Thomas, who characterized the hearings as a "high-tech lynching," a comparison that was later derided by members of Congressional Black Caucus.
Roger Wilkins, a longtime civil rights figure who teaches at George Mason University, attributed part of the support to the degree to which most blacks were unaware of the specifics of what he termed Judge Thomas's "hideous record of attacking civil rights remedies and civil rights leaders."
But he also saw a deep-rooted and instinctive reaction of blacks who saw a common interest in defending one of their own.
"Blacks have been terribly deprived throughout our history and we've been deprived among other things of symbols of pride occupying high places," he said. "So that when a black is presented for such a position there is an instinctive reaction to support that person."
That was the clear view on Auburn Avenue here, where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was born, and where the Southern Christian Leadership Conference he headed and the civil rights center named for him stand.
Here, in one of the spiritual meccas of the civil rights movement, there was overwhelming support for Judge Thomas, more often in spite of his philosophy than because of it.
"How can a black man be a conservative?" asked Marquette DeCuir, shaking his head in disgust as he and a small group of men discussed the Thomas affair near the shoeshine stand at the Fashion Dry Cleaners.
But, that said, he voiced his wholehearted support of Judge Thomas, to the unanimous assent of the other men on hand. "Of course, I'm going to support a black man," he said. "I don't care who he is."
In their recent book, "Chain Reaction: The Impact of Race, Rights and Taxes on American Politics," (W. W. Norton, 1991) Thomas Byrne Edsall and Mary D. Edsall argue that racial issues, explicit and subterranean, have torn apart the old Democratic coalition and driven whites toward the Republican Party. It is a process that mimics the traditional politics of the South.
Professor Williamson says much of the racial psychology of the South is also being played out on a national level. Much like the world depicted in Ralph Ellison's classic novel, "Invisible Man," he said, whites had never been able to see blacks as people but rather as stereotypes. He said throughout history Southerners had seen blacks as either devils or angels -- either beloved field hands and docile country folk or as rapacious animals.
In the Thomas hearings, before a transfixed nation, Judge Thomas was transformed into both, with a power clearly exacerbated by race, he said.
But Professor Williamson said integration, however limited and often painful, was also producing a quiet transformation. "The one bright element is this business of physical integration," he said. "We're getting better generation by generation, but I think we have several hundred years to go."
Whatever the case, few people expect race to recede as a national issue.
"I think it will continue to heat up," Professor Wilkins said. "When we're in uncertain economic times, white people become insecure and frightened, and they look around for scapegoats. The racial advances we've had usually have come in times of economic expansion, when people feel good about themselves. I don't think the American people are going to feel very optimistic for some time to come."

HEADLINE: New Jersey Bars Project in Way Of Skyline View

 BODY:
Hundreds of thousands of motorists and bus drivers move down the ramp to the Lincoln Tunnel each day, taking in a sweeping view of the Hudson River and the Manhattan skyline before they plunge into the tube that takes them from New Jersey to Manhattan.
New Jersey environmental officials have decided that the view is worth preserving, and they announced yesterday that a developer could not block it by building two high-rise office buildings on the Hudson River waterfront in Weehawken. 
 The decision, which the developer says it will appeal, was a victory for state and local environmental groups that have fought to have the project either scaled down or rejected.
Ruth Elsasser, president of the Weehawken Environment Committee, said: "This is a one-of-a-kind view of the Hudson River. It is a magnificent, beautiful resource."
 
Project Developed by Hartz
 The proposed buildings were to be part of Lincoln Harbor, a commercial and residential complex being developed by Hartz Mountain Industries of Secaucus on 93 acres of Hudson riverfront. The project consists of retail and restaurant space, a 322-room hotel, 300 units of housing, a 250-slip marina and two other completed office buildings.
The buildings at issue were designed to be "mirror images" of two 160-foot buildings that went up earlier. The Weehawken Planning Board had approved Hartz Mountain's plans, but the developer also needed a permit from the state Department of Environmental Protection and Energy.
John Weingart, Assistant Commissioner in the department, said, "When balancing the competing equities, the department concluded that the view enjoyed by millions when approaching the Hudson River is an important asset to the waterfront region and New Jersey as a whole."
Mr. Weingart said that the decision to deny the permit was reached only after Hartz Mountain had been given an opportunity to revise its plans so that the buildings would not obstruct the view that officials say is enjoyed by nearly 400,000 commuters a day. He said environmental officials suggested that the buildings be redesigned 85 feet tall instead of the original 160 feet.
The developer's lawyer, Daniel E. Horgan, called the suggested changes "economically impractical."
"Nobody would invest his mother's money in the scheme the department has come up with," Mr. Horgan said.

HEADLINE: Suggestion on Housing for the Homeless in Brooklyn Draws Anger

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
In the first round of what promises to be a long debate, a Federal agency has recommended that Andrew Cuomo's HELP for the Homeless group be chosen to build housing for hundreds of homeless people on the site of the old Brooklyn Navy Yard, angering some local groups who have other ideas.
As word of the recommendation seeped out yesterday, the Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden -- already irate at the Dinkins administration's recent plan for scattering up to two dozen new shelters for homeless single people around the city -- denounced it as "inhumane dumping." 
 Mr. Cuomo, the Governor's son, heads a special mayoral commission due to make sweeping recommendations on the city's homeless policy by next winter. His role in the Brooklyn Navy Yard site injected him into a long-simmering dispute between Hasidic and Hispanic groups in Brooklyn, each in search of land to gain more housing for their own communities.
"This was the promised land that we were continually told by the city will be the answer to the housing crisis in Williamsburg, and to relieve the tension between the Latinos and the Hasidic community," said Isaac Abraham of the Federation of Tenants Councils of Williamsburg. "We have lost the battle for good."
But Mr. Cuomo said yesterday that his proposal would be only part of a comprehensive plan for the site, which stretches over more than 30 acres from Fort Greene to Williamsburg along the East River. He said he would defer on the design and specifics to state and city officials who are crafting a joint proposal for a mix of permanent housing, economic development, homeless housing and open space there.
Mr. Cuomo's proposal was recommended by the Department of Health and Human Services under a Federal law that requires the Government to give special consideration to housing for the homeless when disposing of surplus Federal land. The final decision rests with the Navy, and city officials said they expected any disposition would be months away.
In effect, Mr. Cuomo now has his foot in the door, with first priority to develop whatever part of the site is used for homeless people, and in a position to help broker a compromise among all the various groups that have an interest in using it.
"I believe the most intelligent approach is to forge a coalition that goes to the Federal Government hand in hand with one comprehensive plan, rather than leaving it to the Federal Government to forge such a plan," he said in a telephone interview yesterday.
Mr. Cuomo said his plan involved only transitional housing for less than 1,000 homeless families and singles, but he would not be more specific, saying the outline would be subsumed in a broader plan.
Deputy Mayor Barbara J. Fife said the city and state would submit their joint plan to the General Services Administration, which acts as go-between for the Navy, on Monday.
Depending on what sorts of projects are settled on, she said, the city might need fewer of the 35 potential sites it suggested last week for building new transitional shelters, with special services to meet the mental and health needs of single homeless people. She said the city had not earlier included the Navy Yard in its plan because control of the site was not certain.

HEADLINE: Weiser Journal;
For Small-Town Doctor, A Big Banner Welcome

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEISER, Idaho, Oct. 16

 BODY:
On the menu at this weekend's Weiser Wolverine homecoming feast is a tub of potato salad, piles of hot barbecue beef sandwiches and a mountainous cake, which is inscribed, "Welcome, Dr. Barr."
If that doesn't make Dr. Deland Barr of Wellington, Kan., feel at home in Weiser -- "call us Weezerites, that's what we are," says the town grocer, Tom Anderson -- there is more. Much more. 
 Across the town's main drag, the central route for the homecoming parade, is another big banner welcoming to town the 40-year-old doctor, his wife, Sally, and their six children. At halftime in the big game, Dr. Barr will be introduced. And in a grand, final ceremony on Saturday, Dr. Barr is to sign his name to a contract binding him to this farm town of 4,700 people in western Idaho for at least two years.
The rhythms of small-town America remain as ageless as the cottonwoods now aflame with color here, but its problems change with the years. Weiser, like many rural communities, has a doctor shortage. Two of the town's three physicians want to retire, and the third, Dr. Byron Drake, who is 38, says he will not stay unless he has at least one partner. Dr. Barr will be his partner.
Without doctors, the 27-bed hospital would close. Without the hospital, said Mayor J. K. Jones, the nursing home might close, too. And then Weiser itself might well roll up and die.
As Mr. Anderson put it, "You start forcing people to leave your town to go for a basic service, and everything else might leave as well."
With 2,000 counties around the country underserved by doctors -- there is a shortage of nearly 35,000 family practitioners, primarily in rural areas, according to the American Academy of Family Physicians -- the odds of Weiser's finding a new doctor were bleak. Idaho, with only 1,400 practicing doctors for its one million people, has the lowest ratio of doctors to patients of any state.
More than ever before, medical students are shunning rural areas. Beginning their careers with an average college debt of $53,000, young doctors say it is nearly impossible to survive economically in small towns. The typical doctor now makes about $150,000, according to the American Medical Association.
What could Weiser offer? Well, its people grow onions as big as softballs and as sweet as apples, and they raise a hybrid corn that is marketed as microwave popcorn. Hell's Canyon, the deepest gorge in North America, starts just a holler to the west, and the great alpine peaks of the Sawtooth Range are within a day's drive to the east.
You can buy a house for $25,000. Most people leave their doors unlocked and their car keys in the ignition. (Note to potential burglars: don't get any ideas; Weiserites are well-armed, especially now that it's hunting season.)
But you can't eat the scenery, and even sweet onions get old after a while. Cash, the citizens of Weiser decided, was the only sure-fire way to bring a new doctor to town.
For the last three years the townspeople have held bake sales, car washes, raffles, card games, and sold tables full of pies on Cabin Fever night at the high school. They raised $55,000 in the doctor recruitment drive, but still had no doctor in sight.
The big break came this year when a Dallas medical recruitment firm, Merritt, Hawkins and Associates, chose Weiser from among more than 50 communities that applied after the firm said it would waive the $20,000 fee it charges for finding doctors.
Weiser was chosen because of its strong community spirit and because it is a textbook example of the crisis in rural health, said James Merritt, the firm's president.
After a nationwide search, the firm found Dr. Barr in Kansas. He and his wife said they always wanted to live in the mountains. Colorado, they said, "was too touristy." Weiser seemed perfect. On a visit last summer, they were impressed with the town.
The problem was money. After much discussion, a deal was struck in which the town agreed to subsidize part of Dr. Barr's salary in the first two years of his contract. The aim is to have him earn from $85,000 to $110,000, said Phil Lowe, the administrator of the Weiser Memorial Hospital and head of the recruitment drive. After a few years, Dr. Barr's practice should be self-sustaining.
But some sticking points remain. The life of a country doctor is anything but idyllic. Dr. Barr said he would like to have some time to enjoy the country around Weiser, but with on-call responsibilities at any hour, the job can be a seven-day affair.
"I enjoy small-town medicine because it allows me to do things I wouldn't normally be allowed to do, but that's also a drawback," he said.
If, as expected, Dr. Barr can work out the final details of his contract by Saturday morning, Weiser can rest easy for at least two years. But Weiserites have no such plans.
"After he signs, we're just going to love him and love him and show him how much we care about him," Mr. Lowe said. "He will never feel unwanted."

HEADLINE: Urban Memo;
An Underground Burp Makes Midtown Quake

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
There is a breakdown at a telephone switching station. Half the long-distance phone circuits into and out of New York City are cut off. Airports are thrown into chaos because the air traffic controllers who guide takeoffs and landings at local airports are disconnected.
There is a lovers' quarrel. A homeless woman raging at her companion sets fire to a shack under the West Side Highway. Traffic is tied up for miles and for hours as officials assess the damage to the elevated roadway. 
 There is an electrical-transformer fire in lower Manhattan. Wall Street trading floors go dark, hundreds of workers are trapped in elevators and thousands are forced to walk down endless shadowy flights of stairs.
The vulnerability of the city was demonstrated once again on Thursday when a water main burst at Lexington Avenue and East 42d Street, flooding the subway station below, buckling the pavement above and creating a Rube Goldbergian chain reaction that clogged highways leading into the city and snarled traffic on feeder roads as far away as Yonkers.
 
19th-Century Infrastructure
 New Yorkers see their city as big, complicated and invincible. And it is, so long as everything functions the way it is supposed to. Not everything does. There were 592 broken water mains in the 12 months that ended June 30.
But the water mains are not the only problem. Some urban planners say that high-tech marvels that have been superimposed over a low-to-medium-tech infrastructure -- essentially the layering of late 20th century over the 19th century city -- could make disruptions more frequent and more annoying. "The more sophisticated the city, the more fragile it is," said Mitchell Moss, director of New York University's Urban Planning Institute.
New York City's population is roughly the same as that of Belgium or the Netherlands, but its 7.3 million people are jammed into far less space. The density alone magnifies the disruptions to the underground labyrinth, the largest on this continent. Density also plays a role that small European countries do not have to think twice about. New York's infrastructure converges at what amounts to an epicenter: Manhattan. Snaking under the 24 square miles of Manhattan are 11 million miles of telephone wire, 19,000 miles of electrical cable, 6,000 miles of water mains, 4,000 miles of gas lines, 100 miles of cable television wiring and 105 miles of steam pipes -- all crammed into passages barely big enough to crawl through.
 
Problems Upon Problems
 It is a system, if that word can be used to describe such a labyrinthine maze, that urban planners still marvel at. The drawback is that much of it, once pioneering and imitated, is by now ancient.
"One of the problems of coming first is you have the oldest infrastructure," said George Sternlieb, former director of the Urban Institute at Rutgers University.
Indeed, more than half the city's water mains were installed before 1940 and are made of brittle, breakable cast iron. The one that ruptured on Thursday was far from the first. Three years ago, a main laid in 1898 ruptured, flooding Columbus Circle above and below ground and disrupting subway service for two days. And a main that burst on Fifth Avenue at 19th Street in 1989 took more than a year to repair.
 
A Recipe for Disaster
 Some problems arise when the increasingly sophisticated parts of the infrastructure do not mesh. This is what Tony Hiss, the urban historian and author of "The Experience of Place," means when he talks about the tensions between "the water delivery system" and "the people delivery system."
Twice as many cars enter Manhattan every day as did immediately after World War II, causing vibrations that can often rupture water pipes, although officials indicated that was not a factor on Thursday. "You're putting much more stress on the system because of the way we've reconfigured transportation -- without thinking about the way it would affect the rest of the the infrastructure," Mr. Hiss said.
Some experts see contrasts between the old mechanical systems and the new software-driven communications networks. Mr. Moss maintains that the water mains are the most sensitive component of the infrastructure, because they can more easily wreak havoc on the other components. But other components, while more efficient than the ones that handled the same tasks in the past, are still vulnerable, which can mean more havoc than ever.
The new fiber optic phone cables are a prime example, Mr. Moss said. "Since they carry more messages than the copper they replaced," he said, "a break is far more significant than a break in a copper cable. A small problem produces an international catastrophe for communications. The reason is the phone systems are now software-driven and they're all connected to each other. They're so highly interconnected that problems occurring in a small fiber can have consequences for the entire Northeast."

HEADLINE: Year After Tax Leap, New Jersey Faces Budget Gap

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
 New Jersey, which last year had the biggest tax increase in state history, faces its second budget crisis in a row next year.
Barring a dramatic turnaround in the state's economy, revenues will fall at least $500 million short in the fiscal year that will begin on July 1. State Treasurer Douglas Berman says the short-term outlook for such a turnaround is "gloomy" based on reports this month on the economic health of the nation and the region. 
 Mr. Berman's prediction has implications for this year's budget of $14.6 billion as well as for the budget next year when the state will not be able to count on more than $500 million in one-time revenues that it used this year.
"The economic news is more uncertain" than had been expected when the present budget was drawn up, Mr. Berman said in an interview. "We assumed the economy would lag but would start to grow. I am not so sanguine any more."
 
Delay Expected in Early '92
 Despite such pessimistic forecasts, echoed by other Democratic leaders, Republicans have said that if they win control of the Legislature in November, they will make good on a pledge included in their party platform this summer: to roll back a one-cent increase in the sales tax that was approved by the Democratic-controlled Legislature last year at Mr. Florio's urging. If they succeeded, it would cost the state another $550 million in revenue -- and the Republicans say they are prepared to reduce the size of the government to deal with that.
Mr. Berman said that while overall revenue was on target so far, his concern was that money might not come in nearly so fast as expected in the first half of 1992.
Sales-tax revenue for the first two months of this fiscal year -- the most recent figures available -- showed an increase over last year of only two-tenths of 1 percent, from $689.2 million to $692.2 million this year.
But income-tax collections in the first quarter of the fiscal year increased by 22 percent, from $534.9 million to $653.5 million, over the same quarter a year ago, mainly because of rate increases imposed on higher-income taxpayers.
 
A Democrat's Concern
 Senator Laurence Weiss, the Middlesex Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Revenue, Finance and Appropriations Committee, said in an interview that his biggest concern was flat sales-tax revenues despite the one-cent increase.
"It will take 18 months or more" for retail sales to increase substantially, he said. "Retail sales will stay flat, so sales taxes will stay flat. It's nobody's fault."
The Republican Assembly Leader, Chuck Haytaian, who would become Assembly Speaker if the Republicans take over that house in next month's elections, maintains that his party is committed to reducing the sales tax, even if it means further sharp cuts in spending on top of those imposed by the Florio administration, including the elimination of some 5,000 state jobs through attrition, early retirements and layoffs. The sales tax was increased from six cents to seven and extended to items not previously taxed, like paper products and alcoholic beverages. That accounted for about $1.5 billion of the record $2.8 billion tax increase.
 
'Major Downsizing'
 "We will not approve the budget next year if the Governor has a revenue source based on the sales tax increase," Mr. Haytaian said. "We will not pass the budget."
Mr. Haytaian was not specific about which jobs or services he would cut to make up the $550 million that would be lost if the sales tax is rolled back, but he said a "major downsizing" of state government would be necessary.
Senator Gerald Stockman, a Trenton Democrat who is a ranking member of the Senate Revenue, Finance and Appropriations Committee, said of the Republicans' vow: "It's snake oil for him to be talking about this around the state."

HEADLINE: A Valuable Government Document! Free!

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
Whenever Donald W. Kellerman, a specialist in retirement planning for Dean Witter Reynolds, meets with new clients he recommends that they obtain a free Government document describing the benefits on which two-thirds of retirees rely for at least half their income: Social Security.
"I always hold up one of these forms and tell them to send it in," said Mr. Kellerman, referring to the application for a Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statement. The Social Security Administration began offering the statement in 1988. This, along with information about one's company pension, is the starting point, he said, for anybody planning for retirement. 
 Yet, this mine of information is relatively unexploited. Less than 5 percent of the 133 million people with Social Security accounts request the statement in a given year, far fewer than could profitably use it.
Even savvy financial people, in fact, often assume that the Pebes (rhymes with webs) merely confirms that their employer has been paying into the account on their behalf and that they will ultimately qualify for benefits on retirement.
 
A Valuable Financial Planning Aid
 But the statement provides far more, making it an extremely valuable financial planning aid that can help determine, among other things, how long a person will need to work and what other financial provision he or she will need for retirement.
When I recently received my own statement, I learned that if I worked for the next 13 years and retired at 65 my monthly retirement benefit would be about $1,230, and that if I worked until my so-called full retirement age of 65 years, 4 months, the benefit would rise to $1,260. A gradual increase in the full-retirement age begins to take effect in the year 2000 until the age at which one can collect full benefits reaches 67 in 2027.
The statement also informed me that if I retired at 70, my estimated benefit would be $1,740 a month. These estimates are all figured on the basis of a presumed 1 percent annual increase in the average national wage between now and age 62, but they do not allow for inflation. Social Security benefits are automatically raised each year, based on increases in the Consumer Price Index. (The rise for 1992, announced this week, is to be 3.7 percent.)
In addition to these figures, of which I previously had only a vague notion, the Pebes told me I would get $1,055 a month if I were disabled now, and detailed the amounts my wife and children would get if I should die.
The statement thus represents a major advance from the days when Social Security officials typically did manual calculations on request for those approaching retirement, and account holders knew virtually nothing about the other benefits.
"I'm really proud we were able to do this," said Dorcas R. Hardy, a former Commissioner in whose tenure the Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statement was adopted. "It was a massive computer undertaking."
Besides describing and estimating benefits, the Pebes also provides a year-by-year record back to 1937 of a worker's earnings that were subject to Social Security taxes and the amount of taxes (formerly called contributions) the worker paid. Among other things, this allows one to see the relation between taxes and benefits, a link seldom established in public discussion.
You can see, for example, how long it will take after retirement to get back the amount paid in. Most retirees will get back far more money than they paid in Social Security taxes even if it is assumed that they would have saved the money and invested it in Treasury bills. People with average earnings (about $20,000) will get all their taxes back in two years -- five and a half years if allowance is made for interest. High earners, those earning more than $50,000, break even in seven years if interest is figured, and three years if not; low-income people, earning about $10,000 a year, in four years with interest, one without.
Lower-income workers pay a higher proportion of their income in Social Security taxes than do the wealthy, but their retirement benefits are proportionately higher.
"The $50,000-a-year guy doesn't get five times the benefits of the $10,000 guy," said Philip Gambino, a spokesman for the Social Security Administration.
A check of one's own record establishes two things. First, it shows that one's employer has not absconded with the withheld taxes and, second, whether one has worked long enough to qualify for benefits, which are based on a combination of longevity in the work force and of earnings.
The minimum requirement is 40 credits, a credit this year being $540 of wages subject to Social Security taxes or self-employment income. Four credits, previously called quarters, can be earned in a year.
"The sooner people can review what we are recording, the sooner we can catch any errors," said Gwendolyn S. King, the present Commissioner. Some 2 to 3 percent of people checking their records allege errors.
If your Pebes does not accurately reflect your work and earnings history, report this to Social Security by calling the 800 number provided on the statement. You must have W-2 statements, pay stubs or other proof.
 
How to Get a Benefit Statement
 Obtaining your Pebes is quite simple. First, telephone Social Security at (800) 772-1213 (a new number this fall) and give your name and address. This will bring a short form on which you supply your date of birth, Social Security number, the retirement age you desire (the minimum is 62, at which the benefit is 80 percent of the benefit at 65), your present salary and your projected earnings until retirement. It takes about a month for the statement to arrive. You may apply for statements repeatedly if, say, you want to compare benefits at different retirement ages.
The earnings and benefit statements have attracted such praise among those who know about them that, beginning in 1999, the law obliges the Social Security Administration to start mailing them out automatically each year.
Beginning in 1995, statements are to be automatically mailed to those reaching age 60 for whom a current address can be found.
"I think it's a really great tool," Ms. King said. "People need to start doing some serious planning. We need to make sure they have a realistic view."

HEADLINE: Ex-Klan Chief Has Even Odds in Governor's Race

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Oct. 18

 BODY:
As the Louisiana governor's race drew near a close today, the politics of this state seemed at first glance to be as murky and meandering as the waters of a delta bayou.
But one factor seems most likely to dictate the outcome: David Duke, a former neo-Nazi and grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, has become a major contender in Saturday's open primary by running a campaign that has used code words and symbols like "the rising welfare underclass" to blame blacks for unemployment, crime, government bureaucracy and almost anything else he can identify as a threat to what he calls "our treasured Christian life style." 
 Recent public opinion polls indicate the vote Saturday is essentially a three-way heat with Mr. Duke, a State Representative; former Gov. Edwin Edwards, and the incumbent Governor, Buddy Roemer, running close.
Regardless of the outcome, this election will be a major test of how racial identities and biases are shaping political loyalties in a major Southern state on the eve of a Presidential election year. The two top vote-getters will probably meet in a runoff on Nov. 16, since no one of the three candidates seems likely to receive a majority of the vote on this round.
Mr. Edwards, a populist Democrat, is counting on the historic loyalty to his party of black voters, who usually make up 27 percent of the electorate. Mr. Roemer, who switched to the Republican Party last March, is trying to show that a moderate conservative can draw black votes from the Democrats. And Mr. Duke is openly appealing to whites as the only candidate who would truly protect their interests.
So far, Mr. Duke has avoided explicit attacks on blacks, and he found a new vehicle for making his point without overt racism in the controversy over the confirmation of Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court.
At a campaign rally in the Cajun country of east Louisiana earlier this week Mr. Duke said: "When I saw Clarence Thomas during some of those hearings, my heart went out to him. The forces that tried to destroy his character are the same forces that tried to destroy mine."
Mr. Duke then focused his attack on the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which opposed the Thomas nomination and noted that both Mr. Roemer and Mr. Edwards are "members in good standing." Mr. Duke said: "The N.A.A.C.P. is a far-left organization. The N.A.A.C.P. stands for gun control. I believe in the right of law-abiding citizens to bear arms. I believe in the rights to be judged on your merits and not your race."
Looking blow-dried and freshly scrubbed, the 41-year-old Mr. Duke campaigns in blue jeans and T-shirts or in big-shouldered suits. On his lapel he wears a pin shaped like a fish, an ancient symbol for Christ. He speaks with fervor and sincerity, and there is none of the anger common to the segregationist politicians who were the heroes of his youth.
 
Letting Alone His Past
 No one, not even his opponents in this campaign, has made a major issue of his past associations with the Klan and neo-Nazi groups.
This is a marked contrast to last year's election, when Mr. Duke unsuccessfully tried to unseat Senator J. Bennett Johnston, a Democrat. When Mr. Duke showed surprising strength in opinion polls, he was the target of television commercials showing him raising his arm in a Nazi salute at a cross burning several years earlier.
Mr. Duke took 44 percent of the total vote, including about 58 percent of the white vote in that race.
"Voters here know about Duke, and they have made up their minds about his past," said Susan Howell, director of the Survey Research Center at the University of New Orleans. "The other candidates are afraid to attack Duke because they worry about a backlash."
A survey made public by the center earlier this month analyzed the responses of 745 voters to identify those who favored Mr. Duke even if they would not admit it. The researchers found that some 24 percent of the voters surveyed favored Mr. Duke, as against 28 percent for Mr. Edwards and 30 percent for Mr. Roemer. The sampling error in the survey was plus or minus four percentage points.
Several factors have combined to spare Mr. Duke the criticism he faced in 1990.
Various polls suggest that the two constituencies most likely to oppose Mr. Duke have been divided in the three-way race. Black voters have gravitated to Mr. Edwards, while affluent, highly educated whites are loyal to Mr. Roemer.
Also, both Mr. Roemer and Mr. Edwards must consider the possibility that they will be vying for Mr. Duke's constituents if they eliminate him in the first round of voting and face each other in the second. Harsh attacks on him now would prove counterproductive later, aides to both Mr. Edwards and Mr. Roemer said.
Finally, from the start of the campaign Mr. Duke has identified his enemies as outlandish liberals and as nefarious people from out of state. In a half-hour television campaign advertisement that he is broadcasting repeatedly, Mr. Duke pre-empts his potential critics: "They never accuse me of any violence toward minorities. They accuse me only of thought crime; of being politically incorrect; of saying out loud what many say privately."
Mr. Duke reportedly became active with the Klan when he was 16 years old and quit only in 1980. During the 1970's he worked with the National Socialist White People's Party and openly espoused Nazism. From 1980 to 1990 he was president of the National Association for the Advancement of White People, a group he founded and used as a launching platform for his political career. He remains active in the group.
Addressing all-white crowds, Mr. Duke has frequently stated that "this election is about our way of life surviving in Louisiana and across the United States," identifying the principal threat as the "uncontrolled demographic growth of the welfare class."
In Louisiana many people of all races have found their way of life threatened by an economic depression that started with the oil price bust of 1982. Nearly a decade later, in a campaign debate, Mr. Roemer tried to put as bright a face on the current situation as he could by saying, "We've stabilized our free fall."
Mr. Duke's appeal under these circumstances was evident at a rally in the small town of Kaplan in eastern Louisiana this week. "The young voters see Duke as a gladiator," said Kim Verret, a restaurant owner.
At the rally Mr. Duke hammered at his standard themes: testing tenants of public housing for drugs, obliging welfare recipients to work and giving cash payments to welfare mothers who accept implants of long-term contraceptives. The crowd cheered him at every turn.
"You can't fault the other candidates for not attacking Duke," said Lance Hill, executive director of the Louisiana Coalition Against Racism and Nazism, a group that has criticized Mr. Duke. "The other candidates are just trying to win elections. Duke is trying to win hearts and minds with the idea of building a racialist political movement, and so every election provides him a platform whether he wins or loses."

HEADLINE: Most Oil Fires Are Out in Kuwait, But Its Environment Is Devastated

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Oct. 18

 BODY:
Less than eight months after most of its oil wells were set ablaze by withdrawing Iraqi troops, causing one of the world's great environmental and economic catastrophes, Kuwait has put out most of the fires. Oil-industry officials in the region said this week that all the blazes would be extinguished sometime in November.
More than 700 wells were sabotaged. Yet the speed with which they have been brought under control, and the $1 billion cost so far, have surprised many industry experts. Back in February, most of these experts had predicted that it would take two years and several billion dollars to restore the country's once-thriving oil industry. 
 "As of today, we have only 87 oil wells on fire," a senior Kuwaiti oil executive said in a telephone interview, "and they are being put out at the rate of two to three a day."
Kuwait's Oil Minister, Hamoud Abdullah al-Raqba, told Parliament earlier this week that 28 teams of oilfield firefighting specialists will complete their work well ahead of a Dec. 23 conference of heads of state of the Gulf Cooperation Council, an alliance of Saudi Arabia and five smaller countries on the Arabian peninsula.
Kuwaiti and Saudi officials said they expected Kuwait's oil exports to increase to 550,000 barrels a day by year's end and 1.3 million barrels a day by December 1992. Before it was invaded by Iraq in August 1990, Kuwait pumped two million barrels daily.
Kuwaiti officials estimate the total cost of the Iraqi sabotage to be at least $22 billion, including oil gone to waste and damage to the pipelines, pumps and wellheads in the oilfields.
"The recovery has been much faster than what most people expected and it comes at a time when the world oil markets can use more oil to dampen the rise in oil prices," said Pierre Terzian, editor of Petrostrategies, a Paris-based oil-industry newsletter.
Kuwait's re-emergence on the world market comes at an opportune time for its Government. Oil prices have risen steeply over the last three weeks as companies and consumers around the world begin to stock up for winter. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia, is pumping all the oil its 13 members can produce but failing to satisfy world demand. This week, prices reached $24 a barrel in the United States, up from less than $22 a barrel only three weeks ago.
The world's oil-supply situation has been aggravated by a steady fall in Soviet production amid the country's political chaos of the last two years. Soviet output has fallen to a little more than 10 million barrels a day this year, down from a high of 12.5 million barrels a day only three years ago.
 
Iraq Mired in Export Dispute
 Another reason why oil prices are rising, experts say, is uncertainty over the resumption of exports by Iraq.
An authorization by the United Nations to allow Iraq to begin exporting oil in order to generate $1.6 billion in income to be used to buy essential food, has yet to take effect as Iraq argues with the United Nations over the terms of lifting the economic and military embargo that has been imposed on the country since its invasion of Kuwait.
"Right now the market is uncertain about what's ahead with regard to Iraqi exports, Soviet exports and what kind of winter we will have," said Gary Ross, president of Petroleum Industry Research Associates, which is based in New York. "Under these circumstances the prices will only climb up."
Despite the accomplishments of the firefighters in Kuwait, officials in the Persian Gulf region said the country still suffers from enormous environmental problems. Among the most serious of these are the vast lakes of oil that have formed in the desert around leaking wells where the fire has been put out but the oil continued to flow.
A senior executive of the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation said there were about 200 such lakes, some of which are more than a mile wide and several feet deep. Altogether, these lakes contain 30 million to 60 million barrels of oil, Kuwaiti experts estimate. The oil is evaporating, leaving behind a thick residue of fuel oil and gas oil, these experts say.
This residue is slowly seeping into the ground, poisoning the desert. There is no precedent for this calamity, so environmental experts can only guess at the extent of the damage to underground water supplies and the soil itself, as well as the hazards to human health.
Another problem is the smoke that continues to pour from the oil wells that are still burning.
Yet Abdelrahman al-Awadi, a former Kuwaiti Cabinet minister who is overseeing the environmental aspects of the oil disaster, said this week that the quality of the air in the country has improved to the point that pollution levels are half of what is considered very hazardous to humans.

HEADLINE: Experts Explore Rise in Mass Murder

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
The killing of 22 people at a Texas cafeteria Wednesday is only the latest incident showing a rapid increase in mass murder in the past decade, both in frequency and in the number of victims murdered in individual attacks.
In the view of experts, mass murder is a peculiarly American phenomenon that has grown out of the proliferation of guns in this country, the disintegration of traditional American society and, more recently, the decline in the standard of living in recent years as millions of relatively high-paying jobs have been lost. 
 Of the 10 largest mass murders in American history, in fact, 8 have occured since 1980, according to a widely recognized expert, Dr. James A. Fox of Northeastern University here.
And while mass murderers are part of a larger picture of increasing violence in American society, they also represent a distinctly identifiable subset of murderers, a group whose menacing characteristics are sometimes recognized by neighbors and friends after the crimes occur, but whose explosions into murder cannot be anticipated.
 
Possible Link to Hearings
 In the case of the shootings in Killeen, Tex., several experts said they were intrigued by the possibility that the murders might have been triggered by the killer's reaction to the televised Senate hearings last weekend into Prof. Anita F. Hill's accusations of sexual harrassment against Judge Clarence Thomas. The murderer, George J. Hennard, evidently harbored a strong dislike for women.
Dr. Fox, defines mass murder as the killing of four or more people, said there were now an average of two mass murders a month in this country. Most are in Texas, California and Florida, heavily populated states with a large influx of migrants searching for new jobs or families after disappointments or frustrations elsewhere.
It is this kind of unhappy, angry people, almost always middle-aged white men in their 30's or 40's, who are most likely to become mass murderers, said Dr. Fox, the dean of the College of Criminal Justice at Northeastern and a co-author of "Mass Murder," (Plenum Publishing, 1985) widely considered the most authoritative study of this type of crime.
Typically mass murderers are men with no previous criminal record or history of mental illness, said Dr. Marvin E. Wolfgang, professor of criminology and law at the University of Pennsylvania, and their killings "are not really planned."
 
'Inability to Predict'
 Like Mr. Hennard, they may be rude to their neighbors and have occasional outbursts that frighten people, but that is true of thousands of people around the country and offers no clue that they will become mass murderers, added Dr. Fox.
"What is really striking is our complete inability to predict this kind of violence," said Deborah Denno, a criminologist and an associate professor of law at Fordham University.
What seems to happen with men who become mass murderers, Dr. Fox said, is that after a prolonged period of being lonely, frustrated and filled with rage, "There is some precipitating event, often a catastrophe in their lives," which drives them over the edge. It may be getting divorced or losing their jobs, Dr. Fox said.
In Mr. Hennard's case, one factor might have been that he was disconsolate about having been stripped of his license as a merchant seaman after being found with marijuana.
But, neighbors say, Mr. Hennard also exhibited a hatred for at least some women, which showed up in a letter he wrote to two women referring to "those mostly white treacherous female vipers" who "tried to destroy me and my family."
In Dr. Fox's view, "It's possible the Senate hearings stirred up his anger at women.
Neil Semelser, a professor of sociology at the University of California at Berkeley, agreed. "The Thomas hearings could have been a precipitating factor," he said. "It could have been the last straw for him."
Park Dietz, a consulting psychiatrist and criminologist in Newport Beach, Calif., who has studied mass killers, saw a different connection to the media. Dr. Dietz said he believed that "mass murderers acquire their fantasies from media accounts" of other mass murder cases. Hence he asserts that the "way to turn this thing off is by greatly reducing media coverage."
But any broad conclusion about mass murder is dangerous, because such murders occur rarely and the killers usually die in the incident, said James Q. Wilson, a professor of management and public policy at the University of California at Los Angeles. Consequently, "Medical and social science have not caught up with mass murder," he said.
But there is no question among the specialists that mass murders have become bloodier. "A lot can be traced to the increase in firepower, with more and faster automatic and semiautomatic weapons," said Dr. Fox. "It's hard to kill 22 people with a knife."
Homicide rates in America have long been the highest in the world. In 1988, for example, there were 8.4 murders in the United States for every 100,000 residents, according to the Department of Justice. But figures compiled by Interpol show there were only 4.2 per 100,000 in Germany, 1.97 in Great Britain and 1.2 in Japan, which has the strictest gun control laws in the world.
 
Societal Changes Cited
 Jack Levin, a professor of sociology at Northeastern and co-author of "Mass Murder," said the growth of mass killings reflected a breakdown in American society and the economy. "A lot more middle-aged males feel life has passed them by," Mr. Levin said. "They have lost their jobs or been divorced. The support systems that used to be there are disintegrating, like the family and the church."
This is especially true, Mr. Levin said, for some of the millions of people who have picked up in mid-life and moved. "They get there and if they lose their job there, they really have no one to turn to," he said.
All the images of violence on television have also contributed to the prevelance of mass murders, he said, "by desensitizing us to violence."
Mr. Levin also said he believed that mass murderers have been encouraged by "the growing culture of hate in the United States."
He said the lyrics of some songs, the increasingly violent nature of pornography and the rising incidence of racially motivated crimes show that "hatred has become hip." Mass murderers are spurred by this, he said, because they themselves are filled with hatred and their killings are a way to avenge themselves on people or groups they feel have hurt them.
The killing of five schoolchildren and the wounding of 30 others, many of them Southeast Asian refugees, in Stockton, California in 1989 was an example of this kind of hate crime, he said.
"For mass murderers, the more people they kill, the sweeter the revenge," Mr. Levin said.

HEADLINE: Arabs And Israelis Invited to Begin Peace Talks Oct. 30 With Bush and
Gorbachev

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Oct. 18

 BODY:
The United States and the Soviet Union issued invitations today to Israel, its Arab neighbors and the Palestinians for a Middle East peace conference to convene on Oct. 30 in Madrid.
 Although the parties to the negotiations have yet to formally accept, Washington and Moscow were so confident that the conference would take place that they announced that President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev would be present to begin the first phase of the peace effort, in which the sponsors and the principal parties will sit down together. 
This mostly ceremonial phase is intended to lead in several days to direct talks between Israel and Syria, Israel and Lebanon, and Israel and a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation.
 
Goal: A Lasting Accord
 Egypt, its other neighbor, signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979.
 Mr. Bush said in a statement from the White House that the goal of the conference will be "nothing less than a just, lasting and comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict."
 Today's announcement of the time and place for the conference was made by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Foreign Minister Boris D. Pankin of the Soviet Union at a joint news conference here. [Excerpts, page 5.]
 Mr. Pankin came to Israel not only to issue the invitations, but also to re-establish full diplomatic relations with this country, bringing to an end a quarter-century of estrangement that was often marked by bitter hostility. An ambassador is to be named later.
 
A Mark of Success
 The announcements were the climax of a week of intense diplomacy by Mr. Baker in the region. Ever since the end of the Persian Gulf war in February, the United States has been promoting this conference -- the first such broad-based approach since a Mideast conference in Geneva in December 1973.
 This conference, in addition to pursuing the broad objective of achieving peace between Israel and its neighbors, will try to work out the final disposition of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, home to 1.7 million Palestinians.
 American officials, while saying that they expected the conference to begin as scheduled and that all those invited have given positive signals in that direction, stressed that there are issues still outstanding that could derail the talks -- including which Palestinians will take part and how the second phase of direct, one-on-one negotiations will be conducted.
 The parties have until 6 P.M. Eastern time on Wednesday to officially respond to the invitations, which were conveyed today by the American and Soviet envoys to the Governments of Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, and by the American and Soviet Consuls in Jerusalem to Faisal al-Husseini, a Palestinian leader in the occupied territories. The European Community will also be represented, and the United Nations and the Gulf Coordination Council will be asked to send observers.
"We have witnessed new beginnings in other parts of the world," said Mr. Baker, who made eight trips to the Mideast since the end of the gulf war to arrange the conference. "The negotiating process we are seeking to launch with this invitation holds the hope of a new era in the Middle East. This invitation offers the peoples in the region a pathway to ending an era of confrontation and it offers a basis for a new future."
 He continued: "The road to peace will not be simple. To the contrary, it will be extremely difficult with many problems, many hitches and probably many interruptions along the way. Old suspicions will not disappear quickly. The gaps are real and the gaps will not be easily overcome." Last-Minute Accommodations
 The decision to issue the invitations today came after Mr. Baker met with Palestinians in East Jerusalem and was told that they are prepared to send representatives to the conference who will satisfy Israel's insistence that they not be formal members of the Palestine Liberation Organization or residents of Israeli-absorbed East Jerusalem. When Mr. Baker communicated that to Prime Minster Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli leader indicated that he would recommend to his Cabinet that it approve Israel's participation when it meets on Sunday.
 "Israel will participate in the peace conference when and if it takes place," Mr. Shamir said tonight. "Without negotiations it can never attain peace. This is the first time that we have an opportunity to negotiate as we have wanted to -- direct negotiations, without a mediator, face-to-face, without preconditions -- with our Arab neighbors. I don't know what the results will be. In any case, I think I will recommend to the Government to choose this way because I don't see a better alternative."
 None of the principals is completely pleased with all aspects of the conference, but Washington decided to issue the invitations now in hopes that no one will dare stay away, even if the terms are not 100 percent satisfactory.
 
A Chance Not to Be Missed
 "We just thought if we don't make it happen in October, it very likely won't happen, this being the Middle East," a senior American official said.
 According to the invitations, the conference will be opened by Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev. The opening session is expected to last three days and will involve speeches by the two Presidents, Mr. Baker and Mr. Pankin, the six Mideast participants and the representative of the European Community. Observers from the Saudi-led Gulf Cooperation Council and the United Nations will also be present, but will not address the session.
 The ceremonial opening session, in which the participants will be represented by foreign ministers, is not supposed to involve any substantive negotiations. It is intended solely to pave the way for two parallel tracks of negotiations.
 One track will be the direct talks for the purpose of effecting "real peace" between adversaries, the invitation says. Israel wanted the invitation to say "peace treaties," not just "real peace," but the Syrians rejected that wording and notion. These direct negotiations, the invitation says, should follow "immediately" after the last day of the opening session.
 
Meeting Places as Symbols
 There is a serious dispute between Israel and Syria over where the direct talks will be held. Syria prefers them to be held in the same city as the opening session, because then it can argue that they are still taking place under the umbrella of the superpowers and the United Nations observer.
 The Israelis insist that these talks be held in a separate city, to underscore their one-on-one nature. The Israelis suggested that talks with Syria, for instance, could be held one day in Tiberias, in northern Israel, and one day on the Syrian side of the border.
 
Madrid Offered for Talks
 The Americans and Soviets are inclined to have the first one-on-one talks in Madrid for purely logistical purposes and so as not to lose momentum.
 Another potentially serious and unresolved problem relates to the Palestinian representatives. Early this morning, the Central Council of the Palestine Liberation Organization, meeting in Tunis, announced that it had approved Palestinian participation in the talks. Hours later, Mr. Baker met with a group of nine Palestinians from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with whom he has been negotiating, for the purpose of receiving from them the names of the Palestinians who will represent them in the joint delegation with Jordan.
 While the Palestinians chafed at the conditions imposed by the Israelis, they ultimately accepted them and presented Mr. Baker with the names of seven Palestinians who fit the criteria. Mr. Baker left the meeting and told reporters that he had the names of Palestinian representatives and that his experts said they fit the guidelines. He went into talks with Mr. Shamir on that basis.
 But American officials said that this afternoon the Palestinians informed Mr. Baker that the names he was given were only examples of the sort of Palestinians who might be involved, and not necessarily those who will be involved.
The problem, the officials said, is not that the P.L.O. in Tunis is trying to force unacceptable names onto the list, but that the representatives of the West Bank and Gaza cannot decide among themselves who should be on the delegation.
 Mr. Baker said that he had not shown Mr. Shamir any names, but the Israelis say they know who is being suggested and can live with those names that they have seen so far.
 What the Israelis are more worried about is how high a profile the P.L.O. will assume in directing the Palestinian delegation that comes to Madrid. After receiving his formal invitation, Mr. Husseini said: "We are happy that there is going to be a peace conference. Madrid is a historic city and it is close to us. It is also convenient because it has an office of the P.L.O. there."
 According to the invitation, the talks between the Israeli and Palestinian-Jordanian delegations will initially be about interim self-rule for the Palestinians in the occupied territories. Over Israel's objections, the United States and Soviet Union have committed themselves in the invitation to trying to see that those negotiations are wrapped up in one year. In the third year of self-rule, a condition that is to last five years in total, talks are to begin about the final status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
 A third outstanding issue has to do with negotiations between all the principal parties to the conference and the six Arab gulf states -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. Those talks are supposed to be about regional problems like water rights, arms control and economic development, and were intended to underscore to the Israelis that if they do cede land for peace, they can really have reconciliation with the larger Arab and Muslim worlds.
 But Syria is refusing to attend that broad-based conference and is calling on all other Arabs not to attend until Israel first agrees to give up the Golan Heights, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The Israelis have complained bitterly to Mr. Baker about that but have not used it as an excuse to stay away.
 "The Syrian position is completely negative and does not promise success," Mr. Shamir said. "But still we decided to go to these negotiations. If the negotiations with the Syrians do not succeed, everyone will know whose fault it was."
 The United States accompanied its invitations to Syria, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon and the Palestinians with letters of assurance about the terms and conditions of the conference and basic American policies.
 A key line in the letters to the Arabs is that the United States and the Soviet Union promise to be the "driving forces" behind the negotiations, which means that while they will not be in the room when the one-on-one talks take place, but will be on the sidelines ready to offer ideas and initiatives of their own as "honest brokers." Arab officials expect the two-way negotiations to quickly stall and want the Americans to come in with compromise proposals.
 In that regard, Mr. Baker signaled at his news conference today that the United States stands by its earlier proposal that Israel suspend its settlement-building in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in exchange for the Arabs' suspending their economic boycott of Israel.
 For the first time, he said that "some consideration might be given" to adding into that package deal the Palestinians' formally suspending their nearly four-year-long uprising in the occupied territories. That might make it more attractive for Israel, which rejected the earlier American proposal.

CHAIN REACTION
The Impact of Race, Rights, and Taxes
on American Politics.
By Thomas Byrne Edsall with Mary D. Edsall.
339 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton. $22.95.  
 Less than three decades ago, President Lyndon B. Johnson defeated his Republican opponent, Senator Barry Goldwater, so convincingly that some pundits mourned the loss of two-party politics in the United States. Since that time, of course, an astonishing reversal has occurred. Republicans have won five out of the six Presidential elections. In two of them, the Democratic candidate received almost no electoral votes. In the most recent one, in 1988, he squandered an apparently insurmountable lead of 17 percentage points in the public opinion polls. As 1992 approaches, the list of Democratic Presidential contenders is pitifully thin, and the party itself is in trouble. Another Republican victory seems assured.
Who is responsible for this turnabout? In "Chain Reaction," a remarkably candid and insightful account of the Democrats' steady decline, Thomas B. Edsall, a political reporter for The Washington Post, with his wife, Mary D. Edsall, focuses on two major groups. The first includes members of the party's reform wing, the well-educated, often intolerant George McGovern activists, who gained control of the Presidential nominating process in the early 1970's -- and powerfully influence it today. Far more liberal than the traditional Democratic voter on virtually every issue, these people, according to the Edsalls, have alienated core Democratic constituencies (including the culturally conservative white working class); squelched a desperately needed debate on the issues of black poverty, joblessness, family structure and welfare dependency (by labeling opposing views as racist); and repeatedly forced their national candidates into the suicidal position of defending minority rights against majority values. Scorning political compromise, dead certain of their mission, they seem impervious to the lessons of defeat.
The Edsalls' second group includes the present Democratic members of Congress. They are found to be devoid of creative proposals and unwilling to act boldly, clinging to power by milking a corrupt system of campaign finance that further diminishes the prospect of independent thought. As a result, their control of the legislative branch adds little to a party in clear need of fresh faces, new directions and original ideas.
Historically speaking, the "new" Democratic Party was conceived at the national convention of 1972. Before that, say the Edsalls, "Democratic presidential delegates were only slightly more liberal than the public at large . . . while Republican delegates were considerably more conservative than the electorate. Delegates to the 1972 Democratic convention, however, were significantly farther to the political left of the electorate . . . than the GOP delegates that year were to the right."
The Edsalls maintain that these Democratic delegates were deeply committed to a "rights revolution" that went far beyond anything the party had advocated before. Besides proposing a major redistribution of political power and cultural authority in the United States, they embraced the causes of numerous "outcast groups," such as homosexuals, drug addicts and the urban poor. Indeed, "at a time when crime was rising at an unprecedented rate," the Edsalls write, "the Democratic platform devoted more attention to the restoration of constitutional rights to released convicts than to efforts to combat street violence."
The Democrats took a terrible beating that year. Their Presidential candidate, Senator McGovern, lost by nearly 18 million votes. But the memory of his debacle was quickly erased by Jimmy Carter's improbable victory in 1976. The Edsalls argue persuasively that Democratic leaders misread the significance of that win. Instead of viewing it in pragmatic terms, as a natural reaction to the Watergate scandals, they saw it in ideological terms, as a ringing endorsement of their new social agenda.
This interpretation was disastrous, for it allowed the party leaders to ignore the burdens of their divisive agenda upon the core of their constituency -- working-class and middle-class whites. They seemed oblivious to the fact that prescriptions for racial equality such as affirmative action involved zero-sum solutions in which one group gained at the expense of another. And they did not foresee that their emphasis on the rights of the excluded would leave them vulnerable to charges of being "soft" on everything from crime to drugs to "deviant" sexual behavior.
Then -- in 1978 -- the economy began to collapse. Unemployment, inflation, runaway interest rates, industrial stagnation -- all came together at once to pose big problems for the Democratic Party, which relied on sustained growth as a way of providing special benefits to the poor. A backlash was inevitable. For the first time in decades, the Edsalls say, traditional Democrats questioned the party's ability to protect their jobs, their homes, their futures. And they fumed at the favoritism shown to "special interests" at a time when nearly everyone's standard of living was falling. "Fairness" became a paramount issue. By 1980, the Edsalls write, many white voters mistrusted the Democratic Party's capacity "to administer improvements in medical care, education, and other domestic programs . . . without distributing benefits most heavily to blacks and to the very poor."
Ronald Reagan and the Republicans played brilliantly upon these themes. Their aim, the Edsalls contend, was to "break the underlying class basis" of the Democratic coalition by persuading white voters that the party of Franklin D. Roosevelt no longer represented their basic interests. Time and again Mr. Reagan laid out competing visions of the United States: one of hard work and equal opportunity (Republican); the other of welfare dependency and special breaks for undeserving minorities (Democratic). After years of defensiveness on the race issue, a Republican Presidential candidate captured the moral high ground by portraying himself as a cultural populist, preaching an egalitarian sermon against the purveyors of "reverse discrimination" and other such evils.
Or so it appeared. In reality, the Edsalls explain, Republican strategists had put a new spin on an old technique: the politics of resentment. Already light-years ahead of the cash-starved Democrats in terms of campaign technology -- polling, fund raising and advertising -- they carefully reinforced the growing conviction among white working-class voters that their real enemies were no longer big business and the very rich, but rather big government and the very poor. Republican candidates hammered at the Federal courts and the Federal bureaucracy for threatening jobs (affirmative action), neighborhoods (open housing) and the local control of schools (busing).
At the same time, they attacked Federal spending selectively by differentiating between popular, race-neutral programs such as Social Security and vulnerable, race-freighted programs like Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Their objective, quite simply, was to shift the voter's attention from what the Government once gave to what it now took away.
The strategy worked well. With Mr. Reagan as the link, the Edsalls say, "Working-class whites and corporate CEO's . . . found common ideological ground in their shared hostility to expanding government intervention; these former antagonists joined forces across traditional class lines to form the core of a center-right majority that survived past election day to become a driving force in support of conservative policy retrenchment."
It was, however, a coalition of remarkably unequal members. When Mr. Reagan declared in 1983 that he wanted the United States to remain "above all . . . a country where someone can always get rich," that someone was invariably a Donald Trump or a T. Boone Pickens, not an assembly line worker from Akron or Detroit. As it turned out, the President's "just folks" persona masked a huge bias in favor of those at the very top. Indeed, the Edsalls point out that the policies of the Reagan Administration regarding taxes, wages, unions, banking and antitrust produced one of the most dramatic redistributions of wealth in our nation's history.
"In terms of income alone," they write, "those at the high end of the distribution experienced huge gains during the decade of the 1980s, as the top one percent saw average family income grow by 75 percent, from $313,206 in 1980 to $548,970 in 1990 (both figures in 1990 dollars); while all those families falling in the bottom 90 percent saw average income grow by just 7 percent, from $27,451 to $29,334." Not surprisingly, the lower one went on the income scale, the worse things became. Families in the bottom 10 percent saw their average income decline during the 1980's, from $4,791 to $4,295.
In theory, at least, this coddling of the mega-rich should have created serious problems for the Republican Party. But such was not the case. The Democrats could not capitalize on the issue because the average voter had lost faith in their ability to manage the economy. Throughout most of the 1980's, opinion polls showed a growing public confidence in the Republican Party's handling of economic issues -- a dramatic shift from earlier days. For the majority of Americans, the modest gains made under Ronald Reagan seemed a lot better than the painful losses suffered under Jimmy Carter. At least most families, the Edsalls say, were inching ahead.
In addition, the Democrats appeared more vulnerable than ever on the key issues of race, taxes and values. Their Presidential candidate in 1984, Walter Mondale of Minnesota, was a political moderate. In order to win the nomination, however, he embraced much of his party's social agenda. As a result, he struck many voters as both an opportunist and a pawn of liberal special-interest groups. At best, Mr. Mondale seemed oddly unaware of how much his support for obviously unpopular issues like affirmative action and a Federal tax hike would cost him at the polls. And part of the reason for this, the Edsalls suggest, is that he and his advisers relied "almost entirely on the distorted information gained from campaigning among liberal primary and party activist constituencies." By catering to these groups, the Edsalls believe, Mr. Mondale assured himself of an easy victory at the Democratic National Convention and a humiliating defeat in the November election.
Still, in the 1988 Presidential campaign there was reason for the Democrats to hope. George Bush, the Republican candidate, had none of Mr. Reagan's charisma. He was way behind in the early public opinion polls, and bogged down by nagging questions about Republican corruption and the Iran-contra scandal. The Bush game plan, as mapped out by his campaign strategist, Lee Atwater, was to take the offensive, portraying the Democratic candidate, Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, as an elite Eastern liberal, lacking in good sense and contemptuous of American values. As Atwater put it: "I'm going to scrape the bark off that little bastard."
He did just that. The Edsalls describe the process perfectly: "Facing off against Dukakis, who was a committed reform Democrat, a liberal lawyer, a card-carrying member of the American Civil Liberties Union, a Harvard Law School graduate, an early civil rights activist, a governor who had vetoed a bill mandating the Pledge of Allegiance, and a Greek ethnic with a Jewish wife, the Bush campaign used the American flag, Willie Horton, the ACLU, the death penalty, the Pledge of Allegiance, and a dramatic emphasis on no new taxes ('read my lips') to drive a wedge right into the heart of the Democrats' 17-point advantage."
The most emotional of these issues, by far, involved Willie Horton, a black prisoner from Massachusetts who was featured in numerous Republican television commercials and speeches throughout the Presidential campaign. Convicted of first-degree murder in the early 1970's, Mr. Horton shortly thereafter had received the first of 10 weekend furloughs under a state program supported by the sitting Republican Governor. But even at the start, the program -- and its safeguards -- raised concerns. In 1976 the state legislature passed a bill that would have ended the furloughs of first-degree murderers. Governor Dukakis, as the Edsalls point out, vetoed it. A strong advocate of prisoners' rights, he contended that the bill would "cut the heart out of efforts at inmate rehabilitation."
A decade later, during Mr. Dukakis's second term in office, Mr. Horton took his 10th weekend furlough and did not return. He was captured eight months later in Maryland, after raping a woman and beating her fiance. He was tried there, found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. The presiding judge refused to return him to Massachusetts. "I'm not prepared to take the chance that Mr. Horton might again be furloughed or otherwise released," he said. "This man should never draw a breath of free air again."
In Boston, meanwhile, the Dukakis administration grimly circled the wagons. The Governor himself, the Edsalls say, did not contact -- much less apologize to -- Mr. Horton's victims. His aides defended the furlough program while refusing newspaper requests to examine the records of Mr. Horton and other furloughed prisoners. "Don't forget that Mr. Horton had nine previous successful furloughs," an obtuse state official told the press.
Atwater could hardly believe his good luck. The Willie Horton incident had everything he needed: a black rapist, a white victim and a bleeding-heart Democrat to blame. The timing, too, was perfect, for it played against a background of skyrocketing crime rates in the cities. The Edsalls correctly view the Willie Horton advertisements as racist trash, exploiting the worst emotions of an angry and frightened electorate. But the Willie Horton case was another matter. At the very least, it raised serious concerns about "the consequences of an aggressively expansive liberalism, a liberalism running up against public opinion, against 'traditional' values, and, to a certain degree, against common sense."
"Chain Reaction" should be read by anyone with an interest in American politics, but it should be required reading for Democratic leaders who dream of someday winning another national election. The Edsalls have brilliantly illuminated the party's mistakes and its problems.
It is unfair, perhaps, to ask them for more. Nevertheless, one does wonder what they have to offer in the way of concrete solutions. The Democrats must begin an honest (and long overdue) debate on the causes of poverty, crime and dislocation among the black underclass. But we never learn where the Edsalls stand on these matters, or what they personally would add to that debate.
The same thing can be said about their concerns for the alienated white voter. It is certainly true that the activist liberal agenda has badly split the Democratic Party. It is also true that Democratic leaders have not done enough to address the anger felt by many whites over the alleged favoritism shown to disadvantaged minorities. But once again, the question arises: what, exactly, would the Edsalls have the Democrats do? If programs like affirmative action cause more trouble than they are worth, then what, if anything, should be substituted in their place?
Until some answers are found, the Democrats will have trouble rebuilding their old majority coalition. In the United States today, race -- not class -- dominates the domestic political agenda. And the price for the once-proud Democratic Party, as the Edsalls so superbly demonstrate, has been division, desertion and defeat.
 
 
 
SOLUTIONS ARE NOT IN SIGHT
 The Democratic Party is in trouble. Thomas Byrne Edsall, a national political writer for The Washington Post, once thought the problem lay in the steep downward slide of the United States economy in the late 1970's, and the blame that many voters placed on the Carter Administration. That was his first book, "The New Politics of Inequality."
Now, in his second book, "Chain Reaction: The Impact of Race, Rights, and Taxes on American Politics," Mr. Edsall and his wife, Mary D. Edsall, a short-story writer, have described a vastly more complex web of causes.
"All the current Democratic candidates are struggling to come up with solutions," Mr. Edsall said in a recent telephone interview. But he shied away abruptly when asked which candidate seemed closest to the answers.
Mr. Edsall is not optimistic that any candidate will succeed before Nov. 3, 1992, Election Day. On the key issue of race, for instance, he said that the Democrats have avoided a genuine debate. Civil rights policies have been set by the courts, "without a political consensus," he explained, "and it is going to be painful and difficult to meet the civil rights agenda in political terms because there is not anything like a consensus.
"Congress is now debating in very arcane terms the civil rights bill of 1991, arguing whether it will be a 'quota bill.' But Congress should open a full debate on the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and how the courts and the regulatory agencies have met the terms of that act. How equitable are the civil rights laws? The serious question is the question of fairness."
What makes the Democrats' problem even more difficult, Mr. Edsall added, is an accelerating demographic change of major proportions. "For the first time," he said, "the majority of voters will live in the [traditionally Republican] suburbs, which have become isolated politically from the urban areas." -- BARTH HEALEY

HEADLINE: Near Paris, Disney's Next Park

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING; ALAN RIDING is chief of the Paris bureau of The New York Times.

 BODY:
THE magic wand has not yet been waved, and cranes, earth-movers, 10,000 workers and a host of unfinished buildings and attractions testify to how much has still to be done. Yet, rising out of the French countryside like a strange lost city, Euro Disneyland has already taken on the shape of things to come.
And everything is on schedule to implant that most American of dreamworlds into the European psyche when the fun officially begins at 9:01 A.M. next April 12. For the moment, though, promotion is the order of the day. So last weekend, the Walt Disney Company overcame its penchant for secrecy and invited the press for a sneak preview. Mickey Mouse and his accomplices were of course on hand, Sleeping Beauty's Castle was unveiled and 3,000 employees, many in costume and all trained to smile, bombarded visitors with "Howdy," "Bonjour" and "Buenos dias." 
 A good many employees and guests took along their children.As the brass band t led Disney characters through a storm of balloons and confetti along Main Street, U.S.A., little faces lighted up, prefiguring the excitement that awaits the millions of girls and boys who will visit Euro Disney in the coming years.
The real purpose of the occasion, though, was to show how much has been built. Just four years after the Walt Disney Company won France's approval for construction of Euro Disney on a 5,000-acre plot at Marne-la-Vallee, 20 miles east of Paris, it can boast that 90 percent of the $4.4 billion initial project is finished. To give an idea of the scale, Euro Disney ranks second to the Channel tunnel as Europe's largest construction project ever.
By next April, the resort and theme park, both improved and adapted versions of those existing in California, Florida and Tokyo, will be ready to receive what company executives project will be 11 million visitors in the first 12 months of operation. By then, Euro Disney will be just a 40-minute ride away from Paris on the R.E.R. suburban rail system. In 1994, France's high-speed T.G.V. trains will also carry visitors directly to the park from all over Western Europe.
Although other sites were studied, the logic of choosing the Paris area for Euro Disney proved overwhelming, not least because, with 26 million tourists a year, the French capital is already Europe's most visited city. Paris's strategic location -- within easy reach of Germany and, once the Channel tunnel opens in 1993, Britain -- made the area still more appealing. Even concern about the weather in northern Europe was eased by evidence that Tokyo's similar climate had not discouraged visitors to its Disneyland.
The more interesting question was whether the French, ever proud of their ancient culture and often disdainful of the American way of having fun, might turn up their noses at Euro Disney. So, to appease intellectual watchdogs, the company promised to emphasize the European roots of many of the fairy tales made popular by Hollywood. But now it seems less worried. After all, to the dismay of local gourmets, the French have embraced American-style fast food. And if things go to plan, the French will account for half the visitors.
The main attraction is, of course, the Magic Kingdom theme park. And since it is a world that no one wants to change, Euro Disneyland is modeled after Disney parks elsewhere, divided into five "lands," packed with 29 attractions and peopled by the likes of Mickey and Minnie, Donald Duck and Daisy, Pluto and Goofy and a host of familiar fantasies. The main departure is the substitution of a Discoveryland, inspired by Jules Verne and Leonardo da Vinci, for the futuristic Tomorrowland. Admission prices are expected to be comparable to other Disney theme parks.
As elsewhere, it is the accompanying resort that makes the entire venture economically feasible. In this case, six hotels with a total of 5,200 rooms are already well advanced, each designed to mirror a different aspect of America. They also range in price to suit every pocket, with small seasonal variations. Indeed, for large families, it might well prove economical to visit Paris from Euro Disney.
The cheapest hotels -- $95 to $130 for rooms with one double and two single beds -- are the Cheyenne, which represents a Far West frontier town, and the Santa Fe, evoking the sun-parched world of New Mexico. The Sequoia Lodge with its echoes of American national forests and the Newport Bay Club with its late 19th-century grandeur are considered middle-priced -- between $130 and $190, also with capacity for four people. All four have about 1,000 rooms each. Finally, the modernistic Hotel New York, with 539 rooms and 36 suites, and the rococo Disneyland Hotel, with 479 rooms and 21 suites, are in the luxury class, charging between $190 and $340 for rooms that can accommodate four people.
Next to an artificial lake that serves as the center of the resort stands Festival Disney, an area of shops, restaurants and discotheques that also includes a theater with room for 1,000 where Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, starring American trick riders, will be put on twice daily. Some distance away, an 18-hole golf course is near completion, with plans to add another 9 holes in 1993. And for those looking to save money, Camp Davy Crockett will offer room for campers as well as mobile homes for rent, with shops and sporting facilities conveniently nearby.
If the Euro Disney Resort offers images and tastes of America, the theme park goes a step further by representing the magical world of Disney that has so shaped the imagination of generations of former children.
Main Street, U.S.A., representing a turn-of-the-century American town, is the first "land." It houses the railroad station for the steam engine that will carry visitors around the roughly circular park as well as a tribute to the Statue of Liberty. And it is here that a brass band will parade regularly with the Disney family. Going clockwise, Frontierland comes next, recreating the old American West, with a steamboat ride around the old river and the Big Thunder Mountain roller coaster and a visit to Phantom Manor for those who enjoy frights.
Adventureland brings alive the world of Caribbean pirates and Arabian nights, with Captain Hook's galleon moored beside a mystery island and the Swiss Family Robinson's tree house standing on another islet. Here, as elsewhere, figures will come to life and speak through what is known as the audio-animatronics process. Fantasyland already has Sleeping Beauty's Castle as its turreted centerpiece, but it will evoke other fairy tales, such as Snow White, Peter Pan, Pinocchio and Alice in Wonderland.
The new Discoveryland looks to the future and, in a special nod to Europe, it includes tributes not only to Leonardo and Verne but also to H. G. Wells, all ofwhom looked to the future in the past. In Le Visionarium, visitors will voyage through time and, on a 360-degree Circle-Vision screen, view the splendors of Europe. A 3-D film, "Captain EO" -- starring Michael Jackson, directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by George Lucas -- will provide the thrills in the Cinemagique. And there will be chances to float in an airship, to pilot a spaceship, to visit an orbital station and to drive a racing car.
For Euro Disneyland, though, the real future lies just six months away. And by then, synthetic "skins" must be wrapped around fantasy mountains, modern roofs must be placed on "ancient" edifices, high-tech attractions must be installed in many buildings, water must fill the numerous lakes and muddy work areas must be covered by cement or lawns. The whole park will now be closed to all outsiders until April 12 so work can rush ahead and the eventual "cast" of 12,000 employees can be hired and trained.
When its doors do open, Euro Disney must also be ready to feed the hungry masses. In this, of course, it has ample experience, but the word is that, aware of local sensibilities, more effort is going into the quality of food in France than in the American parks. The fare, though, will be much the same. The resort hotels will each have one or more restaurants, with American themes emphasized at the Festival Disney entertainment center where there will be a steak house, a diner, a seafood restaurant and a delicatessen. The theme park itself will have some 30 places to eat, variously offering waiter, buffet and counter service and menus ranging from fast food a la hamburger and enchilada to exotic delights at the Explorer's Club and French cuisine at the Auberge de Cendrillon.
As with other Disney parks, the entry fee to Euro Disneyland will give access to all attractions. The fee itself, though, has not yet been set. So-called "commemorative passports" for a one-day visit are being sold at 200 francs ($35) for adults and 150 francs ($26) for children under the age of 10. The company also began taking hotel reservations last March.
But Disney executives hinted they may charge somewhat more for regular admission. They also plan to vary the park's operating hours with the seasons, although they are confident that enough attractions are indoors for cold or wet weather not to discourage visitors.
Indeed, they are so confident of success that they are looking far beyond April 12. For the record, they say they will continue to add to Euro Disney through the year 2017. Already in 1995, Disney plans to open a second theme park, Disney-MGM Studios/Europe, which like the original park in Orlando will evoke the world of cinema and be linked to new movie and television production facilities. After that, an Epcot center is being contemplated and perhaps more hotels. And why not? When it comes to making money out of magic, the Walt Disney Company seems to have a way of turning dreams into reality.

Scuba Diving in Belize
Q. I am interested in obtaining information about Belize, with special emphasis on scuba diving. -- Nina Garfinkel, New York, N.Y. 
 A. To some extent, your choice of a way to scuba dive in Belize depends on your own enthusiasm and how much discomfort you are willing to tolerate, or how many amenities you desire. In Belize, an independent Commonwealth nation once known as British Honduras, both packages that offer live-aboard-a-ship arrangements and others based at resorts are offered. One source for either kind of package is See and Sea Travel Service, 50 Francisco Street, San Francisco, Calif. 94133; (415) 434-3400 or (800) 348-9778. For those who wish to stay aboard a ship, the 110-foot Belize Aggressor, which holds 18 people, departs from Belize City every Saturday, and returns the following Saturday. The price, not including air fare, is $1,395 a person. If you prefer to stay at a scuba resort, See and Sea represents three, from 20 to 60 miles offshore, at rates from $1,950 to $1,999 a person. These rates also apply from Saturday to Saturday and do not include air fare. Similar packages are offered by Tropical Adventures, 111 Second North, Seattle, Wash. 98109; telephone (206) 441-3483 or (800) 247-3483.
Another source of information and reservations, but only for single travelers from 25 to 55, is Gallivanting, the Club for Adventure, at 515 East 79th Street, Suite 20F, New York, N.Y. 10021; telephone (212) 988-0617 or (800) 933-9699. Representatives of the Belize Aggressor may also be contacted directly at Post Office Box 9182, Treasure Island, Fla. 33740; telephone (800) 654-3483 or (813) 367-1952. More information, and the names of additional operators, is available from the Belize Tourist Board, 415 Seventh Avenue, 18th floor, New York, N.Y. 10001; telephone (212) 268-8798 or (800) 624-0686.
 
Indians and Amish
 Q. Are there any areas of New York State where Native American and Quaker or Amish working communities (not just museums) can be visited? -- Elizabeth Cuesta, Marlboro, N.Y.
A. A spokeswoman for the Division of Tourism of the New York State Department of Economic Development had no information on working Indian communities that could be visited, but did point out that Salamanca, N.Y., in the western part of the state about 10 miles northwest of Olean, was partly inhabited by Senecas. The town rests on Indian land, the 22,000-acre Allegany Indian Reservation, and is leased from tribe.
A little-known community of about 5,000 Amish is also in western New York State, around Cherry Creek, about an hour and a half's drive south from Buffalo and only 18 miles from Lake Erie. A map for self-guided tours is available at a local restaurant, the Grainery, and either motorcoach tours with a guide or tours with a guide in your own car can be arranged. The three-hour tour with the guide in your car is $45, and lunch or dinner must be taken in the Grainery, which is in a 100-year-old barn. Bus tour rates, for groups, are set by the individual companies; information and reservations from the restaurant: (716) 287-3500.
The Amish in the area are mostly farmers, but there are also shops selling such items as leather belts, wallets, wooden toys and other handmade craft objects. Quilts, pillows and similar household goods are generally sold directly from individual homes.
 
Seeing Flowers in 1992
 Q. Where and when will the next International Flower Expo take place? -- Janice Kelly, Westport, Conn.
A. Two International Horticultural Expositions, as they are formally known, have been sanctioned by the Bureau of International Expositions for next year, according to Michael Italiaander of Expo Garden Tours of New York. One, Floriade, will be held in Zoetermeer, the Netherlands, from April 10 to Oct. 11. The other, Ameriflora, the first such international exposition to be held in the United States, is scheduled for April 20 to Oct. 12 in Columbus, Ohio. At both, numerous countries mount flower exhibits reflecting their native and cultural heritages.
In the Ohio city that bears his name, Columbus will be honored in an exposition with 88 acres of gardens, exhibits, restaurants and performance spaces. Organizers say they are spending $93 million to remake Franklin Park, two miles east of downtown Columbus, for the event. Formal gardens will be created to equal those on several royal European estates. A 3,500-seat amphitheater will be used for jazz, country music and symphonic performances.
More information on the Zoetermeer exposition is available from the Netherlands Tourist Board, 355 Lexington Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017; telephone (212) 370-7360. For information on the Columbus event, contact the Greater Columbus Convention and Visitors Bureau, 10 West Broad Street, Columbus, Ohio 43215, or telephone (800) 282-5393. Expo Garden Tours, 145 Fourth Avenue, Suite 4A, New York, N.Y. 10003, (212) 677-6704, offers travel packages to both expositions. The 14-day one to the Netherlands is $2,650 a person, including hotels, most meals and entrance fees, but not air fare. The similar, seven-day, package for the Columbus exposition is $1,495.
 
Renting a House in Brittany
 Q. We are planning a family trip to France for June and July and would like to rent a house in St.-Servan or St.-Malo on Brittany's northern seacoast. How can we find rental information for this area? -- Ellen J. Kennedy, Edina, Minn.
A. There are several sources for house rentals in Brittany, as well as elsewhere in France, according to the French Government Tourist Office. Among them, RAVE (Rent a Vacation Everywhere) offers rentals in Brittany from about $650 a week to $2,195, depending on the size of the house and the season. (The $2,195 house sleeps 12.) For more information, contact RAVE, 328 Main Street East, Suite 526, Rochester, N.Y. 14604; telephone (716) 454-6440. On the West Coast, Chez Vous has rural cottages as low as $420 a week. Chez Vous is at 220 Redwood Highway, Suite 129, Mill Valley, Calif. 94941; telephone (415) 331-2535. July and August are high season, so the rates then are at the more expensive end of the scale. But since this part of the coast is at the end of the Gulf Stream, the area is relatively mild and green year round. And Mont St.-Michel, the medieval fortress and religious shrine, is only about 20 miles away. The agencies mentioned, and others, also rent houses, from modest cottage to great chateaus, throughout France, as well as apartments in Paris and bed-and-breakfast accommodations in private houses around the country. Information is also available from the French Government Tourist Office, 610 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10020; (212) 757-1125.

HEADLINE: Homeownership -- a Receding Dream

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
YOUNG couples struggling to pay the rent and still save enough for a down payment on a house fell further behind their homeowning parents last year, according to a new study of home costs and ownership rates.
The problem among the young lingered despite the hopes of economists, home builders and uncounted rent-paying nonowners that the recession, lower interest rates and falling prices would make homeownership easier for them. 
 As a result, the population is growing more and more skewed toward homeowners who are white, middle-aged and middle-class, and a renter population that is more and more minority and lower middle class or poor.
This analysis comes from the latest home tenure statistics of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, which was released Wednesday. It saw two distinct trends in America:
"Rapid growth in the number of high-income households has fueled a strong homeowner tradeup and renovation and repair market, while slow income growth at the low end of the distribution has expanded the number of households unable to afford even minimally adequate housing."
The problem, unsurprisingly, can be summed up as one of cost versus income. In the 20 years from 1970 to 1990, the median price of a starter home for a typical married couple between 25 and 29 years old rose by 21 percent in constant dollars, while the income of this typical couple declined by 7 percent, from $28,500 to $26,700, also in constant dollars.
At the same time, the incomes of couples 10 or more years older than this age group stayed even or rose, and this group took advantage of their improving finances to increase their share of homeownership.
So the proportion of all households headed by people aged 25 to 34 years of age who own their own home has dropped, from 51.4 percent in 1973 to 44.3 percent in 1990, while the proportion of people 45 to 64 years old who began climbing the homeownership ladder in the 60's and 70's rose from 75.9 to 78.1 percent, according to the Harvard study.
There is some evidence that couples who were in their early 20's five or so years ago are falling behind those who are that age today, since houses were more expensive, and interest rates higher, in the mid-80's. But the authors of the report cautioned that several more sample years will be needed before it can be shown that people who entered the housing market in the middle of the last decade will remain behind those who came into the market after them.
THE recent period of moderating home prices and a decline in interest rates to their lowest levels in a decade has helped some new households to step on the ladder of homeownership, a ladder that will let them trade up to better and larger homes as they age and their incomes rise.
Real estate brokers and sales people in the New York City region report a buying spurt this summer that was dominated by young, first-time buyers who had decided that prices and mortgage interest rates were unlikely to fall much more.
But according to both the authors of the Harvard study and real estate brokers, lower home prices and interest rates alone are little help to renters who cannot accumulate the 20 percent down payment most mortgages require.
"The challenge today is to help young people come up with the down payment they need," said Dorcas Helfant, president-elect of the National Association of Realtors, the real estate brokers who have a personal interest in seeing more people being able to afford to buy a house. "That's the only way they will be able to take advantage of lower home prices and lower interest rates."
But today's renters will have a harder time saving to buy a house, according to the Harvard study, because declining apartment construction for moderate-income families will mean higher rents, and so less saving.
The trend has implications for generations beyond the present, said Denise DiPasquale, a professor of economics at Harvard University and one of the report's principal authors.
"Homeownership is an important source of wealth accumulation over one's lifetime," she said. "So part of the issue here is that, to the extent that home equity is part of the legacy that can be passed on from generation to generation, increasingly the inability of young renter housheholds to cross the threshold of homeownership will affect not only their own lives, but the lives of their children."
The fact that housing costs have outpaced the ability of many people to pay for them is underscored by the Census Bureau's 1990 Census of Housing, which found the highest homeownership rates in states with the lowest prices, and lower ownership rates where housing is most costly.
So West Virginia ranks first in home ownership in the country, at 74.1 percent of all households, but 47th in median house price, $47,900. Hawaii, conversely, ranks next to last in homeownership rate, at 53.9 percent, and first in median home price, at $245,300.
In last place for homewnership is New York state, at 52.2 percent. But that figure is misleading, pulled down by the 32 percent rate in New York City, where rent regulations and high housing costs make it cheaper for many households to rent than to own. In New Jersey, 64.9 percent of all households own their home; in Connecicut, 65.6 percent.
The national homeownership rate stands at 64.1 percent after having peaked in 1985 at 65.6 percent. But the fairly stable national rate masks the generation gap that is at work.
The rate of homeownership in households headed by someone under 25 years of age has declined steadily since 1973, from 23.4 percent to 15.3 percent in 1990, said the Harvard study, whose figures are based on the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey series.
Each five-year age group between 25 and 45 also shows declines in home ownership, from 44 percent to 36 percent for those 25 to 29, from 73 percent to 70 percent for those aged 40 to 44.
Not until the study reaches those 45 to 54 does it find a group that stayed even, at 76 percent homeownership, and only those above 55 years of age today have been able to increase their group's ownership rate, from 75.7 percent in 1973 to 80.4 percent, the highest rate of any age group.
Why?
"After World War II, we made homeowning much more available to people at a younger age than before, with the V.A. and the F.H.A. and other programs," said William Apgar, associate director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies and another author of the Harvard report. "They were able to start earlier and own their homes longer, and that's where the equity buildup comes from. Now that process is reversing."
EVEN when selected to account for the group most likely to own -- married couples with children -- the figures show younger couples falling behind in homeownership. In 1973, 39 percent of couples under 25 with children owned their own homes; in 1990, the proportion had fallen to 23.6 percent.
The only families with children who improved their homeownership rates were those over 35 today, people who most likely bought their first homes before the price inflation of the late 1970's.
The decline in homeownership has been particularly severe for black families, who started the decade of the 1980's behind the white majority and ended it even worse off. In 1980, 43.8 percent of black households and 68.8 percent of white households owned their homes. By 1990, both rates had slipped, to 42.4 for blacks and 67.5 for whites, but the decline among younger families was sharper.
Thus, white families headed by people under 35 years of age saw their ownership rate drop by 12 percent, from 48 to 42.2 percent, while for blacks, the rate fell 21 percent, from 23.1 to 18.2.
With all this dispiriting news about young familes failing to own their homes, some have wondered if there is not an element of voluntary nonownership at work -- if young couples, in the spirit of the times, are not spending more money on video cameras, cars, vacations and clothes, and indirectly choosing not to save for a home of their own.
Some analysts point to the amount of student debt being carried over from college and graduate school by young couples, noting that banks qualify borrowers for mortgages not only by their income but also by how much they owe.
Carl Case, a professor of economics at Wellesley College and an analyst with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, noted also that homeownership is no longer seen by many as the sure-fire investment it once was. Prices have been on a roller coaster -- up in the early 80's, down at the end of the decade, now perhaps starting up again, he pointed out.
Some economists, meanwhile, forecast that fewer household formations in coming years will mean less price appreciation for those who buy.
"The investment advantages of homeownership have certainly been reduced by the degree of uncertainty raised by these factors, and that has created a lot of background noise that buyers have to take into account," said Mr. Case.
A New York Times poll conducted in June confirmed popular lore that an overwhelming majority of Americans regard homeownership as a sound move. In the poll, 84 percent of 1,600 respondents agreed with the statement, "Buying a home is the best long-term investment in the United States."
Mr. Apgar, at Harvard, agrees that voluntary nonownership is an interesting question, but not at today's ownership rates.
"Some people say that those who want to become owners have already bought their homes," he commented in an interview. "That's O.K. if you have ownership rates of 80 or 90 percent, or if you say that single people don't really want to own a home. But that doesn't cover the married people with children who we know really do want to own and who can't afford it. So you can say people really don't want it, but you also have to look at what people can simply afford."
BEARING in mind that the housing market and incomes vary widely by area, the Harvard study broke the country into four broad regions. It found that in the Northeast, the hardest place for renters to buy, to buy a median-priced starter home for $94,230 means having to have accumulated a 20 percent down payment and meet closing costs of $20,452. To do so requires a minimum annual income of $33,260 .
In the South, by contrast, a starter home sells for $60,111 and closing costs come to $13,046. That, plus a 20 percent down payment, means such a home is within reach of someone with an income of $20,101.
Lowering the down payment requirement -- the solution offered by many housing advocates and by most subsidized mortgage programs run by states -- can also work against affordability. Since lowering the down payment increases the amount that must be borrowed, it also raises the amount of income needed to qualify for the loan, according to the report's analysis.
So, for example, with a 5 percent down payment, the income needed to buy a starter home in the Northeast rises to $39,686, from the $33,260 needed with a 20 percent down payment. In addition, low-down-payment loans usually require the buyer to purchase mortgage insurance, an added cost.
Nor are renters likely to find it any easier to save the down payments needed to qualify for an affordable loan, said Dr. DiPasquale. This is because rents, particularly those paid by moderate-income families, have not moderated with the price of housing in recent years. And they are likely to start rising in the future, since the creation of new rental apartment projects has dropped sharply since the 1986 tax reform act eliminated most of the tax shelters available to those who invested in them.
"A LOT of people point to high vacancy rates as proof that rates won't rise, but much of that vacancy rate is concentrated at the high end of the market," Dr. DiPasquale said. "We are definitely seeing a loss of the rental stock that traditionally serves low- and moderate-income households, those who pay a contract rent of $250 a month or less. That tightening in the market indicates that their rental burdens are high and are going to continue to be high."
Rents that take a high portion of income keep savings low, Dr. DiPasquale noted, "so one of the big points we are making is that, increasingly, the rental market is becoming the market for low- and moderate-income households."
When Ms. Helfant of the National Association of Realtors see studies that show her group's brokers selling to a smaller and smaller share of American households, she begins to think about politics.
"Those of us who are in the real estate business have to make sure we stay active politically, and make sure our legislators understand these homebuying issues," she said in an interview.
She is working to build support right now, for example, for a measure introducted by Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, that would let the parents or grandparents of first-time home buyers lend portions of their Independent Retirement Accounts as a down payment. Currently, the law does not allow such a use of the tax-deferred accounts without a tax penalty for early withdrawal.
"You can invest your I.R.A. in real estate, in a shopping center or an office building, by buying into a mutual fund," she said of the current law, "but God forbid you help your children buy a home of their own."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Communications Landmarks;
New Technology, Old Architecture

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
IF owners and brokers could be entirely believed, you would think every office building in the United States had some "state-of-the-art" feature or other. But the relentless attention to modern amenities ignores the question of what happens to high-technology buildings when the state of the art has advanced by several decades.
Three such structures in lower Manhattan -- richly colored, dramatically detailed, sharply faceted mesas that have dominated their surroundings for six decades -- were given landmark status this month as early exemplars of American Art Deco by Ralph Walker, of Voorhees, Gmelin & Walker. 
 Even more significantly from an economic standpoint, all three remain communication centers, even as they are being adapted to suit modern technology.
The three whose exteriors and first-floor public interiors were designated by the Landmarks Preservation Commission are:
*The Barclay-Vesey Building, also known as the New York Telephone Company Building, 140 West Street, between Barclay and Vesey Streets. This was completed in 1927 and is still owned by New York Telephone.
*The Long Distance Building of the American Telephone & Telegraph Company, 32 Avenue of the Americas, between Lispenard and Walker Streets. Called the "Tower of Speech," the building in its present form was finished in 1932. It is still owned by A.T.&T.
*The Western Union Building, 60 Hudson Street, between Worth and Thomas Streets. It was finished in 1930.
"One million telegrams will be transmitted to and from it daily," an early promotional brochure declared. "The heart of the nation will throb here." Certainly, the heart of the Western Union Telegraph Company throbbed there. Telegraph and cable lines converged in its basement, as did pneumatic tubes that ran as far as 42d Street. Although there were only 24 stories, the structure had 950,000 square feet -- almost as much as the Chrysler Building. On the ground floor was a large auditorium, with a balcony. On the mezzanine was a gymnasium.
Western Union Telegraph sold the building in 1948 and took a 25-year lease, with a 25-year option. In 1973, headquarters moved to Upper Saddle River, N.J., but the company owned the leasehold until 1980, when it was sold to Robert Carmel, Joseph Comras and Stanley Stahl, who purchased the fee in 1985.
Now a multiple-tenant property known as 60 Hudson Street, the building is managed by the Williams Real Estate Company, which stresses its continuing advantages as a communications hub. "We have all the major telecommunications carriers," said Audrey Novoa, managing director of Williams.
These include MCI Telecommunications Corporation, which has a switching center for the New York metropolitan area, and US Sprint Communications Company, which also has a switching center through which calls in the New York area are routed.
THE building was put up to exploit an underground duct system laid out through New York City, said Kenneth E. Pliska, of Highland Associates, which serves as a kind of resident engineering and architectural firm to 60 Hudson Street.
"With cable penetration via duct and conduit into a large cable vault in the basement, and vertical runs that allow for interconnection -- that was the key for people to come into the building," he said. "A lot of these ducts are now used for fiber optics."
"The fact that the big guys came in really drew smaller people," Mr. Pliska said. "The attraction is interconnection." Underscoring that point, the ceilings seem to be filled with horizontal forests of conduits.
"For some high-level tie-ins, it's nice to be located next to your competitors," explained Jim Farris, director of contract and real property administration at Sprint headquarters in Kansas City. "There are economies of scale that are created by proximity. It's the difference between running cable two floors versus running cable two miles. It also helps from the standpoint of interconnecting with the local telephone company."
Among other tenants are American Airlines; Associated Press; Cable & Wireless Communications; Locate, formerly known as Local Area Telecommunications; Metropolitan Fiber Systems; Micronet; Nycom Information Service; RCI Long Distance; Teleport Communications Group and Williams Telecommunications Group.
Such concentration raises a question of vulnerability, which the management said it has addressed. "The owners have provided a great deal of security: a 24-hour staff, closed-circuit TV, card-access locks," Mr. Pliska said. "At times of great concern, such as when the war was going on, extra security staff was brought on to protect the building."
Besides telecommunications companies, 60 Hudson Street is also a major government hub, thanks to its location near the civic center. Agencies with offices there include the New York State Insurance Department and the New York City Human Resources Administration, Buildings Department, Correction Department and Employment Department. Together, they have about 530,000 square feet.
A spokesman for the buildings agency, Vahe Tiryakian, said that the building's architecture actually lifted employees' morale -- particularly the vaulted, through-block lobby, with golden, patterned brick walls that seem to glow from within.
"I always feel so special walking into that lobby," he said. "I marvel at it. There's a meaningfulness that never wears out. I'm not saying we stand around and gawk at it, but we don't take it for granted."
(Some of the other great spaces in the building have not fared as well as the lobby, which is meticulously maintained. The auditorium is now a Federal Express distribution center but its proscenium arch and balcony are intact, complete with starkly geometric Deco motifs. The gymnasium is empty but still has its wooden floor.)
As to the recent landmark designation, which is still subject to review by the City Council, Mr. Pliska said, "What the ownership has been trying to do is establish a master plan with Landmarks, similar to the one at the Empire State Building."
A master plan might include guidelines for the replacement of windows by ventilating louvers and for the installation of microwave and air-conditioning equipment on setbacks.
Five blocks north, the A.T.&T. building on the Avenue of the Americas is no longer the largest long distance center in the world. But the company uses it for administrative, technical, sales, legal and regulatory offices.
"WE did support the building becoming a landmark," said Laura Abbott, a spokeswoman for A.T.&T. "We believe this is an important building with a rich history. And we are pleased that the city has named it a landmark."
The Barclay-Vesey Building, notable for its ground-floor arcade and its lobby, was designed as headquarters of the New York Telephone Company and served as such until 1972, when the executive offices were moved to 1095 Avenue of the Americas, at 42d Street.
Over the years, the building had been filled with more and more equipment, to keep pace with the development of lower Manhattan.
More recently, however, "a change in technology has dramatically changed the way we use floor space," said Charles Clos, general manager for real estate at New York Telephone. "The new digital switching systems have caused our need for space to diminish precipitously, because the new devices are one-fifth the size of the old devices."
At 140 West Street, he said, the company was "going to take advantage of that transition and put people back in that building." In the next two or three years, much of New York Telephone's engineering department will be moved there. The company, which has itself described the tower as a landmark, did not oppose the designation.
"It's a wonderful opportunity," Mr. Clos said. "I get the space for free. It's a good location for our people. And it fills the building back up. We're going to keep the character of the building -- its facades and entrance foyer -- as it is today, in class and quality, so it continues to be a landmark building."

HEADLINE: Candidates Seek to Turn Voter Anger To Advantage

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
THIS is the year of the "fed up" candidate in New Jersey's legislative races.
With the recession maintaining its hold on the economy and many voters still upset over Gov. Jim Florio's quick enactment of a $2.8 billion tax program after his election two years ago, many candidates -- including some incumbents -- are trying to appeal to voters by adopting an angry, anti-government posture. 
 There was a time when only challengers ran on slogans like "Clean up the mess in Trenton" and "Stop the waste of taxpayers money." But this year those sentiments are finding their way into the campaign literature of some incumbents who voted for recent state budgets and were in Trenton when the "mess" presumably was created.
The recent redistricting that created many new legislative districts offers another opportunity for incumbents to campaign as newcomers since their names are not familiar to thousands of voters in their new districts. In addition, a few Democrats who voted for the Governor's tax package and also for the subsequent repeal of the sales tax on heavy trucks and paper products are campaigning as tax cutters because of their repeal votes and are ignoring their support of the much larger tax package.
Since no Republicans voted for the Governor's taxes, many Democrats, including the Senate President, John A. Lynch of New Brunswick, have also dropped their party's label from campaign material. And, much to the Governor's dismay, several Democrats are frankly running, or at least inching, away from him. Senator James T. Phillips, Democrat of Old Bridge, campaigns with a life-sized cutout of the Governor, which he dramatically shoves away from himself while challenging his Republican opponent to "push aside Governor Florio as an issue" in the campaign.
But Republicans aren't about to push the Governor aside since they believe Mr. Florio's unpopular tax program is the key to their hopes of taking control of the 40-member State Senate and 80-member General Assembly in the Nov. 5 elections.
Assemblyman Robert D. Franks of New Providence, the New Jersey Republican Party chairman, said Democrats were trying to raise "obfuscation" to the level of high art in order to avoid a voter backlash in November.
A recent poll by The Star Ledger in Newark and the Eagleton Institute at Rutgers may have helped to encourage that strategy. The poll said 75 percent of the electorate did not know how their local representatives voted on the tax package. Eight hundred people took part in the telephone poll, which had a sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
To counter this, Mr. Franks said, the Republican campaign strategy is simple, but it must be carried off effectively if the party is to reach its goals. "We have to help the public learn a simple rule of thumb," he said. "Only Democrats voted for the Florio taxes, and every Republican voted against them."
 
Vote Against All Incumbents
 Stephen A. Salmore, a professor of political science at Rutgers University and a frequent Republican consultant in statewide elections, said some grass-roots, anti-tax groups formed after the Governor's tax program had been approved are telling their supporters to vote against all incumbents.
"But that won't be easy since many people don't know who their senators and assemblymen are and, if they did, they may have new representatives because of the redistricting," he said. "They don't put asterisks on the ballot next to names of incumbents the way newspapers do when listing the names of candidates."
But they do list the candidates by party, and it will be easy to tell Democrats from Republicans when the time comes to pull the lever in the voting booth, he said.
Richard Roper, executive director of the Council on New Jersey Affairs at Princeton University, said: "This is the era of the fed-up constituency, there's no doubt about that. People feel that their government and government officials aren't serving their interests well. And a candidate who wants to use voter anger to his advantage will have to buy into that view and articulate it well."
 
Disenchantment Across All Levels
 Incumbents who want to run on the record of the last two years have a tough task, he said. "The public is not willing to be convinced that the responses to recent financial problems were the right responses," he said. Mr. Roper added that public disenchantment with the parties in power in the current difficult economic climate cut across all levels of government -- local, state and Federal. "And if people could," he said, "they would like to bring down the leadership at each level, Democrat or Republican."
"What they want is more efficient and effective government, to see government operate in a way that is not wasteful," he said. "They don't want higher taxes and they want to know how the money that is available is being spent."
Cliff Zukin, another professor of political science at Rutgers and former director of the Star Ledger-Eagleton poll, said candidates who campaign as being angry and anti-government would receive only marginal benefit unless their names appeared on the ballot with a slogan identifying them as "fed up."
"People these days don't trust any politician," he said. "Including those who run as fed up."
But aside from the debate over how best to channel voter anger in the closing weeks of the campaign, Republicans appear to have history on their side. Mr. Zukin said a look at State Assembly races in off-years, two years after a gubernatorial election, showed that the party in power lost about half of the Assembly seats it had picked up when the party's candidate for governor was winning.
 
Byrne Gave His Party a Majority
 When former Gov. Brendan T. Byrne, a Democrat, won his first term in 1973 in a landslide, he carried in 26 new Assembly members, giving the party a 66-to-14 majority over the Republicans. Two years later, the Democrats lost 17 Assembly seats. In Mr. Byrne's second run in 1977, when his approval rating had dipped in opinion surveys to 35 percent because of enactment of the income tax, he still won re-election by 14 points and Democrats picked up five Assembly seats. But in the off-year election in 1979 the Democrats lost 10 seats to Republicans, although they still retained control of the Assembly by 44 to 36.
Former Gov. Thomas H. Kean -- who in 1981 defeated Mr. Florio by the slimmest margin in state history, 1,776 votes -- managed to pick up only one Assembly seat, which the Democrats took back two years later. But in 1985, riding the crest of an economic boom and high voter-approval ratings, Mr. Kean won re-election by a wide margin and the Republicans picked up 15 new Assembly seats, enough to give the Republican Party control of the house for the first time since 1971 by a margin of 50 to 30. Two years later, with Mr. Kean's popularity intact, the party still lost eight Assembly seats, but held onto control by a 42-to-38 margin. They lost another seat the next year through the resignation of a Republican lawmaker and the victory of a Democrat in a special election.
In his 1989 victory, Mr. Florio pulled in five new Democratic Assemblymen, enough to give control back to his party. Republicans got one seat back last year through the resignation of a Democratic Assemblyman, who moved up to the Senate, and the victory by a Republican in the special Assembly race. Democrats now hold a 43-to-39 majority in the Assembly and a 23-to-17 edge in the Senate.
 
Independents With Angry Slogans
 Mr. Zukin said past history would indicate that Republicans should pick up a couple of Assembly seats in this off-year election, when about 500,000 fewer voters usually go to the polls than in gubernatorial years.
And if angry-sounding slogans might be a plus, then independent candidates, who do not have party labels to identify them and who can run under any banner, might attract more votes this year. Voters in some districts will see a number of challenging slogans when they enter the booth, including, "No Party Deals"; "Truth in Government"; "Non Lawyer"; "I Represent You"; "Accountable Independent"; "Sound Fiscal Policies"; "Coalition of One"; "The People's Voice"; "Citizen Not Politician"; "Reduce Insurance Rates"; "Middle Class Alternative"; "Unbossed, Unbiased, Unbought"; "Taxpayers' Only Choice," and a perennial, "Politicians Are Crooks."
But Neil J. O'Connell of Jackson Township, a Democrat running for the Senate in the newly created 30th District, probably tried to cover the field in his appeal for support. His campaign slogan: "We Are ALL Fed Up!"

HEADLINE: Forum to Air Sexual Bias in Courts

BYLINE: By Tessa Melvin

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
TERMING the issue of sexual harassment "just the tip of the iceberg," Justice Samuel G. Fredman of State Supreme Court has announced that the Westchester court system will consider that subject and related matters at a public forum this week.
After nearly a year of planning, the Committee to Promote General Fairness in the Courts has scheduled the forum for Tuesday at 7:30 P.M. in the Ceremonial Courtroom of the Courthouse, at 111 Grove Street in White Plains. 
 Calling the timing "exquisite," Justice Fredman said the discussion should appeal not only to the legal community but also to Westchester residents, many of whom spent last week debating issues raised during the Washinton hearings on the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the United States Supreme Court.
 Justice Fredman said that the county's court system provided numerous examples of sexual harassment. "I know from being there," he said. "Women aren't satisfied by the court, and they feel an undercurrent of unfairness by male judges."
 
New Ways to Handle Complaints
 "We hear of lawyers mistreating women opponents and using foul language," said Justice Fredman, who serves on the bench in the Ninth Judicial District in White Plains. "But I am not sure today if every judge in our court system is conscious of harassment. Most men don't know what they are doing, and most don't know what women are complaining about."
The forum will consider a new method for hearing and resolving complaints of sexual discrimination in the county court system, and the committee will announce plans for a hearing day in December.
The 29-member committee, made up of 13 judges plus an array of lawyers, academicians and laymen from the five-county judicial district, has been meeting regularly since August last year. It is working with the cooperation of the Ninth Judicial District's grievance committee and the bar associations of the five counties.
The program will include an original skit, "Court Time," by four students at Brown University. The performers have subtitled the play "An Awareness Act Performance About Gender Fairness in the Courts." The revue is a "sometimes tongue-in-cheek, always satiricial work," which has been performed on numerous college campuses, according to the committee.
 
Taking the Show on the Road
 "It's too good for college campuses," said Justice Fredman, the public relations chairman of the group, whoadded that the committee planned to tape the performance "so we can take this show on the road." The committee is planning forums on sexual harassment in the other four counties of the Ninth Judicial District in the next two months.
"This is something whose time has come," Justice Fredman said. "Women feel they don't get the best lawyers" in matrimonial cases, he said, giving an example, "certainly not in comparison with their husbands, who usually have far stronger economic backing."
Female lawyers also have reason to be concerned, Judge Fredman said. "I don't feel they think they get a fair deal from male judges, of which there are a plethora. There are certainly cases of judges who call them girlie or little girl."
The impetus for forming the committee, he said, came from "an active women's bar association," led by Justice Sondra M. Miller, the only woman on the Ninth Judicial bench. "Sondra is the mother superior of this group," Judge Fredman said.
The event is free and will include a question-and-answer session.

HEADLINE: Why E.D.S. Loves a Recession

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
When the Electronic Data Systems Corporation acquired the Enron Corporation's extensive computing staff and equipment in 1989, it essentially guaranteed that it could handle these operations better. It also promised Enron a savings of $200 million over the 10-year life of the contract. The daring pledge underscored E.D.S.'s cocksureness about its ability to squeeze computing costs.
But its confidence was well placed. The Houston-based natural gas company thinks it is on its way to saving at least that much, equal to 20 percent of its computing expenses, by 1999. "We're out of the how-to-do-it part of the computing business," said Jack I. Tompkins, the Enron senior vice president who bargained with E.D.S. on the deal. "We consider E.D.S. the technology experts." 
 By capitalizing on corporate America's drive to downsize, save money and improve efficiencies, E.D.S. has been climbing like a rocket. Despite the departure of its legendary founder, H. Ross Perot, after a squabble with its corporate parent, General Motors, the company's sales have increased sevenfold since 1984, when it was taken over. To be sure, much of this revenue is provided by G.M. itself, but E.D.S.'s sales are expected by the company and some analysts to more than triple, to $25 billion, by the end of the decade.
This growth is expected despite the fact that the number of companies in the business is increasing. The key is an explosion in demand. One recent survey showed that 40 percent of all corporations are seriously considering hiring computer services companies to manage all or part of their data processing operations. Overall, worldwide spending on computer services, which range from a narrow task like managing automated teller accounts for banks to taking full control of a company's entire computing operations and staff, are expected to hit $1.3 trillion in 1995, according to researchers.
 
'Plenty of Business>
 "There's plenty of business for any company that can do a fine job at this point," said Mr. Perot, who as head of the three-year-old Perot Systems Corporation is one of the new competitors.
E.D.S and the other biggest computer service companies have gained leverage in demanding price breaks when buying computers for their customers. In fact, with pressure on their profit margins, the big computer makers have started to look at the computer services business with envy. In May, the International Business Machines Corporation, for one, entered the business, and it is expected to give E.D.S. a stiff challenge.
"Customers have had so much hardware jammed down their throats for so long that they are now going outside for help," said Stephen T. McClellan, a data processing analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York. "The service companies are squarely positioned between the computer hardware companies and the end users. That is starting to change the landscape of the industry."
Bolstered by the urgency of some customers to raise money to ride out the recession, the computer services business did more managing of existing systems and offering advice and purchasing equipment under "outsourcing" contracts with corporations. Now, E.D.S. and a few of its well-heeled competitors have the cash to buy outright the computing operations of large companies as well as hire the employees of those operations.
To help sustain healthy growth, E.D.S. has also been prospecting for business abroad. Last summer, Lester M. Alberthal Jr., the scholarly looking chairman and chief executive at E.D.S. since late 1986, flexed E.D.S.'s financial muscle in Europe, where it has been a laggard. In the company's first hostile takeover battle, he put up more than $250 million and came away with control of a British-based computer services firm, SD-Scicon P.L.C.
Turning over a corporate computing department to a service company, however well known, is not easy. Traditionalists argue that, for one thing, no team of outside experts can know the details of their businesses as intimately as their own staffs.
Sometimes they are correct. E.D.S. manages computer systems for several savings institutions in Texas controlled by the Resolution Trust Corporation. A few months ago, having misinterpreted data from those sources, it sent inaccurate reports to credit agencies that 1,800 homeowners were delinquent in their mortgage payments. E.D.S. eventually caught the error.
 
'The Angel of Death'
 And for reasons that sometimes have as much to do with office politics as economics, many executives in charge of management information system departments resist yielding control of their empires to outsiders. "An M.I.S. director would rather see the angel of death at the door than someone from E.D.S.," said Darwin Deason, head of Affiliated Computer Systems, a three-year-old systems integrator in Dallas.
Still, aversion to outsourcing is gradually breaking down. "We are moving away from the end of the scale that says 'build everything yourself,' " conceded Bill T. Houghton, president of the information systems subsidiary at the Chevron Corporation in San Ramon, Calif. "If we aren't cost-effective in some area, we try to improve it. If we can't, then using outside suppliers is an alternative."
Some senior computing executives in big corporations acknowledge that they have allowed the service companies to get a foot inside their camp as wholesalers of personal computers and packaged software and suppliers of nationwide and global telecommunication networks. Those deals can often lead to bigger contracts.
In a recession, signing up a computer services company to manage all aspects of information systems "moves the risk and capital investments onto someone else's shoulders," said Robert S. Sullivan, dean of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
Like Enron, Continental Bank and Eastman Kodak have turned all of their computing problems and all of their computing employees over to service companies in the last few years and signed long-term contracts with those companies to operate their information systems.
Financially weakened companies like Cummins Engine, Greyhound Lines and the Southland Corporation have also gone to service companies to cut their computing costs.
In the biggest deal yet, the General Daynamics Corporation, which has been forced to scale back its arms business since the collapse of Communism, agreed to pay the Computer Sciences Corporation of El Segundo, Calif., about $3 billion over the next 10 years to manage all of its computing operations. In turn Computer Sciences agreed to pay $200 million for all of General Dynamics's computer equipment and will hire all of its computing employees. E.D.S. may soon sign an even-bigger deal with the McDonnell Douglas Corporation.
In this atmosphere, E.D.S. has flourished. Its 1990 revenues rose to $6.1 billion from less than $800 million when G.M. bought it for $2.55 billion in cash and stock in 1984. The company earned $496.9 million last year, a 14 percent increase over 1989, and profits were up another 12 percent in the first half of 1991, to $139.8 million.
G.M., which accounted for more than 80 percent of E.D.S. revenues in the first years after the marriage, should account for less than half this year. Analysts expect that orders booked by G.M. for manufacturing software, car-order systems for dealers, health-care administration and other services will be fairly flat as the auto maker struggles with weak car sales in the next few years.
But orders from a growing list of 7,200 other customers in 28 countries should rise at annual rates of nearly 20 percent, analysts said. The company posted an 11 percent sales increase for the first half of the year and will approach $7 billion in revenues for the year. The Yankee Group, a research firm in Boston, projects that revenues for E.D.S. will reach $13.3 billion in 1995, with more than $10 billion coming from customers other than G.M.
Today, E.D.S. accounts for 4.9 percent of the sales of General Motors, up from 3.5 percent just six years ago. Along with E.D.S.'s healthy rise in earnings, that provides at least a small measure of help for a company whose core business has stagnated.
Mr. Alberthal, who is 47, wants his executives reaching toward a yearly sales target of $25 billion, which some analysts think is possible by the end of the decade.
E.D.S., which was founded in 1962, already has lower costs and the best profit margins in the industry compared with a handful of other systems integrators like I.B.M., Andersen Consulting and Computer Sciences.
This advantage stems in part from its position as one of the nation's largest buyers of computers, software and telecommunications services for the insurers, credit unions and health plans that are its non-G.M. customers. And because it is one of the world's largest private operators of data processing centers, capable of handling six billion computer instructions a second, E.D.S. uses dozens of mainframes at 110 sites in the United States, Europe and Asia.
E.D.S. by itself has put pressure on profit margins at I.B.M. It is Big Blue's biggest customer for mainframes, buying more than 50 a year, and it can command bargain prices in small computers as well. If E.D.S. thinks I.B.M.'s price for an order of thousands of personal computers is too steep, it will simply turn to Dell, Compaq, Apple, Digital Equipment and dozens of other suppliers.
To counter inroads made by E.D.S. and other systems companies, I.B.M. in May formed the Integrated Systems Solutions Corporation, even though some rivals contend that the step violated a 1956 consent decree by the computer giant to stay out of the services business. The Justice Department is investigating, but it could be years before action is taken.
I.B.M. is ignoring the fuss. "It is our focus and catalyst for I.B.M. to become a more services-oriented rather than a product-oriented company," said Dennie Welsh, president of the subsidiary.
I.B.M. executives are telling Wall Street that computer services will eventually become a significant profit producer in a company that currently derives 70 percent of its sales from the slowing hardware business.
E.D.S. has other challenges. Its payroll has ballooned to more than 60,000 employees, and a bureaucracy that customers said had slowed the company's response time and made it rigid in its problem solving. In response, Mr. Alberthal last year organized the company into 38 different business units, each dealing with a different industry. The idea was to speed decisions and push them closer to customers.
Earlier, Mr. Alberthal had softened the rigid edges of the military-style culture created by Mr. Perot by, among other things, easing dress codes that banned facial hair and striped shirts.
Flush with more than $700 million in cash, little debt and a yearly revenue stream of more than $3 billion from G.M., Mr. Alberthal is chasing growth in different ways to extend E.D.S.'s vital dominance in economies of scale in computing power, telecommunications networks and other technology.
 
Extending the Reach
 An example of its new reach was a $40 million investment last year in ASK Computer Systems Inc., which gave E.D.S. a 20 percent stake in the company and distribution rights to software programs used by manufacturers. It also signed a deal last July with Consilium Inc. to market management software used in military and aerospace plants.
E.D.S. has a stake in Hitachi's National Advanced Systems and can sell mainframes assembled by National as an alternative to I.B.M. models. And it is hawking a recently developed system for transmitting engineering documents between Macintosh computers.
As for how it all works, executives at Enron, whose former staff of 550 computing specialists are now employees of E.D.S., have some insight.
"It's almost three years and were satisfied," said Mr. Tompkins. "I don't think we've lost control of anything."
Therein is a question. "I would not want anyone to think that by outsourcing your information system that it's suddenly a life of ease," Mr. Tompkins said. " You can delegate, but you can't abrogate."
 
 
PEROT IS BACK IN BUSINESS, STILL THINKING BIG
 On June 1, 1988, H. Ross Perot charged back into the computer services industry, the business he had created nearly 30 years ago. His no-compete contract with the General Motors Corporation expired that day, 18 months after the auto giant bought back his G.M. stock for $750 million.
Analysts say his Perot Systems Corporation, based in Herndon, Va., should exceed $150 million in sales this year. The outspoken Mr. Perot has boasted that annual revenues will reach $1 billion by the year 2000. "I'm working with the best and brightest people I've ever known," he said.
Mr. Perot founded Electronic Data Systems in 1962 when his supervisors at I.B.M. in Dallas rebuffed his urgings to add programming and consulting services for companies buying big I.B.M. mainframes.
Perot Systems pales in size next to E.D.S., but Mr. Perot does not seem to mind. He has taken some hits -- Epic Healthcare Group Inc. in Dallas did not renew a $3 million contract last year. But he has also on occasion defeated E.D.S. and other established giants in bidding wars. NCNB and First American Bancshares are two clients in the financial services business. And Kelsey-Hayes, a maker of auto parts, chose Perot over E.D.S. last spring.
Mr. Perot, who is 61 years old, bankrolled the company with $20 million from his personal fortune, which is estimated at $3 billion. He said he spends about one-third of his time on Perot Systems business. He also has land development operations and is popular on the lecture circuit.
More than half of his top 50 employees followed him from E.D.S., but these days he has nothing but praise for the industry leader, and even for G.M., at least when speaking with reporters. "They're doing a great job, and I'm proud of them," he said.
 
 
 
OUTSOURCING TO THE HILT
 Some companies are not content simply to hire an outsider to provide computer services. Instead, they sell all of their computer operations and transfer the employees that operate them.
The rapid growth of E.D.S. and its biggest competitors raises the intriguing question of how much of the nation's computing capicity will one day end up in the hands of a few computer services giants.
The biggest deal so far was put together last month, when the Computer Sciences Corporation of El Segundo, Calif., agreed to pay $200 million for the computing operations of General Dynamics, a hobbled military supplier. General Dynamics will transfer 2,600 employees to Computer Sciences and pay about $300 million annually for 10 years to Computer Sciences for managing the operations.
But E.D.S. is close to an even-bigger deal with McDonnell Douglas. The two have signed a letter of intentunder which E.D.S. would acquire the contractor's systems-integration unit, with revenues of $398 million last year. But E.D.S.'s head, Lester M. Alberthal Jr., does not rule out buying McDonnell's entire computing operations, which would expand the deal enormously.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Lightening Up on Latin America

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
Two big investors in the stock markets of Latin America, which have been shown the best rises among all of the world's exchanges this year, are raising the yellow caution flag. They are taking their profits on some of their holdings and paying more attention to the downside risk.
The two are Antoine W. van Agtmael, president of the Emerging Market Investors Fund in Washington, D.C., and Mark Mobius, president of the Templeton Emerging Markets Fund, based in Hong Kong. 
 "As prices run up, the upside potential is less and the downside risk is greater, and that is a reason to be cautious," Mr. van Agtmael said in an interview after a conference on emerging markets and country funds run by Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company in New York last week.
Mr. Mobius agreed. "It is getting more difficult to find bargains at this time," he said at the conference. "It is a good idea to lighten up in these countries."
Mr. van Agtmael had 43 percent of his fund in Latin American stocks in August, but he is now cutting his exposure to 37 percent. In his major Latin holdings, Mexico is being reduced to 15 percent from 17 percent; Argentina to 6 percent from 9 percent; Chile to 7 percent from 8, and Brazil is holding at 8 percent.
This adjustment is a recognition of two factors. One is that the markets have moved so far that corrections are possible. And, the second concern is that there are fewer bargains available as more and more investors join the herd and move to Latin America.
"The screaming bargains are no longer there," said Mr. Mobius.
Because of this, Mr. van Agtmael is venturing out of some of the most popular stocks in Mexico and is beginning to look for second- and third-tier stocks that he feels not many other foreign investors have heard of yet.
He emphasizes that he is not making a dramatic turnaround. He still contends that Latin American stocks are at the beginning of a decade of growth. In Mexico, Argentina and Chile, he notes, he will still be overweight, which means the percentage of his portfolio in those nations is larger than would be dictated by the size of the stock markets.
And even though Mr. van Agtmael acknowledges that "I really can't figure out Brazil," he is not pulling out of that market. What leaves him uncertain is the question of how committed the Government is to its economic restructuring.
Despite this faith in Latin America in the long run, Mr. van Agtmael still suggests moving some money into what he calls the Fallen Angels: Taiwan, South Korea, Indonesia and Turkey, whose markets have been among the worst performers recently. "They," he said, "are due for a bounce."
 
Strike in Milan
 When Erich Stock, the manager of the Italy Fund and director for equities for Shearson Lehman Global Asset Management in London, opened his presentation at the Smith Barney conference last week, he had to make an apology. "I am going to talk about the only market that does not exist," he said.
The Italian stock market in Milan was closed by a strike of floor brokers. In the fifth largest economy in the West, there was no trading for four days because of a lingering dispute over the jobs that will be lost as Italy moves to consolidate and revamp its splintered brokerage industry so it will have the capital and technical resources to compete in a unified Europe.
The strike ended on Thursday but it showed, once again, that this market has the air of a banana republic. It is still small with very few liquid stocks. It is only beginning to move to deal with insider trading, the rights of minority shareholders and the lack of openness and disclosure in a market where about one-third of the trades still take place off the floor of the stock exchange.
The strike seemed to center on two issues. One involved the move to continuous trading via computer screens and the formation of a new unified structure for brokerage firms, which will eliminate the need for the floor brokers who were on strike.
The second item of contention involved the slow progress of legislation to bring the practices of the Milan stock market more in line with the rest of Europe. One proposal would restrict large stock tender offers at premium prices among majority investors in a company unless similar prices are offered to minority shareholders. Deals that ignore the minority shareholders are common now.
In an interview from his office in Milan, Enrico Tagliabue, the head of the association of floor brokers, said the strike was stopped because the Government had said it would give full backing to a provision of the law that could make available some jobs for the laid-off brokers in the new brokerage firms.
Mr. Stock said the strike for jobs was futile. He said the brokerage industry was overstaffed and already struggling because of the drop of the volume in the market.
But he said the strike might have the beneficial effect of focusing attention on the need for change. A number of laws, including one approved to restrict insider trading and the one languishing on tender offers, are needed to bring the market into the modern era.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Happy Birthday To a Big Bull Market

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
How does an annual return of 53 percent strike you? That is, as it happens, the increase in the Russell 2,000 index of small stocks in the first year of its bull market, which began on Oct. 17, 1990.
By contrast, the Dow Jones industrial average gained only 30 percent from its low of last October through its record close of 3,077.15 on Friday. Not a bad move, but hardly in the same league. 
 The big rally in small caps is just one part of the schizophrenic financial markets of 1991. It is hard to remember a time when the beginning of "A Tale of Two Cities" was more applicable.
For some companies, the financing front is as bleak as it can be. The credit crunch is real for those too small or too highly leveraged to have access to the financial markets. "The diminished availability of private capital is pushing prices down" for venture capital investors, says Richard E. Kroon, who runs Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette's Sprout Group. The banks that once would have provided loans to many such companies are no longer interested in hearing from them.
But for other companies, things could not be better. The friendly stock market means that many companies can raise equity capital on terms that would have been unthinkable a year ago. Interest rates are down sharply for those that can borrow, and that group is not as small as many think.
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company was among the first to sense that banks were eagerly looking for "safe" borrowers. Its pending recapitalizations of RJR Nabisco and Owens-Illinois depend on paying off high-rate bonds with proceeds from equity offerings that contractually were supposed to pay down bank loans.
"The banks are begging to stay in" the group that lends money to RJR Nabisco, said Daniel J. Donaghue of Duff & Phelps Credit Rating, and are quite happy to give up their right to be paid first. The result is likely to be that the company gets capital at a much lower cost, and the banks get to make loans they now consider to be safe. Mr. Donaghue says RJR Nabisco may even be able to get back into the commercial paper market.
The most important difference between now and a year ago reflects a huge change in sentiment. Now the market is usually willing to assume that bad news relates to a specific company, not to an entire industry. Citicorp shares are near their lows of a year ago, but the average New York bank stock has nearly doubled and went up more last week, even after Citicorp's big loss was reported.
It is that optimism that helped keep stock prices high this summer and fall, even when the evidence of economic recovery was slim. And it is that optimism that is helping companies like Owens-Illinois move from the unloved group to the one with easy access to capital.
A year ago, pessimism was high, and so were the profits to be had by betting against it. Today, it is optimism that is rising.

ECONOMY
 
For Better or Worse, Citicorp's Star Is Hitched to the Economy 

Citicorp is the national economy in microcosm. Badly hurt by the recession, especially in real estate, the nation's largest banking company reported a loss last week of $885 million in the third quarter. Its chairman, John S. Reed, said he expected losses on business and commercial real estate loans to rise for a few more quarters as a consequence of the slumping economy. In the first three quarters of the year, Citicorp charged off as a loss $3.97 billion of loans. Its holdings of badly delinquent loans is now $9.64 billion. Much of that comes from its aggressive push into consumer and mortgage lending, especially in the West where the recession lingers. All this makes some analysts question whether the worst really is behind the nation's biggest bank. "We clearly have picked up more, or at least our fair share, of problems," Mr. Reed said. Vigorous growth in the economy would do wonders.
 
America in the Jalopy Age
 
Showroom traffic is way up as Detroit dazzles consumers with loads of new models. But too few browsers are becoming buyers. Sales for early October, when the new-model year began, were down 10.1 percent compared with a year earlier, in the early days of the recession. Analysts attribute sales resistance even among the most car-conscious consumers to nervousness about the economy. The result is that America's fleet of cars is more ancient than ever -- a rust-eaten 7.6 years, according to Charles Brady, an analyst at Mabon Securities Corporation in New York. When, the auto makers wonder, will all those jalopies ever be replaced?

Getting Stubborn on Prices
 
With the economy growing at barely single-digit rates, prices should be tumbling. How else could shopkeepers move those goods? But prices are not. Last week, the Commerce Department reported, the Consumer Price Index jumped 0.4 percent in September after increasing 0.2 percent in August. If you exclude volatile food and energy prices from the index, "you get an annualized inflation rate of 4.6 percent, which appears high," said Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities in Chicago. That makes some wonder if the Federal Reserve will ease interest rates or simply stand pat. "Right now the Fed wants the economy to expand," said Mr. Kahan.

That Curious Warehouse Watch
 
Number-crunching economists often pose questions to themselves, such as: "At today's sales rates, how long will it take to clear the economy of all its inventoried goods?" The answer to that, they reason, indicates when factory orders will pick up as the nation's stores restock. Right now, according to the Commerce Department, it would take 1.49 months to clean the nation's warehouses of their goods. That is the lowest rate in a year and suggests the economy is picking up. "The recovery is likely to witness stable growth rather than a double-dip," said Jerry Jasinowski, of the National Association of Manufacturers. But at the rate at which those inventories are being cleared, stable growth will also be slow growth.

A Widening Trade Gap
 
Americans sure love their imported goods. The nation's trade deficit with the rest of the world surged by 13.6 percent during August to $6.76 billion, according to the Commerce Department. That happens, the theory says, when the economy is poised for recovery. Not this time. The deficit grew in August because exports slipped 3 percent to $34.16 billion as growth abroad stalled. Before the figures were released, the consensus among economists was that August's deficit would narrow to $5.35 billion. They were off by $1.41 billion.

What Are the Factories Up To?
 
The nation's economic puzzle is composed of pieces not necessarily taken from the same box. Consider factory orders and capacity utilization. According to the Federal Reserve, factory orders were up 0.1 percent in September as inventories were slowly being used up. That was expected. But factory capacity utilization actually dropped in September to 79.7 percent from 79.8 percent in August and 80 percent in July. Factories working less were producing more?
 
Bad News in Housing
 
Since March, housing starts have been picking up. But according to the Commerce Department, they dropped 2.2 percent in September. On its own, that is bad enough. But housing starts are also an indicator of the economy's future course. Buy a house and pretty soon you must fill it. Then you must make the payments. The payments part is what people are worrying about.

No Boost for the Jobless
 
President Bush may style himself the kinder, gentler President, but he wields his veto power with alacrity. Since he has been in office, he has killed 23 bills. Congress attempted to overturn 12 and failed each time. Last week, the survivor was Mr. Bush's veto of a bill extending unemployment benefits for people who have already exhausted their coverage. Extending benefits to the estimated 3.4 million unemployed whose benefits have lapsed "would significantly increase the Federal deficit," Mr. Bush said. Maybe so. But those words sounded far from gentle.

 
 
COMPANIES

 
Milken's Plea for Lenience
 
Last week, Arthur Liman, the principal defense attorney for Michael Milken, the jailed junk-bond financier, asked the court to reduce Mr. Milken's 10-year sentence. In a 31-page memorandum to the court, Mr. Liman cited Mr. Milken's 29 meetings with the government and hundreds of hours of debriefings, as evidence of his client's desire to cooperate. Mr. Liman also drew the court's attention to Ivan F. Boesky, the convicted swindler. Mr. Milken's crimes were not as bad as Mr. Boesky's, according to Mr. Liman, yet Mr. Milken's sentence was harsher. Since the court has heard all this before, sympathy is not expected.

The Good and the Bad at Big Blue
 
While the International Business Machines Corporation has been developing its strategy for the future through linkages with dozens of other smaller computer makers, its day-to-day business has been suffering. Last week, Big Blue reported its earnings fell 84.5 percent in the third quarter to $173 million. Its revenue also fell, to $14.43 billion from $15.28 billion. Investors moaned, analysts saw glimmers of hope. Big Blue also said it had trimmed sales, administrative and research expenses. And last week it announced it was selling its $400 million stake in the MCI Communications Corporation. Ultimately, Wall Street could not make up its mind about I.B.M. The stock fell $2.125 then rose $3 to $104.25 and finished the week at $100.25.
 
USAir Losses Ease a Bit
 
USAir, one of the nation's ailing carriers, reported a loss last week of $81.4 million for the third quarter. That was good news. Analysts had expected worse. USAir lost $120.3 million the quarter before. The airline also said it was planning to trim expenses by $400 million.

Chasing That Cellular Profit
 
So far, no cellular telephone company has figured out a way to make money. But they are good at dreaming big. Last week, McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. unveiled its visions of the future. It said it had developed hardware and software to link its cellular systems around the country into a seamless web of talk. The network will be called Cellular One. Sixty million potential subscribers live in the area it covers. But to make it truly national, McCaw will try to convince other companies to join its network. "What follows next is persuading partners, not acquiring them.It's politics, not finance," said Craig McCaw, the company's chairman. It had better be. McCaw still has $5 billion in debt from previous acquisitions.

TRW Allows a Free Peek
 
TRW Inc. mostly makes satellites and car parts. But it also has a division that produces credit reports -- and makes enemies, among state attorneys general, in Congress and at consumer groups. So, TRW said it would make its reports available without charge to the people in its files.
 
CBS Misses the Ballpark
 
Pity poor CBS. It bought the rights to air major league baseball to add a little punch to its ratings. But CBS lost out to the Senate confirmation hearings of Judge Clarence Thomas. Last Sunday, according to David Poltrack, senior vice president for research at CBS, 27 million homes tuned into the Judge Thomas saga, compared with just 9.2 million homes at the ballgame. The ratings show that a program that is part politics, part National Enquirer, may have a future on TV.

 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Unify? Count the Ukraine Out
 
Immediately after the Soviet republics declared their independence from Moscow's central control, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev proposed a new treaty to create a new union. Russia's President, Boris N. Yelt sin and most of the other leaders of the republics were enthusiastic. But last week the Ukraine had a change of heart. It refused to sign the treaty. The new economic union was too encumbering, its Parliament said, especially the proposal to set up a single central bank and currency. What worries the Ukraine most is the idea of falling under the sway of neighboring Russia once again. "The republics agreed to the treaty thinking they could get raw materials from Russia on better conditions than they now do," said Vladimir Kvint, a lecturer at Babson College in Boston. "But Russia wants to impose political conditions on them now. That makes the whole treaty a question mark."
 
Ford Faces Facts at Jaguar

The Ford Motor Company bought Britain's Jaguar in 1986 for $2.7 billion. It might be sorry it did. The luxury automaker is in a slump. Sales have fallen from 45,000 cars last year to well below 30,000 this year. Jaguar has even had to scrap some new models and stop development on others. Last week, union representatives were summoned by Ford to talk about layoffs. Rumors are that 1,400 workers will have to go. So far this year 2,500 Jaguar workers have been dismissed.
 
Honda Latest Concept
 
Most concept cars never get built. They are sketches in metal and plastic to sharpen designers' skills and drum up excitement for the brand. Last week, Honda unveiled a prototype two-seater dubbed the EP-X (efficient, personal, experimental). The car seats the passenger behind the driver -- talk about stiff necks. But it does have an advantage: an estimated 100 miles a gallon. In the tradition, chances are slim the EP-X will ever be built.

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
The Satisfying Silliness Of the Paintball Wars

BYLINE: By Mary Billard

 BODY:
On a recent rainy Sunday, Christopher Siedman was running through the woods in a strange half crouch, climbing over low stone walls and hiding from enemy fire. Decked out in camouflage pants, he and two friends were holding black metal guns. They thought they were closing in on their objective, a heavily guarded compound at the other end of a wooded field. But in fact, they were going around in circles in a swamp, thick brush blocking their passage.
Just then, the quiet was pierced by unmistakable Rambo-like screams of skirmish. 
 "We gotta get out of here," Mr. Siedman yelled, sounding like a warrior. Then, like the banker he really is, he howled: "We are all zero assets if we get stuck here."
Paintball war is hell.
Mr. Siedman, an analyst at a large Wall Street rating agency, was recently at a camp called Survival: New York, in Newburgh, N.Y., with friends from the Federal Reserve Bank and other Wall Street offices. Like many other people who work 9-to-5, they have discovered the thrill of paintball war, a game in which teams fire gelatin shells filled with paint at one another. The sport picked up momentum when the stock market crashed in October 1987, grew more popular during the recession and won even more players after the Persian Gulf War, said Jerry Braun, co-owner of Survival: New York.
The players obviously revel in being able to let off steam. "It's a bunch of nerds -- accountants and bankers -- screaming their heads off," said Mr. Siedman. "It's great."
Golf and tennis are the traditional ways for co-workers to bond, but the adrenaline released in paintball war is so intense that it transcends those placid playing fields.
The appeal could be attributed to the men's movement -- the poet Robert Bly's theory that the modern male has become alienated from his masculine nature and needs to reconnect with that "wild man" within his soul.
Paintball does indeed fulfill the call of the child, if not the wild. It is a game where grown-ups run around playing a very competitive game of tag.
"It was a thrill to wake up at 5 A.M. to run around outside all day long, like when you were a kid at camp," said Russ Paparo, a commodities trader playing in Newburgh recently. Added Joe Haley Jr., a data sales executive at the White Plains office of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company: "I loved diving and rolling around on the group. How often do you get to do that?"
And that's not to mention all the dressing up: For roughly $40 at the Newburgh field, a combatant gets a full-day session, complete with ammunition, a gun, goggles and a frightening face mask.
No one needs a management consultant to tell the player firing a gun at a co-worker that it provides a cathartic release, and it is perhaps for that reason that many companies actually sponsor paintball war sessions for employees. "It was a great release," said Laura Sayegh, director of sales administration at HBO Video, who joined co-workers at a company-sponsored session. "Our senior vice president of sales was a decoy. It was his idea."
David Reitz, manager of equipment development at Pepsico Inc., was not with a company-sponsored group recently, but "the boss got hit quite a few times," he said.
The game is straightforward -- simply an armed version of capture the flag. A team, with anywhere from 10 to 30 players, guards its flag at one side of the field while trying to grab the other side's flag and take it back to its home base.
But things are not so simple that people don't prepare. The night before the battle, one of Mr. Siedman's playmates trained by reading "The Art of War," by Sun Tzu, the bible of corporate raiders in the 1980's; another watched the grisly Vietnam War movie, "Platoon."
The game is becoming so popular that soon amateurs will be able to start cribbing chesslike strategies from professional tournaments. Pro paintball is scheduled to run on the Sportschannel in November and on the ESPN cable network early next year.
But even weekend warriors know that attitude is key. The language seems to come straight from a lifetime of John Wayne movies buried deep within their psyches. "Take the ridge," one player screamed in Newburgh, his voice hoarse. "Good D," said another, meaning good defense. "Shoot to kill," yelled yet another.
Strategies develop during the session. "We found hunkering down better than being too aggressive; if you are aggressive you get knocked out early," said Pepsico's Mr. Reitz.
Daniel Rappaport, a commodities trader and member of the board of the New York Mercantile Exchange, hid with teammates in the bushes, then rushed the opponent's flag to a barrage of fire. When the smoke cleared, six enemy guards were dead. "They all fired at the first guy," said Mr. Rappaport. The strategy had worked.
But not everyone can learn to work together. On a recent A.T.& T. Computer Systems outing, the team from the sales side could never agree on a master plan, Mr. Haley said. "The judge would count down, the whistle would blow, no one would agree what to do and everyone would run in their own direction," he said.
Still, like an old soldier, he came out with a good story. "We were all pumped up and talking about it in the office," said Mr. Reitz.
"We still talk about it," said Ms. Sayegh from HBO Video. "It's very competitive, but no one gets left out. Everybody played. It's great for team spirit."
Despite all the thrills, however, nothing is perfect. "There was no hand-to-hand," said Mr. Rappaport, sounding a bit wistful.

HEADLINE: Short-Term Leases Lure the Once-Burned Auto Buyer

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
When Richard and Terrie Hursey went out to buy a family car last fall, their dealer worked out a financing plan that allowed them to meet their $300-a-month budget. They bought a 1989 used Ford Taurus, financing the $11,992 purchase over five years, for a monthly payment of $293.22. He says he was led to believe that he could trade up after about a year.
But the Livermore, Calif., couple was distressed to learn last month while shopping for something larger that their car is worth thousands of dollars less than what they owe on their loan. "We've got a funny feeling we're stuck with the car," said Mr. Hursey. "I just feel we got the shaft." 
 Faced with legions of drivers like the Hurseys who suffer "finance remorse," auto makers are pitching a solution: short-term, two- to four-year, leasing. They're hoping leases will not only relieve the remorse, but also put an end to some of their own problems, like broad rebates and other profit-bleeding incentives.
A growing number of car shoppers find the logic compelling. Because leases allow buyers to pay for only that portion of the car's value that will be used up during the contract, leases generally require lower monthly payments than loans. For instance, if an auto maker determines that a $15,000 car will be worth $7,000 after three years, payments on a three-year lease would be based on only $8,000. At lease-end, leaseholders may have to pay a fee for any wear and tear -- things like dents -- not taken into consideration in the predetermined trade-in value. But if all goes well, drivers can simply turn in their keys for a new car.
The shorter terms also mean customers can trade more often. "To me, it sounds like the greatest way to go," said Mr. Hursey, who has learned a good deal about leasing since he bought his car.
To be sure, lease programs are risky for car companies, which place a potentially costly bet every time they commit to trade-in values on their vehicles. And their betting record is hardly encouraging: lessors, which include the finance arms of auto makers as well as the banks, lost an average $1,300 on the sale of each car returned in 1990, according to Randall McCathren, executive vice president of Bank Lease Consultants in Nashville, Tenn., which advises the auto and banking industries.
But lessors say they have learned from past mistakes and are now confidently putting much of their marketing muscle behind lease programs. Their new emphasis is causing a fundamental shift in the way auto makers and consumers do business. "The whole strategy of the industry has changed," said Cedric Rashad, an automotive leasing consultant based in Atlanta.
Indeed, advertisements today are keyed increasingly to such items as Audi's "three-year test drive." The car companies' lease programs, with names like Smart Lease at General Motors, Red Carpet at Ford and Gold Key at Chrysler, have grown dramatically in recent years. In the process, they have won market share for leasing business from the banks. The General Motors Acceptance Corporation, for example, has doubled its leasing volume to about 20 percent of all sales in less than two years. CNW Marketing/Research in Bandon, Ore., estimates that about 20 percent of all cars delivered to retail customers in the United States (excluding fleet sales) are leased.
Many predict leases could eventually reach about 50 percent of the business. At that point, some estimate, resistance will set in. After all, in the words of Buick general manager Edward H. Mertz, "Americans grew up owning things." Anticipating that, Chrysler, for one, introduced a program this month called Gold Key Plus that offers all the features of a lease, but gives customers the title to their vehicle during the lease, creating the illusion of ownership.
Auto makers like leasing for a litany of reasons. For one, customer loyalty. More than 80 percent of consumers who sign leases with a manufacturer's finance arm return to the same dealership for another vehicle, compared with about one-third for buyers, according to CNW.
The lower monthly payments of leasing also help distract shoppers from sticker prices, which now average more than $16,000, as well as rebates and low financing rates. Such incentives, conceived as short-term sales boosters, have created long-term problems by cutting profits and creating the air of distress sales. Some form of rebate or incentive is now involved in 90 percent of all vehicle sales, according to Autofacts, a consulting firm in West Chester, Penn.
Manufacturers say that funds they have set aside for incentives can be put to better use in leasing specials to move particular models. A $199-per-month lease special on Grand Ams earlier this year enabled Pontiac to quadruple lease deliveries on that model over three months. This more targeted use of incentive dollars means that "manufacturers feel they get more bang for their buck with leasing," said Bill Jensen, executive director of the National Vehicle Leasing Association in Culver City, Calif.
Leasing earned a bad reputation in the early 1970's because then, the contracts were "open-ended" -- if the car depreciated more quickly than expected, customers had to make up the difference, sometimes paying several thousand dollars.
By the late 1970's, fuming holders of open-ended leases prompted many dealers to stop offering consumer leasing altogether. "It was a pretty rough time," said Art Spinella, director of automotive research for CNW.
Leasing was reinvigorated by tax law changes in 1981 that gave benefits such as investment tax credits to companies writing leases. A rush of players entered the market, competing ruggedly on financing rates and predicting that their cars would retain more value than a competitor's. "Closed-end" leases, in which the car company or bank is liable for the residual values it set, also evolved.
But many lessors miscalculated. When the cost of cars, especially imports, began rising quickly in the early 1980's, lifting the residual values of used cars, banks and finance companies bet that the trend would continue into the mid-1980's. It didn't. Used-car and residual values started falling, mirroring new-car prices, slashed by cash rebates and low financing terms. The average residual values of 18 models tracked by one leasing guide tumbled more than 8 percentage points between 1983 and 1987. A Pontiac Grand Prix, predicted in 1983 to retain 40 percent of its value after four years, was estimated in 1987 to hold only 29 percent after four years.
Still, most lessors did not feel the full ill effects of that reversal until the investment tax credits were eliminated in 1986. That wiped out the cushion against too-rosy projections of residuals, causing big losses on cars under leasing contracts. For Volvo Finance, those losses approached $2,000 each on some cars, said Michael T. Duke, president of Volvo Finance North America.
For Audi, the pain of unrealistic residuals was aggravated by 60 Minutes's allegations in 1986 that some of its cars were prone to unintended acceleration. The company lost up to $5,000 on some models when they were traded as resale value faded. "For us, it was a huge corporate loss," said Joseph H. Tate, general sales manager of Audi of America. "That's the roulette you play with leasing."
Losses were so great in fact that many banks retreated from the business. Marine Midland, which had built its leasing portfolio to $6 billion by 1989, ultimately lost $100 million on the program, according to Mr. McCathren of Bank Lease. Marine Midland, Citicorp, KeyCorp are among the banks that have since left the business or scaled back.
The banks' share has also been eroded by the "captive" finance arms of the car makers. Captives now finance about 80 percent of the leases written at dealerships, up from just over half in 1988, according to CNW data. Banks account for the other 20 percent of leases offered through dealers.
With the heady car-selling days of the mid-1980's behind them, and the mistakes of the decade still catching up with them, banks and captives alike say they are taking a more realistic approach, making more conservative projections of residual values. "Some of the mistakes of the past have not been repeated," said Joseph F. McPartlin, director of leasing for GMAC.
But Harvey Heinbach, an automotive analyst with Merrill Lynch in New York, said that anyone who predicts residuals is playing an inherently risky game because of the economy's unpredictability. "The risk is there. It may be small, but you're still going to own that thing at the price you guaranteed four years down the road," he said. Some leasing experts also contend that car makers are still supporting unrealistic residual values on some models to win market share.
Industry analysts predict that leasing companies will continue to devise new wrinkles for lease contracts to better match the way customers want to use their cars. Lexus, for example, has added a 30-month lease to offer another choice between 24- and 36-month leases. Ford is contemplating offering lower charges for excess mileage to be paid up front by customers who think they will use those miles, rather than annoying them with higher penalties at lease-end. GMAC has a fledgling lease program for people who lease luxury cars for limited use as second or third cars; the lower mileage projections allow GMAC to lower the customers' monthly payments.
Mr. Spinella of CNW believes that leasing companies will soon find a better solution for customers who decide to exit their leases early. The cost of doing so often angers customers and sends them to another car company for their next vehicle, what he terms the weak point in current programs. "And at the weak point," he said, "there's always somebody willing to come up with a program to solve it."
 
 
MORE ACTION AT THE AUTIONS
 As short-term consumer leasing grows in popularity, car dealers and banks are taking back more cars when leases expire. That means business for used car wholesalers that hold auto auctions.
Auto auctioneers liken their business to a financial exchange. Cars brought in are driven through lanes as auctioneers work the crowd of dealers and brokers to find the best offer. Dealers often come to simply trade some of their used-car inventory for vehicles they think will sell better. The swelling inventory of end-lease used cars, according to dealers, is no problem since most of the cars are relatively young, with 60,000 miles or less on the odometer.
Robert A. McDevitt, vice president of sales and marketing for Anglo American Auto Auctions in Nashville, one of the nation's biggest auctioneers, said that inventory from consumer leases, nonexistent 15 years ago, now comprises 25 percent of the company's business.
And with more luxury cars coming back from consumer leases, Anglo American has added a new lane at some of its gatherings. "We decided we can do a better service to our dealers to showcase them," said Mr. McDevitt. The volume of premium cars handled by the company has grown to about 5 percent of its business, he said.
Anglo American has dressed up its "HighLine" lanes with carpeting and floodlights. "We've kind of spruced up the lane where the higher quality dealer will be," said Mr. McDevitt. Tuxedoed staff served champagne at one HighLine auction, and give away black and gold T-shirts, golf shirts and golf hats.
The trappings are not free, however. While auctioneers typically charge companies about $100 to sell a car, the fee is raised to $250 for the premium lane.

HEADLINE: All About/Translation Services;
The Growing Gelt in Others' Words

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
WITH America's export engine revving up, the nation's translation services are reaping the benefits. To make money abroad, more and more companies are tailoring their products to local markets. That means having legal contracts, technical information, instruction manuals and other materials translated into and out of dozens of foreign languages.
The largest translation companies say demand has grown rapidly in recent years, changing what was once a cottage industry of dozens of tiny firms into a full-fledged business with a myriad of small- and medium-sized competitors fighting for market share. 
 Companies like All-Language Services in New York, which was founded in 1946 with five translators, have been flourishing. All-Language, which is privately held, now has 90 translators working in 59 languages. Its revenues -- it does not disclose dollar figures -- have tripled since 1980, according to Lorraine Kennedy, executive vice president. The company's growth has been spurred on by a fourfold increase in the volume of Japanese translated since 1986.
"There has always been a good deal of sophistication about language in the Fortune 500 companies," said Victor J. Hertz, president of Corporate Language Services, a privately held company in New York with affiliates in Europe. "What you're witnessing now is a burgeoning of interest from middle-level and small businesses."
The maturing of the translation business has also been reflected in a spate of recent consolidations. Since the mid-1980's, the translation division of Berlitz International, the subsidiary of Macmillan Inc., best known for its language schools, has bought six translation companies in the United States and Europe. Berlitz now has about $30 million in revenues from translations.
Another industry leader, Alpnet Inc., based in Salt Late City, is publicly traded. Alpnet, which had $22.5 million in 1990 revenues, has also grown through acquisitions overseas.
Despite its growth, the translation business is highly competitive and very fragmented. Experts say that the industry is so diffuse -- from tiny outlets to major companies -- that there are few reliable estimates of its size. If corporate and government translation divisions are included, "the total industry could be as high as $10 billion," said Michael J. Mulligan, a vice president of the translation division of Berlitz.
 
U.S. Firms Abroad
The Advantage Of Native Ability
 Even for companies that have all their operations in the United States, professional translation is very much an international business, employing for the most part people translating into their native language. Industry officials say that only by maintaining such a standard can they insure that a translation is competent.
Translation companies like Berlitz, with offices around the world, take this requirement a step further by insisting that most translations be done by native speakers in the country where the item is to be read. For example, a service might fax or send electronically to its Paris office a document that needs to translated into French.
"If you're not in country, then you don't speak the same language that they're speaking in that country," said Mr. Mulligan. Berlitz has 250 translators working in 19 offices in 13 countries.
The move over the last few years to sending work to other countries has been helped by fax machines, modems and computers. Businesses can now take their work formatted on a desktop publishing program to a translation service that sends it electronically to an office in another country. The translators then return the work ready for printing. Rates in the industry vary widely, depending on how complicated the document is, the language it is to be translated into and what other services, like editing or desktop publishing, are required.
The largest translation companies usually charge 10 cents to 50 cents per word, though rates may be higher for the most difficult work and for technical and legal documents.
Some languages also cost more to translate than others. Asian and Scandinavian languages are often more expensive: the Asian ones because they are complicated and the Scandinavian ones because of high labor costs in those countries.
 
The Speed Premium
Building Business On Flexibility
 Industry leaders say much of their growth has been sparked by the increasing sophistication of American companies, particularly the smaller ones, as they explore the export market. While large companies can set up their own translation departments, smaller ones do not have the resources for such an undertaking and must seek help elsewhere.
"Translation is no longer an afterthought," said Thomas F. Seal, the president of Alpnet, which has 22 offices in nine countries. "When companies are designing products upfront, they are realizing the need to do translation. We've seen a large increase in contacts from the development phase."
One such company is Maynard Electronics of Lake Mary, Fla., which makes computer software and hardware for backing up data. Maynard, which had revenues of about $100 million last year, recently began aggressively pushing into the European market.
The company found that its distributors in Europe were not translating its manuals adequately or fast enough, so it hired Alpnet to create German, French, Dutch, Spanish and Italian versions of the documents.
"The key was that we needed to get translations out sooner so we could get a good edge on the market," said Dawn Woods, a translation specialist at Maynard.
 
Surviving Change
Bring the U.S. Up to Speed
 While pleased with growth in recent years, industry leaders complain about the haphazard nature of the translation market. Demand for a language may rise or fall because of political or economic changes in a country. For example, the integration of Europe into a single market has led to an increased demand for German, French and Spanish translations.
The business is also oriented toward projects -- with clients providing work in fits and starts -- so it is often difficult to plan.
Over the last decade, many translation services have specialized, employing people who concentrate on translating legal work or technical and scientific documents into a specific language.
"If somebody needs a love letter translated, they can go to a next-door neighbor," said Ms. Kennedy, of All-Language Services. "But 99 percent of the stuff we do is very specialized. You can't rely on dictionaries for this stuff."
And the industry remains extremely competitive. Large outfits with hundreds of full-time translators and offices around the world might vie for the same contracts as small services that keep costs low by employing a freelance staff.
"The fact that the industry is fundamentally fragmented means that there is always somebody with relatively low overhead willing to do a project for relatively low costs," said Mr. Mulligan of Berlitz.
Moreover, even though American companies are using translation services more, many remain less familiar with the importance of language in exporting than their rivals in Europe and Asia.
"The main message now is that in Europe and Asia, you are dealing with people who are very language savvy," said Richard Huarte, the executive director of operations in the United States for Inlingua, a Swiss company with 250 offices in 22 countries, including 24 in the United States.
"The United States is really in its infancy in this area," he said. "We've come a long way, but we're still quite behind."
 
 
 
A GLUT OF GOVERNMENT WORK

To communicate with new immigrants who continue to move to the United States, Federal, state and local governments must translate documents into dozens of languages. This business has been an area of rapid growth.
"Our translation business from government agencies has at least doubled in size in the last six years," said Edward Nef, the director of the Washington office of Inlingua, the American subsidiary of the big Swiss translation service. Inlingua has bid on contracts for the United States Customs Service and the Social Security Administration.
Some agencies, like the Immigration and Naturalization Service, have their own translators. But in an age of immigration, even those offices cannot keep up with the number of languages spoken in the United States. For example, last year, the Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices, a division of the Justice Department, had to translate documents into Arabic, French, Spanish, Korean, Japanese and Chinese. Some of these documents are used by workers to file legal complaints against their employers.
Government agencies also use translation services because they are quicker than waiting for the government to do the work itself, said Tyrone Harrison, an administrative assistant at the Office of Special Counsel in New York. "Translation services have made things easier because once the documents are written in English, we can go ahead and proceed with a case more rapidly," he said.

HEADLINE: Managing;
Soldiers Return to the Workplace

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN has a formal program to recruit junior military officers as area restaurant managers. "They are accustomed to managing the kind of young, inexperienced people that we employ," said Richard M. Detwiler, director of public affairs.
The Harris County Sheriff's Department in Houston held a job fair at nearby Fort Hood to encourage departing soldiers to apply for guard work at its new jail. "Military people are drug-free, disciplined and used to abiding by rules and regulations," said H.R. Barrera, the department's recruiting officer. 
 Schneider National Carriers, the huge Green Bay, Wisc., trucker, has hired more than 1,500 ex-soldiers as drivers. "An over-the-road trucker has to be away from home a lot, and that's a life style that many soliders are used to," said Thomas E. Vandenberg, the company's general counsel.
Apparently, skills shortages and employment dislocations make even stranger bedfellows than politics. After nearly 20 years of mutual indifference bordering on disrespect -- a legacy of military bungling during the Vietnam War, and of industry's greed-stained handling of environmental issues and defense contract padding -- industry and the Army are again eying each other as allies. "We realized we're hammering the same nail," said Frank P. Doyle, senior vice president of the General Electric Company.
Indeed, while industry girds for a critical shortage of skilled workers, the Army is poised to pour thousands of trained soldiers into the workplace. Over the next few years a Washington-mandated downsizing of the Army will result in the "involuntary separation" -- military talk for firing -- of some 50,000 enlistees and 18,000 officers. More than 300,000 others are expected to take early retirement or otherwise not re-enlist. Cuts to the Navy, Air Force and Marines will be miniscule in comparison.
All told, about 400,000 soldiers will be job hunting. The Army's immediate goal is to help all of them find jobs. And, its long-term goal is to permanently position itself as a great jumping-off point for a career.
"If we prove that we can transition people to civilian life, we'll have an easier time recruiting," said G. Kim Wincup, Assistant Secretary of the Army for manpower.
Thus, the Army has mounted an all-out publicity blitz. It has tapped CBS correspondent Charles Osgood to narrate a promotional film about soldiers. And, two weeks ago it co-hosted, with the Committee for Economic Development, a day-long seminar for business people at which it touted such statistics as the $1.3 billion it spends each year on training, and the fact that 98 percent of Army people have high school diplomas.
"Remember, these are the same people who so dazzled and impressed the world during Desert Storm," Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney told the seminar.
The Army has also set up mechanisms to hook employers up with jobless soldiers. It has sent a book to professors teaching military science to students in the Reserve Officer Training Corps, that lists companies interested in hiring the students.
It also has 61 Army-run transition assistance offices, which offer Army people and their families career counseling and assistance with job-hunting skills. And it has contracted with private companies to run 55 Job Assistance Centers, both fixed and mobile, at various Army bases. In addition to counseling, these centers offer computer access to hiring requirements and names of primary contacts at more than 2,000 companies.
By the end of the year there will be an electronic bulletin board that soldiers and their families can check for news of job fairs or anything else pertinent to job-hunting.
And when all else fails, it is willing to apply subtle pressure to get its people jobs. Global Associates, a technical support company in McLean, Va., recently received a contract to train Army reserve medical units to use new types of equipment. It plans to staff the project with a high proportion of Army people, for three reasons:
"They know Army equipment, they know Army rules -- and we got a strong hint from the wording in the contract about who we should hire to do the training," said Walter Berry, the project's training manager.
 
 
 
THE FITS, AND POSSIBLE MISSES
 On the surface, the fit between Army experience and corporate jobs seems right. Army people have relocated families, run foreign outposts, competed globally, managed diversity, worked with advanced technology, handled joint ventures with foreign partners -- many of the very problems that business now faces. And there is a lot of transferability between the technical training the military provides, and the technical knowhow that industry needs.
But cultural fit is less obvious. Some executives question whether military people, who are trained to give and follow orders, can adapt to private industry, where the trend is to empower workers to do what the customer, not necessarily the boss, wants. "I'm not sure the Army breeds creative thinkers," said the personnel chief of a chemical company, who insisted on anonymity.
Pentagon honchos find that kind of skepticism galling.
"Our soldiers make instantaneous decisions whether to shoot at a tank or not, yet we still have this Beatle Bailey image," said Col. Robert Magruder, executive officer to the assistant secretary of the Army for manpower and reserve affairs.
Lieut. Gen. William H. Reno, deputy chief of staff for personnel, expects that the good publicity reaped by Desert Storm will dissipate that image. "Sergeants in the desert made more decisions each hour than a general makes in a week," he said.

HEADLINE: CAMPUS LIFE: Tulsa;
Schools in U.S. And Russia Set Up An Exchange Plan

DATELINE: TULSA, Okla.

 BODY:
The Russian city of Zelenograd has just about everything an entrepreneurial wannabe could want: an electronics industry ready to convert from military production to consumer products; a work force willing to join a free market economy, even a business school. What it doesn't have is a B-school curriculum that teaches Western marketing and management skills. That is what four delegates from Zelenograd came to the University of Tulsa last weekend to get.
"This university knows American business very well, and its curriculum and syllabus answers all questions on the free market system," said Anatoly Larionov, director of the Zelenograd Business School and a member of the delegation. "That's why we came here." 
 Mr. Larionov said the delegation hopes to establish a Master of Business Administration program in Zelenograd and a student and faculty exchange with Tulsa. He said the schools also plan to serve as mediators between Soviet and American business executives, as Zelenograd and Tulsa work to become sister cities.
The joint B-school venture is the first of its kind involving academic institutions in the United States and the Soviet Union, said Robert Hisrich, a business professor at Tulsa who during the summer signed the agreement to start the project.
"This agreement should establish us as a major player in the U.S. technical system and in the conversion and liberalization of the Soviet economy," said Robert H. Donaldson, president of the university and a specialist in international politics with an emphasis on Soviet and American foreign exchange.
 
Closed to Foreigners in Past
 In a four-day flurry that ended last Sunday, Mr. Larionov and Zelenograd's mayor, or "prefect," Alesky A. Ishchuk, along with two Soviet professors, met with Tulsa's Mayor, Rodger Randle, university administrators and B-school professors, and spoke with business students attending classes in international marketing. The delegates discussed Zelenograd's conversion to a consumer economy and said they hoped to become sufficiently familiar with Western marketing techniques to use them in a city "still continuing its struggle for democracy and peace."
According to Mr. Ishchuk, Zelenograd, a city with 12 microelectronic research centers, was closed to foreigners until December 1990 because of the secrecy of military weapons designed there.
Professor Hisrich and Mr. Larionov said they hope to complete the school curriculum next month; but it will not be put into effect until next fall. Student and faculty exchanges should start in January and student internships in May or June, said Professor Hisrich, who was instrumental in establishing a business school and exchange program last year in Hungary.
Each school will pay the expenses of the visiting students and professors. Mr. Donaldson said the university may also be eligible for several Federal grants.
Besides Mr. Larionov and Mr. Ishchuk, the visiting delegation included Lyubov V. Yakovleva, faculty member of the Institute of Electrical Technology, and Nadezhda I. Emelyanova, department head in the Institute for Professional Technical Education of the Russian Republic. Yelaina Khripkov, a Tulsa professor of Russian studies, served as interpreter.
"We probably will initially give more than we can take, but this will be an incredible cultural experience," Professor Hisrich said.
Mr. Larionov added, "In business, we are only making the first steps."

HEADLINE: Most Arab Capitals Welcome Talks

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Most Arab capitals today welcomed the announcement of peace talks with Israel, marking a significant change in the public Arab attitude toward the nation most Arabs have boycotted for more than 40 years.
The vocal and open support for the peace talks reflected a new balance of power that has emerged after the Persian Gulf war, giving moderate Arab nations the upper hand in this region. 
 The crisis has also produced much bitterness against Arabs, including those in the Palestine Liberation Organization and Jordan, who supported Iraq after Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait. These sentiments were evident today in commentaries cautioning Palestinians not to waste this opportunity to make peace.
"Israel and the Arabs must put away their historic enmity and resort to the logic of interests," Al Riyadh, the Saudi daily, said today. That echoed the strong support signaled by King Fahd on Monday for the United States effort to convene a peace conference, another sign of Saudi Arabia's newly assertive attitude in Arab politics.
 
Fahd Praises Baker
 In a remarkable departure from the usually discreet style of Saudi diplomacy, at the end of a Cabinet meeting Monday night, King Fahd lavishly praised Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d for the diplomatic mission that produced the invitation to a peace conference. The King also stressed that Saudi Arabia would make every effortto insure that the peace talks are successful.
Arab officials in the gulf region have also reiterated over the last few days their willingness to take part in the peace conference and to consider the end of the Arab economic boycott of Israel.
In Amman, Jordanian officials said Jordan today formally accepted the invitation to the conference.
A statement issued after a Cabinet meeting said Jordan had decided "in principle" to accept the invitation, and the Information Minister, Mahmoud al-Sharif, said in a telephone interview that some "procedural matters" remained under discussion. He said Jordan's representatives in the joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation would probably be announced in the coming week.
In Cairo, the Egyptian press quoted President Hosni Mubarak as telling all parties in the Mideast conflict that "peace deserves any concessions that may avoid the shedding of blood, violence and extremism and which allow us to turn to the development of our countries."
Editorial writers went further than ever before in stressing the need for compromise and signaling to the Palestinians in particular that they may have to settle for a great deal less than their stated aims of the past: recovering all the occupied territories taken by Israel in the 1967 war and establishing their independent state.
In the gulf, such comments reflected lingering bitterness at the support given by the P.L.O. chairman, Yasir Arafat, to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq during the gulf crisis.
"In the past we thought that the Palestinian leadership had its calculations and vision," wrote Ahmad Jarallah, editor of Al Siyassah, a daily in Kuwait. "But now we know that, unfortunately, the Palestinian leadership has regrettably used the Palestinian cause to play politics and interfere in the internal affairs of Arab nations. Therefore, the decision must be in our hands. We will enter the talks and dialogue with Israel whether the Palestinians accept or reject and whether they come or stay away."
Some editorials also cautioned against high expectations and stringent demands by the Arabs in the talks.
"There are those who say it is possible to recover Palestinian lands even if they are the site of Jewish settlements, as indeed it happened in the case of Egypt, which recovered the Sinai and the city of Taba," Al Nadwa, a Saudi daily, commented today, referring to Egypt's peace treaty with Israel in 1979. It said that times had changed, however, and that such expectations might be wrong and should be revised.
"To those people we say that the situation is different and time is to the benefit of the Israelis," Al Nadwa said. Government radio in Oman tonight praised the peace talks, proclaiming that they are the clearest evidence of the Arabs' desire to seek peace and put the Arab-Israeli conflict behind them.
Only Iran, which is a Muslim but non-Arab gulf power, vehemently attacked the talks and condemned any compromise by Palestinians with Israel. The Iranian rejection of peace talks with Israel was the subject of a special conference on "Palestine" that began today in Teheran.
In a speech on Friday, President Hashemi Rafsanjani told a large crowd in Teheran: "The United States is seeking today to save Israel and eradicate Palestinian aspirations by crushing half a century of struggle by the Palestinian people in the name of peace. It is seeking the recognition by Arab and Muslim states of the illegitimate state of Israel."

 
Arafat in Damascus
 BEIRUT, Lebanon, Oct. 19 (Special to The New York Times) -- Mr. Arafat arrived in Damascus today on his first visit to Syria in three years and held talks with President Hafez al-Assad about the Arab position at the conference.
Syria's state radio, monitored here, said the P.L.O. leader's visit was at the invitation of Mr. Assad, who has been in contact with other Arab leaders regarding the peace talks.
A high-level P.L.O. delegation accompanied Mr. Arafat to Damascus. The delegation may try to mend fences with Syria and Damascus-based radical Palestinian guerrilla factions opposed to Mr. Arafat.
The P.L.O. chairman was expelled from Damascus eight years ago over a policy conflict with Mr. Assad. He has not been back since in a formal capacity, although he was allowed to return in April 1988 for the funeral of a top aide.

HEADLINE: CAMBODIAN TREATY TO BE SIGNED SOON

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 19

 BODY:
After tortuous negotiations, Cambodia's four warring factions have at last agreed to sign a peace accord here on Wednesday to end their 13-year conflict and prepare the devastated nation for free elections.
The agreement will require the United Nations to play perhaps its biggest peacekeeping role ever, with thousands of foreign soldiers and civilians due to assume responsibility for monitoring a cease-fire, disarming combatants, organizing elections and insuring that they are fair. 
 Indeed, more than in any other country where the United Nations has tried to settle a bitter internal conflict with foreign ramifications, the organization will effectively co-govern Cambodia, sharing power with a coalition of the four factions until a new government is elected.
 
A Result of Cold War's End
 The accord is seen as a another fruit of closer cooperation between Washington and Moscow and other changes in the international climate that have already resulted in solutions, or progress towards settlement, of disputes in Namibia, Angola, Afghanistan and El Salvador.
In this case, the United States, the Soviet Union and China all played a pivotal role by supervising negotiations and nudging their respective political clients in Cambodia to accept the risks of democracy over continuation of a war that none seemed likely to win.
But the deep distrust dividing the Phnom Penh Government and its three guerrilla enemies was still evident even as delegates from 19 countries gathered here for a conference on Cambodia that is to begin on Monday and culminate with the expected signature of the peace accord on Wednesday.
At a meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Bangkok this week, members of a combined Cambodian delegation exchanged insults. Khmer Rouge guerrillas were also accused of trying to push more than 40,000 refugees from camps in Thailand into areas under their control.
Recalling that the last major peace conference on Cambodia in Paris broke up in disarray two years ago, Western officials involved in the new negotiations have cautioned against excessive optimism.
 
Crucial Role of the U.N.
 And it is for this reason, they said, that the role of the United Nations is crucial, even though it may cost the organization as much as $2 billion during the estimated 18 to 21 months before elections are held, a new constitution is written and a legitimate government is appointed.
Yet if peace finally comes to Cambodia, it will bring its eight million people their first respite since the nation was drawn into the Vietnam War in 1970, when American and South Vietnamese troops invaded its territory to combat Vietcong and Khmer Rouge rebels.
In April 1975, the Khmer Rouge, led by Pol Pot, seized Phnom Penh, beginning a reign of terror that left more than one million people dead before it was driven from power in late 1978 by Vietnam, which installed a new Government, led by Heng Samrin, in January 1979.
Since then, backed and armed by China, the Khmer Rouge has continued to control territory in western Cambodia and has maintained its warfare against the Phnom Penh Government.
Two other rebel groups appeared, one headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who was ousted as head of state in 1970, and the other, the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, led by a former Prime Minister, Son Sann, who was backed by the United States.
 
A Divided Coalition
 Although the three opposition forces formed a loose coalition, it was always deeply divided, with followers of Prince Sihanouk and Mr. Son Sann almost as eager to prevent the Khmer Rouge from returning to power as they were to oust the Government in Phnom Penh.
On Thursday, in preparation for the future elections, Mr. Heng Samrin's party dropped its commitment to Communism, accepted political pluralism and free-market economics and changed its name.
Under the peace agreement, which is to go into effect as soon as it is signed on Wednesday, the 12-member Supreme National Council, formed from the four factions and led by Prince Sihanouk, will assume the powers of government. But it will also surrender enormous power to what will be known as the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia, or Untac.
This week, the Security Council approved the dispatch of the first peacekeeping unit to Cambodia, comprising 268 military officers and civilians under the command of a French officer, Brig. Gen. Jean-Michel Loridon. It will be in charge of monitoring the initial cease-fire and recommending the size of the main United Nations contingent.
Some estimates have put the eventual United Nations presence as high as 20,000 soldiers and civilian administrators.
Before the United Nations can begin preparing for elections by organizing voter registration and drawing up an electoral code, it faces the intimidating task of securing a cease-fire, insuring the withdrawal of the remaining Vietnamese troops, gathering the warring armies in designated areas and taking charge of their weapons.
The United Nations will also assume responsibility for assisting the return to Cambodia of some 350,000 refugees living in camps across the border in Thailand.

HEADLINE: U.S., Wary of European Corps, Seeks Assurance on NATO Role

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 19

 BODY:
The United States has sought assurances that NATO's position as the bulwark of Western security will not be undermined by French-German moves to give Europe an independent defense capability through the creation of a multinational army corps.
But while Britain has criticized the French-German initiative as a potential threat to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was more diplomatic when he spoke to reporters on Friday after NATO defense ministers discussed the issue at a meeting in a Sicilian resort, Taormina. 
 "We understand full well the desire of our European friends and allies to address the security dimension as they simultaneously come to grips with the very important issues of economic and political integration," Mr. Cheney said.
But he emphasized that Washington still believed "very deeply" that NATO should remain the foundation of Western Europe's security.
"NATO is the mechanism by which the United States has been involved and will stay involved in the questions of European security," he said.
 
Expanded Paris-Bonn Force
 France and Germany made their proposal on Wednesday in the context of negotiations within the 12-nation European Community to draw up a treaty to establish the rules for a common foreign and security policy leading to agreement on a common military policy.
As a step in that direction, the two Governments said they would expand a 5,000-member French-German brigade into a larger corps comprising about 40,000 troops and would invite other community members to take part in the force, which could become the embryo of a European army.
President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl also proposed strengthening an old military group known as the Western European Union. Britain immediately expressed concern that this organization could duplicate functions currently carried out by NATO.
During the meeting of NATO's Nuclear Planning Group in Taormina, Germany's Defense Minister, Gerhard Stoltenburg, faced intense questioning about the initiative. Officials said he explained that details of the planned force had still to be worked out, but insisted that it would be "complementary" to NATO.
 
Nuclear Arms Cuts in Europe
 France, which is not a member of NATO's integrated military command, did not take part in the Taormina meeting. But during a visit to Italy today, Mr. Mitterrand said he hoped that questions raised by the French-German initiative could be resolved in time for a European Community summit meeting in the Netherlands early in December.
He argued that there were no major contradictions between the French-German plan and a competing British-Italian plan that also called for strengthening of the Western European Union but underlined its ties to NATO. The two plans, he said, "deal with the same problem in different ways, but they have the same objective."
The main purpose of the two-day NATO meeting in Taormina, which ended Friday, was to make official the alliance's plan to reduce its nuclear arsenal in Europe by 700 beyond the reductions already announced by President Bush this month.
But the ministers also expressed concern about Soviet control over its own huge nuclear arsenal in the light of the political changes sweeping the country. Mr. Cheney said the Bush Administration planned to "interact aggressively" with Moscow on the subject, adding that future control of Soviet weapons is still "the big question that no one can answer."

HEADLINE: Wall St. Property Prices Fall

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
Seven years ago, the value of the million-square-foot office building that housed Drexel Burnham Lambert and other well-known Financial District tenants was estimated at $160 million.
Last week, the 39-story building at 60 Broad Street, just south of the New York Stock Exchange, changed hands for $57.5 million. 
 The sale of the mortgage on the building owned by Olympia & York, the giant Canadian real estate company, was widely seen as a benchmark of just how hard downtown commercial property values had been hit by the recession. Before that sale, no building worth more than $50 million had recently changed hands, which made it difficult to assess how low the market had fallen.
The collapse in real estate values has been one of the factors hurting New York City, which receives most of its revenues from real estate taxes. The fall in values has also caused enormous losses in the financial services business that employs tens of thousands of New Yorkers.
The mortgage on the building was sold by CalFed Inc., a Los Angeles savings and loan, to the Li Ka-Shing family of Hong Kong and a joint venture formed with Olympia & York, the largest owner of office space in New York City. CalFed did not disclose the purchase price but announced that it had sold the mortgage at a $12.5 million loss, even after it had written down the value of the mortgage.
The building was left more than 70 percent vacant after Drexel went bankrupt last year and the rent income on the building was no longer sufficient to cover monthly mortgage payments. Although Olympia & York continued to make the payments, CalFed was forced by Federal regulators to reduce the value of the mortgage. CalFed put the value of the mortgage at about $70 million, or $70 a square foot, versus the former $160 a square foot estimate.
Some New York real estate experts said they were not surprised by the $57 million value put on the building.

HEADLINE: Deaths at Home Rend Town Used to Worst of War

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KILLEEN, Tex., Oct. 19

 BODY:
This small, hard-nosed town on the edge of the Texas plains is the home of Fort Hood, the largest military base in the United States. And when thousands of its troops marched off to fight the war in the Persian Gulf, many people here feared that scores of their neighbors would be killed or maimed.
So the town prepared for the worst. Support groups for families were formed. Special counseling sessions were held for the children. Ministers and psychologists prepared for months of agony and tears. 
 But though people in these parts learn early how to deal with the uncertainty and hardships and with the shadow of violent death that go with soldiering, they have never needed such lessons more than now, in the aftermath of George Hennard's killing spree.
 
'Pretty Used to Death'
 "We're pretty used to death, with all the wars and the soldiers going to and fro all the time," said Florence Snaden, a longtime resident of Killeen and the wife of a retired staff sergeant. "But almost all of our people came back safe. That's one reason why what happened here the other day is so hard to take. It's never going to leave us. We're never going to be the same."
On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Hennard, the 35-year-old son of a former Army surgeon at Fort Hood, shot 22 people to death and wounded 23 others during the busy lunch hour at Luby's Cafeteria here. Then he killed himself.
It is the worst mass shooting in the nation's history. In 10 minutes on a summerlike day in Texas, Mr. Hennard killed almost as many people as were killed in the worst Scud missile attack by the Iraqis in the gulf war, when 28 American soldiers died in a strike on a barracks.
"After the war there was such a widespread sense of euphoria," said Jim Eads, a clinical social worker in Killeen and a retired Army officer. "Then this happened."
Today, amid the sorrow and shock that has settled over this sunbaked region, the funerals began.
At the First Baptist Church in Killeen, more than 500 people attended a service for Patricia B. Carney. A longtime educator with the Killeen Independent School District, Mrs. Carney, who was 57 years old, was killed as she ate lunch with several school officials.
"I really don't know if you can ever get over something like this," said a school spokesman, Bob Massey. "Now, the children are scared to even go outside. One of the biggest challenges to teachers is keeping that normal tone. But they lost their friends, too."
 
SaturToday, Four Funerals
 At least four of those killed, including Mrs. Carney, were buried today -- the others in Austin, San Antonio and nearby Lampasas. In the next few days, many more funerals will be held.
As the towns buried their dead, the authorities continued to hunt for clues as to why the 35-year-old former Merchant seaman went on his deadly spree. A report in The Dallas Morning News attributed to unnamed police sources that Mr. Hennard had recently seen "The Fisher King," a movie that includes a scene in which a gunman fires several shots into a crowded restaurant. But three police officials said they could not confirm the report.
"What we're going to see is a lot of anger come out over the weekend," said John Hart, the administrator of the Greenleaf Center of Killeen, a psychiatric hospital. "This is a small community and people know eachother. The entire community has been touched."
But Mr. Hart said Killeen is perhaps a little better prepared than other towns to handle the numbing grief.
"The support systems were already in place," he said. "The same people who pulled together before -- the ministers, the doctors, the psychologists -- are pulling together now."
Mr. Hennard's victims included educators and a repairman. There was an electrician and a lieutenant colonel who was due to retire in 14 days. A chiropractor, the president of a credit union and a woman who was two days away from watching her daughter get married were also among the dead.
The victims lived here and in San Antonio, about 120 miles southwest of Killeen, and in Belton, about 10 miles east, and in several other towns scattered across central Texas.
 
'I've Been in There Before'
 "It's hit all of Texas, not just Killeen," Helen Johnson, a resident of San Antonio, said the other day as she stood near the Luby's parking lot here. Mrs. Johnson, who was driving through Killeen on her way to someplace else, decided, like others, to stop and see the site of the killings. "Any of us could have been eating in there," she said. "I've been in there before."
And now, several days after the shootings, people here speak of being leery about going to a restaurant. Many said that the enjoyment of going out to eat died along with their friends and neighbors.
"I went to a restaurant yesterday and everything was so quiet, everybody was so sad," said Pedro Marrero, the pastor of Templo Victoria, a non-denominational church in a converted movie theater in downtown Killeen. "I don't know how long it will take for things to go back to normal."
Another resident, Joe Borrero, said, "I think a lot of people are still numb." Mr. Borrero, who is 40 years old, added, "The kids talk about it, but the grown-ups are having a hard time handling it."
Evelyn Seales, 60, who lives in Killeen, said in an interview on Friday that she was not sure how she felt. She was eating lunch in Luby's with two friends when Mr. Hennard drove his pickup through the restaurant's plate-glass window and began shooting. The three friends survived.
Mrs. Seales said she mistook the first shot she heard for the truck backfiring after it came through the window. She said she thought the truck would explode and "we'd all burn up."
 
A Time to Pray
 Then someone screamed that the man who had jumped out of the pickup had a gun, and people began diving under tables as he walked calmly through the restaurant, shooting people in the head.
"People wasn't saying anything, we were all just praying," Mrs. Seales said.
She closed her eyes. Her husband, George, patted her on the back and wiped a tear from his eye. He said last Thursday was their 38th wedding anniversary.
"We spent our anniversary having leftovers," Mrs. Seales said. "I was too afraid to go out."
The last couple of years have not been kind to Killeen. The economy of this town of 63,500 is "virtually 100 percent dependent on Fort Hood," said a member of the Killeen City Council, H.F. Rucker Jr. He said that in the months after more than 20,000 soldiers from the base were shipped to Persian Gulf in just six weeks, 150 businesses here were forced to close.
"We have very little other industry," he said. "As Fort Hood goes, so does Killeen."
In this town, a camouflage uniform is the most common business suit seen on the streets. And after the troops returned home, life and business began to slowly return to normal.
Sgt. Kenneth Branch has been stationed at Fort Hood off and on since 1981. He said the town had not changed much over the last decade, at least until George Hennard started shooting. But since Wednesday, he says, the town has drawn closer.
"I think it's going to bring the whole town closer together," he said. "Sometimes, the town is split between black and white. But now a lot more people appreciate each other. People speak to you a lot more. You get a lot more smiles. We're trying to recover."
On Friday night, high school football games were played all over Texas, including here, where the Killeen Kangaroos beat Pflugerville, 21 to 14. Today, the shopping malls were crowded, the fast-food restaurants busy.
But there was one difference. Residents here, who, like much of the nation, wore yellow ribbons while the troops were overseas, have begun to wear white ribbons since Wednesday. The ribbons are being distributed all over town as a silent memorial to those who died.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
For a Common-Sense Economist, A Nobel - And an Impact in the Law

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
When people think about what economists do, they are likely to conjure nightmarish equations and computer simulations and all manner of indigestible Greek-letter salad. For the most part, they are right.
But exceptions are often more interesting than the rules. And few are as interesting as the work of Ronald H. Coase, the 81-year-old retired University of Chicago Law School professor who last week won the Nobel prize for economics. His ideas have swept throughlegal scholarship like a fresh breeze. It is likely -- some would argue, inevitable -- that the Coasian way of thinking will influence policies ranging from access to transplant organs to the control of corporations. 
 Mr. Coase (whose name rhymes with dose) has made a career asking basic questions about the minuet of the markets -- how people organize to advance their economic interests, and when government is needed to choreograph the dance. And what a career: his penetrating yet disarmingly simple answers have become the stuff of myth to a generation of scholars more at home in multivariate regression analysis than in English.
For a sample of vintage Coase, consider his 1974 article on lighthouses. For decades, textbooks used the lighthouse as an example of a "public good," a service that private markets could not deliver efficiently because there was no practical way to exclude consumers who refused to pay.
But the British-born Mr. Coase noted that lighthouses began as private enterprises in Britain, and that the system worked well. For in spite of the "free rider" problem, enough people who profited from the ship traffic through British ports were willing to support the lighthouses because they did not trust government to provide adequate service on its own. New Yorkers may note that what worked in Britain also works closer to home: hundreds of city block associations now pay for the extra protection the city's police department cannot or will not provide.
Mr. Coase reserved his broadest brush for an analysis of why business companies exist. Companies, he argued, are really contractual hierarchies that shelter collections of workers from the uncertainties and costs of relying on markets to meet their needs. When a professional wants a letter typed, she can hand it to her secretary rather than looking for typists on the street or in the Yellow Pages. And when a typist wants to sell his skills, he can trade flexibility, independence and perhaps a higher income for a guaranteed salary.
Businesses grow, Mr. Coase concluded, to the point that the costs of internal sources of inefficiency -- the myriad conflicts between individual workers' interests and that of the organization as a whole -- equal the costs of coping with the endless headaches of buying and selling what you need, when you need it. This may not seem an earth-shaking insight. But his ideas lurk behind serious analyses of contemporary business issues ranging from corporate control to workplace discrimination. Indeed, they have proved so fruitful that one of his disciples, Oliver Williamson of the University of California at Berkeley, may yet win his own Nobel prize for extensions of the framework.
For all its impact, however, Mr. Coase's theory of the firm must take a back seat to his 1960 article, "The Problem of Social Cost." When first submitted to the University of Chicago's Journal of Law and Economics, it evoked the wrath of the entire economics department, which was then home to giants including the future Nobel prize winners Milton Friedman and George Stigler. But in a famous seminar, Mr. Coase converted them one by one. Thirty years later it has probably become the single most cited article in modern economics.
Again, the point is simple. It had long been the conventional wisdom that markets generating "externalities" -- costs not borne by producers -- would inevitably be wasteful without a little help from government. If, for example, soot from a factory chimney ruined the paint on neighboring houses, some sort of tax or regulation would be needed to get the factory to take account of the soot damage in choosing a lowest-cost method of production.
Mr. Coase was skeptical. If the damage created by the soot exceeded the cost of curtailing it, why couldn't the homeowners bribe the factory to clean up its act? In a world where the practical problems of making deals (what economists call the transactions costs) were tiny, he concluded, government would not be needed to insure least-cost solutions to problems of externalities.
By the same logic, of course, pigs could fly if only they had wings. But as Guido Calabresi, dean of the Yale Law School, points out, Mr. Coase was not trying to make a practical case for keeping government out of regulating pollution. Rather, he was arguing the true source of market failure is not the externalities but the transactions costs that prevent waste-reducing deals. For purposes of clearer analysis, he was separating the problem of coping with the nuisance from the question of who was at fault. In a Coasian world of "causal agnosticism," Mr. Calabresi says, one could as easily speak of the paint getting in the way of the soot as the soot getting in the way of the paint.
Michael E. Levine, the dean of Yale's School of Management, offers an example of the way such analysis can change established legal thinking. In a hoary Minnesota case often cited in law texts, a Great Lakes steamer tied up at the nearest wharf to avoid sinking in a storm. The dock was badly damaged, and the owner sued to cover the repair costs.
At the time (1910), the court floundered its way through a logical thicket of assigning liability where common sense said no one was truly at fault. If Mr. Coase had been on the bench, however, he might well have focused on the next accident rather than the last.
A Coasian scholar would want to give both the owners of docks and the owners of boats the incentives to minimize the total damage to life and property. And that probably would have meant billing the boat owner, who was in the better position to weigh the risks.
The Coasian way of thinking, Mr. Calabresi says, offers opportunities for analyzing questions in everything from bankruptcy to environmental law. Even novel legal issues, like balancing the wishes of grieving families against society's interest in making body organs available for transplant, give way easily to Mr. Coase's brand of analysis. Such Coasian techniques have found a firm niche in legal scholarship.
But Richard A. Posner, a Federal appeals court judge and disciple of the Nobel prize winner from his days as a University of Chicago Law professor, thinks the best is yet to come. "Ideas filter gradually into the real law," he said; "It will be another generation" before the shock waves fully penetrate the system.

HEADLINE: A New York State Revision Shows Fewer at Work

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Indicating that the recession is more severe than previously believed, the New York State Department of Labor has said that there are fewer people working in the state and in New York City than it had originally estimated.
Compared with its previously released monthly estimate of the number of people on payrolls, the Labor Department's revised estimate for August shows that there were 79,200 fewer jobs held throughout the state at the end of that month, including 53,800 fewer in the city. 
 "You could have knocked us over with a feather," said Thomas A. Rodick, deputy director of the Labor Department's division of research and statistics.
Based on what it calls its monthly non-agricultural employment estimate -- a figure derived from a sample of 22,000 work places in the state, 6,000 of them in the city -- the Labor Department had originally estimated that were 8 million jobs held throughout the state, 3.4 million of them in New York City.
 
A More Complete Number
 But based on quarterly tax reports from the approximately 460,000 employers in the state, the department came up with a more complete number that it calls a "universe figure," and was forced to reduce the employment estimates by 79,000 in the state and 54,000 in the city.
That would leave the state with 7.9 million people on payrolls at the end of August, compared with 8.2 million for the same period in 1990 -- a 3.4 percent drop. And New York City experienced a 4.7 percent drop, from 3.6 million people employed in September 1990 to 3.4 million this September.
"Along comes this universe figure and we compare, and the universe figure is much lower than our monthly estimates," Mr. Rodick said.
The hardest-hit sectors of the economy, according to the Labor Department report released on Friday, were in the wholesale trade, restaurant and hotel industries, as well as business, management, engineering, legal and repair services.
"The numbers indicate that the national recession has been more severe in New York and some other large states than previously thought," Mr. Rodick said. "New York is not alone in this. Other states have experienced, in terms of percentage, even larger drops."
Asked what factors caused the drop in employment during the first part of this year, Mr. Rodick cited "the combined effects of the national recession and the Persian Gulf war." The war, he said, "was a period of really great concern on the part of the nation and consumers, and it really dampened economic activity."
Mr. Rodick also pointed out that the service industries have traditionally been considered "recession proof."
"But in this recession," he continued, "services are also being impacted. The cost pressures and tight money in the goods-producing sector is filtering down and taking its toll on the services used by the manufacturers."

HEADLINE: Palestinians Present List of 14 Delegates for Talks

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Asserting their intention to be treated as equals to everyone else at the conference table, Palestinian negotiators today gave the chief United States representative here a complete list of their delegates to the Middle East peace talks planned for Oct. 30 in Madrid.
The names of the Palestinian delegates are a critical issue because Israel has placed strict conditions on the Palestinians who will go to Madrid as part of a joint delegation with Jordan. Among other things, the Israelis rule out sitting down with anyone who is from East Jerusalem or has overt ties to the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
 The 14-name list was not made public, and a Palestinian leader said that if Israel got to see the list, it would be torn up and a new one drafted.
Nevertheless, even without knowing specifically who were proposed, Israeli officials said they were confident that they could make sure their criteria would be met. "We'll have our ways," said Ehud Gol, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
 
Shamir Unenthused
 Although he is decidedly unenthusiastic about the Madrid gathering, out of concern that Israel will be forced to make territorial concessions to its Arab neighbors and not receive solid peace guarantees in return, Mr. Shamir says he will recommend when the Cabinet meets on Sunday that it agree to send an Israeli delegation. "I don't see a better alternative," he said on Friday after the United States and the Soviet Union, as conference sponsors, sent out invitations.
But while it seems likely Mr. Shamir will prevail, his aides foresee a political storm from far-right elements of his governing coalition.
Ariel Sharon, the hawkish Housing Minister and a rival of Mr. Shamir within their Likud Party, called again today for the Prime Minister's resignation, charging that he had "led Israel on a mistaken path and continues to anesthetize the public against the truly terrible dangers Israel faces."
Three small, right-wing parties in the governing coalition, which could bring down the Government if they all walked out, have also expressed great unhappiness and have raised questions about whether they would stay on as Government partners. Signs were that they would, at least for now. Even if they do leave, the opposition Labor Party and several small groupings on the left promise to take up the slack and support the Government so long as the peace process continues.
 
Secrecy and Jockeying
 The secrecy surrounding the list of the Palestinian delegates reflects a jockeying for tactical position that may get rougher in the days leading to the Madrid talks.
For the Palestinians, weakened by a string of miscalculations that include its support of Iraq in the Persian Gulf war, the peace process has thus far involved large gulps of swallowed pride. They have had little choice but to accept Israeli terms for their participation, but now that the conference looks to be a reality, they are seeking to reassert themselves and regain a measure of independence.
"We are not less than anyone," said Faisal al-Husseini, one of the main Palestinian negotiators who has been meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. "This is the way we will be treated: no less than anyone, no less than any other state."
One way for him to declare equality was by not disclosing the names on the delegate list, which he handed today to the United States Consul General in Jerusalem, Molly Williamson. In this manner, the Americans can check the names to see if they follow Israeli guidelines. But the Palestinians can also say that the Israelis will not have a direct opportunity to reject them before giving their final assent to the conference.
"There is an agreement that these names are not to be vetted or vetoed," said Hanan Ashrawi, another Palestinian negotiator.
Mr. Husseini and Mrs. Ashrawi, while presumably not delegates themselves because of their East Jerusalem identity cards, are expected to be part of a six-member advisory team to the Palestinian delegation. Their presence in Madrid would be likely to increase already strong Israeli concerns about how prominent the P.L.O. will be.
For all the secrecy, some names of proposed delegates have filtered out. Among the reports is that the Palestinians will be led by Dr. Haidar Abed al-Shafi, a physician from the Gaza Strip who heads the Red Crescent Society there and is said to be close to left-wing Palestinian groups.
Other names mentioned are Zakaria al-Agha, another Gaza physician, who also has met frequently with Mr. Baker; Zia Abu Ziad, a writer and journalist; Abdel Rahman Hamad, a professor of engineering at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank; Sami Kilani, a writer and lecturer at An Najah University in Nablus; Hassan al-Khatib, an economics professor from Ramallah; and Radwan Abu Ayash, a Ramallah resident who heads the Arab Journalists Association.
But none of these names have been confirmed.

HEADLINE: Tourists From Abroad Discover Mid-America

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DODGE CITY, Kan.

 BODY:
Aided by a weak dollar and bargain-basement air fares, visitors from overseas are flocking to the United States in numbers that have set records five years in a row. But what has startled travel experts is that more and more overseas visitors are turning up in states like Kansas and Nebraska, Kentucky and Utah.
Having seen the theme parks and the major cities, these tourists -- especially repeat visitors, who last year made up 76 percent of all overseas visitors -- are traveling to Indian reservations, staying at dude ranches, hiking through remote national parks and finding their way to places far off the beaten track. 
 Places like Dodge City, a windswept old frontier outpost that achieved international fame as the setting of "Gunsmoke," the longest-running Western in television history, hold special appeal. With its reconstructions of 1870's buildings where gunslingers like Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson (and the fictional Marshal Matt Dillon) roamed, Dodge City has attracted almost 20,000 foreign visitors this year.
The Old West flavor is one of the main reasons Kansas leads all other states in the rate of growth in overseas tourism -- up 213 percent last year from 1985 -- as against a national average of 60 percent in the same period.
"Can there be anybody around the world who doesn't know of Dodge City from television and the movies?" asked Bernie Ashfield of Adelaide, Australia, who traveled here from New York on a cross-country tour bus.
Ian Hay of Timaru, New Zealand, a fellow passenger, added: "It's a very historic spot. Dodge City is just about as well-known down there as New York."
These days, almost no tourist attraction seems too remote for overseas visitors. Some of the recent interest in Iowa, for instance, stems from its legalization of gambling on Mississippi river boats, starting last spring.
But in Dyersville, Iowa, where a baseball field was created for the Kevin Costner movie "Field of Dreams," Jackie Ellingson of the Chamber of Commerce said, "Lots of Japanese tourists have flocked here to see the 'Field of Dreams.' "
Thousands of foreigners -- inspired by reruns of the 1960's television adventure series "Route 66," about two friends who traveled the highway in a Corvette, have been turning up in cities and towns along what is left of the 2,448-mile highway that linked Chicago and Los Angeles.
"Japanese, Germans, Norwegians, Swedes, Italians -- the list just goes on and on," said Angel Delgadillo, a barber for 41 years in Seligman, Ariz., which sits along a 160-mile uninterrupted stretch of the famed highway. "The number of tour buses that get off Interstate 40 to come to Seligman is awesome. They say they're looking for America."
Overseas visitors are even showing up at the Tulsa home of Michael Wallis, the author of "Route 66: The Mother Road" (St. Martin's Press, 1990), a nostalgic look at the highway, wanting to know more about the highway that has gripped their imagination.
"I don't know how they know where I live," Mr. Wallis said, "but almost every week foreigners show up at the door -- British, Germans, Japanese and French. Ten days ago a young couple from London, both of them in banking, showed up on their way from Chicago to L.A."
Although states like California and New York are still far ahead in absolute numbers of overseas visitors, smaller states are using aggressive promotional campaigns to make big gains. "Until about three and a half years ago we didn't even think of our state as being a potential destination for foreign tourists," said David K. Reynolds, administrator of Iowa's Division of Tourism. "But we've had a 175 percent increase in foreign visitors from 1988 to 1990. And a few weeks ago we had seven tour operators from Brazil and Argentina."
 
Behind Big Percentage
 The main reason for such high percentage growth, of course, is that most of those states had few overseas visitors until recent years, and even now lag light-years behind the states with the most overseas visitors. Kansas, for example, had only 119,000 overseas visitors last year and Utah only 267,000, compared with California's 4.8 million and New York's 4.5 million.
After Kansas, the states with the largest increases from 1985 to 1990 were Nevada, with 159 percent, and Nebraska and Kentucky, with 135 percent each. In Kentucky, the thoroughbred horse farms are the big attraction for foreigners.
But the numbers are certain to change significantly, experts say, as foreigners continue to seek new experiences and as most states -- realizing the economic impact of foreign tourism -- pour more money and effort into promoting themselves individually or through the many regional tourism association that have cropped up.
For much is at stake: 38.8 million foreigners, including almost 17.3 million Canadians and 6.8 million Mexicans, spent $52.8 billion in the United States last year, including fares on American airlines, according to preliminary figures of the United States Travel and Tourism Administration, a unit of the Commerce Department. Of the foreign visitors, 14.8 million came from overseas and accounted for the biggest percentage growth of foreign visitors to mid-America.
All of the foreign visitors spent $5.2 billion more in the United States than did the 43.6 million American who traveled oversease last year.
One city that has done particularly well is Cody, Wyo., which had almost 20,000 visitors this summer from Taiwan alone. Cody, a city of about 7,500, is a gateway to Yellowstone National Park, and it has dude ranches, a rodeo every night from June through August and has museums devoted to Buffalo Bill, the Plains Indians, Western art and Winchester firearms.
 
Cody Reaches Out
 But more than that, it has reached overseas to sell its attractions. About five years ago a small delegation from Cody flew to Taipei, to meet with travel operators. "We convinced them there was lots to do here," said Judith Blair, the marketing director of two hotels in Cody. Altogether, she said, Taiwanese, Britishers, Germans and other foreign tourists account for about 400 of the 1,200 tour buses that stay at the Blair Hotels.
Other regions have gained, too. Stan Fisher, the president of Allied Tours in New York, said his company has handled about 150,000 tourists from Europe this year, 10 times that of a decade ago, and his most popular tours include trips to New England to see the fall foliage. "We have so many people wanting to go to New England this month," Mr. Fisher said, "that we don't have room for them."
Similarly, Jerry DiPietro, the president of Tourco Inc. in Hyannis, Mass., said that the tour most popular with his 5,000 European clients is 14 days in New England.
The most passionate overseas visitors, by most accounts, are those who are enamored of cowbows and Indians. "The Japanese and Germans who come here are absolutely bowled over by the Wild West," said Todd Kirshenbaum, deputy director of the Nebraska Tourism Office. "Anything with rodeo, cowboys and ranches, they just go nuts over."
That opinion was seconded by Greg Gilstrap, the director of travel and tourism for Kansas. "There's strong interest in cowboys, Indians and the Old West," he said, "and Kansas is lucky enough to have a lot of the things that foreign visitors are looking for."
 
Skiing Attracts Japanese
 Last year, 3.1 million Japanese visited the United States, the most from any country overseas, with 2.2 million coming from Britain and 1.2 million from Germany. While most Japanese continue to travel in groups, many are now striking out on their own.
Mitsuko Kennair of Hotard Coaches in New Orleans, said her Japanese clients are taking Mississippi cruises, visiting plantations, journeying to see alligators and even flying from Tokyo just to attend the jazz festival held each spring. "Almost all of them are repeat tourists, looking for different destinations," she said.
Jan Arai, co-owner of J. D. Cook tour company in Seattle, said many of her repeat Japanese clients are striking out on their own or with family members. "A lot are trying to test their mettle by renting R.V.'s," she said.
Arizona alone earned $56 million last year from Japanese tourists, many of whom came to visit the Grand Canyon, but others stayed at dude ranches or visited its many Indian reservations.
It will be a long time before most foreign visitors feel at home in the American heartland, according to John Sem, who heads the Tourism Center at the University of Minnesota.
But officials in both the private and public sector agree that tourism to the interior will continue experiencing record growth, now that the ice has been broken and now that cities and states are belatedly aware of its economic importance.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
For Democratic Hopefuls, Race Turns to a Sprint

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
If the marathon was the metaphor for the Presidential campaigns of the 1980's, the 50-yard dash might be the most appropriate comparison for the Democrats of 1992.
In the four months between now and the New Hampshire primary, this campaign will be a sprint for money, organization, name recognition and support. 
 Forget about the long months of campaigning in Iowa, the first caucus state. With time so short and with Senator Tom Harkin, a native son, in the race, along with neighboring son Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, none of the other candidates are expected to mount the kind of expensive, all-out campaign for the Feb. 10 caucuses that were de rigeur in 1988 and 1984.
 
Trying to Attract a Crowd
 "It's becoming more and more clear that nobody's coming to Iowa," said Joe Shanahan, spokesman for the Iowa Democratic Party, which recently moved back its scheduled Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner to try to increase turnout -- by the candidates.
Instead of the so-called Iowa bounce, which helped produce Jimmy Carter as the Democratic nominee in 1976, the candidates in 1992 will be looking for a New Hampshire jumpstart. It is no accident that most of the candidates have descended on that state, which holds the first primary on Feb. 18.
 
The Big Democratic Test
 "New Hampshire is absolutely the key," said Thomas E. Donilon, a lawyer and longtime Democratic strategist. "Because they're starting so late, and with Iowa less important, New Hampshire will be the first point in the process where we have concrete winners and losers."
In fact, this may be the first Presidential campaign in years in which the voters do most of the work in sorting out the field. By this time four years ago, the race for the Democratic nomination had already lost its front-runner, Gary Hart, to accusations of womanizing, and a rising star, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., to allegations of plagiarism. Debates and polls and handicapping journalists had created a series of hot candidates and troubled campaigns long before the voting began.
There is no time for a complicated early campaign this year, thanks to the war in the Persian Gulf, the general troubles in the Democratic Party and all the other factors that froze Presidential politics for months and ultimately produced a little known and closely packed Democratic field.
 
Front-Runner Is Lacking
 Four of the five major candidates for the Democratic nomination have entered the race within the past month; a sixth, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, will officially join them on Monday.
There is no obvious front-runner, unless Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York jumps in, a possibility that would utterly remake the race and has kept the party in high suspense in recent days. Another wild card is the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who is still considering whether to run. Most of the current candidates are still in the earliest stages of strategy, fund raising and organization.
Consider their fund raising: Four years ago, when Michael S. Dukakis filed his Sept. 30 report with the Federal Election Commission, he had raised $8.1 million, while Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri had raised $3.5 million.
Last week, when the same reports were filed, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas had raised $201,319; Senator Kerrey had raised $223,720; Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia had raised nearly $220,000; Senator Harkin had raised $713,857, and former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, who entered the race in April, had raised $767,010.
A combination of the late start, the recession, the aura of President Bush's invincibility and the always-grueling mechanics will make fund raising particularly demanding for the candidates over the next few months. "That's a large part of what's driving our schedule right now," said Lorraine Voles, a spokeswoman for Mr. Harkin.
Nathan Landow, the chairman of the Maryland Democratic Party and an influential fund-raiser, said, "From now until Jan. 1, most of their time has to be spent raising money to get through New Hampshire and hopefully have a little nest egg for Super Tuesday." Adding to the worries over money is the possibility that Federal matching money could dry up, temporarily, in February and March.
The campaigns are just beginning to jockey for strategic position; so far, they have been remarkably gentle to one another. As they head toward November, when a series of candidate forums and debates begin, one of the earliest rivalries to emerge is between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kerrey, both of whom present themselves as new generation centrist Democrats.
For example:
"Bill Clinton has a reason and a rationale and a clear message that connects with middle-class voters," said Frank Greer, Mr. Clinton's media consultant. "I don't believe Bob Kerrey has a rationale or has figured out what his message is."
Bill Hoppner, Mr. Kerrey's campaign chairman, counters, "The question is, is there substance in the claim for substance?" He argues that Mr. Kerrey's health care proposals are far more detailed than Mr. Clinton's.
 
Clinton in Polished Campaign
 At this point, Mr. Clinton, who traveled the country for the past year as chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council, a group of centrist and conservative Democrats, has the more developed message and the more disciplined and polished campaign style.
But Mr. Kerrey, who began moving toward a campaign only in late summer, has a compelling life story (Congressional Medal of Honor in Vietnam, a long recovery from the loss of a leg, a meteoric political career and a romance with the actress Debra Winger) and a raw political appeal that, in the view of many Democrats, could make him take off.
Mr. Kerrey will also be a player in Iowa, whether he likes it or not; because he comes from a neighboring state, he is almost forced to compete in Iowa, or risk the high political sin of doing worse than expected in his own backyard. It is not clear, however, how much a second-place finish in those caucuses would mean to Mr. Kerrey as the campaign moves into New Hampshire.
Mr. Clinton may have less to worry about in the expectations game, since the first contest is so far from his home, but he does have to rack up some early successes, somewhere, or risk the fate that befell his fellow Southerner, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, in 1988. Mr. Gore did well on the Super Tuesday primaries in the South but never broke out of his region.
 
Liberal Standard-Bearer
 Mr. Harkin, meanwhile, has staked out a clear market position in his party, as a proud standard-bearer for traditional liberals. Some centrist Democrats have already begun to worry that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kerrey could carve up the middle ground and leave an opening for Mr. Harkin to scoot up the field -- just as Mr. Carter did against a field of liberals in 1976.
There are many other variables. Some Democrats warn that Mr. Brown, with his angry anti-politics-as-usual message, should not be discounted in a year when the voters may not feel kindly toward Washington. Mr. Wilder could give Mr. Clinton problems in the South. Mr. Tsongas is always on the lookout for an opening. Any of these candidates could decide to wage a late guerrilla campaign in Iowa to generate a little pre-New Hampshire momentum.
In general, most of these campaigns are so young, and the candidates so unaccustomed to the white heat of a Presidential election, that any number of stumbles are possible. At the same time, someone could get very hot and wrap up the nomination early, something that many Democrats devoutly wish. The shortage of money could be a powerful factor in forcing an early decision.
Still, the latest round of tinkering with the Democratic nominating rules has created a system of strict proportional representation that, in a multi-candidate field without a clear front-runner, could produce a lengthy process, once the voting begins.

Why the Thomas Hearings Were a Sometime Thing on TV

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
At about 7:45 on the first night of the explosive testimony at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings into sexual harassment allegations against the Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, Dan Rather, the CBS anchor, announced that his network's coverage was going off the air, even though Judge Thomas had yet to testify. CBS, Mr. Rather said, had to satisfy its contractual obligations to carry a major league baseball playoff game.
Then Mr. Rather said something extraordinary: "Of course, the hearings can be seen on other stations." 
 The statement, formulated by CBS management, captured two aspects of what Howard Stringer, president of the CBS Broadcast Group, called "the changed nature of the network business."
In the new reality of news coverage by the big three networks, the newsworthiness of an event is only one consideration when a decision is made about when to pre-empt other programs; and everybody knows that news viewers can go elsewhere when a network decides it can't pre-empt its entertainment shows for news.
Many hours of the hearings were covered live, but for the most part the network coverage -- after the initial day when Judge Thomas and his accuser, Anita F. Hill, both testified -- fell into a pattern that is likely to become more and more the standard:
When a network's regularly scheduled program was deemed expendable, the hearings were broadcast live; when the network had something scheduled that it felt it could not afford to pre-empt, like baseball or an expensive mini-series, the hearings went off the air.
While this practice has always been followed to an extent, executives at each network agreed the pressure to consider the increasingly precarious financial position of the networks has made the decision to pre-empt much more difficult.
"Making the decision has never been more complicated, or more agonizing," Mr. Stringer said. "That weekend strikes at the heart of what we all stood for in the past."
 
Hit Shows vVs. News
 CBS, which covered the fewest hours of the hearings live, carried baseball Friday night, Saturday afternoon and Sunday night, as well as a National Football League game on Sunday afternoon, during the hearings.
ABC pre-empted part of a college football game Saturday to cover some of the testimony but returned to the game in the fourth quarter. On Sunday, ABC took advantage of being the only network not covering football by carrying six hours of the hearings. But ABC then broke away in favor of its prime-time schedule, including such hits as "America's Funniest Home Videos."
That decision created an impression of some imbalance because ABC had given live coverage to many hours of testimony from witnesses backing up Professor Hill and then went off for "Home Videos" before witnesses supporting Judge Thomas appeared. (ABC broadcast two more hours of pro-Thomas testimony after midnight.)
NBC carried a Notre Dame football game Saturday and the N.F.L. Sunday. It also stuck to its entertainment schedule for much of Sunday night, including the first part of a mini-series about the life of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. But on Tuesday, NBC was the only network to cover in full the Senate's debate before its 52-48 vote to confirm Judge Thomas.
That decision was viewed skeptically by news executives at each of the other networks who noted that NBC had the weakest daytime schedule and could best afford to carry the debate. NBC's ratings for the debate were up 65 percent over its usual daytime lineup.
The ratings for the television channels covering the hearings live in their entirety were also up. CNN and C-SPAN on cable and PBS all saw their audiences soar when they were supplying something the networks chose not to broadcast.
What was down most significantly for each of the networks was revenues. One network estimated that the three networks combined lost commercials worth $15 million to $20 million while covering the hearings.
Mr. Stringer said thin profit margins affected decisions. "We're all getting closer to break-even than we ever dreamed," he said.
A senior ABC News executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said ABC's news division had full support from its corporate management to make calls on pre-emptions. "If we had junk on, of course we're more likely to go live," the executive said. "It does boil down to agony sometimes. But the pressure is self-imposed. There's just no way you can't be conscious of the financial issues. We all know what it cost to cover the gulf war, on top of a recession."
Both the ABC executive and Don Browne, executive vice president of NBC News, said they believed that their networks had at least carried enough of the hearings so that viewers could feel fully informed even if they watched only that channel.
Asked the same question, Mr. Stringer said, "If people only watched CBS, they didn't get enough." He added, "It's a fair question to ask whether we are breaking a bond with the viewer who has come to expect something from us in terms of commitment. But the financial pressure has never been so acute. We'll make some brave decisions, but not enough to please those who hold up a mirror to our past. It's impossible to duplicate days gone by when we're fighting for our life."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
As Candidates Hunt the Big Issue, Polls Can Give Them a Few Clues

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. KAGAY

 BODY:
As the 1992 Presidential candidates seek ways to harness their political fortunes to compelling issues, it is useful for them -- and for more neutral observers -- to pause and ask: What problems and issues are on the public's mind?
Since George Gallup began asking the question in 1935, many poll takers have relied on a standard question to gauge such public sentiment: "What do you think is the most important problem facing this country today?" 
 Researchers pore over years of responses, looking for patterns and portents. Sometimes the answers are obvious; occasionally they yield a campaign theme.
For example, in a New York Times/CBS News Poll taken earlier this month, twice as many called "unemployment" the chief problem as had done so in August. A bill extending unemployment benefits, passed by Congress but vetoed by President Bush, has been one effort by Democrats to capitalize on this rising concern.
Diverse forces influence the public's agenda at any given moment.
Many of the problems cited by respondents are perennials. Since 1935, Gallup's results have been dominated about equally by two recurrent mega-themes: war and peace, and unemployment and inflation.
When answers like "the economy," "unemployment," "recession," and "inflation" are combined, 39 percent of the respondents in the Times/CBS News Poll this month said the country's economic situation is the most pressing problem.
But long-term shifts are discernible. Mentions of "nuclear war" have declined. And dramatic events have an impact. Terrorism was briefly a "worst problem" in 1986.
Some topics are nascent, lurking in the background, needing only a news event to push them to the fore: race relations, toxic waste, the savings and loan crisis.
Interestingly enough, issues that some advocates treat as "litmus tests" of candidates are hardly ever nominated by ordinary voters. Abortion, for example, is mentioned by just 1 percent in this month's poll.
Some other topics are "non-issues" that never have a chance. Nationalization of heavy industry is unlikely to ever be an issue, no matter how hotly it may be debated in other countries.
Of course, the people's agenda can simply feed back to pollsters what the public has already absorbed from its leaders or from television and newspapers. An extraordinary example occurred in 1989 over drugs.
During 1988 and the first half of 1989, as crack spread and as news story after news story appeared, illegal drugs were routinely cited by around 15 percent as the country's most important problem.
But in September 1989, when President Bush devoted his first prime-time television address to the subject and declared his war on drugs, the topic soared to a spectacular 64 percent in a Times/CBS News Poll.
 
The Rise of Health Care

 
 Over the following year -- although drug smuggling and drug use were apparently undiminished -- the topic dropped to about 10 percent, as the economy and the Persian Gulf claimed more attention and the White House turned to new priorities.
But the No. 1 problem is not the only one that politicians and poll takers keep an eye on. Shifts in less frequently mentioned concerns can serve as an early warning system.
Health care, for example, has recently moved onto the radar screen.
In a half dozen Times/CBS News Polls over the past year health care moved from no mention at all to 1 percent, then 2 percent, then 3, and then 5 percent in August. That put it -- with the deficit, education, homelessness and poverty -- among a handful of problems just behind the mega-problems mentioned in the polls.
It dipped a couple of percentage points in the latest poll as references to unemployment, which increased from 11 to 20 percent, drew attention away. But health care may now have crossed a threshold.
Turning a problem into an issue takes leadership -- to define terms of debate and to frame solutions that can rally support. Whether any 1992 Presidential candidate can do that depends on many factors including, from a politician's point of view, the electoral profit or loss to be had from pinning one's fate to an issue.
 
Market Tests
 It is difficult to tell in advance what approach will work. Probing such potentials is one job private poll takers do -- market testing issues and messages, as it were.
For example, Mr. Bush's pollster, Robert Teeter, is credited with organizing the focus groups in Paramus, N.J., that in spring 1988 first revealed the power of flags and prison furloughs as issues. When a focus group composed of swing voters -- ones who voted for Ronald Reagan in 1984 but were leaning to Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts in 1988 -- were told about Mr. Dukakis's veto of a mandatory pledge-of-allegiance bill and his defense of a prisoner furlough program that gave passes even to murderers ineligible for parole, about half switched. Mr. Bush's top planners, who watched the focus group discussion through a one-way mirror, immediately saw that they were on to something.
In recent years, consultants have advised many politicians to emphasize themes of consensus, showing that they share voters' values, rather than to risk identification with potentially divisive solutions to vexing problems. That is one reason the flag and Willie Horton were used as they were in 1988.
Appeals by leaders can certainly succeed in placing important new problems on the public's agenda; Teddy Roosevelt once called the Presidency a "bully pulpit" for just that purpose. And demagoguery or flim-flam can be temporarily distracting. But a glance at the list of "most important problems" over the decades suggests that the people's priorities ultimately derive from real-world worries.
Ultimately, it profits any would-be leader to heed such concerns.
Some of the Democratic candidates have been sounding a theme of "less attention abroad, more on problems here at home" that resonates with today's mood. And the Bush Administration is reported to be readying initiatives to help the economy in order to bolster Mr. Bush's domestic credentials.

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
Integration Without Violence

BYLINE: By E. R. SHIPP

 BODY:
Incidents of bigotry in New York City, from taunts to assaults, are now so frequent that confrontations seem almost inevitable as the city's racial mix shifts and whites adjust to being the new minority.
Two Brooklyn neighborhoods imploded this summer. In Canarsie, a real estate office that showed homes to blacks was firebombed three times, a Pakistani-owned supermarket was burned out twice and several people were beaten. In Crown Heights, riots broke out after a black child was struck and killed by a Hasidic man driving in a rabbi's motorcade. In both areas, rapid shifts in ethnicity contributed to the climate of violence. 
 In Canarsie, where the white population has declined from about 90 percent to 75 percent since 1980, many whites say they fear their neighborhood will be turned into East New York, a nightmare of drug-related killings and random shootings.
"A lot of people fled from where they were living when those neighborhoods became integrated and came to Canarsie for safety," said Benjamin DuBose, a former police officer who is president of the Canarsie Historical Society. "They are feeling that the same thing could happen again."
In Crown Heights, where 85 percent of the population is black or Hispanic and many are of Caribbean descent, black homeowners are angry that Hasidic Jews are aggressively trying to buy them out.
"When we talk about the youth throwing stones, even some of the middle-class Caribbean-Americans would be cheering them on because of the resentment that is there," observed Karl Rodney, publisher of the weekly Carib News. "And it is not a resentment because they are Jews. It is a resentment because of their persistence in trying to run them out of Crown Heights."
Canarsie and Crown Heights are frightening, but hardly unique. Ethnic clashes are taking place in many American neighborhoods. Experts in urban demography say confrontations can sometimes be headed off when cities recognize a growing problem. But the unfortunate truth, said Gary Orfield, a Harvard University political scientist, is that few cities have a plan for making racial diversity more palatable.
Experts cite a few examples where peaceful change was achieved, and neighborhoods did not deteriorate, and say there is a common thread: the successes were relatively middle-class areas. Oak Park, Ill., is synonymous with planned integration. Other models are the Hyde Park-Kenwood section of Chicago, Shaker Heights and Cleveland Heights in Ohio, Teaneck, N.J., Bloomfield, Conn., and Starrett City in Brooklyn.
"Integration is working best in communities with high education levels, partly because people can rationally talk it through there," Professor Orfield said. Friction occurs where working class whites are displaced and feel threatened.
For integration to work, someone or some institution must take the lead in attracting a racially-mixed group of residents, calming fears, quashing rumors and helping people see the things they have in common. These leaders try to convince residents that their property values need not drop. Often, if a university or hospital is the catalyst, the institutions provide their own security forces to heighten the sense of safety. They might also purchase housing and encourage employees to live nearby. And, using their political and economic clout, they insist that housing codes are enforced, municipal services are delivered and financial institutions continue to grant mortgages. Often, when such measures are undertaken, the homeowners themselves end up uniting against real estate agencies trying to blockbust.
In some areas, including Shaker Heights and other Cleveland suburbs, village governments took the lead in attracting nonwhite residents and assuring that mortgages are available. And, in an experiment that is being closely followed by government officials and social scientists, officials in Florida's Palm Beach County are trying to integrate 37 communities by getting developers to make housing more affordable and by advertising.
In some New York neighborhoods, leaders have emerged. In Washington Heights, local officials and Yeshiva University worked together to ease tensions when Dominicans began displacing Jews.
In others, the city's Human Rights Commission, with 67 employees and a $3 million budget for community relations, has stepped in. It has been working in areas suffering from what Dennis deLeon, its director, calls "diversity stress." They include Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, Corona, Flushing, Richmond Hill and Ozone Park in Queens; Flatbush, Windsor Park and East New York in Brooklyn; and Pelham, Kingsbridge-Fordham Road and Soundview and Parkchester in the Bronx. Teams from the agency work with neighborhood groups, hand out fliers and try to get block associations to meet together on neutral territory. Then they try to point out the issues that neighbors of different races have in common and build coalitions to address concrete problems like sanitation services or gentrification rather than "vague issues like getting along with each other," Mr. deLeon said.
In Crown Heights, Mayor David N. Dinkins tried another tactic. Borrowing a phrase from the final message of "Boyz N the Hood," a summer movie about gang violence, he repeatedly urged youths to "increase the peace." Last month, he called for 1,000 youth to volunteer for an "Increase the Peace Corps" to help the commission.

HEADLINE: A Missing Olive Branch

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MADRID, Oct. 19

 BODY:
With an Arab-Israeli peace conference now virtually certain to take place, what are the prospects that it will actually produce something?
American, Arab and Israeli diplomats are not hiding the fact that they really have no answer to that question. Their attention has been so focused on the exhausting effort to organize the conference that little original or in-depth thought has been given to what can realistically be achieved once the parties get to the table. 
 Few diplomats doubt that when the conference opens here on Oct. 30, it will appear at first blush to be a breakthrough to a dead end. Syria, Jordan, the Palestinians and Lebanon are expected to demand territory occupied by Israel. Israel will decline. The Arabs will call for American pressure on Israel. Israel will say this is not what the conference was supposed to be about, and the whole enterprise will explode in a cacophony of conflicting demands and finger-pointing.
 
A One-Act Play?
 So Act One is already written. The question, American officials say, is whether there can be an Act Two.
"One should not predict the demise of this conference too quickly," said Stephen P. Cohen of the Montreal-based Center for Middle East Peace. "The same combination of international pressures which forced the parties to the table in the first place will apply to keeping them there after it starts. It is not going to be easy for anybody to just walk away."
In seeking to organize the conference, the United States was initially driven by President Bush's desire to prove that the Persian Gulf war could produce something beyond the destruction of half of the Iraqi Army and the restoration of the Kuwaiti monarchy, American officials say.
The peace conference, which Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d discussed with Spanish officials today on a stop here on his way home from the Middle East, has been arranged totally at the initiative of Washington, and not through the efforts of the Middle East parties themselves.
After nearly eight months, the United States appears to have succeeded in persuading Arabs and Israelis to come to the table by manipulating pressures on the participants that grew out of the end of the cold war and the end of the gulf war.
The splintering of the Soviet Union left Syria an orphan, desperately interested in a new relationship with Washington and ready to pay for it by agreeing to direct talks with Israel.
 
Pressures on Israel
 An influx of Soviet Jewish emigres left Israel so strapped for cash to take care of them that it could not afford to spurn the Bush Administration's demand for a peace conference. The Iraqi missile attacks on Israeli cities during the gulf war drove home to Israelis as never before the need to end the regional conflict.
Jordan and the Palestinians were left economically impoverished and diplomatically isolated by their support for Iraq in the gulf war. When the Bush Administration offered them a parole on the condition that they attend the conference on the United States' terms, they seized the opportunity.
Adding to the pressures were the end of the cold war and the new relationship between President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union, who are expected to meet in Madrid before the conference convenes. The new cooperation between Moscow and Washington in the gulf war also gave Mr. Baker unparalleled tools for diplomatic maneuvering in the Middle East.
The Soviet Union, for instance, was ready to squeeze the Syrians and Palestinians on Washington's behalf and to restore relations with Israel to promote the conference. The Saudis, who were beholden to Washington for the American role in the gulf war, used their influence with Damascus.
Such tools can build a conference. Can they build peace agreements?
Neither Lebanon nor Syria, nor Jordan or the Palestinians, is approaching the talks with the philosophy that inspired President Anwar Sadat of Egypt to make peace with Israel in the late 1970's. That philosophy was based first on a gesture of complete reconciliation -- which in Mr. Sadat's case meant coming to Jerusalem -- and then an offer of full security guarantees in return for an Israeli withdrawal from all lands occupied in the 1967 war.
 
The Least Contact Possible
 As the Arab parties approach this conference, they are hoping rather for the least direct contact possible with Israel and the maximum international pressure on Israel. As the state-run Syrian newspaper Tishr said in an editorial last week, "The peace process has entered a decisive stage and the countdown to attend the conference has been launched, both of which require a stern U.S. position to pressure Israel to respond to the calls for peace."
The trick for the United States, which sooner or later will have to play the mediator, will be to produce movement toward peace among Middle Eastern leaders who are not interested in real reconciliation at this initial stage. What forced Israel to return all of the Sinai to Egypt was the popular will of the Israeli people, a response to Mr. Sadat's overture. That popular will is not to be found anywhere today.
There has been nothing to foster such a spirit. The diplomacy leading up to the peace conference has been a sterile exercise in closed-door deal involving no more than a few dozen people at most in any country. No Arab or Israeli leader has prepared his people for a historic transformation in relations. But without such a change in attitudes, no peace will be possible.
American and Israeli officials are beginning to consider small, interim accords that might begin to change the atmosphere on each front, and ultimately generate popular pressure on reuctant leaderships for more sweeping and durable arrangements.
American officials seem to believe that Israel's separate talks with each party at the conference will quickly stall, and that this will give them an opening to offer compromise proposals to bridge the gaps.
On the Palestinian front, as Mr. Baker hinted Friday, Washington is already considering proposing that Israel suspend its settlement-building activity in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in return for an end to the Arab boycott of Israel and a suspension of the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories. So far, Israel has not shown much interest in such a deal.
When the Israelis and Palestinians do begin their direct talks, they will concentrate initially on a five-year transition toward Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, according to the conference invitation. But the two parties have been down this road before, at the autonomy talks at Camp David.
Those talks broke down in 1982 over three fundamental questions, and those have not changed: who will control the land, who will control the water and who will have the ultimate authority?
There are three water tables in the West Bank, and Israel takes 75 percent of that water for its citizens. Finding a plan for Israeli-Palestinian water control will take considerable imagination. The same is true of the land issue. The only potential growth for Jewish and Arab towns in the West Bank lies in open land, and 70 percent of it is under Israeli control.
Israel has a list of about 25 areas of administration -- including garbage collection, local police authority, traffic and education -- which it would be willing to cede to Palestinians during a period of self-rule. The Palestinians say those are wholly insufficient.
The Lebanese refuse even to discuss legitimizing what the Israelis call their security zone in southern Lebanon, insisting that Israel must simply pull out. Israeli officials say that, given the weakness of the Beirut Government, they see no alternative to maintaining the zone as it now exists.
The impasse between Syria and Israel will be the hardest to bridge, American officials say. The disengagement agreements that Henry Kissinger brokered as Secretary of State in the mid-1970's have less appeal today; the Syrians are not interested in any partial solutions unless they are guaranteed at the start that they will get all their land back.
The Israelis feel that they have little room for a phased pullback without retreating completely from the Golan Heights, something that no Israeli politician is prepared to do now. Many Israeli and American experts say a solution will have to be forged in which Israel would accept the notion of Syrian sovereignty over the Golan Heights in principle, without an actual Israeli military withdrawal anytime soon.
Some experts might argue that there is no harm in exploring any of these alternatives, even if the conference fails. But that is not necessarily true. The fact is that a balance of power has evolved naturally on Israel's fronts with Syria, Jordan and Lebanon since 1973. It is not peace and it is not gentle, especially for the Palestinians, but it isn't war, either.
When President Bush went to war in the Persian Gulf, it was not to establish "real peace." It was to restore the balance of power there, and that even meant letting President Saddam Hussein stay in power in Iraq, because to topple him would have upset the balance.
 
Risk of Upsetting the Balance
 By pressing now for "real peace" in the Arab-Israeli theater, instead of relying simply on the power balances that have developed there, the United States runs the risk that all the parties will take steps and make statements that will be destabilizing rather than stabilizing.
This could involve anything from terrorist attacks by radicals frightened by the prospect of a deal, to new settlement-building by Jews wary of a land giveaway, to the fall of governments. Some of these events will inevitably accompany the peace process. The question is whether it will overwhelm the rickety, brutal, but stable balances of power that already exist, or rather consolidate them.

Power In Europe

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
France and Germany presented their allies with an unexpected and intriguing proposition last week. Either it means something, or nothing. Whichever, it will have far-reaching repercussions for the future of NATO, West European unity and America's voice in Europe.
The French-German idea is to enlarge their existing joint military brigade as a step toward creating a separate West European army. They propose to house this force under an energized Western European Union, comprised of 9 members of the 12-member European Community. Most importantly, the Western European Union would report to the E.C. and not to NATO, where American power holds sway. 
 If this diplomatic verbiage is real, it would boost efforts for a united Western Europe with a common foreign and defense policy -- and would be the beginning of a premature end for NATO. If this is the usual European security blather, NATO and the U.S. will continue to lead in Europe -- and full West European integration, including defense, will be put off further into the future.
Faceless institutions are boring. But NATO, like many, represents the most profound power. Which is why President Mitterrand of France, Chancellor Kohl of Germany and President Bush have told their diplomats to wink at the French-German initiative and avoid frontal assaults -- for now.
Paris, as always, wants to reduce American influence in Europe. Bonn does not; but as Germans push for West European unity, it will have the effect desired by the French. In any event, both insist that their initiative is fully in keeping with agreed NATO declarations on developing a European security identity.
More, both say it is essential for West European integration. They argue that they cannot reach complete economic unity without political unity, and that political unity requires an independent European defense posture. Besides, both see an inevitable decreasing American presence in Europe with the passing of the cold war and therefore less of a security role for NATO as well.
The U.S. has always supported the drive toward West European unity, but maintains that it can and must proceed without any diminution in NATO's role and authority. Washington says NATO policy calls for a West European military identity midway between NATO and the European Community, not one attached to Europe alone. Otherwise, U.S. power will be diminished in Europe far too soon, something no one wants -- not West or East Europeans, not Soviet republics, not anyone save Paris.
Bush Administration officials believe France is isolated. They also expect the Germans, as is their pattern, to start backpedaling on the military proposal as soon as they see the reaction on the continent. Meantime, the Administration knows it can count on the British to slash away at the French-German proposal, so no need to haul out American guns. No one is more devoted to NATO and the U.S. than London, and no one less eager for full West European unity.
Stripping aside the diplomatic niceties, the issue comes down to this: The French and some Germans believe a uniting West Europe must establish a stronger security identity -- even at the expense of NATO and the U.S. The U.S. believes it is essential to preserve a dominant role for NATO and the U.S. until Europe is genuinely prepared to step in -- even with risks for West European unity.
Washington has the much stronger case, for reasons the French and others prefer to ignore.
Europe is not ready for a diminished NATO. Despite its rhetoric, France will not abandon its independent military identity. Tellingly, Europeans could not get their act together to stop the fighting in Yugoslavia. Most importantly, everyone fears a power vacuum that can be filled only by Germany, however reluctant Germans may be.
And when all the dust settles in the East, the Soviet Union or Russia or several of the largest republics will still have significant military power. Even if all turn out to be benign, Europe will not wish to rely on their good will.
For Soviet republics, for Germans and for all, NATO remains the only group on the horizon that can keep the door closed to renewed militarism and saber-rattling. Only with a strong NATO can Europeans and Americans have the quiet to concentrate on solving their other growing woes.

Conflict Escalates Over Organization Devoted to Racism

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS

 BODY:
Weeks of oral clashes between supporters of a white student union and demonstrators escalated into a brawl involving about 30 people Thursday at the University of Minnesota, while the union's founder was giving an on-campus radio interview, the campus police said.
No one was arrested, but at least three people were injured in the fight, in which tear gas was used by some of the brawlers. Two were treated for head injuries, the campus police said. 
 The fight was the latest confrontation between the union, whose founder, Thomas A. David, a Minneapolis senior majoring in ancient history, has publicly supported racial separatism, and its critics, who consider the group racist, fascist and white supremacist.
Hecklers all but drowned out Mr. David as he spoke at an Oct. 14 campus forum on white supremacy and five days earlier at least 500 university students gathered on campus to condemn the recently formed union.
Conflict began after a controversial Sept. 25 opinions piece by Mr. David, was published in the university's student newspaper, The Minnesota Daily.
Mr. David called for a separation of the races in the United States and wrote that immigrants "come here to suck the blood of hard-working White people, who are forced to pay higher taxes to support these third worlders."
 
'You Don't Feel Safe'
 The essay and Mr. David's thrice-weekly recruiting notices placed as classified ads in the paper have struck a nerve of fear in the minority communities on campus, said several coalition members.
"As an Asian here, you don't feel safe anymore," said Chanthala Insisiengnay, a Minneapolis sophomore in studio arts and a member of the Lao Student Association. "The environment is hostile. We contribute to the economy too. We pay taxes. We work."
In an interview last week, Mr. David said the mission of his organization, which he says has about 10 members and is not registered as a university student group, is to promote the white culture and fight affirmative action and quotas on campus.
"I have no desire to harm the nonwhite races," Mr. David said, "I simply think it would help everyone to separate." That extends to interracial dating and marriage, he said, adding, "I don't want to be a mud race in this country, and I will fight to the death against that."
The university has taken no official stance on the White Student Union, said Marvalene S. Hughes, vice president for student affairs. "To the extent that we can protect First Amendment rights to one group, we will protect the First Amendment rights to all groups," Mrs. Hughes said.
But the university president, Nils Hasselmo, speaking at a Board of Regents meeting on Oct. 11, called on the university community to join continuing efforts to combat racism.

'Need-Blind' Policy On Admissions Is Reconsidered

DATELINE: AMHERST, Mass.

 BODY:
The president of Amherst College, Peter R. Pouncey, and Jane E. Reynolds, dean of admissions, met last week with about 100 students, faculty members and administrators to discuss changing the college's admission and financial aid policies because of budget deficits.
The college officials said they were responding to growing campus concern over the future of "need-blind" admissions and the way financial aid policy decisions are made. Under the need-blind policy, an applicant is considered for admissions without regard for whether he or she can pay. Those accepted who cannot afford the fees are then given financial aid based on need. 
 President Pouncy said the policy is in jeopardy as a result of the college's efforts to increase cultural and socio-economic diversity in the student body.
"This is a problem we invited," he said. "We made a very determined effort to broaden the base of the school, and students who can't afford Amherst on their family incomes make up 90 percent of America."
 
$21,290 a Year
 The college's comprehensive fee, including tuition, room and board, is currently $21,290 for an academic year. Forty-six percent of Amherst students now receive need-based aid from the college, which will spend $8.5 million in scholarship grants to students this academic year.
Mr. Pouncey outlined two possible alternatives to the need-blind process. Financial aid awards, he said, could be "watered down" so that students would receive less scholarship money, which they do not repay, and be forced to take larger loans.
Or, he said, Amherst could admit students on a need-blind basis until the financial aid runs out. At that point, he said, the admissions staff would begin looking at applicants on the waiting list and admit only those who could pay their own way.
In an interview, Mr. Pouncey said that the college could insure that there would be enough money to cover students on the acceptance list by shortening it. That would lengthen the waiting list and mean that fewer acceptance letters would go out in April.
"Is it conceivable that someone on the wait list would be rejected because he had no money? Yes," Mr. Pouncey said. "And is it also conceivable that someone on the wait list would be accepted because he or she was fee-paying? Yes."
He added that since "all of this is presumably played out honestly and in a forthright manner," people on the waiting list with little demonstrated need could rescind their request for financial aid.
 
Worried About Elitism
 Jorge Armenteros, a junior from San Juan, P.R., majoring in political science, said he worries that either alternative would be the start of a larger movement back "toward a more elitist, white, Anglo-Saxon college." Mr. Armentero said, however, that he favored a policy in which all students on financial aid "share the burden equitably."
By contrast, Megan Carr, a junior in history from Toledo, Ohio, said that changing financial aid packages would be less desirable than using a longer waiting list. But she said, "The concept is kind of disgusting that you can buy your way off the wait list."
Last week's meeting was a response to a request from the Financial Aid Coalition, which comprises 14 different student groups concerned with the future of admissions policies and financial aid at Amherst.
"It's the college's responsibility to both inform students about how these decisions are made and have a dialogue with students," said Anthony E. Wright, a junior in English and sociology from the Bronx and a coalition organizer. "I think that's happening now."
 
Budgetary Problems
 Some students said they saw the meeting as a counterweight to an Oct. 3 meeting between trustees and students, about 150 of whom showed up. Billed as an informal gathering, the meeting became an often-antagonistic discussion in which students accused the administration of failing to inform them about financial aid issues.
Last week, Mr. Pouncey said Amherst must decide on a new financial aid policy by January, when a cap will be placed on what has become a runaway part of the budget; the new policy would effect freshmen entering in 1992. Financial aid increased 32 percent over the last three years, Mr. Pouncey said. By contrast, total expenditures, not including financial aid, rose only 1.7 percent in the same period.
Ms. Reynolds acknowledged that changes in financial aid policies could affect how prospective students perceive Amherst.
"If you are a student from a lower socio-economic background," she said in an interview, "and you're reading articles or have heard through the pipeline that Amherst has changed its financial aid policy and has no resources, you may take yourself out of the competition even before it starts, thinking that Amherst has no money for you." She added, "That is not true and that is a perception we have to guard against."

HEADLINE: HARASSMENT CASES CAN GO UNNOTICED

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Federal law requires companies to have policies prohibiting sexual harassment, but employers that vigorously try to enforce their own rules are few and far between, experts say.
The policies at many companies lack specifics as to what behavior is offensive, or what remedies are available. Some companies train and educate only their top managers, rather than the entire work forces. 
 "It's the unique company that takes it seriously enough to spend time and money to train their work force to let them know about the policy, instead of just tacking it to a bulletin board," said K. C. Wagner, a consultant to businesses on sexual harassment in Oakland, Calif.
The Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Clarence Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court have greatly intensified the debate on this difficult issue.
 
Offensive Behavior Persists
 Even at the companies with the strongest programs, those with long-established policies on sexual harassment and elaborate procedures and strict penalties to deal with it, offensive behavior continues.
It is striking that although such cases often come down to one person's word against another's, many companies with strong programs find that virtually all complaints have merit.
For example, A.T.& T., which has won considerable respect for its policies, says 19 of every 20 complaints received are valid.
And at E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, Edward S. Bardzik, senior consultant for diversity education, said: "Except for where there has been a broken office romance, we get very few, if any, complaints that don't have at least some merit. Most women who come forward are feeling something very uncomfortable in the environment at a minimum and often more than that."
Companies with tough policies on sexual harassment say morale and productivity are both improvong. At the same time, the companies say they are addressing complaints before these develop into litigation.
Why aren't the programs at the tougher companies more successful in eliminating sexual harassment?
The social stigma attached to the subject inhibits discussion, investigation and elimination of the problem, consultants and corporate executives say. Until society in general understands and rejects sexual harassment, corporations will not eradicate it.
Dr. Virginia A. Sadock, director of New York Medical Center's Program in Human Sexuality, referring to the Senate committee's proceedings, said, "As the hearings demonstrate, in general in our society, it is not the behavior of the harasser that has been questioned but that of the victim."
To be sure, women in the work place are rarely subjected to the sort of overt sexual harassment confronted by women miners when they first entered the mines 20 years ago. Like their male colleagues, they were stripped down and slathered in axle grease in a hazing ritual. Unlike the men, they were tied spread-eagled to wooden supports.
But neither is sexual harassment now merely a matter of misinterpreted flirtations or off-color jokes. Nude pinups of women remain in precinct locker rooms and on Wall Street trading floors and more than one female professional can recall a male supervisor who promised advancement and perquisites in exchange for sexual favors.
Some people simply live in the dark ages. When Colleen McMahon, a partner at the New York law firm of Paul Weiss, Rifkin, Wharton & Garrison, began advising a leading investment bank about sexual harassment, she was struck by the difficulty the officer in charge of the program had in convincing bank officers that pictures of naked women festooning the trading desks were inappropriate.
The difficult economic environment is preoccupying many companies these days. Dr. Baila Zeitz, one of the authors of "The Best Companies for Women," a 1988 book that evaluated companies' commitments to halting sexual harassment, said she strongly suspected that fewer companies today were concerned about detailed policies and procedures on sexual harassment.
"Corporations are more concerned about putting out fires now because of the changes in the economy that have occurred since my research in 1986, 1987 and 1988," she said. "They're not concerned with the niceties as much."
She and most other experts on sexual harassment in the work place said one important element of any corporate program is a clear commitment from the most senior levels of management. On Oct. 11, as Anita F. Hill was testifying on the Thomas nomination, A.T.& T.'s chairman and chief executive, Robert E. Allen, sent a message into his employee's computers, reiterating the company's lengthy, very specific policy forbidding sexual harassment and spelling out the penalties -- including "dismissal" and "personal legal and financial liability."
 
Afraid of Discussion
 Consultants say such a response was uncommon even after the hearings. Most executives keep the issue of sexual harassment at arms length, afraid that any discussion will feed the perception that harassment is pervasive.
One of the most highly regarded programs for dealing with sexual harassment is at Du Pont, which provides a telephone hotline that employees can use to report incidents and discuss options for redress anonymously.
About 65,000 of Du Pont's 100,000 American employees have participated in half-day training programs that deal with preventing sexual harassment and discrimination. Since the program began in 1988, the company has handled more cases internally and fewer in the courts.
Du Pont employees are told to report harassment complaints to any supervisor or manager, who is obligated to take prompt action. If an employee's accusations warrant an investigation, the company will interview other employees and the person accused.
In 1986, the Supreme Court clarified its definition of sexual harassment to include subtle forms of intimidation -- lingering, intimate touches, repeated sexual innuendo or comments about aspects of a person's physique -- that can create a "hostile environment."
That ruling gives to victims of sexual harassment a role in establishing boundaries. The less blatantly offensive the behavior is, the more responsibility the recipient has to speak out against it, said Susan L. Webb, a consultant with Pacific Resource Development Group Inc. in Seattle.
"Nobody has to tell their supervisor, 'Please don't tell me stories about bestiality and group rape,' because he should know better," she said. "But telling someone, 'Please don't call me Babe; my name is Susan,' helps clarify your feelings about a situation that might make some uncomfortable."
The courts themselves are beginning to try to illuminate the boundaries around offensive behavior. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, has ruled that any verbal or physical behavior that a "reasonable woman" would regard as offensive is covered by the law. The judge writing the opinion noted, "Conduct that many men consider unobjectionable may offend many women."
Still, many lawyers for plaintiffs and women's groups note that corporate policies against sexual harassment are intended as much to protect the company as to protect victims.
 
Element of Self-Interest
 "While corporations claim to react sensitively and promptly to these sorts of complaints, their sensitivity is often not to the victim," said Mitchell Green of King & Green, the San Francisco law firm that successfully pressed a sexual harassment case against the the Securities and Exchange Commission. "Instead it's a sensitivity to protecting their rear if the employee does go forward with a lawsuit."
Lawyers who advise companies on their sexual harassment policies contend that the element of self-interest insures that companies will take great care to address complaints. "Given the liability that a company can incur if it doesn't protect the secretary who complains that her boss is harassing her, those interests are one and the same," said Ms. McMahon of Paul Weiss.
Some women involved in harassment cases see it differently. One woman executive represented by King & Green has filed a lawsuit in Federal Court in New York against the subsidiary of one of the country's largest banks, charging in part that it failed to address the complaints she filed.
The woman, who insisted on anonymity, said an executive solicited sexual favors, threatening that he would ruin her career if she did not comply.
She decided to report the incident "just to get it on the record," but asked the company not to investigate.
Soon after she filed her report, her career degenerated into a succession of demotions, denied transfers and smaller bonuses. In August 1990, her job was ended.
"My advice to a young woman would be not to come forward," she said. "You will be labeled a troublemaker, you will be persecuted, your career will be ruined."
 
 
AN EXPLICIT POLICY TOWARD HARRASSMENT

 
A.T. & T.'s sexual-harassment policy, considered by experts to be well-written and specific.
 "A.T. & T.'s sexual-harassment policy prohibits sexual harassment in the workplace, whether committed by supervisory or non-supervisory personnel. Specifically, no supervisor shall threaten to insinuate, either explicitly or implicity, that an employee's submission to or rejection of sexual advances will in any way influence any personnel decision regarding that employee's employment, wages, advancement, assigned duties, shifts, or any other condition of employment or career development.
 "Other sexually harassing conduct in the workplace that may create an offensive work environment, whether it be in the form of physical or verbal harassment, and regardless of whether committed by supervisor or non-supervisory personnel, is also prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, repeated offensive or unwelcome sexual flirtations, advances, propositions, continual or repeated verbal abuse of a sexual nature, graphic verbal commentaries about an individual's body; sexually degrading words used to describe an individual; and the display in the workplace of sexually suggestive objects or pictures.
 "Sexual harassment in the workplace by any employee will result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal and may lead to personal legal and financial liability. Employeess are encourage to avail themselves of A.T. & T.'s internal Equal Opportunity complaint procedure if they are confronted with sexual harassment or any prohibited form of harassment. Such internal complaints will be investigated promptly, and corrective action will be taken where allegations are verified. No employee will suffer retaliation or intimidation as a result of using the internal complaint procedure.
 -- Robert E. Allen, chairman

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Sunday about sexual harassment in the workplace misstated the Federal law regarding harassment. Although the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission strongly urges all companies to have policies against sexual harassment, there is no Federal law requiring them.

HEADLINE: Film Maker's Work Is Imbued With Look and Feel of New Jersey

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN

 BODY:
A STAR-CROSSED romance between two teen-agers -- the daughter of a Jewish doctor and the son of an Italian sanitation worker -- who meet in a Trenton high school. A bittersweet reunion of seven 1960's radicals who were on their way to march on the Pentagon when they were arrested in Secaucus. A compassionate look at Shoeless Joe Jackson, one of the eight Chicago White Sox who threw the 1919 World Series and wound up, unrecognized, in the minor leagues in Hoboken.
Movie buffs are bound to get the titles at once -- "Baby, It's You," "Return of the Secaucus Seven," "Eight Men Out" -- and identify the writer and director, John Sayles, whose recently released exploration of contemporary urban blight, "City of Hope," takes place in a hypothetical Hudson City. 
 No matter their actual locations, most of the seven films that bear the imprint of Mr. Sayles, who was been acclaimed as "the godfather of independent film makers in this country," are permeated with the look and feel of New Jersey.
Even though "City of Hope" was shot in Cincinnati ("too expensive and too congested" to do it in New Jersey, according to the film's publicity materials), it is presumed to reflect Hoboken, where Mr. Sayles owns a home. The movie, though, by extension, is intended to represent the problems and politics of change that he has observed in small cities all over, especially Schenectady, where he grew up, and Atlanta and East Boston where he later lived.
"You see the links," Mr. Sayles said. "And when you think of New Jersey, you think of small cities with a melting-pot tradition, without major league baseball teams and where the media doesn't play that big a role. Incidents here don't become national news. I feel like the press is a day or two behind things. In New York, the minute the girl is chained up, they're in the living room -- and it comes out that day. So, in a way, when a city in New Jersey is on the screen, it almost automatically says to people, 'Oh, this isn't Chicago or L.A. and we're not renaming New York City.' But here -- in Jersey City and in Trenton and in Camden and in Newark -- we've got all the problems of a big city, without the economic base."
By interweaving relationships among a multiplicity of characters with conflicting agendas, "City of Hope" is a search for morality in a chaotic, crumbling community. Although the title is but once mentioned by a fading representative of a white establishment in decline -- "the second most indictable mayor in the state" -- during a fund-raising dinner, his speech is interrupted by a black city councilman who bursts in, leading a constituency that has joined him once he has compromised his ideals.
Intimations of real hope suffuse Mr. Sayles's epic narrative. A police officer is incorruptible. A young mugger is contrite. But a reconciliation scene between a corrupted father and his rebel son turns into a death scene, and in an ambiguous, absurdist-like ending, a homeless schizophrenic man wails for help in the night. Who will hear him? Who would listen? In his most ambitious film, Mr. Sayles, characteristically, tempers sleaze with sentiment, mixes polemics with melodramatics and illuminates grimness. There is hope and there is no hope. Nothing is simple, or simplistic.
 
Hopes Is in the Vision
 Hope is operative in Mr. Sayles's vision. Esperanza (the Spanish word for hope) is the name of his production company, and one of the two plays he has written is called "New Hope for the Dead." "The movie's working title in my head was 'Sex, Lies and Urban Renewal, ' " Mr. Sayles said, mentioning a variation of "the best title I ever heard -- even if the movie wasn't good, I'd go see it."
But "City of Hope" finally came out of the mayor's speech and, he said, "I thought it's true and ironic at the same time; a lot of phrases sound most cynical coming out of a politician's mouth because they lack meaning -- and the hope lies somewhere between the believers and the cynics."
"I see hope occasionally coming from the ground up," Mr. Sayles said. "I don't see it coming from the top down right now. I really feel a resurgence of tribalism in cities. People who used to be able to find some kind of coalition are finding they get their power from their own group, and people who are also finding a way to rise above their own little tribe. You can't expect help from above, whether it's religion or the Federal Government, and nobody's going to fall out a spaceship. But on the next block, that's where to look for it at least."
Mr. Sayles's block is "on the bus side" of Hoboken, where he has been living in a three-story brownstone for 12 years, with Maggie Renzi, co-producer of his films and actress in some, and assorted "revolving roommates who find it too tough or too expensive to stay in New York."
 
Spends One-Third of Time in Hoboken
 To get to his New York office ("I've been there twice"), or to the big studios rented for editing and sound mixing, he takes the No. 126 bus. "It used to be the 63 until inflation came," he said. "If I'm on the other end of town, I take the PATH."
Hoboken, where Mr. Sayles now figures he spends one-third of his time when he is not "on the road or retreating to his house in upstate New York," has been his alternative to the "stressful and assaultive" life in New York, which he dismisses.
"Here, there's a little more sharing of power, even if it's just the power to make noise," he said. "I see community organizations and manage to do some cohesive things, and I have seen some kind of median ground between the real-estate blitz that was forcing people out of their apartments. That changes a real tight neighborhood, the idea that you, or your kids, can't afford to live there anymore. But the kind of Oklahoma land rush that was happening seven or eight years ago has slowed down. So it's changed, but we still have the old-fashioned Hoboken nights and the yuppies. "
"And people here are better informed about what's going on and they have a say, so that things -- like developing the waterfront and where are we going to park -- are not left in the hands of one or two politicians or developers or the school board," Mr. Sayles continued. "And in the one mile square city, things are more manageable. Stuff gets out in the air quicker." Mr. Sayles and Ms. Renzi are on the board of advisers of the Hoboken Renegade Company.
 
A Commitment to Communities
 In talking about his concerns -- estrangement and, a running theme in his films, a commitment to communities -- in his life and in his art -- Mr. Sayles finds political involvement and personal relationships "inextricable." "Of people we know, we were the first to move to Hoboken and then a lot of our friends moved in, but as they had kids, they moved farther out into Jersey," he said. "The big thing I see happening -- and it's reflected in the movie is that as ethnic groups move in and out, the people who are sending their kids to school are not represented among the teachers, who live in the suburbs and they're still Irish and American and they're teaching black, and Hispanic and Asian kids and there aren't that many black and Hispanic and Asian teachers. Like it or not, there's a lack of accountability there. " he said.
Assimilation ("What do you give up when you join a larger group?") provides another connection among his films. And throughout his films, one senses a renewal of innocence and a need to reclaim the past, as exemplified in "Brother From Another Planet," wherein a black, mute, but all-seeing angelic extraterrestrial lands in Harlem with an eye on the drug scene. And in "Baby, It's You," Mr. Sayles made the comment, "High school is the last bastion of democracy."
And then there are his novels. The third, "Los Gusanos (The Worms)," which concerns Cuban liberation, was published in June, marking him as an independent novelist as well. He acted as his own agent, stipulated that no editorial changes, or movie sale -- "I don't want to complain about someone else's crummy movie version" -- would take place, and he got a six-figure advance. And the assorted short stories (some anthologized in "The Anarchists' Convention"). And the early screenplays for other directors ("Alligator," "The Howling"). And the first episodes of a television series. ("Shannon's Deal").
"Secaucus Seven," which was made in 25 days for $60,000 in 1978 and grossed several million, was his first venture as an independent film maker. "City of Hope" took five weeks and cost $3.1 million. "I've been able to keep my overhead low enough so I don't have to take jobs to eat," Mr. Sayles said.
 
'I Do Stuff I'm Interested In'
 His comment on the extraordinary diversity of his work is simply, "I do stuff that I'm interested in and I'm interested in a lot of stuff, but I'm not interested in movies that are just about who shot who; I'm interested in movies that are about who shot who and why."
Leave the comments about the remarkable authenticity of "City of Hope" to the critics. "The shift of accents alone is dizzying," noted one; another referred to "ear-perfect conversations."
"I don't go out to do research," Mr. Sayles said. "I just live and pay attention and that stuff gets into my work. And when you work for yourself, that's not work."
Work or not, it has been intensive. "Matewan," a highly praised film that was released in August 1987, was about a 1920 coal miner massacre in West Virginia, and "Thinking in Pictures," which was published in November 1987, was his chronicle about the making of "Matewan."
His work has been acknowledged with various prizes for short stories and the "Secaucus" screenplay, capped by the John D. and Catherine T. McArthur Foundation "genius" award at 32. "I'm an ex-genius," he said. Which does not speak of Mr. Sayles's appearances in most of his films. "I tried to play the characters who come in and do their damage and then leave," he said. "There's no time to write their history if I'm directing." An actor before he was a writer or director, Mr. Sayles did a short summer stint as Tom in the 'Glass Menagerie" in the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts several years ago, opposite Joanne Woodward and Karen Allen, with Paul Newman directing.
 
'Hardest Thing to Write Well'
 He admits that his plays are the "hardest thing to write well."
"Even if you direct your own play, the actors carry the ball," he said. "You can't freeze it in time."
Mr. Sayles, who became 41 last month, may not yet have crossed over from cult to mass celebrityhood. "And my terms of being successful don't even show up on the radar of a major studio," he said. "What you hope is there's a track record that you build up and people say, 'Oh, this guy makes good movies.' "
"And I can go to the movies and stand on line, and nobody recognizes me, and that's fine," he said. "The Secaucus Mall is my local theater, but most of the movies I've written and directed don't go there, -- most of them made at least half their money -- only 'Eight Men Out,' which was released by Orion, did.
"But I do what I want and I live where I want, and one of the reasons I choose to live right here in a real house is that this can still exist as a fairly diverse community. It hasn't turned into a boutique."

HEADLINE: Shift in Status for Architects and Designers

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
WHO'S who in the design field? For years, the distinction between interior decorators, interior designers and architects who do space planning has been blurred. But now a new state law, which requires interior designers to take a tough test for state certification, should help the public distinguish the work of professional interior designers from that of self-styled decorators.
"It's a very important distinction," said Elizabeth A. Dresher, who graduated from college with a degree in interior design. "Until now, anyone, the owner of a wallpaper store, someone who has had no training at all, could call themselves an interior designer. But there is more to interior design than picking out wallpapers and fabrics." 
 Ms. Dresher, who is the senior designer at Planned Expansion Group, an architectural and design firm in White Plains, said planning interior space involves such things as knowledge of building codes and fire exits. "The new law will give academically trained interior designers credibility," Ms. Dresher said.
In order to become certified by the state, designers, even those with years of experience, will be required to pass two stiff examinations: a design qualifying exam and a test on state fire, safety and building codes. A state board for interior design will be appointed by the Board of Regents.
 
Known as the LaValle-Koppell Bill
 Yet few Westchester architects are in favor of the LaValle-Koppell bill, as it is referred to.
"When it was presented in its original form three years ago, we lobbied strongly against it," said John P. Sullivan, president-elect of the Westchester/Mid-Hudson Chapter of the American Institute of Architects, who has his office in Valhalla.
"It was worded in such a way that it would have permitted designers to stamp drawings that would be accepted by building departments without a review by an architect or an engineer, which we thought was absolutely dangerous," Mr. Sullivan said. "We negotiated back and forth and finally the language of the bill was made a little clearer. However, as architects, we still feel the bill gives these interior designers too much responsibility for design. The authors of the bill claim it is for the welfare of the public, but we feel public safety is not foremost, as the bill ignores aspects of interior construction which should be solely the province of the architect."
The law defines the type of interior construction that designers can do as "not materially related or materially affecting the building's system." That definition is too vague, Mr. Sullivan said.
"You may have individuals without the necessary training opening up interior space with no idea how it will affect the structure of the building," he said.
 
Shortcomings of the Law Cited
 Joseph Kiel, who has been an architect for 40 years and now has a practice in Hartsdale, agreed with Mr. Sullivan. Mr. Kiel added that he thought the law did not go far enough.
"It's supposed to be for the protection of the public, yet anyone can still call themselves a decorator," Mr. Kiel said.
"It doesn't restrict the uncertified from going into business," he added, "and it doesn't prevent those untrained, self-styled decorators from the sleazy practice of rubber-stamping, which is getting an architect to stamp their drawings."
Calling rubber-stamping a disgrace, Mr. Sullivan said, "Our chapter is getting close to procedures that when we put them into effect will carefully monitor and eliminate the rubber-stamp practice, which we deplore," he said.
Mr. Kiel also said the bill doesn't require designers to carry malpractice insurance.
"The state insists that architects have it," Mr. Kiel said, "and if designers are allowed to plan space, they should be required to have it, too."
Matthew E. Kroin is an architect for and president of the Planned Expansion Group, which he said is a firm that specializes in corporate interior architecture and development of retail stores shopping centers. He said the competition for interior-design assignments has exacerbated the friction between architects and designers.
 
Collaboration Is Favored
 "Times are tough; building is way down," Mr. Kroin said. "Given the state of the economy and the recession, it's understandable that architects are anxious to protect every bit of their turf. But I strongly believe that collaboration between the two disciplines benefits both.
"I know it has worked for us, because for 15 years that's how we have run our practice. We have 25 people on staff, and four of them are interior designers who work as equal members of a team with architects on our space-design projects. The interior-design people have training that architects don't have and complement one another."
Mayda Horizny, an architect on Mr. Kroin's staff, said she thought certification would put interior designers "on a better footing with other professionals."
"I see it as a chance for improving the working environment," Ms. Horizny said. "It may change the way people regard interior design, which I think of now as a field dominated by women, secondary to architecture -- a field they perceive as dominated by men. But there are many designers who are men and many women like myself who are architects. We all complement one another."
Nancy W. Clark, head of the Clark Design Group in Rye, has been an interior designer for 32 years. She said that she not only welcomed certification but also lobbied hard for it to become law.
"I want to be accredited and be known as a qualified professional, which I am," Mrs. Clark said. "I have a degree in interior design from Cornell University, and I have completed large projects such as planning the executive offices for General Mills in Minneapolis and doing the offices of various General Electric facilities around the country."
Certification, Mrs. Clark said, will ultimately benefit the public. "In the past we've all been lumped together," she said. "Designers, decorators and people who own retail stores have been put in the same category. People don't know who to hire for design jobs."
 
Protecting a Market
 In recent years, Mrs. Clark said, architects began making a profit from interior-design work.
"Part of the problem is they don't want to lose that market, especially today," she said. "But I work a lot with architects, and I don't think the new law will change that. I will continue to do so."
Jacqueline Cutler, an interior designer in Scarsdale who has been in business for seven years, said she was in favor of the bill because it elevates designers by giving professional standing to those who pass the test.
"I fully intend to take the exam," Ms. Cutler said. "I majored in interior design at Syracuse University, and I want a professional accreditation. I certainly don't think I'm going to take any work away from architects," she added. "I don't see any conflict, since I specialize in residential work, making use of antiques."

HEADLINE: Yonkers Chamber Forms A Political Action Group

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
STEPPING boldly into the election fray, this city's Chamber of Commerce last month cast aside a 98-year tradition of watching from the sidelines and formed a political action committee. Tomorrow, the business organization's new PAC is to announce endorsements for mayor and Council members.
"There has been a feeling that we've been spectators for too long," said Thomas J. Caramadre, president of the 700-member chamber and secretary of the PAC. "The time has come for us to be players." 
 Prompted by what many consider to be the most important city election in a half-century, the chamber's board of directors voted in early September to form the nine-member PAC to act aggressively by interviewing and endorsing candidates and to solicit campaign funds for its choices.
With this move, the Yonkers chamber becomes the first chamber in the county to take an active role in campaign politics. In the state, only chambers in some of the larger cities or regions -- Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo, New York City and the Nassau-Suffolk County area, for example -- have PAC's.
 
Reflects a Growing Trend
 Nationwide, however, the new role adopted by the Yonkers chamber reflects a growing trend, officials report. Increasingly, business organizations are seeking political involvement, evaluating candidates and contributing to campaign funds, said Michael J. Carman, senior legislative affairs manager for the eastern division of the United States Chamber of Commerce in Manhattan.
"The trend among chambers that are worth their salt is not to bury their heads in the sand," Mr. Carman said. "The time for the business community not to be involved is over."
Because issues such as child care, job opportunities, economic development and the environment involve the business community, Mr. Carman said, chambers should have more influence in the political process.
For the Yonkers chamber, the impetus to form a PAC was generated by a structural change in the city's government. The city manager position, created 50 years ago, is being eliminated, and many of the duties will be taken over by the newly elected mayor, who will serve for four years instead of two.
"What happens in November will affect Yonkers until 1995," Mr. Caramadre said. "The issue of our forming a PAC has been under consideration for 10 years. This year, though, we decided the time was right."
 
Questionnaires for Candidates
 After voting 15 to 0, with one abstention, to form the PAC, the chamber proceeded to mail a 13-item questionnaire to 24 candidates -- four running for mayor, four for Council president and 16 for the six City Council seats.
The nominees were asked their opinions on a range of subjects, including the city's income-tax surcharge, its real estate transfer tax, the formation of an independent school district, a citywide reassessment of property, the role of the State Emergency Financial Control Board and the adequacy of police and fire protection.
The candidates were also asked what they would do to increase economic and industrial development efforts in Yonkers, how they would rate the image of the city and what role they saw for the chamber in government. Mayoral candidates were asked what changes they would make, if elected, under the new strong-mayor form of government.
After the questionnaires were returned to the chamber, candidates were interviewed for 45 minutes each by members of the PAC. The proceedings were taped, because not all members of the PAC were present for all interviews.
While the response to the chamber's new political involvement has been "generally very positive," Mr. Caramadre said, some people have expressed skepticism, questioning what might happen if the chamber backed a losing candidate.
 
'Work to Develop a Relationship'
 "If a candidate who was not our choice wins, we will work to develop a relationship," the chamber's president said. "There doesn't need to be any hostility. But, at the very least, people seeking public office should know what the business community needs and expects from them."
Three of the four mayoral candidates in the November election agreed that the victor would have to be attentive to the needs of the now politically active chamber, even if the new city leader were not endorsed by the PAC.
Angelo R. Martinelli, a member of the chamber of commerce and a former Mayor of Yonkers for six terms, who is running as an independent, said: "Up to now, the chamber hasn't been taken seriously. With a PAC, the organization has clout."
Peter A. Chema, majority leader of the City Council who is running as the Republican-Conservative candidate, said he admired the chamber's new level of commitment but acknowledged that the PAC was "a risky venture." He said, "As far as I know, most chambers remain apolitical."
And State Assemblyman Terence M. Zaleski, a Democrat, said he would be "disappointed but not crestfallen" if he failed to win the PAC's endorsement. Whoever wins the election, he added, should develop an effective working relationship with the business community.
 
5 Republicans, 2 Democrats
 Thomas Byrne, the Right-to-Life Party candidate for mayor, did not respond to the questionnaire and was not interviewed by the PAC.
Of the PAC's nine members, five are Republicans: John Kulacz, an accountant; Eben Walker, president of a graphite metalizing company; John Fazio, president of a travel agency; Andrew Carlin, a lawyer, and Dominick Carbone, vice president of Sarah Lawrence College and chairman of the PAC.
Two are Democrats: Barbara Soares, owner of a design company, and Patricia Sadler, a director of the local Y.W.C.A.
Two members are independents: Howard Berman, a lawyer, and Edith Klein, vice president of a paper-products concern.
"We picked members who are representative," Mr. Caramadre said. "The fact is that among business people, there are generally more Republicans."
The members were selected by Mrs. Killilea and approved by the chamber's board of directors. Some PAC members will serve for one year, others for two, with the PAC electing new members as terms expire. The staggered terms are expected to permit continuity when new members are appointed.
 
Some Concern Over Labels
 Reservations about being viewed as partisan have deterred other chambers from forming or activating PAC's. In White Plains, the 3,000-member Westchester County Chamber of Commerce has had a PAC structurally in place for two years but has chosen not to use it, said Harold E. Vogt, the organization's president and chief executive officer.
"There is some concern that we would be labeled a Republican, Democrat, independent or Liberal organization, and we don't want that," Mr. Vogt said. "We want our group to be issue oriented without any party affiliation."
With that in mind, Mr. Vogt said, his organization chose not to activate the PAC to raise campaign funds for candidates. "We keep members apprised of pending legislation," he said. "We represent our views to officeholders. And we feel that is the level of involvement that is appropriate at this time."
According to Federal law, chambers are incorporated, tax-exempt organizations and are forbidden by the Internal Revenue Service from raising political funds, unless they establish a PAC.
 
Up to $5,000 a Year
 Under state law, businesses and corporations may contribute up to $5,000 a year to a PAC, whereas there is no cap on individual donations, said Daniel B. Walsh, president of the Business Council of New York State, an umbrella organization in Albany for business groups and chambers.
The Yonkers Chamber of Commerce PAC is asking for minimum donations of $50, to be given to the endorsed candidates' campaign funds. The chamber, as an association and not a corporation, needed only to change its bylaws in order to establish the PAC.
An advantage of making political contributions through a PAC, Mr. Caramadre said, is anonymity. Campaign contributions over $99 are published in newspapers. But if a company or an individual gives the money to a PAC, only the amount the committee gave will be listed.
Robert J. Galterio, a member of the chamber's board of directors who voted for the PAC, said he had "some initial concerns" about the organization's venturing into new fund-raising activities. "My fear," he said, "was that the PAC would be soliciting funds from the same people we ask to help support our other endeavors. You can't keep going to the well. Enough is enough. This is not the greatest of times as it is."
 
Expansion Is Planned
 Early last week, about $2,000 in donations to the PAC had been received. Mr. Caramadre suggested that the amount might increase significantly once the endorsements were announced.

HEADLINE: Now Playing: Real Life, the Movie

BYLINE: By NEAL GABLER; Neal Gabler, the author of "An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews Invented Hollywood," is at work on a biography of Walter Winchell.

 BODY:
Fade in on New York Harbor off The Battery on a muggy June day. A young man jumps from a launch into the roiling water and disappears beneath the surface. Within seconds divers in scuba gear plunge in after him. Boats converge on the scene. A helicopter hovers overhead. But the man never surfaces.
Fade in on five toughs rampaging down the mean streets of Washington one night. The gang encircles a dazed man. One of them rears back and unleashes a savage punch. The victim falls stiffly, like a tree being felled. 
 Fade in on a snowy slope in fashionable Aspen. We see two figures in ski parkas silhouetted against the sky: a man and a woman. Suddenly, another woman appears. She wheels on the first woman and hisses, "Stay away from my husband!"
These are all scenes from recent movies, but you wouldn't have seen any of them at your local theater. The first was a rescue drill conducted by the New York Harbor Police; according to some accounts, the policeman playing the victim had foregone a life jacket to make the rescue look more authentic for a German television crew shooting the action. The young man drowned. The second was a video made by a gang of Washington youths during a so-called wilding. And the third was the famous confrontation on the slopes between Ivana Trump and Marla Maples. The reason you wouldn't have seen any of these scenes at your local theater is that they were playing on a different kind of screen. These movies were playing on the screen of life.
Reality has always had a way of challenging fiction and frequently outflanking it. But by the "screen of life" I mean something much more self-consciously theatrical than chance invention. I mean that life itself is gradually being transformed into a medium all its own like television, radio and print. And we are becoming both performance artists in and audiences for a grand, ongoing entertainment that is often richer, more complex and more compelling than anything in the conventional media. Or, as Philip Roth put it in his story "On the Air": "What if the world is some kind of -- of show! . . . What if we are all only talent assembled by the Great Talent Scout Up Above! The Great Show of Life! Starring Everybody! Suppose entertainment is the Purpose of Life!"
Philip Roth was writing more than 20 years ago, but the evidence has steadily mounted ever since that politics, religion, news, education, warfare, crime, everything are really branches of, well, call it show biz. Everywhere the fabricated, the inauthentic and the theatrical have gradually driven out the natural, the genuine and the spontaneous until there is no distinction between real life and stagecraft. In fact, one could argue that the theatricalization of American life is the major cultural transformation of this century. Devoured by artifice, life is a movie.
 
Reality Management
Enter Fantasy, Riding a TV Set
 It is difficult to pinpoint precisely when the process began. Surely as soon as America first emerged as a mass industrial society there were individuals who saw no reason to let the vagaries of life govern when one could orchestrate life to one's benefit. Soon public relations experts were manufacturing events and manipulating reality, and over the decades these small contrivances, established on a thousand fronts from business to news to politics, metastasized. Before long everyone in public life had a P.R. rep and everything in public life seemed the product of premeditation.
It was this sort of image-mongering and reality management that the historian Daniel Boorstin deplored in his path-breaking 1961 study "The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America." For Mr. Boorstin, Americans increasingly lived in a "world where fantasy is more real than reality." And he warned, "We risk being the first people in history to have been able to make their illusions so vivid, so persuasive, so 'realistic' that they can live in them." Mr. Boorstin believed that by letting artifice displace experience, we were debasing our culture. Still, he assumed that if one lifted the scrim, one would find a reality behind the counterfeit. What he could not have foreseen was that the scrim would become the reality.
Partly, he underestimated the extent of the theatrical in America because he underestimated the power of television to dictate the terms of our discourse. As Neil Postman has observed in his powerfully argued screed against television, "Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business," "We are now a culture whose information, ideas and epistemology are given form by television, not by the printed word." And Mr. Postman went on to say that television, unlike print, "has made entertainment itself the natural format for the representation of all experience." Television not only welcomes artifice, it demands it. Inherently visual, inherently visceral, television abhors dead air. It requires that everyone on it -- newsmakers, authors, generals, criminals, academicians -- keep us entertained or we'll tune out.
Television certainly has contributed to the frenzy of role-playing in America, if only because the lone standard to which television holds anyone is the standard of performance. (Mr. Postman says that Richard Nixon was done in by television not because he was a liar but because he looked like one.)
In a famous commercial a few years back, a soap opera star announced, "I'm not a doctor but I play one on TV." Today, when it seems everyone is engaged in one sort of performance or another, that could serve as the nation's motto. "I'm not a hero but I play one," says Oliver North. "I'm not a football star but I play one," says Brian Bosworth. "I'm not a journalist but I play one," says the local news anchor. "I'm not a President but I play one," says Ronald Reagan.
Since the media transmit these performances, it is tempting to blame them for the theatricalization. But doing so is mistaking symptoms for causes. Life is the medium, television an important but component part. And life hasn't become a form of entertainment because P.R. men learned to stroke our cultural G-spots or because wily television executives learned how to lobotomize us into grinning idiots. We have been complicit in the whole process and for good reason. It works.
If theatricalization accelerated at roughly the same time that America was emerging as a mass industrial society, it was also a time when American life was becoming less manageable, more complex. With the old verities of 19th-century small-town America suddenly under siege, people needed techniques to help them understand the changing social order and possibly dominate it.
A painless way to make sense of this new world was suggested by one of the modernizing forces itself: the movies. The movies offered many forms of guidance to confused Americans, particularly to immigrant urban dwellers; they became a virtual manual for acculturation. But one of the most important and most subtle services the movies offered was to serve as a popular model of narrative coherence. If reality was overwhelming, one could always carve it into a story, as the movies did. One could bend life to the familiar and comforting formulas one saw in the theater.
Beginning in the 1920's, the tabloids and then magazines and television provided dozens of real-life plots, from kidnappings and murders to political scandals, to crimes in executive suites, to election campaigns, to World War II, to the cold war, to Watergate, to the recent Soviet coup attempt. Today, virtually all the news assumes a narrative configuration with cause and effect, villain and hero, beginning, middle and provisional end, and frequently a moral. Events that don't readily conform, the savings and loan scandal, for example, seem to drift in foggy limbo like a European art film rather than a sleek commercial American hit.
That is why reading the news is just like watching a series of movies: a hostage crisis is a thriller, the Milwaukee serial murders a morbidly fascinating real-life "Silence of the Lambs," the Kennedy Palm Beach case a soap opera, a fire or hurricane a disaster picture.
One even suspects that Americans were riveted by the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearings last week not because of any sense of civic duty but because it was a spellbinding show -- part "Rashomon," part "Thelma and Louise," part "Witness for the Prosecution."
But as with movies, if "formularizing" reality is a way of domesticating it, it is also a means of escaping it. Michael Wood in his book "America in the Movies," described our films as a "rearrangement of our problems into shapes which tame them, which disperse them to the margins of our attention" where we can forget about them. By extending this function to life itself, we convert everything from the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby to the marital misadventures of Elizabeth Taylor into distractions, cheap entertainments that transport us from our problems.
But before disapproving too quickly, one is almost compelled to admit that turning life into escapist entertainment has both a perverse logic and a peculiar genius. Why worry about the seemingly intractable problems of society when you can simply declare, "It's morning in America" and have yourself a long-running Frank Capra movie right down to an aw-shucks President? Why fret over America's declining economic might when you can have an honest-to-goodness war movie that proves your superiority? Movies have always been a form of wish fulfillment. Why not life?
When life is a movie, it poses serious questions for those things that were not traditionally entertainment and now must accommodate themselves. Politics, for instance. Much has already been made of the fact that Ronald Reagan came to the White House after a lifetime as a professional actor. Lou Cannon, in his biography of Mr. Reagan, "President Reagan: The Role of a Lifetime," details just how central this was to Mr. Reagan's concept of the Presidency and what it suggests about the new political landscape.
 
Performance Politics
Good Vibes From the Oval Office
 "What he wanted to be, and what he became, was an accomplished presidential performer," writes Mr. Cannon. Everything was scripted for Mr. Reagan, from press conferences to quips; even in personal conversations he read from note cards. When the President did wing it, he was vague and often incoherent.
Of course President Reagan was not the first politician to have been a consummate performer. One thinks immediately of Franklin Roosevelt. But for Roosevelt the performance was always a function of the Presidency -- a means to sell his policies. For Mr. Reagan, the Presidency was a function of the performance. What the Administration was selling was what movies sell: good vibes.
None of this was lost on Mr. Reagan's advisers. They knew that his primary function was to star in the movie of his Presidency and offer genial reassurance that everything would be O.K. In this escapist entertainment there would be no racial divisiveness, no economic calamity, no education crisis, no AIDS.
We acquiesced not because we were deluded but because it was a pretty good movie as movies go: well executed, thematically sound, deeply satisfying, fun. "You believed it because you wanted to believe it," President Reagan once told a columnist who insisted he had seen the young actor on the set of the movie "Brother Rat," even though Mr. Reagan had not been there. "There's nothing wrong with that. I do it all the time."
Psychologically speaking, the President may have been right. Politically speaking, though, the Presidential movie is a far more vexing proposition for a democracy. In the first place, turning the Presidency into performance art changes the way we measure the Presidency from the efficaciousness of the Administration's policies to the power of its performance -- that old TV gauge. In this the media were happy to collaborate. Throughout the Reagan years one heard ad nauseam about the effectiveness of the President's delivery, about his popularity, about his charm until, as Professor Kiku Adatto noted of the press corps during the 1988 Bush-Dukakis campaign, the reporters had become theater critics, dissecting the stagecraft of the campaign rather than its substance.
In the second place, if performance art turns the Presidency into a movie, it also turns Americans into an audience. "You like the audience," Mr. Reagan once mused after his Presidency. "You want to please the audience." But audiences, unlike citizens, have neither responsibilities nor obligations. There are no minority rights either. The majority rules, and if you don't enjoy the movie you can just skedaddle. Anyone who has the temerity to stand up during the show and criticize it for not being relevant is likely to seem irrelevant himself. This movie isn't about relevancy. This movie is about escape.
Were President Reagan the author of this phenomenon, one might pass it off as a weird blip on the political screen. But, again, Mr. Reagan is the symptom, not the cause. From now on every President will be drafting the script of his Presidency. For President Bush it is the story of a self-effacing American Everyman, half Yankee, half Texan, whose common demeanor belies a steely toughness.
 
War: The Mini-Series
Casting for the Gulf Was Impeccable
 Just as every movie blockbuster comes with its own set pieces, the movie within the movie, so the Bush Administration devised its set piece: a staggeringly successful mini-series called the gulf war, which demonstrated on an unprecedented scale how events might be given the narrative shape and heady rush of a good action picture.
It is odd, unseemly even, to describe a war as "telegenic," but that is precisely what the gulf war was. Each network introduced its war coverage with music, a logo and a title -- "Crisis in the Gulf" on ABC; "Showdown in the Gulf" on CBS before the hostilities and "War in the Gulf" after the hostilities had begun; "America at War" on NBC. For them it was a new series, and even the correspondents, notably CNN's Peter Arnett and Wolf Blitzer and NBC's "Scud stud" Arthur Kent, gained a star's celebrity.
Certainly the gulf war was a lot more telegenic than Vietnam. Vietnam was a long, logy hallucination of a movie -- the good guys indistinguishable from the bad, the plot dribbling away to entropy. The Pentagon had learned that if it were to control the media front it couldn't let that happen again. The next war was going to be short, sharp, its narrative lineaments clean, happily unconfused as to heroes and villains. The next war was going to be an entertainment.
The casting was impeccable. Articulate, brilliant, rugged, sensitive, heroic H. Norman Schwarzkopf was a figure of Herculean proportions, especially when placed beside the Vietnam commanders William Westmoreland and Creighton Abrams. On the other hand, Saddam Hussein resembled the evil mastermind from a Saturday afternoon serial. As for actual combat, the action we saw, primarily bombs hitting targets, was antiseptic and precise.
Formulated like a World War II movie, the gulf war even ended like a World War II movie, with the troops marching triumphantly down Broadway or Main Street, bathed in the gratitude of their fellow Americans while the final credits rolled. Nor did the movie analogy end with the parades. The gulf war, like "Star Wars," had its ancillary markets: trading cards, T-shirts, video cassettes of the action.
Nevertheless, there is one distinction between this "movie" and the conventional movies that helped keep the home fires burning during World War II, other than the obvious one that those played in theaters and this one played in the medium of life. Those movies had a purpose besides entertainment. They were designed to mobilize support and forge a consensus for the real war being fought overseas. But when the war itself is a movie, when its real-life objectives are murky and mercurial, the war "movie" mobilizes support for . . . what?
For itself, one supposes, which is why the real point of this war may not have been to liberate Kuwait, insure the flow of oil or eliminate Mr. Hussein. It may have been to restore our confidence, to make us feel good -- which is, of course, traditionally not the function of warfare but of the movies or TV. "General Sherman had it all wrong," editorialized The Nation earlier this year. "War ain't hell -- it's entertainment."
 
When Life Upstages Art
Elizabeth Taylor's Celebrity Theory
 When life itself is an entertainment medium it also forces adjustments from the stars of films, TV, records and the rest of the conventional media. How do you hold your own in the life movie when the President, businessmen like Donald Trump, alleged mobsters like John Gotti, the Kennedys, even mass murderers compete for public attention? When everything is entertainment, what can you provide that these new entertainers cannot?
The answers come from an unlikely source: Elizabeth Taylor, who may be as close to a theorist of the life movie as there is. Ms. Taylor's life has long seemed like real-life soap opera of the most lurid hue. A childhood in Hollywood, marriage after marriage, the tragic death of her one true love, bouts with illness, obesity, drug addiction, recovery -- the list goes on.
All these things had kept Ms. Taylor in the public view. More, they had kept her a first-rank celebrity. In fact, Ms. Taylor's life was so much more entertaining than anything she could do on screen that she didn't have to work in movies or TV to hold our interest. She just had to live.
In "The Image," Mr. Boorstin noted that the celebrity "will be destroyed, as he was made, by publicity," the idea being that publicity is perishable; once the celebrity passes from public view there are no lasting accomplishments to survive him. But Elizabeth Taylor understood that one never need pass from that view; that one could keep unraveling the long skein of one's life; that one could make of one's own life a movie and that so long as it was entertaining, one would never be passe. "I am my own industry," she once declared, and she was absolutely right. (A marketing executive recently described an in-store promotional movie Ms. Taylor made for her new White Diamonds perfume as "a theatrical event," complete with tickets and popcorn.) When was the last time you went to see a real Elizabeth Taylor movie? When was the last time you read about her?
In the old days of celebrity, we seldom went to see a movie solely because we were curious about a star we had read about; on the contrary, we were curious about stars because we had gone to see their movies. Today the life is almost always a teaser for the work -- when there is any work to tease. No one I know rushes out to see a Mickey Rourke picture, few were tempted by the recent Farrah Fawcett-Ryan O'Neal sitcom, and Dolly Parton hardly rivals Madonna's popularity -- to name some recent cover subjects of Vanity Fair, the chronicle of the celebrity life movie. But they each have stories to tell and lives to sell.
Demi Moore, the actress-wife of Bruce Willis, didn't even have a picture in release at the time of her controversial Vanity Fair cover, but the magazine aptly described her yet-unborn child as "her next project." Julia Roberts did have a movie in release when she suddenly aborted her impending marriage to the actor Kiefer Sutherland. The picture, "Dying Young," did disappointing business. But as Caryn James pointed out in these pages, Ms. Roberts's life movie was booming. The tabloids and People got everyone gossiping about the young woman's romances just as they once did about Ms. Taylor's.
In effect, the life now is always usurping the work just as one suspects that for the celebrities themselves the life movie is always usurping whatever "real" life there is. "It's not easy being Cary Grant," the actor was once alleged to have said, meaning, presumably, that it wasn't easy for an ordinary mortal to live up to his screen image. Grant was assuming, of course, that there was a difference between the man and the image. It is much easier being, say, Cher because that assumption doesn't hold. When life is a movie, image and life conflate. The stars aren't projecting anymore. They seem to be living for us, opening their lives to public inspection, letting us in on their secrets, entertaining us.
But "entertainment" may be too limiting a word for these life movies. As mindlessly voyeuristic as all this may sound, the stars are also providing a kind of art as well as entertainment. Semioticians who study language and signs have long held that culture itself could be "read" as a vast text. Similarly, lives can have themes as well as plots, and these themes can be a major part of their appeal: the content that informs the story.
One of the appeals of Elizabeth Taylor's life is that it forcefully conveys the theme of survival. No matter what happens to Liz, she always triumphs. One of the appeals of Cher's life is that it conveys the idea of self-renewal: from a motley-dressed rock-and-roll star to a sex object to a serious actress. Sylvester Stallone's life has had the thematic amplitude of a Greek myth. He is the shepherd (actually deli waiter) who becomes the gods' (actually Hollywood's) favorite and then, succumbing to his overweening pride and to Circe (actually Brigitte Nielsen), must be punished for his hubris. Now, according to last year's Vanity Fair profile, "Sly's Cry From the Heart," he is chastened and newly sensitive.
No doubt stars could keep recycling the formulas if there weren't someone to push the edge of the celebrity envelope. Madonna's life is as soap operatic as the best of them, and it is ripe with thematic possibilities: sexual role reversal, hedonism with impunity, the wages of celebrity, to name a few. But Madonna has added a brilliant Pirandellian wrinkle to the old formula. She has made her life work about her life movie.
In the documentary "Truth or Dare," Madonna admits that she is not the best singer, dancer or actress and adds disingenuously, "Who do I think I am, trying to pull this off?" But Madonna knows exactly who she is. She is a conceptual performance artist whose truest art is the art of manipulation. That alone might not make her any different from Cher, Mr. Stallone, Ms. Taylor or the rest, save this: Madonna gleefully reveals her manipulation to us. She luxuriates in it. Like the magicians Penn and Teller, who are constantly debunking their magic, she invites us to see the mechanisms behind the tricks, until all we see are the mechanisms. It is the shamelessness of it that makes her so appealing to her fans.
"She doesn't want to live off-camera, much less talk," her then-boyfriend, the actor Warren Beatty, complains in "Truth or Dare." Mr. Beatty himself has always pretended to be secretive. He lurks at the edges of the frame here as he has lurked at the edges of the press for decades. Yet lurk he does. Not for nothing do we know not only Mr. Beatty's romantic entanglements, but even his love-making techniques. It is part of his life movie as legendary Lothario. What he cannot see is that Madonna is Mr. Beatty without the hypocrisy.
In fairness, though, not even Madonna always gets it. In "Truth or Dare," Kevin Costner saunters backstage to pay his respects after a concert. Flashing that big lopsided Costner grin, he tells her the concert was "neat," then apologizes for having to get back home to the kids. No sooner has Mr. Costner left than Madonna is sneering incredulously, "Neat?" and sticking her finger down her throat to gag. Madonna didn't seem to realize that she had momentarily become a guest star in Mr. Costner's life movie, believing instead that he was a guest star in hers. "Neat" was deliberate and probably ironic. It is the sort of thing one expects Mr. Costner to say. And the excuse about getting back to the children is as central to the Costner "movie" as sex is to the Beatty "movie."
Life couldn't be a movie if it were limited to the famous and powerful. Americans have always emulated their stars in fashion, behavior, attitude. Now, consciously or not, they are emulating the stars' theatricalization. Recently I heard about a party where the hosts' 8-year-old daughter roamed about with a video camera. As the party was breaking up, the girl called the guests to attention, popped a cassette in the deck and showed them the edited video version of their party, complete with titles, effects and soundtrack.
 
Ordinary People
Cultural Footprints Exit Into the Video
 And a recent article in The Times reported what must surely be the frontier of this domestic theatricalization: a young man asked his divorced parents to step in front of the camcorder and re-enact happier times so that their granddaughter could see how it was before the breakup.
These are the new entertainments and the new arts, spun in life from life. It is even conceivable that these, more than our novels, films and paintings, may be the cultural footprints we leave behind. Someday, perhaps, future generations will be retelling the sagas of Elizabeth Taylor, the Kennedys, Nancy Reagan, Donald Trump and Sylvester Stallone, or watching the videos of that divorced couple playing themselves in better days. Someday they may be parsing the meanings of these narratives as we interpret Greek myths.
Meanwhile, we edge ever closer to Philip Roth's dark, prophetic vision -- ever closer to the time when entertainment will be the only purpose of life and everything else will be dispersed to the margins and forgotten.

Trade Group Head Sees Deeper, Longer Slump

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
"No one I talk to in the advertising business sees the remotest sign that we're out of the economic slough of despond," John O'Toole, president of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, said in a speech to the trade organization's 53d annual Western Region Convention in San Diego over the weekend.
Mr. O'Toole listed the differences between this recession and previous ones that "point to a deeper and longer recession." Among them, he said, were the severe decline in advertising revenues being suffered by the media and the decision of advertisers to divert money normally spent on consumer promotions to trade promotions. 
 Still, Mr. O'Toole said, he expected aggressive advertisers to "use the recession to increase brand share at bargain prices," which would get "competition and advertising budgets growing again." That process helped end previous recessions, he added, and "there's no reason to assume it won't happen this time" -- eventually.

Burden of Chicago Sun-Times: Being No. 2

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
At The Chicago Sun-Times, the national recession and widespread advertising drought have added pressure to the newspaper's fundamental handicap of being No. 2 to the dominant Chicago Tribune in advertising and circulation.
And last week, the paper narrowly averted a strike that would have strained its finances even further. 
 Indeed, the prospects for No. 2 papers in the few cities with newspaper competition took on a particularly somber cast Friday when the Gannett Company announced that it had sold The Arkansas Gazette, the No. 2 paper in Little Rock, to the owner of The Arkansas Democrat, which then closed it.
 
Strong Franchise Is Seen
 Still, Sam S. McKeel, publisher of The Sun-Times, said Friday that even though his paper had problems, they were not terminal. He asserted that The Sun-Times still had a fundamentally strong franchise, with particular power in such areas as automotive advertising.
"The paper is not in danger of collapsing, has a very positive cash flow and has thus far met all its debt-service obligations," said Mr. McKeel, who said the private company does not release performance figures.
As a tabloid focused on the city, The Sun-Times has traditionally had particular strength in Chicago and Cook County. But this has proved less important in recent years as residents moved to the suburbs, where The Tribune has traditionally had more muscle. Cook County lost about 250,000 in population in the 1980's, according to the 1990 census.
The Sun-Times has mounted large cost-cutting efforts twice in the last year that whittled 115 jobs, and Mr. McKeel said another significant round of cost-cutting was imminent.
Since June, The Sun-Times has been in intense negotiations with the Newspaper Guild, which represents about 245 newsroom employees, and a strike seemed almost inevitable at one point last week.
 
Details of the Contract
 "On Thursday at 11:30 in the morning, I announced in the newsroom, 'A strike is a virtual certainty,' " said Daniel J. Lehmann, a Guild spokesman. A contract settlement was reached at 5 P.M.
On Friday, the union approved a three-year contract with no increase the first year, a 2 percent increase the second year and 2 percent for each six months of the third year. While the agreement had some sweeteners, including a $550 bonus for each union employee upon ratification, the Guild received far less than it had asked. Management, pleading financial duress, said the union got all the newspaper could afford to give.
The last decade has been a time of turmoil for The Sun-Times, which has had three owners during that period. Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation acquired the paper from the Field family in 1984 for $75 million and then sold it two years later to Adler & Shaykin, a New York venture-capital company, for $145 million when newspaper profits were high and prices for papers were at a peak. Among the limited partners in the venture is the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States.
 
The Tribune's Lead
 Since 1986, The Tribune has increased its circulation lead, mostly because The Sun-Times has lost about 100,000 subscribers, both daily and Sunday. The Sun-Times's daily circulation is 538,000, compared with 741,000 for The Tribune, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. The Sun-Times's Sunday circulation is 559,000, compared with more than 1.1million for The Tribune.
The Tribune claims to have 80 percent of the total advertising revenue generated by the two papers and 90 percent of the help-wanted classified advertising.
Mr. McKeel said The Sun-Times's bankers, with Citibank as the lead banker, had been quite cooperative in restructuring the debt that exists from buying the company.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Need Is Generally Seen For Nudging Economy

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
With the economy showing few signs that it is doing little more than limping along, some analysts are becoming increasingly convinced that a measured dose of fiscal stimulus is needed to insure a modest recovery.
That view is also held by the Bush Administration, which last week made plain its intention to introduce a number of measures it contends will stimulate growth. 
 The steps mentioned last week are a familiar lot and include a cut in the capital gains tax, incentives for new home buyers and expanded Individual Retirement Account deductions.
But looking to the Federal Government for help is not without risk, the analysts acknowledge.
 
Impact on Rates
 After previous recessions, Congress and the White House have tended to pile on goodies like tax cuts and new spending programs, not measure them out in dollops.
The Administration insists its proposals will be "revenue neutral," and the huge budget deficit would seem to be an effective check on an impulse to overdo the economic stimulus. But the risk is there.
Adverse reaction from the financial markets is another potential problem. Any stimulus package that is perceived as excessive will almost certainly drive up interest rates, making the medicine less effective.
But those are risks worth taking, the analysts said, because current conditions seem to defy description.
"Economists don't have a good term for where we are," said Gail W. Fosler, chief economist at the Conference Board, a business organization. "The recession is over, and the recovery has yet to begin. Fiscal stimulus, in the form of a capital gains cut and a multiyear reduction in Social Security taxes, is needed."
 
'Stimulus Is Called For'
 Most economists expect that the Commerce Department will report that the economy grew at a fairly respectable rate of 2.5 percent to 3 percent when it releases its preliminary estimate of gross national product in the third quarter on Oct. 29.
But much of that growth was a result of a slowdown in inventory liquidation, they argue. Moreover, the steady decline in important sectors over the last few months is not synonymous with robust health.
"Recent data suggest the economy is staggering," said Alan Sinai, president of the Boston Company Economic Advisors Inc.
"Manufacturing seems to be fading, exports have fallen for the past three months and consumer spending is lagging," he said. "The economy needs help. A small dose of fiscal stimulus is called for."
Mr. Sinai said no more than $10 billion to $15 billion should be used to move the economy to a somewhat faster rate of growth.
Like Ms. Fosler, Mr. Sinai favors a cut in the capital gains tax and a reduction in Social Security taxes for middle- and low-income workers. Extending unemployment benefits should also be part of the package, he said. A sizable chunk of the package would be financed by a 5-cent increase in gasoline taxes.
"That amount of stimulus would give us about a percentage point of growth over the next year," he said. "By my projections, that would get the economy growing at a 2 percent rate."
 
Some Economists Dissent
 The view that fiscal policy needs to be more stimulative is not universally shared, however.
Indeed, many economists insist that given more time, the steady slide in interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve Board since the middle of 1989 will adequately bolster the economy.
But a fiscal package of modest proportions would not necessarily drive up interest rates, they said.
"We think the economy will make it without fiscal stimulus," said Susan Hering, an economist at Salomon Brothers, "and that the interest rate decline we have had will propel us to 3 percent growth or more by early next year."
But, she added, "if the markets remain very skeptical about prospects for recovery, and the Administration were to propose something of modest dimensions, I don't think the markets would mind too much."
With the Presidential election little more than a year away, the political need to insure recovery is clear.
Still, Gordon Richards, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers, said there was little that could be done in the short-term that would have a measurable impact. And the long-term need to cut the deficit remains, he added.
 
A Similar Pattern
 "Given the choice of blowing last year's budget deal and letting the deficit escalate, or leaving fiscal policy as it is, I suppose we would come down in favor of the latter," Mr. Richards said. "In the long term, getting the deficit under control is a very high priority."
Moreover, there is reason to suspect that the current state of the economy is really little different from conditions that have existed in the early phases of past recoveries.
"One of the lessons of history is that in the last 25 years every time we start a recovery, we get very nervous and throw additional billions into the jaws of what seems a very anemic expansion," said Jay N. Woodworth, senior domestic economist at the Bankers Trust Company.
"But lo and behold, by the time the legislation percolates through Congress, it is clear that the expansion is not anemic at all, and we ratchet up inflation. From an inflation perspective, I am very nervous about the possibility of a fiscal package."

HEADLINE: No Pickup Expected For Hiring

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The nation's manufacturers say that while production has risen in recent weeks for many products, the pickup is so modest and uncertain that hiring new workers -- an essential step if the nation is to shake off the recession -- might be delayed indefinitely.
In interviews with more than 20 executives at the semiannual directors meeting of the National Association of Manufacturers, which ended in Atlanta on Saturday, the story was essentially the same: production for home consumption, apart from exports, is 1 percent to 3 percent above the summer's levels. 
 Manufacturing is the healthiest sector in a weak national economy, and those numbers suggest the recovery is finally at hand. But the executives held back from making that pronouncement.
Instead, they greeted the improvement with skepticism and with doubt that it would last. "You have to look pretty hard to find it," said Harry A. Hammerly, an executive vice president at the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, the tape maker.
 
P.&G.'s Uncertain Gains
 The Procter & Gamble Company, for example, finds that sales are up 2 percent or more since June for all its numerous consumer products: foods, beverages, soaps, paper items and beauty aids. But Marvin Womack, a Procter vice president, said the company did not know yet whether Americans were consuming more, or Procter was simply taking sales away from competitors, with no net national gain. "You need the disposable income and the will to spend it to increase national consumption," he said. "Neither seems present."
Similarly, the Phelps Dodge Corporation, the copper company, has experienced what Douglas C. Yearley, the chairman, described as a surge in orders over the last four months for wire used in autos, electric motors and home construction. "That's surprising, since we don't see the end demand," Mr. Yearley said, adding that much of the wire might have been earmarked for the 1992 model cars.
"Now we are getting signals from the auto companies' purchasing people that if they don't get better car sales, they won't maintain the order level," he said.
Reflecting a view apparently widely held among the 150 executives at the two-day meeting, those interviewed said a gradual rise in production means that companies are not forced to hire workers or even to pay much additional overtime. A surge in demand and in production -- the pattern in the early months of previous recoveries -- would force companies to expand their work forces quickly.
But when sales grow slowly, that leaves time to increase production through labor-saving strategies: more automation and rearranging of work assignments.
"If the business comes back slowly, as ours is now, we can phase in these productivity improvements, which take time," said Wallace Barnes, chairman of the Barnes Group Inc., headquartered in Bristol, Conn., a maker of metal springs and precision parts that go into numerous products. "That is not good news for the nation's employment statistics, but it is good news for our competitiveness."
 
Counter to Bush Plan
 The resistance to rehiring -- indeed, the Barnes Group, which employs 5,000 people in the United States, is still reducing its staff through attrition -- runs counter to the dynamics for a recovery that have been outlined by the Bush Administration, the Federal Reserve and many economists. Even with a weak recovery and a slow improvement in factory production, they had expected that overtime and new hiring would soon kick in.
The resulting rise in income, in turn, would fuel more demand, more purchases, greater production and still more hiring, making the recovery a solid reality by year-end. The manufacturing sector, in particular, has been counted on to lead the way in rehiring, given that the service sector is laying off thousands of workers to become more efficient, the construction industry is in the doldrums, and state and municipal governments are reducing staffs because of budget problems.
But manufacturing employment has risen by only 67,000 workers, to 18.4 million, since the recession's low point earlier this year, and remains well below its 19.2 million level when the recession started in July 1990.
 
Problem Recognized at Fed
 Recognizing the problem, David W. Mullins Jr., vice chairman of the Fed, said in an interview last week, "There is a real question whether the rise in production will catch hold in employment." He added that the third-quarter gross national product, measuring the nation's economic growth, could show as much as a 3 percent rise, at an annual rate, when the G.N.P. figure is announced on Oct. 29. But despite the likelihood of this good news, which would represent the first growth in the national economy in a year, Mr. Mullins was pessimistic. "It bothers me," he said, "that we might be running out of steam" and the economy might "fall back."
Whatever the future, the present exhibits sharp differences among manufacturing industries. While sales of P.& G.'s small consumer items rose, production of appliances fell from December until the summer and is now "dragging along the bottom," neither rising nor falling, said Gary L. Rogers, senior vice president of General Electric appliances.
"People are buying only what they have to, and they are always looking for lower-priced models," he said. "Even if production rises 3 percent to 4 percent next year, there would not be much hiring."
 
Sales Double for Jack Daniels
 Factory sales of Jack Daniels and other whiskies made in the South by the Brown-Forman Corporation also fell all year, but in September they suddenly doubled. A higher Federal excise tax helps to explain the sales decline, but Stephen F. Thompson, the company's executive vice president, said the September rebound was beyond his understanding. "If we have another month in a row like this, it might mean something," he said.
Restocking for Christmas might be an explanation, Mr. Thompson said. And export growth is helping many other manufacturers. Even before the recent mild turnaround in the nation's manufacturing production, export growth had made manufacturing industries the strongest in a recessionary economy.
Air Products and Chemicals Inc., a manufacturer of industrial gases, exports 15 percent of its $2 billion annually in domestic production, and exports had been rising at a rate of roughly 6 percent a year, while domestic sales began to rise only in late summer at a much slower pace. "Our turnaround would not hold up if exports were to fall," said Dexter F. Baker, the company's chairman and also the newly installed chairman of the National Association of Manufacturers.

HEADLINE: Westinghouse's Sour Experience

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
In real estate circles, Westinghouse Electric's real estate lending business is regarded as one of the great disasters of the 1980's, up there with boom-and-bust savings and loans and oil-patch banks.
And many analysts say the worst is not over. Never mind that twice this year, the big Pittsburgh-based company has been forced to reconcile itself to huge losses from misguided loans by its Westinghouse Credit subsidiary for suburban hotels, motels, apartments and office buldings. Two weeks ago, it earmarked $1.68 billion as a reserve against additional loan losses, bringing to $2.66 billion its total addition to reserves this year. 
 "If the economy continues to be one in which real estate values continue to plummet and highly leveraged companies continue to have problems funding themselves, then they could have more problems," said Fred Pastore, a analyst at Moody's Investors Service who has been given access to the mountain of junk bonds and real estate loans in the Westinghouse Credit Corporation's portfolio.
 
Interest in the Pieces
 With a difficult financing road ahead, more problems could mean that Westinghouse will have to sell several of its non-core businesses and might be significantly changed in a restructuring. Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, the powerful New York leveraged buyout firm, is already reviewing some of Westinghouse's businesses.
More than half the giant conglomerate's real estate loans, amounting to about $3 billion, are not paying all, or any, of the interest they are supposed to pay. Westinghouse Credit's real estate loss reserves equal about 68 percent of its underperforming real estate assets, but the company also has another $1.7 billion of off-balance-sheet credit commitments that it may have to finance if the market continues to trample its investments.
"We think they may need half a billion to a billion dollars more in reserves," said Nicholas P. Heymann, an analyst with County NatWest. "In order to solve the problem, they are going to have to put the bad loans in a separate, self-funding company."
In an attempt to buttress the company's cash position and forestall more big losses, Paul E. Lego, Westinghouse's chairman, announced a plan to speed the recovery of the financial services group, which handles the real estate portfolio.
Mr. Lego has replaced William A. Powe, 54 years old, the high-powered salesman who oversaw most of the failed property investments, with Leo W. Yochum, 64, the company's former chief financial officer, who is coming out of retirement.
Mr. Lego, who declined to be interviewed, has also begun a financing plan that includes private placement of new equity, reduction of short-term debt and expansion of bank credit facilities. The company hopes to improve its cash flow by $500 million by the end of next year, in part by issuing $400 million in Westinghouse stock instead of cash to the company pension fund. Mr. Lego has refused to rule out the need for yet more loss reserves.
 
Overvalued Hotel Properties
 How did this corporate giant, better known for making complex electronic equipment, stumble so badly?
Executives and analysts who have worked with Westinghouse or seen portions of its property portfolio said about 200 loans, or about a quarter of its portfolio, are in limited-service, franchised economy hotels like Hampton Inns, one of its largest borrowers, and Embassy Suites, Days Inn and some Marriott Courtyard motels. These loans, many of which went to small operators, were made on inflated appraisals in the late 1980's and too often represented a high portion of the appraised value, often between 75 percent and 95 percent.
Sometimes developers who were looking to squeeze a little more cash out of their buildings would get a first mortgage for, say, 70 percent of the property from a bank or insurance company, and then go to Westinghouse Credit for a second mortgage secured by the additional 30 percent of value.
In this depressed real estate market -- hotel property values have fallen by at least 30 percent in the last four years -- nearly all of Westinghouse's second mortgages have been wiped out, those familiar with Westinghouse's holdings said. Even many first mortgages are worth substantially less.
Westinghouse Credit, along with the Japanese leasing companies, developed a reputation in the commercial real estate community as a lender of last resort: If you borrowed from them, you would have to pay higher loan fees, but they would make loans that banks would not make.
In addition, credit companies can often close deals quicker because they are not subject to Government supervision as banks or insurance companies are. As a result, many of the big property syndicators and partnerships, like VMS Realty, the troubled Chicago real estate company, went to Westinghouse.
"All the credit companies got into the hotel business in the mid-80's, when they saw the great returns they could get and the real estate climbing in value," said Dan W. Daniele, director of hospitality consulting services for Ernst & Young. "So they made five- to seven-year mini-perm loans and thought they could flip the hotels when the values rose. Now every credit company has a large portion of its underperforming assets that are hotels."
All this has left Westinghouse Credit with a mountain of nonperforming mortgages secured by buildings that cannot, and will not for the forseeable future, support the debt. Meanwhile, its inventory of foreclosed real estate, valued at about $195 million in June, is rising as more developers walk away.
"Westinghouse viewed it as a business like making lightbulbs or any other business," said a real estate executive. "It doesn't seem to have occurred to them that the reason they got such big fees was because the deals they were financing were incredibly risky."
If the economy slows further, many of the hundreds of millions of dollars of mortgages that Westinghouse recently renegotiated to give borrowers more manageable terms may nevertheless become delinquent.
"They were high-value lenders," said a banker who spoke on the condition of anonymity, "and their premise was that even if income were to go down, values would be sustained. But that didn't happen. Westinghouse underwrote income at very small margins, so if the income went down, they were in trouble."
 
Need for More Financing
 Many people in the commercial property business said that Mr. Powe and the go-getters he assembled at Westinghouse Credit were aware of the risks but were counting on ever-increasing property values and Japanese and other willing foreign buyers. Now the Japanese have their own sour real estate investments to fret about, and Mr. Powe is out.
And even assuming that Westinghouse is successful in its plans to raise $900 million, unknowns loom about the parent company's balance sheet, suggesting it will have a strong, continuing need for large amounts of bank financing. Even before the real estate reserves, the operating profits at the company's businesses were down 30 percent as of September. Last week, about 80 banks that lend to Westinghouse held preliminary discussions on the company's problems and near-term financial needs.
Westinghouse has about $5 billion in short-term debt and commercial paper that will come due and need to be rolled over next year. The banks that will be asked to provide more credit will want to be certain that the company's liabilities and its real estate problems have been sufficiently provided for.
Those liabilities include about $1 billion in unfinanced company pension fund charges, an estimated $500 million to $1 billion in environmental cleanup costs for some 57 sites and another estimated $500 million charge related to employee health-care benefits that must be addressed by Jan. 1, 1993.
With a book value of about $3 billion plus another $900 million if the financing plan goes through, Westinghouse will be squeezed over the next year as some of these charges hit its bottom line. The net present value of the company is difficult to determine with these liabilies, but it seems clear that the banks will have to come to the rescue because the commercial paper market is effectively closed to Westinghouse.
The company has had repeated downgradings of its credit ratings and has had trouble persuading investors that they should buy its commercial paper, the corporate i.o.u.'s that help manage its cash and liquidity.
On top of that, Westinghouse Electric faces a class-action suit that contends the company failed to adequately disclose the extent of its real estate problems when it sold 21.5 million shares of common stock in May. At that time, Westinghouse traded at around $28 a share. On Friday, it closed at $16.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Nine-Month Loss
 Real estate woes were almost entirely responsible for Westinghouse Electric's $1.25 billion loss for the first nine months of this year on revenues of $9.37 billion. That compares with a net profit of $717 million, or $2.44 a share, on revenues of $9.21 billion for the comparable 1990 period.
Mr. Heymann, the NatWest analyst, estimated that his previous worst-case prediction for the company's dividend -- that it would be cut in half, to 70 cents a share -- is now the best that can be expected. In fact, he and others believe the dividend may be temporarily eliminated.

HEADLINE: Bank Sues Salomon and Travelers

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
A Philadelphia savings bank has accused Salomon Brothers Inc., the Travelers Corporation and some top executives at both of colluding to deprive the bank of money it is owed by four real estate partnerships.
The dispute involves real estate partnerships that had attracted investments from more than 200 of Salomon's most prominent current and former employees and comes as the Wall Street firm is struggling mightily to rebound from its admission that it behaved unlawfully in several recent Treasury auctions.
 
Secret Negotiations
 The Meritor Savings Bank in Philadelphia, in a little-noticed lawsuit filed in June in Philadelphia County Common Pleas Court, contended that the Salomon group was secretly negotiating to release Travelers and its Prospect Company investment unit from obligations that would insure that the partnerships' loans to Meritor are repaid. 
 Meritor charges that in return, the Salomon group was negotiating to receive payments that could help reduce adverse tax consequences it now faces.
To satisfy Meritor when the deal was struck in the mid-1980's, Salomon arranged for Prospect, which had a financial stake in the projects, to cover any shortfalls should the rental properties the four partnerships invested in fail to generate enough income to pay their debts. Travelers, the big insurance company, had issued a so-called comfort letter advising Meritor that its policy was to make sure its subsidiaries fulfilled their obligations.
Nonetheless, the Meritor loans, which totaled $59 million, went into default last April.
"In essence," the complaint says, "Traveler, Prospect and Salomon Brothers intend to abandon their obligations and commitments to Meritor in order to minimize their own losses, while leaving the investment partnerships without sufficient funds to satisfy their obligations to Meritor."
 
No Comment
 Spokesmen for Travelers and Salomon said over the weekend that it was their companies' policies not to discuss pending litigation.
According to partnership documents filed with the New York County Clerk's office in Manhattan in 1984, at least 216 former and current Salomon employees would have been participants in the real estate deals. They include many of Salomon's top officials at the time, including John H. Gutfreund, Thomas W. Strauss, John G. Meriwether, Paul W. Mozer, and Donald M. Feuerstein, all of whom left the firm shortly after the Treasury market scandals in August.
Other investors were Henry Kaufman, Salomon's former chief economist, and Lewis S. Ranieri, the father of its mortgage-backed operation, who was immortalized in the best-selling book, "Liar's Poker."
Many Properties Purchased
The partnerships were used to buy office buildings in Tampa, Fla.; Denver and San Antonio, as well as an apartment complex in Irving, Tex., long before problems in the real estate market and tax-law changes in 1986 made such deals unattractive.
The partnerships were but a few of the many investment vehicles in real estate and in oil and gas that Salomon often offered its wealthier employees.
"They were good investments," M. Jack Perkin, a former Salomon managing director who quit in 1988, said yesterday. He helped select the properties and remains an investor in the deals. "Back in the early 1980's, there was a lot of syndication going on, and this was another vehicle for key employees to invest in," he said.
 
Defaults and an Injunction
 For some time, the properties have not been generating enough income to pay the partnerships' debts, including the $59 million in Meritor loans. Prospect was thought to have been making up the difference up until April, when the loans defaulted.
Meritor, a savings institution rebounding from financial difficulties in the 1980's, in July had disclosed $59 million in new problem loans, a 13 percent increase to its nonperforming assets.
But the savings bank did not disclose the identity of the borrower or the nature of the problem, even though it had already won a temporary injunction from the Common Pleas Court.
The June 5 injunction bars the defendants from "entering into any agreement or understanding with one another" that would violate the partnerships' agreements to Meritor and prohibits the partnerships from making any distributions to the defendants.
 
Earnings Due Today
 Meritor investors who learned of the lawsuit last week were told the bank would disclose more information about the loans today when it reports its third-quarter earnings.
"I just think it's interesting that Travelers is running full-page ads saying you can rely on us, and they're just walking away from an obligation," said Gary E. Hindes, the chairman of the Delaware Bay Company, a Meritor stockholder.
Mr. Hindes said he was disappointed that the Salomon partnerships might have been slow to pursue Travelers for the money.

HEADLINE: Bentsen Calls For Tax Cuts And I.R.A.'s

BYLINE: By IRVIN MOLOTSKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Senator Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Finance Committee, called today for a tax cut intended to provide relief for middle-income taxpayers and provide a stimulus to the economy.
The measure by Senator Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, would reduce taxes by $72.5 billion over the next five years by allowing a tax credit of $300 for each child 18 years old or younger in a family and restoring the availability of Individual Retirement Accounts to all taxpayers, regardless of income. The cuts would be paid for by a 5 percent reduction in military spending.
 
Improved Odds for a Tax Change
 Given that President Bush and the Republican leaders in Congress renewed their call just last week for a capital gains tax reduction to create more jobs, Mr. Bentsen's proposal would appear to improve the chances for passage of some kind of tax legislation this year.
But an aide to Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said Mr. Rostenkowski did not expect Congress to be able to act before adjourning in about a month. Mr. Rostenkowski is preparing an alternative proposal.
In addition, the Republicans are likely to oppose Senator Bentsen on the ground that he is making a gesture to take advantage of a political issue on which the Bush Administration may be vulnerable.
Mr. Bentsen denied such political motivations, maintaining in an interview: "I've been saying for months that I would introduce a bill to provide relief for middle-income Americans. I'm concerned very much about a double dip in the recession. The Administration is just now talking about a stimulant."
The White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, repeated the Administration's preference for a cut in the capital gains tax and incentives for investment in research and development, when he was asked about the Bentsen proposal today on the ABC News program "This Week With David Brinkley."
Mr. Sununu, speaking of the lagging economic recovery, said, "The problem is that our job growth is not as fast as we would like it." But he asserted that "the turnaround occurred back in May and June."
 
Seeks to Stimulate Economy
 Senator Bentsen issued his proposal in the form of a statement released by his office staff here and discussed it today on the CBS News program "Face the Nation." Later, in a telephone interview from San Diego, he said his plan was not an attempt to pre-empt the Republicans on the question.
"They've been trying to talk their way out of the recession," he said. His own plan, he said, would "help give a jump-start to the economy."
The committee that Senator Bentsen heads has among its responsibilities the writing of tax measures. The Texas Democrat said he had discussed his proposals on Friday with both Mr. Rostenkowski and George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic majority leader in the Senate.
Mr. Bentsen said that neither had seen details of his plan but that both were in favor of tax relief for middle-income Americans.
 
Other Ideas for Military Savings
 The aide to Mr. Rostenkowski said that he and the other Democratic leaders in the House were indeed in favor of such tax relief for the middle class but were not in favor of achieving it by using all the expected savings from military spending cuts.
Mr. Rostenkowski's alternatives, his aide said, would call for using part of the expected military savings to finance some new domestic programs and to help reduce the Federal deficit.
Senator Bentsen said his proposal would encourage Americans to save more, while reducing the taxes of the middle class and stimulating the economy. His proposed tax cuts and I.R.A. modifications would go into effect Jan. 1, while the reductions in military spending would start next Oct. 1.
Senator Bentsen estimated that the tax credits for families with children 18 years old and younger would cost the Treasury $60 billion over the next five years, while the I.R.A. changes would cost $12.5 billion.
A family of four with an annual income of $35,000 would save $600 on taxes a year, or 25 percent of their tax bill. Such taxpayers, he said, had seen their taxes rise during the last decade while their income fell by 5 percent, factoring in inflation.
Current law limits tax deductions for I.R.A.'s to individuals with annual incomes under $25,000 and families with incomes under $40,000, and only if they are not covered by a pension plan. Senator Bentsen seeks to allow all taxpayers to put up to $2,000 a year in I.R.A. accounts and deduct that amount when calculating their taxes.
 
A Return to Pre-1986 I.R.A.'s
 His proposal would return the Individual Retirement Account to the status it held before the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Under the 1986 changes, the tax breaks on I.R.A.'s were restricted to lower-income people in order to reduce the cost to the Treasury.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a Democratic member of the Finance Committee, suggested today on the ABC program that he supported the Bentsen proposal, though not with enthusiasm. "Nothing the matter with it," he said, adding with deliberate understatement that it "would do no harm."
But Senator Moynihan said the larger issue on which the United States ought to be focusing is the mounting interest on the national debt. "It's eating us alive," he said.

HEADLINE: Citing Corruption by Kenya Officials, Western Nations Are Canceling Aid

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Corruption among top Kenyan Government officials has become so pervasive that Western donors, no longer confident that their assistance is reaching the people it is intended for, are cutting their aid programs, Western diplomats and economists say.
Further, corruption is a deterrent to new investment in Kenya, economists and foreign officials say, and a Bush Administration official says the American Embassy here has told Washington in a report that it believes that President Daniel arap Moi and some of his top aides and relatives are the main offenders. 
 The problem of corruption in third-world nations is not a new one. But Kenya, with its capitalist economic practices and relatively efficient infrastructure, was long regarded by Western donors as a success story amid the economic rubble of Africa. The country has been rewarded with large increases in Western aid, both from the World Bank and individual donors.
 
Denmark Halting New Aid
 But now that story has changed, as shown by these developments:
*The Danish Government, until recently one of the biggest donors to Kenya, said Friday that it was immediately ending its 17-year support for rural development in Kenya after an audit showed that most of the nearly $40 million in that aid program "disappeared because of corruption." Last month, the Danes said they were freezing all new aid to Kenya.
*The British Government, the former colonial power, decided this year not to give Kenya money to subsidize oil prices for consumers, a European diplomat said, because British officials feared that the money would go to a powerful politician instead.
*For similar reasons, two Western diplomats said, the World Bank decided against an ambitious $100 million program with the Moi Government to promote the domestic energy production.
*The American and British embassies had to intervene to keep Citibank from leaving Kenya after a dispute with a Cabinet minister over repayment of loans, Western diplomats said.
 
'A Deleterious Effect'

"I don't know if Kenya is at the head of the class when it comes to corruption but they're a contender," the United States Ambassador, Smith Hempstone, said recently. "The state of the economy is extremely fragile, and corruption has a deleterious effect."
The first President of independent Kenya, Jomo Kenyatta, and his family amassed a large fortune in land, precious gems, ivory and casinos during his rule from 1963 to 1978. But economists here say the Kenyatta dealings were small compared with the systematic hold that Mr. Moi and some colleagues have acquired over the larger Kenyan economy of the 1980's and 1990's.
Even so, Kenya, which gained independence from Britain in 1963, has appeared attractive to Western aid donors because of its remarkably strong economy, especially as seen next to those of its war-torn neighbors, Somalia, Ethiopia, the Sudan, and Uganda and impoverished Tanzania.
Thus, foreign aid jumped from $200 million in 1986 to $1 billion in 1989. But a Western diplomat said that when Western donors meet in Paris next month to decide Kenya's aid for next year, they are likely to give Kenya less than it requested, in large part because of the corruption.
The practice of politicians demanding a share of a business is a deterrent to the new large-scale investment that Kenya needs to deal with its accelerating unemployment, a Western economist here said. A Western donor country's assessment said that private investment in Kenya fell by 12 percent last year. It was the first overall decline since 1982, when there was an attempted coup, the assessment said, although American officials noted that American private investment has been dwindling for the last decade.
In response to the pressure from aid donors, the Kenyan Government has announced that it is establishing an anticorruption unit to ferret out bribe takers. In a speech on Oct. 10, celebrating his 13th year in power, President Moi made special note of corruption.
"My Government is already aware of this problem and is taking appropriate measures to deal with it," he said in the speech at a crowded stadium here.
Last year, a Bush Administration official said, the American Embassy here reported to Washington in a cable that a "get rich now" philosophy pervaded the top echelon of Mr. Moi's Government.
The official said the embassy wrote that it was almost impossible to document the wealth of Kenyan officials. But the Embassy reported in another cable that the British High Commission estimated the wealth of Energy Minister Nicholas Biwott to be "hundreds of millions of dollars," chiefly in offshore holdings. As Cabinet Minister in charge of energy, Mr. Biwott's official monthly salary is 21,033 Kenyan shillings, about $750. A member of the Kalenjin tribe, to which President Moi also belongs, Mr. Biwott is considered to be President Moi's closest political confidant.
The Administration official said the embassy had reported in the "get-rich-now" cable that officials believed that four Kenyan Government officials and three relatives of Mr. Moi had greatly enriched themselves through their public office or access to officials. The embassy listed the officials as Mr. Moi; Mr. Biwott; Vice President George Saitoti, and the Permanent Secretary in the President's Office for Internal Security, Hezekiah Oyugi.
Efforts to interview Mr. Moi and Mr. Oyugi were unsuccessful. Mr. Biwott said by telephone that he would consider an interview, and when asked about being described by a Western embassy as having enriched himself through public office, he said: "I'm not aware of such cables. If you have any I will answer accordingly."
An Assistant Minister, John Keen, who works in the Office of the President, said in an interview that he could not comment on the specific names mentioned in the cable to Washington.
Mr. Keen, who has been criticizing recent anti-Western comments by Mr. Biwott and other Government officials, said he believed all Kenyan public officials and their wives should be made to declare their assets. He described the recent announcement to set up an anticorruption unit as falling "far below expectations."
"Either the cancer of corruption is killed or it will kill the state," Mr. Keen said.
The American Embassy here, describing what it called an example of personal financial gain through public office, reported that Mr. Moi was believed to be a partner in an oil refinery in Puerto Rico with an Israeli businessman. The embassy said two Kenyan businessmen were believed to operate as front men for the President and "cut" the President in on their deals. The embassy said Mr. Moi, who comes from a humble background and was a teacher before entering politics, is believed to have a share in a Nairobi casino and a hotel in the Masai Mara game park. The embassy also said it was believed that Mr. Moi had received a "seven-figure" commission when Kenya bought two airplanes from the European consortium Airbus Industrie in the late 1980s.
It is not illegal for public officials in Kenya to engage in private business.
Western diplomats in Nairobi as well as local businessmen said it was common for a handful of senior politicians to demand a share in the start-up of a company or to demand control once a company became successful. "If you come into Kenya and make a lot of money you are a target," a Western diplomat said.
 
Britain Denies Fuel Grants
 As Energy Minister, Mr. Biwott is in charge of a large section of the Kenyan economy, ranging from the oil industry, hydroelectricity, coastal development, pipeline construction and one of the largest government enterprises, Kenya Power and Lighting. Through this commanding position, Western diplomats and economists said, Mr. Biwott has been able to amass a large private fortune.
In response to a request for an interview, Mr. Biwott said he would grant an interview after a public inquiry into the killing of former Foreign Minister Robert Ouko, who was slain in February 1990. Government corruption has become an issue in the already lengthy Ouko inquiry, which lawyers here said they believed could last another six months.
At the height of the Persian Gulf crisis, when gas prices rose, the British Government decided not to grant about $7 million to Kenya for subsidizing consumer fuel costs. The British made similar grants in neighboring Uganda and Tanzania, but a European diplomat said the British felt that such a grant in Kenya would be siphoned off by the interests of Mr. Biwott.
Two Western diplomats said the World Bank had proposed spending about $100 million for domestic energy production, but could not get a commitment from Mr. Biwott that the program would be properly audited and thus canceled the plans.
In what Western diplomats described as the most disturbing intrusion into the private sector by a politician that they could explicitly document, companies belonging to Mr. Biwott brought legal action in June against the Nairobi branch of Citibank. Both the American and British embassies had to intervene to keep Citibank from leaving Kenya, the diplomats said.
The trouble arose when Citibank sought to collect on $14 million in loans to some of Mr. Biwott's companies. Western diplomats said Mr. Biwott's lawyers went to Kenya's High Court and got an injunction that blocked the bank from collecting on the loans, of which $11.2 million worth was secured by letters of credit in a Swiss bank account of Mr. Biwott.
 
Threat From Foreign Banks
 An American diplomat said a senior official in the embassy complained about Mr. Biwott's actions to the Vice President, Mr. Saitoti, saying Citibank and other foreign banks would leave Kenya if Mr. Biwott was able to avoid payment in this fashion. Western diplomats said a senior British diplomat conveyed a similar message to the Chief Judge of the High Court, Alan Hancox. Mr. Biwott held larger loans with the Nairobi branch of the British bank, Barclays, the diplomats said.
The injunction was then lifted at a court hearing before the judge who had granted it.

HEADLINE: TURKEY'S LEADERS TRAIL OPPOSITION

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, Monday, Oct. 21

 BODY:
President Turgut Ozal's eight-year domination of Turkish politics, which saw a radical transformation to free-market economics and the establishment of a close working relationship with the United States, appeared to be in jeopardy today as early results pointed to his party's defeat in Sunday's parliamentary elections.
A loss could usher in a weaker coalition government that might thwart some of the economic reforms and policies that have raised Turkey's profile among Western nations. 
 It appeared unlikely that any of the three main political parties would win more than 30 percent of the vote. Turkish television said unofficial results from about 15 million votes counted gave the opposition True Path Party 27.6 percent of the vote compared with the governing Motherland Party's 24.1 percent.
The True Path Party is led by Suleyman Demirel, who has been Prime Minister six times and was twice removed from office by the military.
 
Kurdish Rebels an Issue
 True Path leaders, who spent most of the campaign attacking President Ozal, advocate tougher measures against Kurdish insurgents in the southeast and promise to end what they say is rampant corruption and nepotism in the Government.
Mr. Demirel, the party leader, told reporters at his home early today that he expected to win about 30 percent of the vote, but refused to discuss possible partners in a coalition government.
"It's too early to say if we can come to power by ourselves," he said.
" can't say anything about a coalition at the moment . . . "You can't cut cloth for the nappy of an unborn child," he added, quoting a Turkish saying.
The Social Democratic Populist Party, which rejects the privatization of remaining state enterprises, was in third place with 20.8 percent of the vote. In fourth place with 16.3 percent was the Welfare Party, a coalition of a religious fundamentalist party and a right-wing nationalist party. The Welfare Party could influence the makeup of any coalition government.
Because of complicated election rules, it may be a week before seats in Parliament are officially parceled out. Under Turkish election law, it is possible for a party to acquire a clear majority in the 450-seat Parliament without taking a large percentage of the popular vote.
In the last election in 1987, the Motherland Party did just that, taking 65 percent of the seats with only 35 percent of the vote. Parties need at least 10 percent to seat candidates.
 
A Referendum on Ozal
 The elections were largely a referendum on the political future of Mr. Ozal, a close ally of the United States and the man who has championed Turkey's transition to a free market and its opening to the West.
He gave strong backing to the allied effort in the Persian Gulf war, allowing American planes to conduct bombing strikes against Iraq from Turkish soil. He has softened Turkey's stance in the Cyprus dispute with Greece, and has lifted some of the restrictions on the country's 10 million Kurds.
Opposition candidates across the political spectrum have pledged to remove Mr. Ozal from office, playing on fears that he might give up Turkish claims to Cyprus and hand the country's Kurds enough power to slip out of Turkish control. The opposition charges that in shifting the country's domestic and foreign policy, the President has exceeded the constitutional powers of his largely ceremonial office.
"Our first priority," said Erdal Inonu, the head of the Social Democratic Populist Party, "is to change the Constitution and have Parliament elect a new President."
Mr. Ozal's term ends in 1996, but opposition candidates charged that his election in 1989 by the Parliament that his party controls was unconstitutional. To order new elections, the opposition will have to have two-thirds of the 450 parliamentary seats.
The election is the third since 1983, when the country returned to civilian rule after a military coup in 1980.
 
Political Paralysis Feared
 The coalition partners that ruled in the 1970's before the coup often bickered and threw the government into near paralysis, something Western diplomats fear could happen again if there is no clear winner in this election.
Turkey's next government faces major economic and political challenges, including maintaining ties to the West in the post-cold-war era.
Turkish officials are worried that the country's strategic importance to the West could decline now that the Soviet Union, Turkey's neighbor, poses much less of a threat to global security.
The demise of President Ozal's Motherland Party could well see a cooling of relations with Washington, but what worries Western diplomats most is a weak coalition government that would usher in a period of instability, throwing one of the West's most important regional partners into turmoil.
Turkey's transformation over the last decade has been dramatic.
The Government has installed a working phone system and electricity in most of the remote corners of the country.
 
Stores Now Well Stocked
 Stores, whose shelves once housed a few shabby locally made products, are overflowing with foreign imports and Turkish-made products that sell competitively in Europe. An increase in exports and tourism have taken some of the strain out of the country's payments on its $43.7 billion foreign debt.
But the country is also wracked by a 71 percent inflation rate, and many voters, as well as members of the governing party, resent the accumulation of power and wealth by many in Mr. Ozal's family.

HEADLINE: Hollywood Journal;
City Tosses Bit of Beauty at Its Blight

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Oct. 20

 BODY:
For decades, illusion has made this town famous. Now, the ability to blur the line between what is and what seems to be has been enlisted in a campaign to transform Hollywood. The result can be glimpsed at the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Western Avenue.
There, the Community Redevelopment Agency of Los Angeles has created what just might be the quintessential Hollywood amenity. Its sole purpose is to look good. It is temporary. And it will be seen primarily by people driving by. 
 The agency spent $50,000 to turn a menace and an eyesore into a garden. It replaced a trash-strewn empty lot frequented by homeless people, muggers, crack dealers and prostitutes and with sculptures, bougainvillea, oleander and flax.
The site, dubbed Metro Gardens, makes for a lovely street corner view, but it is only a view. No one will stroll, picnic or sit there. Fearful the danger would return and the same people who once made the lot an embarrassment would ruin its new features, the redevelopment agency surrounded it with a high iron fence. In 1994, the garden, the fence and the artworks will give way to a station on Los Angeles's new subway line.
"This was one of the worst crime-infested places anywhere," explained Councilman Michael Woo, the Los Angeles official whose district includes Hollywood. "We couldn't have a real park there. We couldn't afford the 24-hour-a-day security that would be necessary to guarantee people's safety. I'm satisfied this was the best use we could make of it."
Felicidad A. Guzman, whose apartment overlooks the lot, said: "There was always these guys selling drugs, asking for money. I just didn't want to walk by. Now you can walk by."
At street level, Hollywood shows little of the glamour associated with its name. South of the hills dotted with mansions lie areas of poverty, homelessness and crime. Gangs, once limited to the southern and eastern parts of Los Angeles, are now fixtures.
Five years ago, the city and the redevelopment agency approved a 30-year, $922 million program to return Hollywood to its former glory, but the promised commercial and social revival will take years. Until then, Mr. Woo and the redevelopment agency plan to make small-scale beautification projects like Metro Gardens a regular sight.
If the trees and shrubs of Metro Garden seem to deny the surrounding reality, Adam J. Leventhal, the sculptor commissioned by the agency, confronted it. In his "Homeless Ghost," a pair of disembodied hands pushes a shopping cart. "It's all about how we make our problems invisible when we can't deal with them," he said.
The redevelopment agency would not win any popularity contests around Los Angeles. It has a reputation of catering to developers while imperiously disregarding the poor. Residents in Hollywood fear the agency will do there what it did in the 1960's to downtown Los Angeles, where thousands of people were evicted to make way for skyscrapers.
But a recent demonstration against Metro Gardens at its dedication attracted only four protesters against use of tax money for landscaping and art. The project was just an attempt to cover up the problems of the poor, they charged, and fencing off the lot would only force the criminal element to move down the block.
Mr. Leventhal disputed their conclusions. "If people think that by keeping an empty lot open they're helping homeless people, that's pretty weak," he said.
He added: "The city is absolutely not doing enough about the problems that affect people who don't have money. But it's not a choice between that and art. You have to have both. I think Los Angeles is on the verge of total entropy, of breakdown, of becoming a completely dysfunctional city. But I also think art is an issue of survival."

HEADLINE: Louisiana Puts Ex-Klan Leader In Runoff Race

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Oct. 20

 BODY:
State Representative David Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, won a spot in the runoff election for governor of Louisiana on Saturday, but Republican officials in Washington disavowed him today as a racist who would win no support from the national party.
Mr. Duke finished second in the open primary on Saturday and today promoted himself as a new leader of the Republican Party's conservative mainstream. He will face Edwin W. Edwards, a former three-term Governor who is a Democrat, in a runoff election on Nov. 16.
 
Thanking the Rank and File
 
 Gov. Buddy Roemer, who was elected four years ago as a Democrat and who became a Republican in March, finished third in the primary, despite the public backing of President Bush and the national Republican Party. The state party, however, backed Representative Clyde C. Holloway.
In unofficial returns with all but two of 3,927 precincts reporting, Mr. Edwards led the 12-candidate field with 516,119 votes, or 34 percent; Mr. Duke had 484,923, or 32 percent; Mr. Roemer had 408,904, or 27 percent, and Mr. Holloway had 82,785, or 5 percent, The Associated Press reported.
"The rank-and-file Republicans of this state voted for me, and the rank-and-file Republicans in this country believe the way I believe," Mr. Duke said at a news conference today.
"I think I offer a tremendous opportunity for the Republican Party," he said. "I am the first Republican candidate that actually bridges the gap between fiscal conservatives and labor."
John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, was among several Republican leaders in Washington who tried to distance themselves from Mr. Duke today. "The President is absolutely opposed to the kind of racist statements that have come out of David Duke now and in the past," Mr. Sununu said on the ABC News program "This Week."
Mary Matalin, the chief of staff of the Republican National Committee, said when asked in an interview if Mr. Duke would receive any assistance from the party, "unequivocally, it is not possible." She added: "He is not a Republican. We never considered him a Republican. There will be no involvement in his campaign whatsoever."
The results of Saturday's voting represented a major setback for the Republican Party in its highly publicized effort to make inroads in this historically Democratic state.
 
Bush's Help Didn't
 Mr. Roemer was defeated after a switch to the Republican Party last spring that was partially engineered by Mr. Sununu. He lost despite the fact that his campaign was managed by professional Republican organizers dispatched from Washington. Even personal appearances by both President Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle did not hand Mr. Roemer the Republicans' core vote in Louisiana.
It was Mr. Duke who amassed much of the vote in Republican strongholds like the lakeside suburbs of New Orleans and in Mr. Roemer's home territory in northwest Louisiana.
According to Louisiana law all candidates regardless of party affiliation appear on the same ballot in an open primary, and if none win a majority of the vote the top two candidates face each other in a runoff.
Mr. Edwards, a flamboyant Cajun who has been a towering presence in Louisiana politics for 25 years, won with heavy support from black voters in what proved to be a tight, highly polarized election.
Defeated by Mr. Roemer in the 1987 election amid accusations of corruption, Mr. Edwards, 64 years old, hammered at what he called Mr. Roemer's unfulfilled promises from that campaign. Calling Mr. Roemer "pompous and preachy," Mr. Edwards depicted the incumbent as an ineffective leader who had failed to enact much of his own agenda.
A Harvard-educated technocrat, Mr. Roemer, 48, focused much of his campaign effort on promoting his education policies. However, his most recent initiative in that field was a new teacher evaluation system that produced a bitter conflict with the Legislature and the teachers' unions. As with his efforts on the environment and tax reform, Mr. Roemer had a hard time pointing at obvious accomplishments.
Mr. Roemer lost the election in the state's major metropolitan areas, where he ran more poorly than expected, ceding the votes of many affluent, well-educated whites to Mr. Duke.
 
Veiled References to Race
 While proclaiming that a religious conversion had led him from the hate-filled beliefs of his youth, Mr. Duke, 41, waged a campaign that played on the economic fears and racial biases of white working class voters.
Although he rarely made explicit references to race, Mr. Duke used thinly veiled racial code words to make blacks his scapegoats, for example promising to cut the costs of social services by reducing "the illegitimate welfare birthrate." Yet, Mr. Duke also echoed positions taken by President Bush and other Republican leaders when he vowed not to raise taxes and labeled racial hiring quotas as unfair to qualified whites.
Although he has repeatedly been disavowed by both the state and the national Republican Party organizations since he marched onto the political stage two years ago, Mr. Duke told a victory rally early this morning, "We are Republicans, and we are committed to equal rights."
His supporters serenaded him with rousing renditions of "Dixie" and the "Battle Hymn of the Republic."
Pronouncing himself unconcerned that national Republican leaders would deny him assistance in the runoff campaign, Mr. Duke said, "I don't think they have helped any Republicans by getting involved so far."
Mr. Duke's involvement with the Klan dates back to his teen-age years. He reached the rank of grand wizard before quitting in 1980. In the 1970's he openly espoused Nazism.
 
A Yeltsin? 'I Like That'
 Now that he is seeking an electoral platform for his views, Mr. Duke's attempt to portray himself as a mainstream Republican serves several political purposes, said Ed Renwick, a professor of political science at Loyola University in New Orleans.
"First of all, Duke clearly wants to set himself up as a national figure and may be thinking about entering the Presidential primaries or something like that," Mr. Renwick said. "Also, he is trying to get respectability by putting on the clothes of a Republican candidate as opposed to the wardrobe of his unsavory past."
In this campaign Mr. Duke repeatedly touted himself as the leader of a new conservative political movement. "What we are doing down here in Louisiana is going to have a lot of impact all over the United States of America," he said at his news conference today. "I think the working people of this country are ready for a real change in government."
He said he saw this movement extending across the world, with him as a leader. "One person described me as the Boris Yeltsin of American politics," he said. "I like that."
 
Two Checkered Pasts
 In his concession speech early this morning, Mr. Roemer spoke of Mr. Duke's appeal to voters without ever identifying his opponent by name. "I would not discount this state," he said. "There is a lot of anger and anxiety in America. It is something that must be dealt with, and politicians have to do a better job of that."
James Brady, chairman of the Louisiana Democratic Party, said today: "There is no doubt that people, particularly middle class whites, are frustrated with government in general. They don't see government as on their side. I think Duke capitalized on that, promoting every buzzword available."
Mr. Duke and Mr. Edwards had a chance encounter at the Louisiana Superdome today, where the New Orleans Saints were playing football. The two candidates were smiling and cordial with each other despite the fact that they represent radically different political views and constituencies.
Indeed, since the primary results put them in the runoff against each other both have repeatedly stated that they will refrain from personal attacks based on their pasts.
While Mr. Duke is trying to shed his Klansman's image, Mr. Edwards is trying to bury his image as a rapscallion figure who was a habitual Las Vegas gambler and who was twice tried, but never convicted, on Federal corruption charges in the 1980's.
Mr. Edwards said today, "I want it well understood that I will not run any kind of negative campaign. It is useless to dwell in the past."
But there is a fundamental difference between the two candidates that may affect how their pasts play out in the campaign. Mr. Edwards has held high elected office in this state many times, and many times the voters have overlooked the more rakish aspects of his character. Mr. Duke is now for the first time seriously contesting a position of major responsibility.
"Duke has been an easy protest vote so far," Mr. Renwick said. "But this time voting for Duke can't just be a protest. It will be a vote to make him governor of the state and to give him all the executive power of that office."

HEADLINE: Tiny Babies, Big Problems

 BODY:
One can see them in neonatal intensive care units all over the country: tiny babies hitched up to a bewildering array of tubes and monitors. Some are too frail even to wail. Most will live long enough to leave the hospital; the majority of the very tiniest will have neurological damage; and many will incur staggering medical bills.
The price some of their parents pay in emotional anguish, and that some of the babies may pay in physical pain, is of course beyond reckoning. Although a neonatal intensive care unit can be a place of joy, the smallest of these babies usually face a grim future -- or no future at all. 
 The tragedy is that many of these too-early births could have been prevented with better prenatal care for the mothers or more widespread contraceptive services to protect teen-agers.
Every year the United States sees the birth of 45,000 babies weighing less than three and a half pounds and more than two months premature. As recent articles by the New York Times reporters Elisabeth Rosenthal, Gina Kolata and Jane E. Brody point out, the smallest of them can pose profound ethical problems.
When, for instance, should one cease treating a tiny baby whose setbacks after birth -- brain bleeding, say, and cardiac arrest -- make a grim prognosis even grimmer? Who should make the decision? One mother concerned about her desperately ill premature infant was told by the doctor: "You don't make these decisions. We do."
How much better it would be if such suffering could be headed off at the start. By contraception, for example. Children born to mothers who are still children tend to be very small. Yet every year some 35,000 babies are born to girls under the age of 15. After discounting for inflation, Federal funding for contraceptive services has fallen by almost two-thirds since 1980.
Better health care could help. Many children born to crack-addicted mothers are dangerously underweight. But drug treatment slots for the pregnant are few and far between. More broadly, millions of American women don't get comprehensive prenatal care that is routine in Western Europe.
Those programs are costly. But the cost cannot match the price America now pays to care for very-low-birth-weight babies. Intensive care for premature infants costs more than $2,000 a day, and the medical bills can run to nearly half a million dollars. If the premature baby suffers long-term damage, the cost of continuing care and education may be formidable.
Medical technology has met the challenge of keeping tiny babies alive. The greater challenge is to reduce the need for those marvelous machines.

HEADLINE: Coming Back;
Get Guns Off the Street

 BODY:
Last year, gunfire killed 1,559 New Yorkers, including numerous innocents hit by bullets meant for others. The gunfire did something else, just as destructive in its own way: It raised the fear level among seven million New Yorkers.
Hoodlums with guns have long been part of New York City. But suddenly the guns are more ubiquitous and powerful, the hoodlums younger and more volatile. Citizens who might once have challenged someone smoking on the subway hesitate now, for fear of a lethal response. Guns are drawn over aggressive driving, casual insults, petty thefts. 
 Removing illegal guns from the streets would dramatically enhance safety and reduce fear. New strategies for gun control are acutely needed; most can be pursued within current budgets, if the Mayor and Police Commissioner will focus on the need. The gun problem has assumed emergency proportions. It demands an emergency response.
New York City's Sullivan law, one of the nation's strictest, licenses only people who show clear need to carry guns. But tough licensing is not enough when social and economic forces expand the trade in illegal guns as a deadly side effect of drug traffic. Crack dealers, younger and wilder than the old-line gangsters who managed the heroin trade, consider 9-millimeter semiautomatic handguns, sawed-off shotguns and military assault rifles essential.
As the crack culture grew more entrenched, gun toting became something even for "good" kids to emulate. No one knows how many illegal guns are on the streets, but homicide statistics confirm the alarming trend: In 1990, guns were used in 69 percent of homicides; in 1980, it was 58 percent.
Unchallenged, the spread of guns makes a joke of existing laws. A state law imposing a one-year sentence for illegal gun possession has had little effect. And so far, police have taken a number of well-intended but inadequate steps. A year-old task force of 12 officers working with 12 Federal agents has arrested 154 traffickers and seized 496 weapons. And the department keeps pushing to close legal loopholes, like one permitting gun traffickers to obtain Federal licenses although unlicensed locally.
But given the thousands of illegal weapons on the streets, those are bare gestures. Much remains to be tried. In theory, it would seem desirable to increase police authority to search citizens for guns and confiscate any illegal weapons so found. But confiscation raises difficult legal and policy issues. By long tradition, the N.Y.P.D. has resisted mass arrest sweeps or "stop and frisk" strategies sometimes attempted in Los Angeles and other cities. The state's highest court has set high thresholds of suspicion that must be met before police can search for illegal guns, based on constitutional issues not easily altered by new state legislation.
Even so, there's room for much more to be done. The department might, for example, encourage people fearful of neighbors with guns to report confidentially over a citywide hot line. Minimal follow-up like review of criminal records could develop enough data to justify searches, confiscations and arrests. New Orleans operates such a hot line successfully; a well-publicized line in New York could yield hundreds of calls.
Police could also move more forcefully against students carrying guns to school. The schools can afford metal detectors in only 15 of 120 high schools. Those detectors sharply reduce gun-related incidents. If the city can't turn up the needed money, private donors might be approached. In the meantime, police and school safety officers could do more to identify armed students and confiscate guns.
Officials might also persuade owners of bars and clubs to install metal detectors where patrons are known to carry guns. Metal detectors might be used at post offices, welfare centers, the Department of Motor Vehicles and other high-traffic agencies. The Transit Authority might even find a way to incorporate weapons detection in new turnstiles.
Illegal guns, fast becoming New York's top public safety problem, provide a perfect target for Police Commissioner Lee Brown's new emphasis on problem-oriented policing. Concentrating even a small part of the department's new resources on confiscation and suppression of guns could yield a lopsided payoff in preserving the quality of New Yorkers' lives. And their lives.

Breaking the Logjam

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
No one who knows the Middle East will celebrate yet. The substance of a successful negotiation, the give-and-take needed to make it work, is still hard to envisage. But there are going to be negotiations, starting next week in Madrid, and that is remarkable enough.
For the first time in its 43 years as a state, Israel will meet face-to-face with each of its Arab neighbors -- and with representative Palestinians. All the issues between them will be on the table: peace, security, land, people.
It is going to happen now because of George Bush and James Baker. Secretary of State Baker spent much of the last five months wheedling and pushing the intractable parties. But his success was possible only because the President had the vision and the courage to commit himself to this conference.
Mr. Bush seized the moment, after the Persian Gulf war, for a new effort at Arab-Israeli peace. He understood that some fundamental power relationships had changed. Those changes, still going on, offer hope for an onset of reason in the Middle East.
The end of the cold war has had an immediate impact on the region. Soviet military support for Syria has ebbed, making President Assad look to improved relations with the United States. Israeli and American fear of Communist influence has abated, making possible a joint Soviet-American invitation to Madrid that in the past would have caused alarm.
The decline in Soviet power is also having a profound impact on U.S.-Israeli relations. It has weakened, or removed, one basis for the close ties of recent decades and for massive U.S. aid: the idea that Israel was a strategic asset for America in a vital part of the world.
The gulf war showed that U.S. armed forces could act in the Middle East without Israel. In that war, indeed, Israel was a complication rather than an asset in U.S. military calculations.
Americans are still committed to help Israel, for reasons of history and conscience. But it is clear that a more detached relationship is developing, one in which America will more freely weigh its own values and interests. The Economist wrote last month:
"Americans still express their moral commitment to Israel's survival; but Israel's moral case grows steadily weaker as it refuses to extend to the Palestinians the right of self-determination that has become a cornerstone of the emerging world order. A peace which left Israel ruling over millions of voteless Palestinians has become unthinkable."
Israelis are increasingly aware that they cannot expect unconditional support from the United States -- that they can maintain the vital American connection only by paying attention to American interests. President Bush made that bluntly clear when he postponed consideration of loan guarantees: too bluntly, most Israelis thought, but they understood the larger point.
In this new relationship, the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 are the crunch. U.S. policy is to end Israeli control of the West Bank and Gaza and their more than 1,500,000 Palestinian inhabitants. Prime Minister Shamir and much of his Government are committed to creeping annexation of the territories.
A new political choice is therefore shaping up for Israel: Keep the occupied territories or keep American support.
Economic realities are also pushing Israel to make a choice about the occupied territories. The reasons are explored in depth by Bernard Avishai in the forthcoming November-December issue of the Harvard Business Review.
The $10 billion sought from the United States in loan guarantees is to build housing for Soviet immigrants to Israel. But if those immigrants are to have jobs, Mr. Avishai says, Israel will need two or three times that much in investment capital from the world. And Israel will have to change its protective economic policies and become part of the global market, using its special scientific and intellectual talents.
But there will be no large-scale foreign investment, Mr. Avishai writes, and no long-term contracts with Israeli firms, while the world sees insecurity over the issue of the occupied territories. "Israel can have the Whole Land of Israel or it can have a piece of the global economy."

Reading Mario's Mind

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

 BODY:
When I was in Tokyo last month, they asked me what the possibility was that I would run for President. I told them that question was too easy.
If they had asked me, "Do you think there is a possibility that while the Governor of New York is in Japan there will be an earthquake and a typhoon in two days?" I would have said, "Not likely." But of course -- there was an earthquake and a typhoon in those two days. So the unlikely sometimes happens.
But I can't get away with this cuteness routine forever. I've been saying I have no plans to run, and no plans to make plans, but now it's a year to Election Day and it's time to stop playing Hamlet and start playing for keeps. 
 Of course I'm running, and not just for the exercise; this thing gets more winnable every day.
The media are so naive. They phrase their questions in convoluted ways to be first to drag an announcement out of me, and they miss the opening of the campaign that's been going on for months in California.
That's where the nomination (and the election) will be won. It's the biggest state, plenty of ethnics and minorities, where I can win big. I want the California primary to be moved up early in the spring, so I can put the nomination on ice quickly and focus on Bush.
Of course, the President knows that, and wants me to lose a few Southern primaries, which is why his California Republicans are trying to keep their primary in June. That's the first skirmish of the campaign of '92, and the pundits, typically, are waiting around for a press release.
I like the Democrats now in the field running to be my running mate. Rockefeller or Gore might have been trouble, but these new guys are perfect for clearing out the political underbrush.
Harkin of Iowa, the old-line liberal, doesn't have a chance, but he has the best one-liner so far. "George Bush was born on third base and thinks he hit a triple." Great line, not only about Bush's rich childhood, but about taking credit for seven Presidents' battle against Communism. I'll give Harkin full credit, but I'm the one who played semi-pro baseball and that gag belongs in my stump speech.
Clinton of Arkansas is the best organized, and he has his centrist message together. Him I like, and I need a Southern WASP, but he's another Governor, and the damn gossipmongers will be all over him. Be a good campaign chairman, nice contrast to Sununu or Mosbacher.
My man is Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. Lost part of his leg winning the Medal of Honor -- untouchable. Can you just see my Kerrey up against Bush's Quayle? Let Bush try to wrap himself in the flag again; "my running mate Senator Kerrey, who doesn't have to remind you that he won the Medal of Honor in Vietnam . . ."
Now about strategy. We'll jujitsu Bush on his claim to foreign policy experience: America doesn't need a President of the World, we need a President of the United States. And his foreign policy has been overrated: he totally misread the breakup of the Soviet Union, and after all the fuss about defeating Saddam Hussein, the dictator is getting more dangerous because George Bush choked up at the end.
I'll hit him with the "Dirty Dozen." Bush's veto of the unemployment insurance bill was one; his veto of the bipartisan civil rights bill will be two. The Democratic leadership should pass 10 more bills the people need and want -- health, housing, education -- let the no-man in the White House do his "dirty dozen vetoes." I'll pledge to sign those 12 bills on Inaugural Afternoon -- and I'll keep my promise, unlike that phony no-tax promise that he won on and broke.
Let him try his Dukakis stuff with me, sailing around New York harbor and whatnot -- he'll never know what hit him. George Bush stole $6 billion from the states this year, on top of being the slowest-growth President since Hoover. Are you better off than you were four years ago with "Mr. Veto" in the White House, paralyzed in the face of recession?
You think I'd sit tight like those bozos when Bush's hatchet men smeared Anita Hill? Not a chance. Americans like a scrapper, an underdog in the polls who will stand up against the smug no-men, and just watch those polls turn around when I make my prime-time speech at the convention in New York, and when I get to him in those televised debates.
I can hardly wait. Then what am I waiting for?

HEADLINE: After Judging Thomas, Senators Face the Public

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Oct. 20

 BODY:
The Senate Judiciary Committee's heated hearings into Clarence Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court and whether he was guilty of sexual harassment reverberated well beyond Capitol Hill.
Record numbers of viewers watched the televised sessions for hour after riveting hour, and by the end of the inquiry, judgment was being passed not only on Judge Thomas but also on members of the Judiciary Committee, the judicial nominating process and the Senate generally. 
 While Judge Thomas eventually won confirmation, visits to four states make clear that the drama is not over for members of the Judiciary Committee.
The offices of many Senators have been inundated by phone calls, letters and telegrams from constituents who were pleased or angered by the hearings. The volume and tone of the communications are such that they cannot be ignored, particularly by those senators who face re-election next year or who have never been on particularly solid political footing in their home states.
At least one poll, conducted by the Gallup Organization after the hearings, found that roughly one of every two viewers who watched a significant amount of the inquiry came away feeling less confident about Congress and the Congressional process.
Further, the poll found that of the leading members of the Judiciary Committee, only its chairman, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, won a favorable rating from a majority of all viewers. Sixty-three percent said they were well impressed by his performance.
Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, won a favorable rating of 48 percent, Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, won a 41 percent favorable rating and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts won a 22 percent favorable rating, the lowest recorded. The poll, conducted on Oct. 14, was based on telephone interviews with 612 adults and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
Following are reports on how the hearings affected these legislators in their home states.
 
Massachusetts
Kennedy Assailed on Effectiveness
Senator Edward M. Kennedy has an entirely new political problem because of his muted role in the latest hearings on the nomination of Clarence Thomas for the Supreme Court.
He has been criticized, and ridiculed, for not taking a more active role in attacking Judge Thomas and defending Prof. Anita F. Hill, who accused the judge of sexual harassment.
But he also has a familiar and critical political advantage, the reluctance of formidable challengers. Gov. William F. Weld, the popular Republican who has been telling the Senator for months he would not oppose him in 1994, told his own staff last week that he would run for re-election as Governor then. He told them not to talk of him as a Senate possibility, a Weld intimate said Saturday.
And Mr. Kennedy has advantages of his own doing and position. No one else in Massachusetts could have done what he did tonight, holding a dinner for President Mary Robinson of Ireland, whom he hailed as also "the president of Irish everywhere." Scores of voting Irish-Americans were also his guests at the John F. Kennedy Library, looking across the harbor their ancestors crossed on the final yards of their trip to America.
Still, the issue of his effectiveness, or lack of it, in the Thomas fight is a political concern because it offers a new legitimacy to discussions of his personal life. As one supporter, Beverly Copeland, a management consultant from Brockton, said Saturday: "He has done a good job as a Senator. If he could just keep his private life private."
The new charge of ineffectiveness is also a concern politically, if only because it breaks unfamiliar ground. For nearly three decades, the angriest attacks on Mr. Kennedy have concerned what he did or tried to do, from passing civil rights bills to blocking Robert H. Bork's Supreme Court nomination to seeking national health insurance.
 
Many Complaints Remain
 There are still plenty of those complaints. Some long-time haters, like Mike Lopez, an East Bridgewater plumber, gleefully seize on the Thomas episode as evidence that "he's all washed up."
But fundamental Kennedy supporters also have their doubts now. Jim Canavan, a typesetter from Quincy, said, "He's still pushing for health care." But he added, "I think he's slipping a bit. It's his private life -- a little ridiculous for a man of his age."
Even more unkindly, an editorial in today's Boston Globe, a devoted ally over the years, accepted the general belief in Washington that his low profile in the hearings was caused by his own "reputation as a womanizer." That showed that "neither he nor his supporters can again assert that his private life has had no impact on the discharge of his public duties," the editorial concluded.
The Globe said, "It is exactly because he has been such an effective Senator" that his relative silence mattered.
More than anyone else on the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Kennedy is a national figure, and national criticism reverberates here.
But there are staunch voices of support, too. Ann F. Lewis, a consultant here, reminds disappointed feminists that it was Mr. Kennedy's staff that was in on the initial discovery of the accusation against Mr. Thomas. She said no other Senator was as dedicated a supporter of women's issues. "When someone has been your champion for a long time, you don't turn on him," she declared.
The Kennedy organization, while startled by such tokens of vulnerability as The Globe editorial is hard at work on the 1994 campaign. Mr. Kennedy is usually in the state three weekends a month, blaming President Bush for the sluggish economy, and no appropriations bill that helps the state passes without a press release.

HEADLINE: After Judging Thomas, Senators Face the Public

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ERIE, Pa., Oct. 19

 BODY:
The Senate Judiciary Committee's heated hearings into Clarence Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court and whether he was guilty of sexual harassment reverberated well beyond Capitol Hill.
Record numbers of viewers watched the televised sessions for hour after riveting hour, and by the end of the inquiry, judgment was being passed not only on Judge Thomas but also on members of the Judiciary Committee, the judicial nominating process and the Senate generally. 
 While Judge Thomas eventually won confirmation, visits to four states make clear that the drama is not over for members of the Judiciary Committee.
The offices of many Senators have been inundated by phone calls, letters and telegrams from constituents who were pleased or angered by the hearings. The volume and tone of the communications are such that they cannot be ignored, particularly by those senators who face re-election next year or who have never been on particularly solid political footing in their home states.
At least one poll, conducted by the Gallup Organization after the hearings, found that roughly one of every two viewers who watched a significant amount of the inquiry came away feeling less confident about Congress and the Congressional process.
Further, the poll found that of the leading members of the Judiciary Committee, only its chairman, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, won a favorable rating from a majority of all viewers. Sixty-three percent said they were well impressed by his performance.
Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, won a favorable rating of 48 percent, Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, won a 41 percent favorable rating and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts won a 22 percent favorable rating, the lowest recorded. The poll, conducted on Oct. 14, was based on telephone interviews with 612 adults and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
Following are reports on how the hearings affected these legislators in their home states.
 
Pennsylvania
A Split Decision On Specter's Role
 Mary Hosack and Margaretta Moore, both retired teachers, came to a union meeting on Saturday to talk about health benefits and pensions. It took very little to get them talking about the Thomas confirmation hearings instead.
"I think he did a very great deed," Mrs. Hosack, a Democrat, said of Senator Arlen Specter, a Republican. "He performed as he was asked to do."
Mrs. Moore, a Republican, disagreed. If he runs for a third term next year, she said, she does not plan to vote for him again.
"I thought he was unnecessarily nasty," she said as she left the early morning meeting. "His attitude was just mean-spirited."
The difference in opinion -- which often seems to have little to do with sex or party affiliation -- is typical of the debate in Mr. Specter's home state as the people he represents assess his role as Prof. Anita F. Hill's chief inquisitor during Judge Clarence Thomas's confirmation hearings.
Mr. Specter, who concluded publicly that Professor Hill had committed perjury while appearing before the Judiciary Committee, has been defending his statements and behavior ever since.
A moderate Republican who favors abortion rights and has long enjoyed the support of women's groups, Mr. Specter has ended up in a near no-win situation in his home state. Many women are mad at him; and while conservatives are pleased, even they still do not quite trust him.
And as Mr. Specter prepares to face a likely primary challenge next year from a conservative anti-abortion state legislator, Steven F. Friend, it has become crucial that he shore up his political base.
He made his first stab at that here Friday night, flying in from Washington to speak to a group of Erie County Republicans and to local reporters at a news conference.
In both forums, he spoke of the Thomas hearings and offered his defense of the high-profile role he was asked to take on.
Mr. Specter said in an interview last week that he became convinced that Professor Hill's credibility was questionable after he tried to pin her down on the details of her contacts with Democratic committee staff. "It was like a floodlight going on," he said.
 
Defense of Questioning
 He said in the interview that he had been just as tough on Judge Thomas.
"I asked him a lot of very strong questions," he said. "A lot stronger than I asked Miss Hill."
But conservatives still have suspicions about Mr. Specter, going back to his decision to vote against confirming Judge Robert H. Bork in 1987.
"Arlen usually gets all kinds of grief from the conservative part of the party," said Ann DiTullio, who works in the district office of Representative Tom Ridge, the Republican from the Erie area. "He's going to have 50 percent of the people mad at him all the time."
But the political down side could be limited. "Many of the people who are furious at him were never Arlen Specter voters," said Rick Robb, who ran the Reagan-Bush campaign in Pennsylvania in 1980 and 1984.
And Specter supporters see a man who did the honorable thing and who can only benefit from the national exposure he received.
Denise Illig-Robinson, a Republican member of the Erie City Council, said, "What helps him is that his name and his face were on CNN for that long."

HEADLINE: After Judging Thomas, Senators Face the Public

Delaware
Biden Is Hearing Plenty of Support
When Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. dropped by the Ranch House on Friday morning for a cup of coffee, the waitress scurried to meet him with a big hug.
"You were great," crooned the waitress, Ruth Martin. "You're my guy."
Almost everywhere the Delaware Democrat went on his home turf, he found a warm greeting and a good word for his efforts as chairman of the Judiciary Committee in its inquiry into the Supreme Court nomination of Clarence Thomas.
There were plenty of harsh words for other committee members, for the confirmation process in general, and for Judge Thomas and his accuser, Prof. Anita F. Hill. But for Mr. Biden, there was almost universal praise, with "fair" and "evenhanded" the words heard most often.
Some members of Congress and some students of the Congressional process have criticized him for calling the second round of Thomas hearings, or for not scheduling it sooner, or have accused him of running things too strictly or too loosely. But there is little of that criticism at the grass roots.
"Great job!" a Metroliner passenger called out in Union Station in Washington as the Senator, who commutes daily between Wilmington and Washington, hastened through.
 
'Natural' and 'Real'
 A woman struggling with two bags veered toward him.
"You did fine," she panted. "But you tell Specter and Hatch they're in trouble with the women of America."
In conversations with Mr. Biden about the Thomas hearings, few people mention his eventual vote, which was against Judge Thomas. Rather, the talk is mainly about the tone of the hearings and who was telling the truth.
"You tried to help everybody," said Phyllis Greenberg of Wilmington as Mr. Biden worked the booths and tables of the Ranch House restaurant. "I've got a place for you in my heart."
Another Ranch House patron, Don MacDonald, a retired chemical worker, said he was "tired, just tired" of watching Congress at work because so little progress was made and because many Congressional procedures had become acrimonious talk-fests. But even though he votes Republican, Mr. MacDonald had no harsh words for Mr. Biden, saying instead that the job of the Judiciary Committee chairman was "untenable given the group that's there to work with."
Since narrowly winning election to the Senate in 1972, Mr. Biden has never been in any real political difficulty in Delaware, easily winning three re-election victories. Last year he captured 63 percent of the vote, despite the baggage of an embarrassing 1988 run for President that he ended prematurely when he was accused of plagiarizing some passages in his speeches.
Still, at least one columnist, Norman A. Lockman of the News Journal in Wilmington, warned Mr. Biden that he must find a way to reform the judicial confirmation process, "or be held responsible for the corruption of a national governmental trust."
Mr. Biden says he intends to hold hearings on reform. He also wants to meet with President Bush to discuss the issue.
"We haven't heard the last of this," he said.

HEADLINE: After Judging Thomas, Senators Face the Public

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHEYENNE, Wyo., Oct. 17

 BODY:
The Senate Judiciary Committee's heated hearings into Clarence Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court and whether he was guilty of sexual harassment reverberated well beyond Capitol Hill.
Record numbers of viewers watched the televised sessions for hour after riveting hour, and by the end of the inquiry, judgment was being passed not only on Judge Thomas but also on members of the Judiciary Committee, the judicial nominating process and the Senate generally. 
 While Judge Thomas eventually won confirmation, visits to four states make clear that the drama is not over for members of the Judiciary Committee.

Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts won a 22 percent favorable rating, the lowest recorded. The poll, conducted on Oct. 14, was based on telephone interviews with 612 adults and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
Following are reports on how the hearings affected these legislators in their home states.
 
Wyoming
Simpson Assailed For Speaking Out
The unvarnished style of Senator Alan K. Simpson has long been revered here as pure Wyoming, as stark and rugged as the untamed high plains. To some voters, his pugnacious performance on the Judiciary Committee last weekend marked him as a rare politician who really says what he thinks, rather than affecting a phony civility.
But to others, Mr. Simpson's behavior reflected something else about the state: the ferocious, howling wind. In interviews this week, many said his attacks on Prof. Anita F. Hill seemed cruel. And his shouted diatribe against Nina Totenberg, who reports on the Supreme Court for National Public Radio and first interviewed Professor Hill's about her accusations of sexual harassment against Judge Clarence Thomas, did not square with his image as a tall, self-effacing cowboy from Cody.
"I thought he made a total ass of himself, and he won't get my vote again," said Barbara Martin, a 42-year-old secretary for an oil company. "He was completely out of line."
To be sure, many other voters still regard the third-term Senator as a hero. "Simpson is almost like God in this state," said Joe Yoksh, a 24-year-old bartender who usually votes Democratic. "He's like the people out here. He's a good old boy -- plain-spoken, regular and honest as they come."
 
Politics With Personal Feel
 In this thinly populated state, where almost everyone can claim to have met Mr. Simpson and he is simply called Al, politics has a distinctly personal feeling. Personality can count for as much as a voting record. And it was Mr. Simpson's style, not his political leanings, that has been the talk across Wyoming.
Before, during and after the Senate confirmation hearings, Senator Simpson figured in one highly publicized sideshow after another. After appearing on the ABC News program "Nightline," he followed Ms. Totenberg into the parking lot and lambasted her for disclosing the accusations.
In a television interview, he said that Professor Hill was a "dupe" of liberal forces opposing Judge Thomas. In a remark that was widely condemned as unfair, Mr. Simpson alluded to a sheaf of affadavits that he said would discredit Professor Hill's character and reveal her "proclivities," a loaded word that prompted harsh criticism from one Wyoming newspaper.
In an editorial, The Wyoming Eagle in Cheyenne characterized Mr. Simpson's remarks as an "appalling fashion for a politician who repeatedly stresses the need for fairness." The editorial went on, "It was a remarkably cheap shot in a hearing that was dominated by such action."
A spokeswoman for Mr. Simpson said that during and after the hearings there had been thousands of calls to his office in Washington, , and added that they had been running about even, for and against.
But Marcia White, 54, who owns a vitamin manufacturing company in Douglas, said critics of Mr. Simpson simply do not understand the man.
"The feminists are upset with him, but he is truly very respectful of women," she said.

HEADLINE: Seeking the Serum to Cure Hospital Emergency Room Crises

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I commend your Oct. 8 editorial addressing what has become a crisis in this city's hospital emergency rooms, and the emergency that prevails at Kings County Hospital. The hospital lies within my Congressional district, and I have participated over recent years in many community efforts to improve staffing and care, only to see these attempts at a cure fail for lack of the one serum that could do the job: adequate financing. 
 Kings County Hospital's Emergency Room is by far the busiest in New York City and, unfortunately, many thousands come to the E.R. because past recommendations for more decentralized clinics have been ignored, and these people have no other source for medical services. The community suffers from too many who are unemployed or too poor to pay for health care; thousands of others have low-paid jobs but, like some 30 million workers in this country, they have no protective health care insurance. I have invited community leaders to meet with me to reinstate an Emergency Care Task Force and to establish a special subcommittee to cope with the problems of the embattled Kings County Emergency Room.
The key to a long-range solution lies in legislation to establish a universal health care system for all Americans. I am a co-sponsor of the Russo bill (H.R. 1300), which represents the most promising move in this direction.

The Latin Market Comes Back

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
FOR decades, Latin America was a hugely important marketplace for the United States -- one that largely shut down in the 1980's when the Latin nations fell far behind in their debt payments. These countries are still deeply in arrears. But nearly a decade after the onset of the foreign-debt crisis, Latin America is re-emerging as a big buyer of American goods and a big borrower.
The comeback is quite bullish. This month alone, the Latin nations have borrowed nearly $900 million abroad. And United States exports to Latin countries are approaching the levels of the golden 1960's and 1970's, when they accounted for more than 15 percent of all American goods sold overseas. The beneficiaries of these new exports, of course, are American manufacturers, which, in a recession year, have enjoyed a windfall of $3 billion in extra sales from an unexpected quarter. 
 Various reasons are offered for what C. Fred Bergsten, president of the Institute for International Economics, calls "the 180-degree change in the business and investment climate." Such swings occur periodically in Latin America, but in the view of many economists this one seems likely to endure longer than most.
The rebirth of the Latin marketplace began in the late 1980's, when unpaid bank debt was converted into longer-term Treasury bonds. In the process, debt payments were reduced and postponed, freeing up money to take on new debt.
With this foundation coming into place, Latin America has increasingly embraced free and open markets, dismantling the state capitalism that had predominated since World War II. The phenomenon is most evident in Mexico, but is also well along in Chile, Venezuela, Colombia and Argentina.
The free-market embrace is drawing new dollars to Latin America in several ways. Government deficits have been reduced through layoffs at state-owned enterprises and cutbacks in public services. With less money printed to cover shrinking deficits, inflation has declined and currencies have strengthened, thus making foreign investment less risky. Privatization of state-owned companies is also in full swing, and the dollars paid into Latin treasuries to purchase these companies help to pay for imports and to service new debt.
What's more, privatization makes new lending more attractive, says John Purcell, a research director at Salomon Brothers. "A lot of these enterprises were money losers as state enterprises," he said, "while in private hands they are more likely to be profitable, a prospect that makes the bonds they sell seem less risky to investors."
Finally, trade barriers and tariffs have been removed or lowered, so that an imported General Electric dishwasher now often costs no more than a poor-quality, inefficiently manufactured Argentine or Mexican version. As a result, exports to Latin America in the second quarter reached $15.6 billion, or 15 percent of total United States exports. Through most of the 1980's, they rarely exceeded 14 percent of the total.
But the new activity is a gamble, one that counts heavily on Latin America becoming part of a free-trade zone linked to the United States economy. The soon-to-be-negotiated free trade agreement with Mexico is the first step in this process. As if it were already signed, northern Mexico is quickly becoming a United States manufacturing center, populated by American-owned manufacturers shipping numerous products back home.
"Mexico is the prototype," said Harley Shaiken, a University of California economist. "There might be losers, but for the moment everyone is lowering barriers and seeking agreements that will also plug them into the American economy."
So far, Mexico is also the major Latin importer of American goods, and the biggest borrower, accounting for $4.4 billion of the $6.7 billion in new Latin debt floated since November 1989, says Latin Finance, a Miami publication. But rather than foreign bank loans, the debt this time is through bonds sold by Latin governments and companies and purchased mainly by individuals abroad.
Most of these bonds require repayment in five years or less and offer yields above 10 percent, reflecting their riskiness and attracting American investors who once purchased high-yield corporate junk bonds in the United States, until that market declined. The bonds' riskiness suggests the possibility of a future debt crisis, which could damage the reputations of the American companies -- among them Salomon, the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company and Morgan Stanley & Company -- that have played major roles in underwriting the bonds.
"We do in a way have to stand behind them," Mr. Purcell of Salomon said. "You are supposed to believe in an issue that you bring to market; you lose your customers if you don't."

Broad Advances for Dollar On Prospect of Higher Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar advanced against other major currencies yesterday, helped by hopes that United States interest rates would move higher.
Gold prices jumped overseas -- by $4.20 in London, to $364.25 -- but rose less sharply in later New York trading. Gold rose $1.60 on the Commodity Exchange in New York, closing at $363.80 an ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $363.25, up $1.50. 
Foreign exchange analysts said the dollar had moved higher in response to surging market interest rates, which can lead to higher rates elsewhere in the economy. The dollar, like other currencies, draws support from higher interest rates.
 
Long-Bond Rates
 The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond, used as a basis for setting a variety of other rates, jumped to 8.07 percent in late trading yesterday from Friday's 7.95 percent.
John McCarthy, chief foreign exchange dealer with ABN-AMRO Bank N.V., said the dollar was also helped by a feeling in the market that "there are potential inflation problems down the road."
He noted that precious metals prices moved higher in recent weeks and oil prices were at their highest levels since the gulf war.
Although the Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates to aid the sputtering recovery, many traders believe that if inflation accelerates, the central bank will be forced to push rates up.
The markets are waiting for fresh economic news, particularly durable goods orders from September, which are scheduled on Thursday.
The dollar closed higher against the Japanese yen, rising to 130.80 yen in New York, from 129.65 on Friday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar rose 0.75 yen, closing 130.60 yen, and in London, it was quoted at 130.70 yen.
The British pound fell against the dollar, slipping to $1.7165 in New York from late Friday's $1.7270. In earlier London trading, sterling fell to $1.7185 from $1.7245.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's prices, included: 1.6933 German marks, up from 1.6865; 1.4835 Swiss francs, up from 1.4750; 5.7750 French francs, up from 5.7490; 1,266.00 Italian lire, up from 1261.25, and 1.12625 Canadian dollars, down from 1.12675.

Tax-Cut Talk Sends Prices Down

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Talk of tax cuts to revive the economy rattled investors in the Treasury bond market yesterday, and prices of long-term securities fell by more than a point, while yields rose above 8 percent.
"The debate about fiscal stimulus is sending a cold chill through the market," one government securities trader said. "If we are going to focus in on what is going on in Washington, that is going to hurt." 
 Last week Bush Administration officials began to suggest it would seek a number of tax changes, including a cut in the capital gains tax, to stimulate the economy. The debate was joined over the weekend by Democratic legislators, including Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, who called for tax cuts for middle-income families and fully deductible I.R.A.'s.
Reaction to the proposals was seen first in Asia, where market participants sold securities during overnight trading. The selloff continued when activity shifted to Europe and then to the United States.
Congress is to adjourn for the year in little more than a month, and analysts acknowledged that tax cuts are unlikely to be more than a talking point until sometime in 1992.
But for credit market participants the implications of the discussion seem ominous.
"If the talk represents a shift from monetary to fiscal policy, it suggests there will be less of a reliance on the Fed to lower short-term rates," said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides research and commentary on developments in the foreign exchange and credit markets.
"Second, with huge budget deficits lurking around the corner, the talk of tax cuts suggests the burden on the market would be even greater."
Thus far, the tax cut talk in Washington has emphasized that the changes would not worsen the deficit. Financial market participants are skeptical.
"Anyone in the market would be happy if tax cuts were matched with revenue cuts," said David A. Wyss, chief financial economist at Data Resources Inc., the economic forecasting firm. "But most in the market seem to believe that we will see the former and not the latter."
With no important economic reports released yesterday, the negative Washington talk dominated the session.
"There was no good news to offset this," Mr. McCarthy said.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered in late trading at a price of 100 19/32, down nearly 1 1/2 points, or almost $15 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, to yield 8.07 percent. Late Friday the benchmark issue was offered at a price to yield 7.95 percent.
Among note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 22/ 32, down 7/8 point, to yield 7.62 percent. And the 6 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 9.32, down 1/8 point, to yield 5.96 percent.
At the Treasury's weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills, the new three-month securities were sold at an average discount rate of 5.04 percent, up from an average rate of 4.99 percent at last week's sale.
Bids on the new six-month bills generated an average discount rate of 5.11 percent, up from the average rate of 5.03 percent at the sale a week ago.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, the Philip Morris Companies offered $350 million of 12-year notes at competitive bid.
A bid from a group led by Merrill Lynch & Company won the securities. They were reoffered to investors with a coupon of 8.25 percent, and were priced at $99.582, to yield 8.305 percent, 75 basis points, or 75 one-hundredths of a percentage point, over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities, which are noncallable for life, mature Oct. 15, 2003. They are rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The slide in Treasury prices spilled over into the corporate and tax-exempt municipal bond markets.
Participants in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said that prices of most issues dipped by about 1/8 point in light trading.
In the municipal bond market, traders said that prices of most widely quoted issues fell by about 3/8 point.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of new three-month and six-month Treasury bills:
 (000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: Montgomery Ward Plans Return to Catalogue Trade

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
Montgomery Ward & Company wants to muscle its way back into the crowded catalogue business.
The big Chicago retailer, which closed its unprofitable catalogue division in 1985, said yesterday that it was teaming with the Fingerhut Companies, a mail-order concern, to start a company to produce nearly a dozen separate catalogues a year. 
 Unlike its previous "big book" general-merchandise catalogue, which included 100,000 different items, Ward now plans to mail separate, narrowly focused catalogues for clothing, electronics, jewelry and cosmetics and other merchandise.
Bernard F. Brennan, chairman and chief executive of Ward, said he expected the sales of the new company, called Montgomery Ward Direct, to reach $500 million in five years.
In pursuing the specialty mail-order business, Ward hopes to avoid the problems of the troubled catalogue divisions of Sears, Roebuck & Company and the J .C. Penney Company. The country's last two large general-merchandise catalogues are performing poorly. Sears's unprofitable mail-order business, which includes some specialty catalogues, still does the bulk of its business from its 1,600-page fall and spring catalogues.
When Mr. Brennan closed Ward's catalogue operation in 1985, it was losing $75 million a year on sales of $1.2 billion.
"In 1985, I said that general-merchandise catalogues were no longer viable," Mr. Brennan said yesterday. He said that was even more true today, with specialty merchandisers supplanting generalists at both the catalogue and the store level. "It is just impossible to satisfy a customer today with a broad array of merchandise," he said. Mr. Brennan has considerably narrowed the focus of the Ward's stores.
But Montgomery Ward is entering the catalogue business at a difficult time. With the cost of setting up a mail-order operation comparatively low, the field is crowded. There are 8,000 catalogue companies in the country, according to the Direct Marketing Association, a trade group in New York.
In addition, there was a substantial increase earlier this year in the third- class postal rates used by catalogue mailers, and the weak economy has hurt many retailers, including mail- order merchants.
"You've got three negatives on the horizon that you didn't have four or five years ago," said Richard Pyle, an analyst in Minneapolis with Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood Inc. "It's more difficult to make the kind of profit margins that you used to in the business."
 
'Perfect Timing'
 Weaker companies are beginning to fall by the wayside, retail experts said. But the turmoil makes it "perfect timing" for the new venture to enter the market, contends Theodore Deikel, chairman and chief executive of Fingerhut, based in Minneapolis.
"As those that still have the big books try to figure out what to do and struggle for direction," Mr. Deikel said, "we are jumping in."
The lure of the mail-order business is considerable, with more and more time-pressed shoppers buying merchandise over the phone or through the mail. While only sketchy numbers exist, the Direct Marketing Association said that mail-order sales exceeded $25 billion last year. The trade group said that half of the consumers in the country shop by phone or by mail at least once a year.
 
Chances of Success
 Some analysts said that Montgomery Ward's name and considerable resources gave the venture a good chance of success.
"It is a very smart and strategic move," said George Rosenbaum, president of Leo J. Shapiro & Associates, a research firm in Chicago.
Ward plans to send catalogues primarily to its 10 million credit card customers. Fingerhut will supply the expertise of running a mail-order business.
Fingerhut is known for catalogues featuring knickknacks and arts and crafts supplies aimed largely at the blue collar market. Stock in the company, which had $1.2 billion in sales last year, rose $1.125, to $29.375, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.
Ward was taken private in 1988 in a $3.8 billion management buyout led by Mr. Brennan. The company had $5.5 billion in sales last year and profits of $153 million, Mr. Brennan said.
Ward and Fingerhut described the new venture as a partnership that would be equally owned by affiliates of the two companies. The mail-order business will have headquarters in Minneapolis. The first catalogue will be mailed out early next year.
Mr. Brennan said the company would be profitable in its first year of operation.

HEADLINE: Dow Falls By 16.77, To 3,060.38

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stock prices pulled back yesterday from Friday's record levels, with analysts citing a weak bond market, rising inflation fears and some gloomy corporate earnings.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 16.77 points, to 3,060.38, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index declined by 1.27, to 214.88. 
 But the declines came without heavy selling, as volume was significantly off last week's heavy pace. Trading on the Big Board was a moderate 154.2 million shares, down from 205.3 million on Friday. Losers outpaced gainers by 1,014 to 626.
 
Looking to Interest Rates
 In trying to explain the decline, Peter G. Grennan, senior vice president and head of stock index futures trading at Shearson Lehman Brothers, pointed to the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond, which rose to 8.07 percent yesterday.
"Above 8 percent, it sent a message to the market that the Fed may not be so accommodating" in moving to lower interest rates, he said.
Most traders do not expect stocks to rebound until Treasury security prices stablize. "Today's pullback should not be a surprise to anyone," Mr. Grennan said. "Each time this year that the Dow has reached a new high, the market has sold off."
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 2.48, to 390.02, while the American Stock Exchange composite slipped 0.71, to 381.78. Trading in smaller issues was also down. The Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter trading was down 1.94, to 536.96, and the Russell 2000 index off by 0.44 to close at 182.97.
 
Rally in Blue Chips
 Blue-chip stocks, which were down in early trading and throughout most of the day, made a strong comeback, helping a Dow that was off as much 34.66 points in afternoon trading cut half its losses.
Poor earnings hurt both Owens-Corning Fiberglas, down 4 1/2, to 20 1/4, and International Rectifier, down 5, to 13 1/4. Owens-Corning reported on Friday that it would increase 1992 asbestos litigation reserves. Traders also said that Jonathan Goldfarb, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, had lowered his recommendation and slashed his 1991 and 1992 earnings estimates for the company.
But some stocks rose on better earnings, including U.S. Healthcare, up 1 1/8, to 29 1/2, and Thorn Apple, a food concern, which closed up 1 1/4, to 42 1/2. Chase Manhattan's third-quarter earnings of $136 million, compared with a loss of $623 million in last year's third quarter, pushed that stock up 1/2, to 19.
Traders said Raphael Soifer, an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman, lowered his estimates on Wells Fargo and two other California banks, citing the slow pace of recovery in that state's economy. Wells Fargo stock fell 5/8, to 69 7/8.
 
Gain for Time Warner
 Time Warner, still wrestling with a heavy debt burden, rose 1 1/2, to 85 7/8. Although the company reported a third-quarter loss of $62 million, compared with a loss of $91 million in the period last year, analysts saw surprising earnings strength in the company's publishing operations, where more than 600 jobs are being cut and the company has taken a $60 million restructuring charge.
But the market took exception to Keystone International's flat earnings outlook for the fourth quarter. The stock in the maker of flow-control systems fell 5 3/4, to 25 1/2.
Robert M. Goldman at Dean Witter Reynolds said he was repeating his "buy" recommendation for U.S. Surgical based on information from a conference of the American College of Surgeons, which opened yesterday in Chicago. U.S. Surgical, which makes surgical stapling devices and sutures, rose 5 1/8, to 91.
Lockheed rose 1 7/8, to 43 1/4, as Michael Lauer, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody, upgraded the company to a "trading buy."

HEADLINE: Amoco Off 45.3% on Woe In Oil Patch

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
The Amoco Corporation said yesterday that its earnings fell 45.3 percent in the third quarter. It was the first report in what analysts said would be a two-week stream of sharply lower earnings results from the nation's major oil companies.
Prices for crude oil fell by an average of about $5 a barrel during the quarter ended Sept. 30 from the level of a year ago, when they had surged following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
 Amoco, the largest producer of natural gas in North America, was also hurt by a plunge in gas prices in midsummer. Gas prices fell to the lowest level in 15 years, at less than $1.10 for 1,000 cubic feet, before rebounding in September.
 
'Worst Quarter in 10 Years'
 "We think this will be the worst quarter for oil-company earnings in 10 years," said Frederick P. Leuffer, an analyst at C. J. Lawrence Inc.
But with prices climbing in recent weeks, the third period will mark the industry's lowest point for the year, he said. Unofficial figures indicate that gasoline demand rose by at least 1 percent in the third quarter, the first increase for the year, he said, and it appears headed higher.
The November contract for domestic crude traded at $24.04 a barrel yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up nearly $4 from the average posted price for the third quarter of $20.30 a barrel, and just below the average posted price for domestic crude of $25.50 a barrel in the third quarter last year. Natural gas prices have risen to $1.55 for 1,000 cubic feet, a 30-cent increase from the average in the third quarter.
Amoco, the nation's fifth-largest oil company, said net income fell to $290 million, or 59 cents a share, from $530 million, or $1.04 a share, in the quarter a year ago. Revenues fell 11.3 percent, to $7.01 billion from $7.90 billion.
 
Charge for Shutting Refinery
 Earnings for the 1991 quarter were depressed by a $76 million expense related to the shutdown of a refinery in Casper, Wyo. Paul Mlotok, an analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company, said Amoco's operating income was better than expected because of lower exploration costs. "Under the circumstances, the performance was quite good," he said.
Amoco's refining and marketing operations showed gains because crude costs were lower than a year ago. Profits in that unit rose to $169 million, from $129 million, but income fell in chemicals, to $13 million, from $37 million in the 1990 period. Mr. Mlotok said demand declined because of the recession.
Amoco's share price fell 37.5 cents yesterday, to $53.50, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

1,200 Layoffs At Wal-Mart

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said yesterday that it was laying off up to 1,200 workers in what it called a normal payroll adjustment and not a response to the weak economy.
It appeared likely that Wal- Mart, which has a work force of 367,000, took the step to keep costs in line. Wal-Mart, one of the nation's largest retailers, has built its reputation and success on lower prices, which are dependent on reduced expenses. 
 Don Shinkle, a Wal-Mart spokesman, said from the company's headquarters in Bentonville, Ark., that the cuts were made in the Sam's Clubs warehouse division. About 25 jobs were cut at Sam's headquarters, while the others were spread out among the 192 Sam's outlets, he said.
"You look at your payroll and you make various periodic adjustments, depending on the market and other criteria," Mr. Shinkle said. He said Wal- Mart would be adding sales help for the holiday season.
Analysts were surprised by the layoffs, but said the retailer was probably trying to insure that costs remained under control. "As far as I know, they're certainly not having any problems," said Joseph Ronning, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman & Company.
Besides Sam's, Wal-Mart operates more than 1,600 Wal- Mart discount stores and four Hypermart USA outlets.
Wal-Mart's shares were down 12.5 cents, to $49, in trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.

Chain of Mental Hospitals Faces Inquiry in 4 States

SERIES: Psychiatry for Profit: Trouble at Private Hospitals -- First of three articles.

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
Law enforcement officials in several states have begun investigations of one of the nation's largest private psychiatric-hospital chains on charges that it systematically misdiagnosed, mistreated and abused patients to increase its profits from insurance claims.
Over the last decade, the company at the center of the investigations, Psychiatric Institutes of America, the operator of 73 hospitals and treatment centers across the nation, has been regarded as one of the most modern, profitable and prestigious enterprises in the fast-growing industry of private psychiatric hospitals. 
 Its Fair Oaks Hospital in Summit, N. J., for example, is widely known as a center for research and treatment of drug addiction. In the 1980's, celebrities praised their treatment there and its doctors were models to many health professionals of a new generation of psychiatrists as entrepreneurs.
The investigations, under way in New Jersey, Texas, Florida and Alabama, involve complaints from those and other states, law enforcement officials say.
The company says that complaints against its hospitals and drug and alcohol treatment centers are overblown or inaccurate. It says they are not guilty of any wrongdoing.
But health authorities say that questions about these institutions are part of a broad, accelerating crisis in the private, for-profit psychiatric-hospital industry, an enterprise that has grown rapidly in the last decade. At its heart is a fierce argument about their quality of care, rising costs and attempts to balance the needs of patients with the search for profits.
Concern about the possible abuse or overuse of mental-health services is especially great now because the costs associated with these practices have become an important factor in driving up the nation's overall health costs -- now 12 percent of the gross national product.
"One of the big questions facing American psychiatry is whether or not the profit motive in hospitals drives people to do things that are unacceptable ethically," said Dr. Paul Fink, a former president of the American Psychiatric Association. "That doesn't mean every private psychiatric hospital is bad. It means that some people who tie their jobs and their world to the bottom line are going to seek patients in every way they can."
In more than 200 complaints to law enforcement officials in New Jersey, Florida, Texas and Alabama, and in an extensive series of interviews, former patients, their relatives and former staff members made these charges, among others:
*The company's hospitals in New Jersey, Florida and Texas admitted patients who did not need hospitalization. In Texas, the State Attorney General says the hospitals hired "bounty hunters" who "kidnapped" patients with medical insurance.
*In Florida, former patients and their families charged in lawsuits that the hospitals kept patients against their will, or even against the wishes of their families, including, in one case, a 3-year-old child.
*The company's hospitals in New Jersey and Florida crafted diagnoses to meet patients' insurance coverage, investigators said.
*In some cases, the hospitals kept patients until their insurance ran out, whether they needed such hospitalization or not, according to law suits and former staff members in New Jersey, Florida and Alabama. In other cases, the hospitals are said to have released patients as soon as their insurance was exhausted whether they were ready to be diswhether they were ready to be discharged or not.
*Hospitals in a number of states awarded bonuses to top staff members as incentives to keep patients for longer stays, former staff members said.
 
Company Defends Treatment
 A spokesman for the company, which is a subsidiary of National Medical Enterprises Inc. of Santa Monica, Calif., said that charges against the hospitals were made by a small number of former employees and that treatment at most of the chain's hospitals was beyond reproach.
"Patients are admitted by physicians when physicians determine that it is medically necessary to do so," said the spokesman, David Olson. "The overwhelming majority of patients are the subject of outside third-party utilization review or case management."
Charges of kidnapping, altering diagnosis, or any altering of medical tally false, he said, adding that it is ending the practice of paying staff bonuses on the basis of the number of patients in hospitals.
Nonetheless, Mr. Olson said, the company recently hired two law firms to conduct a review of practices at all its hospitals, and the top executive overseeing the psychiatric hospital subsidiary, Norman A. Zober, left his post on paid leave earlier this month.
Mr. Olson said that National Medical Enterprises did not comment on cases of individuals. In Florida, dozens of former patients from the company's two hospitals in Palm Beach County have registered their complaints, often in public demonstrations outside the hospitals. Bill Coakley, an organizer of the demonstrations, pointed to a number of examples. These and other former patients made themselves available for interviews after several of them found they had had similar experiences, formed patients' advocacy groups and decided their stories should be made public.
 
Admitted for Anorexia
 Kelly Dewald, a Palm Beach County resident, said she voluntarily admitted herself to the company's Lake Hospital of the Palm Beaches in Lake Worth for treatment of anorexia four years ago when she was l7 years old. She said she received little treatment for the eating disorder but instead was put on antidepressants that brought on hallucinations and paranoia. After 34 days, when her insurance ran out, she said she was summarily discharged and told her treatment was over.
"At this point I was left with nothing," she said. "But one week after I stopped taking medication, the violence, the fear and paranoia disappeared."
Her bill, for nearly $26,000, included charges of $3.75 for one Bufferin tablet and 30 biofeedback sessions at $150 each. She said that she had been unable to get anyone at the hospital to take her complaints seriously, and that she had talked to a lawyer who said she would probably lose if she went to court.
Charges at Psychatric Institute hospitals in Florida and New Jersey often run from $700 to $1,000 a day. The costs of residential treatment vary greatly at other hospitals, but according to Dr. Charles E. Riordan, a clinical professor of psychatry at Yale University, public or not-for-profit private hospitals often charge $400 to $500 daily.
In another Florida case, Eileen Vinsand, the wife of a Palm Beach County firefighter, said the stay of her 10-year-old son, Jimmy, in the company's Fair Oaks Hospital in Boca Delray turned into the worst conceivable family horror. A school guidance counselor recommended that Fair Oaks evaluate the boy in 1988 for hyperactivity and behavioral problems.
 
Asked About Insurance
 She said the hospital's first question was whether he was covered by insurance and when that was confirmed he was promptly admitted. Mrs. Vinsand, who had been trained as a nurse, said she was subsequently told that she could not visit her son. But she said she forced her way into his room and that what she saw were actions unlike anything she had seen in him before: "He was having what looked like grand mal seizures. He was terrified. He was flipping his head back and stuttering and his eyes were running back into his head."
She said she demanded his release but the doctor in charge told her that her son had brain damage and if she removed him the hospital could have her rights of custody to the child taken away.
"I believed it," she said. "They play off your emotions. They have M.D.'s after their names. They are God."
Her son was released several days before his insurance ran out. She said Jimmy soon regained his normal health and has now outgrown his hyperactivity.
Why did she not sue? Because the child got better so quickly and "you don't sue God."
 
Threat Is Reported
 Last January in Anniston, Ala., W.T. Gable, a retired insurance agent, said he took his 73-year-old wife, Elsie, who was having repeated nightmares, to the psychiatric ward at the Regional Medical Center. The ward is operated by Psychiatric Institutes of America.
Mr. Gable said that after a week he wanted to take her out of the hospital but that the doctor in charge refused to allow her to leave and quoted him as saying: "If you do, I'll fix it so that no a doctor in town will touch her."
Mr. Gable said, "I have witnesses who heard that." Mr. Gable said from the day of admission, a chart listed Mrs. Gable's release date as Feb. 6 -- the day her insurance ran out.
"Their intention was to keep her until the 6th," he said, "even before they knew what was wrong with her."
Last year, the medical director and the head psychologist on the ward resigned, saying patients were kept until their insurance ran out.
Psychiatric Institutes of America is one of several major companies that rapidly developed chains of investor-owned psychiatric hospitals in the 1980's. The number of beds in for-profit psychiatric hospitals in the United States grew to 37,500 in 1990 from 21,400 in 1984. The total number of such hospitals grew to 440 in 1988 from 220 in 1984.
 
Increased Public Acceptance
 The growth came as a result of increased public acceptance of psychiatric care, the growth of health insurance plans that paid for psychiatric treatment and the widespread deregulation of the hospitals in several states.
In places like Palm Beach County, one of Florida's affluent vacation spots, for example, the number of free-standing private psychiatric hospitals grew from one to seven, while other general-care hospitals also opened up psychiatric and drug and alcohol units. The same increase, from one to seven, took place in Dallas.
Although scattered complaints have been made about other companies, officials say they have not identified other for-profit hospitals for investigation.
And medical authorities are quick to point out that some of the new entrepreneurial hospitals are providing excellent care. Still, many psychiatrists said they were troubled by the companies' generally aggressive advertising campaigns and the premiums they put on getting and keeping patients with insurance.
 
Florida Investigations
 A spokesman for the Florida Attorney General's office said yesterday that his state's investigation was being handled by the its consumer litigation division, focusing on Fair Oaks and Lake Hospitals. The state insurance company's fraud division said it had begun its own investigation.
In Texas, where Psychiatric Institutes of America operates 13 hospitals, the Attorney General's office is suing the company to stop payment of $3.1 million in funds from a crime victim's compensation fund, which pays for victims' psychiatric services. The suit involves at least 125 patients.
In the suit, the state charges that patients were "subjected to unnecessary and expensive treatment programs, some of which are administered by persons not trained to safely conducte such programs." The state says it is also investigating charges that the company hired people it called bounty hunters to "infiltrate" meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous to find patients.
"They would simply kidnap various persons who didn't need treatment of any kind," said Ron Dusek, a spokesman for the Attorney General's office. "And once they got them into the hospital they held them against their will until the insurance claims ran out."
 
Settlement in New Jersey
 In New Jersey this summer, Psychiatric Institutes of America, which owns Fair Oaks Hospital in Summit, together with doctors there, agreed to pay a $400,000 fine to the state, the largest such settlement in state history.
Both sides agreed not to discuss the basis for the payment but the state said the investigation came in response to complaints from patients and staff members.
Officials familiar with the New Jersey inquiry said that in recent weeks Federal agents and the United States Attorney's office in Newark had joined a new investigation of Fair Oaks that involved charges of criminal insurance fraud.
Louis Parisi, who heads the New Jersey Insurance Department's investigation division, said the department had received more than 300 complaints from around the country about hospitals owned or operated by Psychiatric institutes of America.
Among the charges being investigated in New Jersey, state officials say, are those of Dr. Robert Stuckey, a psychiatrist who served as the medical director of the alcoholic unit at Fair Oaks from 1975 to 1985.
In an interview yesterday, Dr. Stuckey said patients were admitted who did not need treatment and that their diagnoses were shaped to take advantage of insurance coverage.
 
'Analysis of Insurance'
 "The starting point was always their remarkable analysis of insurance," Dr. Stuckey said. "They were geniuses at assessing and diagnosing insurance."
He added: "They took people who didn't need psychiatry. "They took people who couldn't defend themselves and kept them in hospitals for months."
Critics of the hospitals in Florida say that the plight of patients may be best illustrated by the case of three children whose parents were divorced and who were were being confined unnecessarily at Fair Oaks at Boca Delray.
The children's father, George Pallay, has sued the hospital, saying that his children, aged 3, 8 and 9, had been held for six weeks until their insurance coverage ran out.
Mr. Pallay's lawyer, Theresa DiPaolo, said an investigation by insurance companies later found that the children did not need psychiatric hospitalization.

HEADLINE: Ex-Backers of Ousted Haitian Say He Alienated His Allies

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Oct. 15

 BODY:
When the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide won Haiti's first democratic presidential elections in December, his landslide victory sent tens of thousands of Haitians coursing through the streets waving branches stripped from trees and crowing like the rooster that was their leader's campaign symbol.
One of the new President's first acts was to declare a "marriage" with a long-troublesome Haitian Army, whose enlisted soldiers, he was fond of pointing out, shared a dirt-poor background with his core supporters. 
 Summoned by signs of hope that the country had rarely seen, planeloads of skilled Haitians were soon returning from exile to offer their services to their largely illiterate homeland. Even skeptical diplomats had begun to express admiration for the leftist priest's unexpected moderation in many of his economic and foreign policies.
But now, in the time since he was deposed by a rebellious army on Sept. 30, many who had supported the eight-month presidency of Father Aristide say the collapse of Haiti's brief experiment with democracy was hastened by an insular and menacing leader who saw his own raw popularity as a substitute for the give and take of politics.
 
Froze Out Other Officials
 While President Aristide performed as expected in combating the corrupt vestiges of the political class that flourished during the 29-year Duvalier family dictatorship, he also quickly froze out even those newly elected officials who had equally long records of fighting dictatorship.
Soon, he was governing a country of nearly seven million people with the aid of fear and a tight circle of friends. When political allies were needed to break his fall, none could be found.
"These guys were too taken with the politics of conspiracy to imagine how you can get things done by working with people," said Jocelyn McCalla, a Haitian human rights expert. "As things developed, Aristide grew increasingly isolated and the people around him saw every criticism as a plot to subvert them."
Just weeks before undertaking his candidacy, the 38-year-old Father Aristide, a longtime priest in Port-au-Prince's slums, was denouncing the coming elections as an American ruse to impose yet another puppet government that he said would exploit the country.
In a last-minute bid to defeat Roger Lafontant, a widely feared former Interior Minister under the Duvalier dictatorship, however, the Haitian left came together briefly and persuaded Father Aristide to be its candidate.
 
Knew How to Rouse Poor
 As an unbending foe of Duvalierism who had escaped repeated attacks by death squads, Father Aristide had strong credentials. And unlike many Haitian political leaders, he knew how to rouse the poor, who form the vast majority of the country's population.
Requiring a legal sponsor, Father Aristide's candidacy was rushed onto the ballots under the banner of the National Front for Change and Democracy, a left-of-center coalition of intellectuals and labor and grass-roots political leaders.
Once he gained office, however, the National Front, which would have instantly provided him with a large bloc of parliamentary supporters, was jettisoned by a President riding a tide of immense personal popularity.
Almost immediately, Father Aristide began intimating that political parties were not representative of the people. In place of the parties, the new President began to lean heavily on Lavalas, an unstructured movement of affluent idealists and long-exiled leftists who had helped finance his candidacy. Soon, he was invoking the group's name, which means torrent or flood in Creole, in everything from greetings to his speeches.
 
'Out of Another Era'
 "These folks came straight out of another era," a diplomat said of the Lavalas activists. "Their political models were Paris in 1968 and the Cultural Revolution in China."
Lavalas quickly became perceived as both gatekeeeper and ideological rudder of the administration, guiding everything from personnel decisions to the Government's increasingly disputatious relations with Parliament.
"For Lavalas, the Parliament became a negation of the power the people gave Aristide," said Jean-Claude Bajeux, a human rights advocate whose organization, Konakom, had supported the priest's candidacy. "They reasoned that Aristide should have had all the power because he was the people."
Drawing the most surprise and criticism was his choice of a close friend for Prime Minister, Rene Preval, who was little known.
 
Party Is 'Shut Out'
 "From the start, we were shut out of the process," Senator Jean-Robert Martinez said of the way his National Front party was treated. "The President didn't even want to talk to us."
Father Aristide's decision to govern without the help of political parties was quickly followed by other signs of unilateral actions, which sounded alarms from the National Assembly to foreign embassies over his commitment to democracy.
From judicial appointments to ambassadorial nominations, diplomats say, the President repeatedly sought to bypass the Assembly, whose advise-and-consent role in such matters was clearly established in the 1987 Constitution.
When the legislature refused to back down, a crowd of at least 2,000 Aristide supporters surrounded the National Assembly on Aug. 13, roughing up two deputies and threatening to burn others alive if they moved ahead with a planned motion of no confidence against Prime Minister Preval.
That week, the offices of the National Front, Father Aristide's onetime electoral allies, were sprayed with bullets while a meeting was being held inside. The offices here of Mayor Evans Paul, a National Front leader, were stoned, and the headquarters of a labor union that had backed Father Aristede's candidacy was burned by his supporters.
A Senator's home was also attacked by a mob and a deputy was threatened with "Pere Lebrun," or burning alive by a group armed with used tires and a bottle of gasoline.
For months, Father Aristide had justified the practice of Pere Lebrun as a "legitimate expression" of outrage by a people who had no other recourse. Now, many felt his supporters were reinstating terror as a central motif in the country's political life.
As the President's troubles with civil society grew, so did his problems with the army. Much as he resisted submitting senior Government appointments to the legislature for its approval, the President never formally nominated Brig. Gen. Raoul Cedras, whom he had appointed to command the army.
 
Financing of Coup
 While mutual suspicions grew between the general and the President over the nomination delay, Haitian political leaders and diplomats say, the growing climate of vigilantism as well as increasingly strident statements by Father Aristide blaming the wealthier classes for the poverty of the masses encouraged a group of traders to finance a coup attempt.
Using the President's own words about Pere Lebrun, which he had praised three days before as "a nice instrument," plus warnings that he was planning to eliminate their jobs, the coup leaders were able to incite enlisted men into setting off the revolt that overthrew Father Aristide, diplomats say.
In the National Assembly, which became the focus of Haitian politics as soon as the army made clear that it had no desire to hold on to power, a sigh of relief could be heard among senators and deputies who had come to loathe a heavy-handed President they had only recently celebrated.

HEADLINE: Vietnam Says Hong Kong Can Return 222 Refugees by Force

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 21

 BODY:
The British Government announced today that it had persuaded Vietnam to let the authorities in Hong Kong fly 222 boat people back to Vietnam against their will next month, and that it would keep trying to persuade Hanoi to take back tens of thousands more.
Britain had hoped last week to announce an agreement in principle with Vietnam accepting involuntary repatriation. This would permit the authorities in Hong Kong to begin deporting most of the 64,000 Vietnamese who are being held in 12 camps after arriving by boat and asking for asylum. Few have any prospect of being admitted to the British crown colony as refugees from political persecution. 
 Officials here in London offered no explanation for the failure so far to reach this broader agreement.
"Discussion on the detailed arrangements for repatriating other non-refugees in Hong Kong continues," the Foreign Office said today. "The Vietnamese Government has confirmed that no illegal immigrant who returns to Vietnam will face persecution and that it will continue to facilitate the monitoring of returnees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and others to insure that these guarantees are fully respected."
 
'Just the First Step'
 "This was just the first step," a British spokesman said, adding that the Hong Kong Government would probably wait until November to give the Vietnamese a chance to make arrangements for receiving the 222 to be returned.
The desire of London to send them back has put it at odds with Washington, which opposes involuntarily repatriations to Vietnam for any reason. The British argue that most of the boat people these days are fleeing economic conditions, not political repression. "Frankly, I find the American opposition to be incomprehensible," Alistair Asprey, the Hong Kong Government official in charge of security, said at a news conference there today.
Some British officials also point to recent decades of Vietnam's military history in making their arguments.
American forces withdrew from South Vietnam in 1973 after eight years of combat intended to prevent a military takeover by the Communist North. Two years later, the North Vietnamese Army swept down through the central highlands and then captured Saigon, ending three decades of civil warfare and uniting Vietnam under a Communist Government in Hanoi.
Sir Peter Blaker, a senior member of Parliament from the governing Conservative Party, recently described the American opposition to a forced return of Vietnamese from Hong Kong as an irrational reaction to that military defeat.
 
Talks With Washington
 But Britain's Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, said this month that officials were discussing the situation with Washington and hoping to persuade the Bush Administration to acquiesce in an involuntary repatriation if they went ahead with it.
Today's agreement, the Foreign Office said, covers only Vietnamese who had come to Hong Kong once before, had been returned, and had then re-entered Hong Kong illegally a second time. Of a total of 322 people in this category, 92 have volunteered to return and 8 are awaiting screening, leaving 222 subject to return against their will, the Foreign Office said.
Of 64,000 Vietnamese asylum seekers now in Hong Kong, only 5,000 have been able to convince authorities in the overcrowded colony that they fled their homeland for political rather than economic reasons and thus qualify for refugee status. Of the rest, 41,500 are awaiting screening and 17,500 have been classified as non-refugees. The British want the Vietnamese to agree to accept them all back even if they do not want to go.
Reports from Hong Kong over the weekend said that passions were running high in the camps and that some refugees had threatened to commit suicide rather than go back to Vietnam against their will.
Britain deported 51 boat people from Hong Kong to Hanoi in December 1989, provoking protests from the United States and violence in the camps in Hong Kong. The British authorities then suspended involuntary repatriations, and began negotiating with the Vietnamese on procedures to make the process less painful.

HEADLINE: America Grows Gloomier on Economy, Poll Shows

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21

 BODY:
As the Presidential campaign season begins in earnest, Americans are even more deeply troubled than they were earlier this year about the state of the nation in general and of the economy in particular, according to a New York Times/ CBS News Poll.
The number of Americans who say that "things" in the country have "pretty seriously gotten off on the wrong track" has increased from 31 percent who said so in January to 42 percent in March and to 60 percent in the latest poll. And a plurality of 44 percent says things in the country are generally going worse than they were five years ago; that is up from 31 percent who expressed the same view in March. 
 Underlying this wave of pessimism is anxiety about unemployment, the recession, the Federal budget deficit and other aspects of the economy about which participants were asked. Forty-one percent of Americans say the health of the economy is the most important problem facing the country, and many predicted it would only get worse.
 
Bush's Approval Remains High
 But that deep concern for the economy does not appear to have significantly affected their political choices. Participants in the latest poll indicated that they still overwhelmingly approved of the way President Bush was handling his job, and many people said they knew little or nothing about the current Democratic Presidential contenders. Mr. Bush's overall approval rating stood at 67 percent.
The depth of concerns about the future of the country showed, however, that the President could be vulnerable next November if the economy did not rebound. Just 33 percent say they approve of Mr. Bush's handling of the economy, while 57 percent disapproved.
Although Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York is not an announced candidate for President, he was the favorite among those polled who say they usually vote in Democratic primaries. These say by a 2-to-1 margin that he should run for President in 1992.
For the poll, 1,280 adults from across the political spectrum were questioned nationwide by telephone from Oct. 15 to Oct. 18. It included 991 people who say they are registered voters and 420 people who say they vote in Democratic primaries or caucuses. The survey carries a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points for all registered voters and a margin of plus or minus 5 percentage points for Democratic primary and caucus voters.
In this first temperature taking on attitudes about the 1992 Democratic Presidential field, it is clear that most voters are not yet paying much attention to the campaign.
Asked to choose among the six declared candidates at this early stage, 47 percent of the respondents who say they vote in Democratic primaries say they had no preference; 64 percent say that they are not satisfied with the candidates now running and that they wish there were more choices.
 
Rating the Democrats
 When these participants were asked to choose among eight possible contenders, the two who drew the most support may not even run: Governor Cuomo was preferred by 27 percent; the Rev. Jesse Jackson followed with 13 percent, and each of the others tallied in single digits. Although Mr. Jackson was second in the polling, respondents by a 2-to-1 margin say that he should not run, in a somewhat ambiguous result that can be attributed to the public's familiarity with his name.
Indeed, at this early stage, support for the six declared candidates generally reflects name recognition. Edmund G. Brown Jr., the former California Governor who announced his candidacy today, led with 12 percent, followed by Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, with 8 percent; Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, 7 percent; Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, 5 percent; Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, 3 percent, and Paul E. Tsongas, the former Massachusetts senator, 2 percent.
In a hypothetical trial heat, Mr. Bush enjoyed an advantage of about 20 percentage points over an unnamed Democratic opponent; 49 percent of registered voters say they would probably vote for Mr. Bush, while 28 percent say they would probably back his opponent. But in an indication that Mr. Bush would be vulnerable if the economy does not rebound, 79 percent of registered voters say domestic issues "will matter more in deciding how" they vote than would foreign policy matters.
While the poll was taken in the week that the Senate was under fire for its handling of Judge Clarence Thomas's Supreme Court nomination, it does not appear to reflect this criticism.
For example, 30 percent of Americans approved of the way Congress was handling its job in a Times/CBS News Poll in August. There was very little change in early October, when 27 percent expressed the same view. And in the latest survey, 29 percent indicated approval.
Similarly, by a 55 percent majority, Americans say they trust the Senate more than the President to make the right decisions about who should sit on the Court. That is the same proportion reflected in a New York Times/CBS News poll taken in September, before the Thomas hearings.
 
A Small Slide
 More remarkable is the finding that 25 percent of the respondents say they trust the President more than they do the Senate on Court nominations, in a decline of six percentage points since the September survey. Sixty-one percent agreed with the Senate's confirmation of Judge Thomas, although 63 percent say they disapprove of the way the hearings were handled.
Nevertheless, the public found something of value in the proceedings, with 54 percent saying there is a greater likelihood that women who feel they have been sexually harassed will report the incidents.
In one shift in respondents' beliefs about Congress, 68 percent of participants in the survey say they support a term limit of 12 years for lawmakers; this represents a 12 percentage-point increase from a year ago.
Most striking was that in every question on the economy, people offer more pessimistic views than in the most recent survey, taken in June. Sixty-five percent say the economy is "very bad" or "fairly bad." This was 8 percentage points more than in June. Forty percent say it is getting "worse," in a rise of 11 percentage points.
The results on questions about Mr. Bush's performance were mixed. The President's perceived strength in international affairs has kept his approval rating at 67 percent. But his efforts on the economy continue to be rated relatively poorly and he is being faulted for his emphasis on foreign policy.
These concerns could spell trouble for Mr. Bush, whose support does not seem particularly solid. Although the President begins the campaign season with a substantial lead, about four in 10 of those respondents who say they favor Mr. Bush also say they can imagine circumstances under which they would vote for a Democrat.
 
Campaign Isn't a Focus
 The reason most people know little about the Presidential landscape is reflected in that few say they have focused on it. Sixty-six percent of registered voters chose "not much" when asked to describe the attention they have paid to the campaign thus far, and only 8 percent chose "a lot."
Although Governor Cuomo and Mr. Jackson had high name recognition among respondents, many more people say they believe Governor Cuomo should run than say that Mr. Jackson should. By a split of 45 percent to 22 percent, the Democratic primary voters say Governor Cuomo should run. By a split of 30 percent to 60 percent, these same respondents say Mr. Jackson should not run.
Mr. Cuomo has a balance of 29 percent favorable impressions and 9 percent unfavorable among Democratic primary voters. For Mr. Jackson, the unfavorable ratings outweighed the favorable ones, 41 percent to 29 percent.
In a result that could be significant for Governor Cuomo, who insisted last week that he would have to resign the Governorship if he ran for President, 53 percent of all registered voters say candidates currently serving as governors could not run and also fulfill their duties to their home states.
Regarding the kind of candidate that would be favored, a plurality of the Democratic primary voters say they want to see their party nominate a moderate. And in answer to a separate question about the declared candidates, 54 percent of respondents say they are "pretty much alike" rather than having "important differences."
While most people say they know very little about the Democratic field, primary voters who know the candidates say they like Governors Clinton and Wilder and Senators Harkin and Kerrey. In the cases of Mr. Brown and Mr. Tsongas, favorable impressions among Democratic primary voters were counterbalanced by a roughly equal level of unfavorable impressions.

"How the Survey Was Conducted"
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Oct. 15-18 with 1,280 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. The numbers were then screened so that calls would be placed to residences only. Within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the poll.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, for those who say they vote in Democratic primaries or caucuses, it is plus or minus five percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: Talk About Tax Breaks Is . . . Just Talk

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21

 BODY:
All the talk in the last few days about new tax breaks is mostly political positioning on the eve of the 1992 election campaign.
The basic theme of Republicans and Democrats on tax policy is the same as it was generations ago: Republicans want to give tax breaks to the wealthy, saying that to do so would improve the economy and thus benefit all Americans. Democrats want to redistribute income away from the rich and toward the poor and middle class, maintaining that fairness makes the economy run more smoothly. 
 The evidence supporting either tenet is shaky at best. But the arguments -- which boiled up anew on television on Sunday when Senator Lloyd Bentsen, a Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee, offered his latest tax cut proposal -- sound good in a campaign speech.
 
Differences Within the Parties
 This year, the differences over taxes are not only between the parties but within them.
President Bush would rather concentrate on foreign policy and let the economy take care of itself. But his hand has been forced by the conservatives in his party like Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia who despise last year's budget deal because it makes lowering taxes so difficult.
Most liberal Democrats take issue with Senator Bentsen. Rather than cut taxes, they want to expand social programs with whatever peace dividend grows out of the end of the military threat from the Soviet Union. But the moderate wing of the party in the Senate, led by Mr. Bentsen, Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Al Gore of Tennessee, has decided that tax cuts for the middle class is where the votes are.
How all this will work out is unclear, but this much is certain: nothing of substance will happen for months, just more and more talk about taxes and the economy.
This should be favorable ground for the Democrats. After all, the economy is still sour, the middle class does feel overtaxed and polls show that most people believe important domestic programs are being ignored. Even more important, it draws attention away from foreign policy, where Mr. Bush is most secure.
Indeed, on the CBS News program "Face the Nation" on Sunday, Senator Bentsen first took a shot at Mr. Bush. "The economy is dead in the water," Senator Bentsen said, "and we do have to jump-start it. The Administration has been trying to talk their way out of it, and that hasn't worked."
But the plan Mr. Bentsen then outlined -- a $300 per child tax credit to American families, a renewal of tax-deductible individual retirement accounts for all Americans and a 5 percent cut in military spending over five years to pay for the new tax breaks -- is sure to generate as much opposition as support within his own party. Until the Democrats develop a unified position, it will be hard to turn the issue against Mr. Bush.
 
Little to 'Jump-Start' Economy
 Whatever the political virtues of the Senator's proposals and whatever their value as a matter of tax policy, they would do little if anything to "jump-start" the economy.
First, it will be well into next year if not later before any tax changes can be enacted and put into effect, much too late to give a quick boost to today's sluggish conditions. Second, tax cuts will do little to stimulate the economy if, as Mr. Bentsen proposes, they are offset dollar for dollar by cuts in Government spending. Third, more generous deductions for I.R.A.'s would theoretically encourage saving, not spending, normally the wrong prescription for an economy struggling to get out of recession.
Further, Mr. Bentsen seems to be giving up the line of attack on tax fairness that proved so advantageous to the Democrats in last year's budget battle.
Mr. Bentsen did not even give a nod to the poor, as much a part of Democratic tax dogma as help for the rich is part of Republican philosophy. And the $72 billion that would be lost through lower taxes is money that could not be spent for better medical care, education, highways and other programs that Democrats advocate.
So none of the Democratic Presidential candidates endorsed the Bentsen ideas today, and Democrats in the House of Representatives, led by Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, stayed at arm's length.
 
Meant for Public Consumption
 At the White House, the recent flurry of activity on economic issues, including the President's highly publicized meetings with bankers, business executives and his top economic advisers, was also meant more for public consumption near the start of the election campaign than as a genuine effort to bring about policy changes.
"There's a feeling he hasn't been visible enough on this issue," one adviser said of Mr. Bush. To keep the Democrats from stealing the march on tax cuts, the President in the next week or so will offer what he calls a "growth package," his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said today. The centerpiece, no surprise, will be a lower capital gains tax rate.
Republican doctrine holds that the economy will expand and jobs will be created if investors can keep more of their profits, instead of having them taxed away.
Whether giving these people a tax break in the form of a capital gains cut would induce them to invest more and help the economy to grow is an open question. All that is for sure is that most of the tax savings would go to the rich.
Mr. Fitzwater said again today that Mr. Bush did not want to violate the cardinal principles of last year's budget agreement, that all tax cuts would be balanced by equivalent spending reductions and that money would not be shifted from the military to the domestic side of the ledger.
But on this score, the President may have to relent. Most politicians believe that a budget written when the Soviet Union was a serious military threat is no longer pertinent now that the cold war has ended. Senator Gramm, no antagonist of a strong military, said today: "Do I think a 5 percent defense saving over the next five years is realistic? Yes, I do."
So the battlefield for the election campaign becomes how to use that money, perhaps $70 billion to $100 billion. Should it go for tax cuts, and if so should they be concentrated on the poor, the middle class or the rich? Should money be used for domestic programs? Or should some of it be set aside to reduce the budget deficit?
The deficit? It is expected to hit a record $350 billion this year. But no one is mentioning it nowadays. It is a dreadful word on the stump.

HEADLINE: The Newest Fashion in Urban Transportation: Ferryboats

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR

 BODY:
Long before dawn, commuters arrive at the dock in Weehawken, N.J., first one by one, then in briskly moving masses. Briefcases in hand, they board a blue and white ferry marked "Midtown." And for the next five minutes, until the Port Imperial ferry docks at West 38th Street in Manhattan, serenity seems to settle over the crowd.
"Before the overwhelming assault on my senses, I just like to have a few Buddha-like moments," said one woman who sat on the upper deck, her eyes closed and her face lifted into a breeze rolling off the Hudson River. 
 Downriver, another ferry shuttles between Weehawken and New York's financial district. And a third moves between Hoboken, N.J., and Battery Park City in Manhattan. On the East River, an airport ferry brings travelers from Manhattan's East Side to La Guardia Airport, bypassing the often congested highways in Queens.
Except for the 70,000 weekday riders of the Staten Island Ferry, most of the more than 3 million commuters who come and go from the city's business district each day still travel by land: in crowded trains, or in buses and cars that cram through tunnels and over bridges. But a small and growing number -- more than 15,000 -- have begun making the trip across the Hudson and East Rivers by ferry.
"It is a kind of renaissance," said David Phraner, a transportation planner for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. "It isn't a panacea for all the urban transportation problems that we have, but ferries are an important part of a big picture."
 
An Attractive Alternative
 The idea of ferries criss-crossing New York's rivers like bootlaces is an old idea made new, an idea finding favor not just here but in other American cities where planners are looking for ways to curb pollution, reduce traffic and attract tourists. In the past five years, the ferry business here has been built up by private entrepreneurs who sensed a market among commuters weary of traditional mass transit. About 75 percent of the ferry riders say they switched from publicly financed mass transit and about 25 percent say they are now leaving their own cars at home or in the ferry parking lot, the New York City Transportation Department said.
The ferry's newfound popularity harkens back to the city's earliest days, when a rowboat ferry carried the area's new Dutch settlers across the East River between Brooklyn and what was then known as New Amsterdam. By the mid 1770's, several ferry lines -- powered by oars, sails, poles or horses on treadmills -- linked Manhattan, Long Island and Staten Island with the mainland and with each other. New York later became home to the world's first steam ferry, and by 1909, just before the Hudson and East River railroad tunnels were opened, the ferries were moving as many as 2,000 passengers at a time across a bustling harbor.
"Ah, what can ever be more stately and admirable to me than mast-hemm'd Manhattan," wrote Walt Whitman in his poem, "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry."
 
Better Technology
 But as tunnels, bridges and cross-river transit lines proliferated, all but the Staten Island ferry died out.
Now, transportation experts said, ferries are making a comeback, not just in New York but in Boston, Seattle, San Francisco and San Diego.
"The technology for the ferry boats is getting better, so you have a more comfortable ride," said Henry S. Marcus, chairman of the Ocean Systems Management program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. "In many areas, driving to work is not ideal and is getting worse. People are thinking a little more about ferries, and so I think, in general, the number of people using them has been increasing."
Martha A. Reardon, a director of the International Marine Transit Association and a ferry consultant, said ferry ridership in the United States is now about 200,000 a day, mostly because commuters -- and municipal officials -- are looking for alternatives to traffic gridlock.
"There just isn't any more room," she said. "People are looking at bridges and saying, 'Do we doubledeck it or do we look for an alternative?' "
 
Concerns About Profitability
 In New York alone, seven ferry services now shuttle riders between Manhattan, Brooklyn, New Jersey and La Guardia Airport. Several more, including a commuter catamaran service between Haverstraw, N.Y., and lower Manhattan, are being planned. And the New York City Transportation Department, with help from a $180,000 Federal grant, is working on a study that is expected to call for six new ferry routes.
But for every city or company that has successfully revived its ferry services, dozens of others have failed.
Of the 13 or so New York City ferry routes that began operating in 1990, at least four have been closed down -- mostly because of low ridership. Several ferry companies have gone out of business.
Transportation experts say that without Federal or state subsidies, many commuter ferry services are not economically viable. George Haikalis, a transportation consultant, describes them as "money losers."
One success story is the Port Imperial Ferrybus line.
Standing on the dock of the Port Imperial ferry terminal in Weehawken, Arthur E. Imperatore, the owner and real estate magnate, waves to a group of morning commuters as they board his ferry to midtown.
"Look at what we've done and not a dollar of public subsidy," says the 66-year-old Mr. Imperatore, who recalls taking the old Weehawken ferry for four cents when he was growing up in West New York, N.J. Today, the ferry he runs costs $4 each way to midtown, $5 to downtown, and an extra $4 for parking.
Inside the terminal -- a restored ferry painted with historical murals -- passengers can sit in the cafe or bar, drop off clothes for dry cleaning or get tickets from a travel agency. When they get to Manhattan, a fleet of minibuses whisks them to other points throughout the area, where they can walk to work. Since 1986, Mr. Imperatore's business has grown from 23 people to more than 7,500, and. Mr. Imperatore expects the ferry to make a $1 million profit this year.
 
The Aesthetic Edge
 On the Hoboken Ferry, a joint venture between Mr. Imperatore's company, Arcorp, and Hartz Mountain Industries, daily ridership between New Jersey and Battery Park City has risen almost 40 percent since last year to 7,000.
"We are able to make this work because we have the right location," says Mr. Imperatore, who owns land on either side of the river. "And you have to try to get people to change commuting habits that have been ingrained. It's hard to change those habits quickly."
But for passengers, profits are not being measured in dollars.
"This is the nicest thing that ever happened to me," said William Kremer as he boarded a Weehawken Ferry for Manhattan. "I drove for more than 26 years and I'd get stuck for at least 45 minutes twice a week. My nerves were totally shot."
"I tried the bus," he said. "But I just couldn't take it. I wasn't fit for work by the time I got there. This relaxes me."
Keiji Tsuchida, a Wall Street banker, said that after years of taking trains in Tokyo, the ferry from downtown Manhattan to Weehawken was an exercise in stress reduction. "Even at rush hour in the morning I can read the paper and eat donuts and drink coffee. That's different from Tokyo, where people are always pushing. It's a nightmare."
Richard Maxwell, an insurance broker who was boarding the afternoon ferry to Highlands, N.J., is another convert. "I used to take the train, then the car, and it was a killer," he said. "This is much better. It has changed my life."

HEADLINE: Study Says Iraq's Child Mortality Rate Has Tripled

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER

 BODY:
A new public health study by American and other Western experts in Iraq says the country's child mortality rate has nearly tripled and perhaps even quadrupled as a result of the Persian Gulf war, civil strife and international sanctions.
Such an elevated mortality rate could mean tens of thousands of additional deaths in Iraq's population of more than three million children under five years old, officials who took part in the survey said, although they declined in their study to make specific projections of overall deaths. 
 The study, a comprehensive follow-up to a smaller survey in May organized by faculty members of Harvard University's school of public health, said Iraq's serious public health deficiencies had improved little if at all.
In the earlier study, the Harvard team estimated that compared with prewar times as many as 170,000 more children would die this year from disease and from the "catastrophic" breakdown of the health-care system. But some public health experts criticized the estimate, based on surveys of hospital wards, as too speculative.
 
9,000 Families Interviewed
 The new study, a copy of which was made available last week before its release today, is based on interviews conducted in more than 9,000 Iraqi households by Arabic-speaking interviewers. The survey was conducted between Aug. 25 and Sept. 10 and provided a data base of more than 16,000 births to study from the standpoint of disease, development and nutrition.
"The medical team wanted to show the proportionate change of child mortality in Iraq in the most current period, and the best way to do that is through a direct survey," said Sara Farnsworth, a spokeswoman for the team, adding, "But that doesn't necessarily produce a reliable number of overall deaths."
Based on the sample, the health survey found that disease and poor nutrition increased the 1991 mortality rate for children to 80 deaths per 1,000 of population, compared with a prewar rate of 20 to 30 deaths per 1,000.
"The acute shortage of infant formula, powdered milk and essential medicines, as well as the rise in the price of food, may have contributed to this elevated risk of mortality among Iraq's children," the study said. "The results presented here suggest that children under the age of 5 in Iraq are receiving sufficient food to avoid acute starvation, but are still severely malnourished."
 
A Million Malnourished
 The study found that malnutrition, measured by body weight and size relative to the age of children, was evident in 29 percent of the population under 5, which translates into nearly one million children significantly undernourished. Nearly 120,000 Iraqi children fell into the category of severely and acutely malnourished.
The group of 35 professionals, largely from universities in the United States and Britain, was financed by grants from the MacArthur and Merck foundations and called itself the International Commission on the Gulf Crisis. Eight separate studies were compiled, including reports on the effects of war and crisis in Iraq on child psychology and on women in Iraq.
The study pointed out that while top Iraqi officials from President Saddam Hussein to senior officers in the military and ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party are exempted from suffering by special access to food imports and hard currency, the majority of Iraqi households are in a state of crisis over food and health because of rampant food-price inflation. An economic study said Iraqis had seen their purchasing power erode 15 to 20 fold.
In this state, most Iraqi families are spending all their income on food, and it is still not enough. Monthly government food rations that typically run out after 10 days are the only thing preventing the outbreak of famine in Iraq, the study asserted, and millions of Iraqis are going hungry for part of each month, the survey found.
 
Harvests Declining
 The major additional findings of the study are these:
*Despite efforts to increase grain harvests to make up for food shortages, the output from Iraq's farmers in 1991 has declined 75 or 80 percent because of breakdowns in the irrigation system and shortages of electricity, fertilizers, pesticides and seeds.
*Iraq's herds of cattle, sheep and goats, the principal source of high-protein meat for the population since the United Nations-imposed economic sanctions, have shrunk by 50 to 60 percent because of increased rates of slaughter, the spread of disease and shortages of veterinary medicines.
*Millions of Iraqis still are drinking water contaminated by sewage. A survey of drinking water in 158 randomly selected households nationwide showed that 106 of the samples tested positive "for gross coliform contamination," a key factor in the spread of diarrheal diseases like typhoid and cholera.
*Most infectious diseases are "thriving" and water-borne diseases like typhoid still are epidemic in southern Iraq. The country's hospital system remains devastated and short of medicine, food and staff.
*The country's electrical generation system, heavily targeted by allied bombers during the war, has been partly revived and recently has been generating 68 percent of its prewar peaks. But a detailed examination of power plants showed that Iraqi engineers had exhausted their supply of spare parts and faced inevitable deterioration of electrical output.
Power losses have a direct effect on public health in Iraq because of the power requirements for water and sewage treatment.
 
Issue of Oil Sales
 The study is one of the most extensive health surveys in the aftermath of modern warfare and is likely to be cited by some United Nations officials who have been arguing that the Security Council should allow Iraq to sell more than the $1.6 billion in oil for humanitarian purchases approved last week.
After paying reparations to Kuwait, Iraq will have about $933 million left to purchase urgently needed supplies of food and medicine under the plan. If Iraq goes ahead with the oil sale -- a move that is in doubt given Baghdad's objections to the terms -- it will be the first major sale since August 1990. Iraq has been trucking small amounts of crude oil to Jordan for barter since the end of the war.
In an editorial note sounded by the authors of the economic survey, the continued United Nations sanctions policy was challenged on the basis of human rights.
"If humanitarian needs are those defined by our basic rights as human beings," it argued, "they go much beyond what the Iraqi economy can deliver as things stand."
Adding that carrying out the cease-fire resolution "is a serious issue," the report says: "The safe disposal of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, demanded by this resolution, is a particularly legitimate concern. But it would be tragic if this concern unleashed the destructive power of another weapon of mass destruction -- the effective withdrawal of food and other necessities from the Iraqi people."

HEADLINE: Ex-Klan Leader's Vote Sends Message to a Pained G.O.P.

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21

 BODY:
Suddenly, the high theater of Louisiana politics has become deadly serious to both parties.
For national Republican leaders, the second-place finish by State Representative David Duke in Saturday's primary for governor, which puts him in the runoff election on Nov. 16, is a source of deep embarrassment. Even as the White House and the Republican National Committee sought to distance themselves from the former Ku Klux Klan leader today, he was making the rounds of the morning talk shows -- as a Republican, he insisted. 
 "I think there are millions of Republicans who agree with me," Mr. Duke said on ABC's "Good Morning America."
 
Democrats Seize Opportunity
 Democrats were quick to reach for the moral high ground today, asserting that Mr. Duke's success in Louisiana is the logical outgrowth of years of Republican attempts to build on racial divisions, with issues from school busing to prison furloughs to the current debate over racial hiring preferences.
But there was little partisan chortling in the capital today: the Louisiana governor's primary had daunting lessons for both parties. Both Republican and Democratic analysts cautioned that Louisiana is the most idiosyncratic of states, with a long history of protest politics and an economy that has been ailing for years.
But these analysts also said that the primary reflected, in extreme form, a powerful anti-establishment mood growing around the country, fed by the recession and evident in developments like the drive to limit Congressional terms. The Duke phenomenon obviously has much to do with race, these analysts said, and the way economically insecure white voters can respond to angry talk about welfare and affirmative-action programs. But it also transcends this, some argued.
On the most immediate level, the Duke phenomenon was a political problem to be managed by the Republicans. From the White House, from Vice President Dan Quayle, and from the Republican National Committee came several painful disavowals, all the more pained since the man Mr. Duke squeezed out of the runoff election was Gov. Buddy Roemer, the Democrat-turned-Republican who was the White House's prize catch earlier this year.
Despite the warm welcome from the White House, including campaign visits by President Bush and Mr. Quayle in recent weeks, Mr. Roemer finished third, behind Mr. Duke and former Gov. Edwin W. Edwards, the flamboyant Democrat seeking a comeback after surviving two trials on corruption charges. The state's Republican Party endorsed another candidate, Representative Clyde C. Holloway.
Clayton K. Yeutter, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said grimly this afternoon: "We simply do not have a horse in that race today. We do not consider Mr. Duke to be a legitimate representative of the Republican Party."
But Ronald H. Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, asserted that the Republicans' "tepid disavowal" of Mr. Duke "is not nearly enough." Mr. Brown asserted, "Frankly, he's running on the same kind of wedge issues that Jesse Helms and George Bush himself ran on."
Natalie Davis, a poll taker at Birmingham-Southern College in Alabama who is a member of the Democratic National Committee, echoed other Democrats in asserting that "Republicans want it both ways": credit for appointing Judge Clarence Thomas, a black man, to the Supreme Court and political gain from issues like Willie Horton, the black convicted murderer used as a symbol of Democratic crime policies.
 
Harkin Sees a Connection
 Some Democrats clearly intend to make Mr. Duke a powerful symbol of the divisions that, they assert, the Republicans seek to tap. Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, a Democratic Presidential contender, asserted that Mr. Bush's divisive policies led "directly, directly" to Mr. Duke's success.
There were other lessons drawn from the Duke vote. James J. Brady, chairman of the Louisiana Democratic Party, said: "Part of his vote is just a hard-core racist vote where if there was some candidate further to the right of Duke they'd be with him. That's probably 30 percent of his vote. But the rest of it is he's appealing to the frustration with government, and that takes on a lot of different variances among different groups, from taxes to affirmative action to the general perception of how government treats people."
Geoffrey Garin, who conducted polls for Senator J. Bennett Johnston in his race against Mr. Duke last year, said that interviews conducted after that election found that the crucial variable was how voters felt about government.
"There wasn't a lot of difference between how pro-Duke whites and anti-Duke whites felt about their economic sitaution," Mr. Garin said. "But there was a big difference in how they felt about their political representation."
Don Sipple, a Republican consultant, agreed. "I think he's a vehicle for a lot of disaffected voters who are growing in their numbers," he said. "It's frustration with the system."
Eddie Mahe, another Republican strategist, said this makes his national party's problem all the more acute: As the establishment attempts to come down on an anti-establishment candidate, it could only feed his appeal. "I think we've got ourselves into a very difficult one," Mr. Mahe said.
Almost no one in politics wants to underestimate Mr. Duke, who has made a career of defying predictions. Susan Howell, director of the Survey Research Center at the University of New Orleans, said her analysis of returns from heavily white parishes on Saturday indicated that Mr. Duke got 42 to 44 percent of the white vote, Mr. Roemer got about 30 percent and Mr. Edwards got 17 to 18 percent.
The overall results, according to the Associated Press, showed Mr. Edwards with 34 percent of the vote, Mr. Duke with 32 percent and Mr. Roemer with 27 percent.
Mr. Duke's past -- he is a former national grand wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and founder of the National Association for the Advancement of White People -- is well known in Louisiana.
But Mr. Duke asserts that he has since moderated his views; he says, as he said this morning on national television, that he is "not a racist" but simply believes in "equal rights."
Many Louisianians said they were hoping that as their state's voters focused on actually electing a governor, rather than sending a message, Mr. Duke would falter.
But in the meantime, many national analysts are studying what the Duke success might say about disaffected, angry voters. Stan Greenberg, a Democratic poll taker, asserted that there is great frustration among white men who have not gone to college, whose incomes are dropping in real terms and who feel that neither party is speaking to them.
"Race is just one piece of it," Mr. Greenberg said, "But if politics in general doesn't respond to those voters, it leaves them available to the extremist candidates."

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING;
Belmont Ends on a Declining Note

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO

 BODY:
Belmont Park rang down the curtain for the year yesterday with stirring memories but with fading numbers: attendance for the 48-day fall season was down by 3.2 percent and wagering by 5 percent, continuing the decline that has afflicted thoroughbred racing in recent years.
But Jerry Lawrence, executive vice president of the New York Racing Association, suggested that "the figures reflect a general malaise in the economy." And he said they implied that "people are being much more careful with their money during this recession." 
 The stately old track on Long Island will stay closed until next May, as it has every year. But the horses will keep running in New York without pause because the Aqueduct track in Queens opens its fall and winter season tomorrow, with the first race booked for 12:30 P.M.
 
Running in the Red
 New York shifts scenes in racing four times a year: in May, from Aqueduct to Belmont; in late July, from Belmont to Saratoga; in late August, from Saratoga back to Belmont, and in late October back to Aqueduct. But wherever they've been running, the horses have been running in red ink.
The New York Racing Association reported these numbers yesterday as it closed Belmont for the winter:
Attendance at the track during the 48-day meeting totaled 510,606, a decline of 3.2 percent from last year's fall season. Betting at the track totaled $117,756,759, a decline of 5 percent. Even statewide betting, which includes Offtrack Betting offices and wagering from one track to another, declined by 2.2 percent to a total of $327,459,609.
 
Careful Spending
 "The figures reflect a general malaise in the economy," Lawrence said. "Ontrack handle is down more than attendance, which leads me to believe that people are being much more careful with their money during this recession.
"Other spectator sports in the New York area have suffered declines this year, some much more radical than ours. Anyone in the sports or entertainment industry has definite concerns about the current economic climate."
"Actually," he added, "business has rebounded since earlier this year. At Aqueduct this spring, both attendance and handle were down in double-digit figures. We are making inroads, but it is a tough battle. Hopefully, business will continue to rebound at Aqueduct.
"Last year's Belmont meet also had the additional advantage of building to a climax with the Breeders' Cup. We did not have that advantage this year."
 
Artistic Success
 The Breeders' Cup, rotated among leading tracks each year, will be held on Nov. 2 at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky. Next year they will be staged at Gulfstream Park in Hallandale, Fla.
But Belmont's fall season at least ended as an artistic success. It was highlighted by 31 stakes races that offered more than $6 million in purses and numerous dramatic highs.
In Excess, who opened the year in California, became a star this summer in New York. He extended his winning streak in major races to four when he won the Woodward Stakes last month, and intensified his campaign for the ultimate prize, the title Horse of the Year.
The handicap star Festin won the Jockey Club Gold Cup. The filly Versailles Treaty succeeded Meadow Star and Lite Light as the heir apparent in their division. And Strike the Gold kept running gamely, but was still chasing his first victory since the Kentucky Derby last May.

HEADLINE: Balance of Nature? What Balance Is That?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
ECOLOGISTS are increasingly abandoning the popular concept of the balance of nature and are replacing it with the image of a natural world in which plant and animal communities perpetually fluctuate. Disturbances like climatic change, fires, storms and disease, some scientists say, seldom give these communities the chance to settle into a state of equilibrium.
And anyway, others contend, populations of plants and animals are inherently unstable and would not achieve equilibrium even in the absence of external disturbances. Now, taking the question a step further, ecologists at the University of Minnesota say they have demonstrated that under some conditions, populations of certain grasses, following an internal dynamic, rise and fall in the irregular, unpredictable patterns that scientists call chaos. 
 The effect of the findings, some scientists say, is to undermine further the idea that nature will settle into a neat, harmonious balance if humans leave it alone. The findings are also viewed as an encouraging step in the attempt to understand the patterns of ecological systems.
In this case, Dr. David Tilman and Dr. David Wedin of Minnesota report in the current issue of the British journal Nature that they experimentally manipulated populations of a native American wild grass, Agrostis scabra. Farmers call it pant-creeper because its seeds have thorns that make them crawl up one's leg.
In 1985, the experimenters sowed Agrostis seeds at two different initial densities on plots containing 10 different levels of nitrogen, the plants' main nourishment. After the plants appeared, those in low-nitrogen soils maintained a fairly stable amount of above-ground biomass, meaning all the plant that appeared above ground as measured by dry weight. The biomass of grass in richer soil oscillated more, its amount expanding and contracting from year to year over the five-year period of the experiment. Those in the richest soil, displaying the wild oscillations that scientists associate with the chaotic behavior of dynamic systems, exhibited a 6,000-fold crash, to nearly zero, in 1988.
 
The Problem With Litter
 Scientists in the young field of chaos theory say that in dynamic systems, chaos begins when increasing velocity or energy forces the system to a certain point. A familiar example is the turbulence that begins when a smoothly flowing stream of water reaches a certain velocity. In the case of the Agrostis plants, said Dr. Tilman, the greater boost of energy provided by the richest soil kicked the oscillating population of grass into a chaotic fluctuation.
He described the mechanism by which this happened: The higher nitrogen level spurred greater plant growth. When the above-ground parts of the plants died in winter, they left a heavy layer of litter. The next spring, this layer prevented the new shoots of the perennial grass from growing, causing the crash. The lower the levels of nitrogen, the smaller the oscillations. Only those plant populations in the richest soil crashed.
This pattern illustrates another hallmark of chaotic behavior, said Dr. Tilman, namely that any small difference in initial conditions will be magnified -- in this casecausing the biomass of the plants in the different plots to diverge more sharply as the dynamic process unfolds.
This dependence on initial conditions, as chaos theorists call it, was also reflected in another aspect of the Minnesota experiment. Among the plants in the richest soil, the ones that plunged into chaos, those originally planted at a lower density recovered more rapidly, their population trending more sharply upward in the last two years of the experiment.
None of four other grass species growing in the experimental garden suffered a crash or lapsed into chaotic behavior, Dr. Tilman said, suggesting that the behavior was not caused by environmental conditions.
"I never imagined I would find chaos," he said. "I imagined it would grow up to equilibrium. This has changed my world view, to be blunt about it."
 
More Work Is Needed
 The study demonstrates "that ecologists are now ready to think this way," said Dr. Daniel Botkin, an ecologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara. "If someone did this 15 or 20 years ago," he said, "it would have been abandoned as a failed experiment. There wouldn't have been any basis for interpreting the results. Now scientists in this area are beginning to look at their experiments in a new light. That's the really important thing" about the Tilman-Wedin study.
Dr. Tilman said that chaotic patterns might not occur all the time in an ecological context, and the Nature paper says that more work is needed to determine how general they are. But, he said, "chaos might be much more likely in natural systems than we imagined five years or so ago," adding, "There is a good chance that many ecological systems are going to have chaotic dynamics in them." In ecosystems with more than one species, he said, chaos is even more likely.
Other experts said that while the new study provides one of the most vivid bits of evidence yet of chaos in ecological systems, the Minnesota ecologists have not yet nailed it down unequivocally. "I think he's demonstrated that there may be chaos," said Dr. William M. Schaffer of the University of Arizona. "The data are highly suggestive and very interesting. I think this is very exciting."
In the early 1970's, Dr. Schaffer was a pioneer in probing the role of chaos in ecological systems, notably in an investigation of the chaos factor in the waxing and waning of measles epidemics.
Scientists have been investigating the role of chaos in many areas of science, from chemistry to weather and climate, to fluid dynamics to astronomy to economics, even to physiology, where some investigators believe it may play a role in disturbance of heart rhythms. The term chaos is used by scientists not in its conventional sense of total disorder but in a specialized way. It deals essentially with the concept of order within disorder. Turbulent, chaotic systems may look as if they behave randomly and with total disorder. But scientists say they exhibit an underlying, long-term order that is neither wholly deterministic nor wholly random.
 
A Lack of Crispness
 The study of chaos in ecological systems is especially difficult because they do not behave with the crispness of, say, a chemical reaction or the flow of fluid in a tube. For a long time, said Dr. Schaffer, ecologists looked at chaos as a mathematical curiosity. For this reason, he said, the Tilman-Wedin paper is likely to provoke skepticism.
But, he said: "I think that if you're going to look for this sort of thing in ecological systems, this is the only approach. It's going to have to be an experimental approach with semi-natural systems." In nature, he said, it is impractical to study the dynamics of a population or an ecosystem because it takes too long for the dynamics to unfold.
What does it matter? "There is this widespread perception that there is a balance of nature, that in the absence of human interference, systems are going to settle down at this mythical balance point," Dr. Schaffer said. "To the contrary, the evidence is that many species fluctuate an enormous amount with regard to their densities."
Whether this is an inherent property of the system or the result of external disruption is a big question, he said. But either way, he said, the possibility of ecological chaos suggests that in principle, at least, ecological processes can be analyzed and understood.
"It really cuts the legs out from underneath this position that all we really have to do is leave these systems alone and everything's going to be ducky," he said. "What we have to do is understand how these systems behave and then we as people can decide what we want, how to manage them appropriately."
While the balance-of-nature concept remains strong in general circulation, many scientists have discarded it. For his part, said Dr. Tilman, he has long since abandoned the notion. "That phrasing hasn't been used much in 20 years. The issue is more one of what is controlling the patterns we see in nature."

 Chaos theory holds that any small variation in initial conditions in a dynamic system can be magnified many times. In an experiment, grass plants grew luxuriantly in the soil riches in nitrogen.
 When the above-ground parts of teh plants died in winter, they left a heavy layer of litter. It kept light from the new shoots the next spring, causing a crash in population. The lower the levels of nitrogen, the smaller the oscillations. ONly those plant populations in the richest soil crashed. (Source: Grasses, An Identification Guide (Houghton Mifflin)

Return With Us Now . . .

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER

 BODY:
Meanwhile, back at the recession leading economists, leading political leaders and leading President George H. W. Bush are at grips with the most vital question of the day. That question: Is there a recession, and if so, who cares as long as the polls show the election is in the bag?
As we join them, little Jane and Jimmy too have just galloped up to the White House unaccompanied by their usual cohorts, leading 1935 radio cowboy star Tom Mix and Tom's wonder horse Tony. A leading economist, prone to saying what everybody but the audience has known for days, speaks: 
 "Little Jane and Jimmy too! You rode off with Tom to find the answer to the most vital question of our generation: to wit, who leaked the F.B.I. report on Anita Hill? Yet now you return without either Tom or Tony."
The President, a mite testily: "Now wait a minute! Just because Tom isn't with them doesn't justify the media in saying America is in a state of Tomlessness."
Leading White House sycophant: "Or Tonylessness either, Mr. President. Anyhow, even if it is, what about Chappaquiddick?"
Little Jane and Jimmy too, who have the annoying habit of speaking as one, have an alarming tale: "While studying a cold campfire for clues to the source of the monstrous leak, Tom was taken unawares by three statesmen --"
"At this point in time nobody says 'taken unawares,' " says a leading economics prose master. "You mean that events outside Tom's parameters of expectation converged to limit his previous mobility. In short, if he's now unemployed, it's his own fault."
Little Jane and Jimmy too: "They weren't parameters that seized Tom, sir. They were three statesmen, Senators three: Simpson, Specter and Hatch. 'Don't try to get by with a scurrilous lie,' we heard them tell Tom with a hair-raising cry, 'for remember with fear what is written quite clear: "A tooth for a tooth and an eye for an eye." So best tell the truth or you'll be the prize catch of the statesmen three: Specter, Simpson and Hatch.' "
Leading White House aide John Sununu suggests that since Tom is now unable to keep tots chowed down at the bunkhouse, little Jane and Jimmy too now do something unglamorous for the Administration and take jobs as hamburger flippers. Though not as exciting as riding the range for justice, he says, it will hold down the unemployment statistics.
"But," wail Jimmy too and little Jane, "Tom is being held prisoner in the old mine shaft while Senator Simpson reads him a code of media ethics night and day."
Leading President Bush, suddenly alert: "I can't believe it! Tom Mix mixed up with the media crowd? A great American like Tom, riding a great American wonder horse like Tony to say George Bush cares more about foreign policy than he does about the domestic agenda? Say it isn't so, little Jane and Jimmy too!"
Hangdog intonations subtly enter the voice of little Jane and Jimmy too, for, being 1935 children, they believe in legends and admire George Washington, so cannot tell a lie. "As radio people," they say, "we are all inescapably, alas, media: Tom, Tony the wonder horse and we two too, little Jane and Jimmy too."
A leading White House handler of Supreme Court nominees says, "There wasn't any media in 1935 --"
"Not 'wasn't any media,' " says a leading Republican pedant. "It's 'weren't any media.' Media's plural. Needs a plural verb."
"That was one of the few great things about 1935: There weren't any media," says a leading White House sentimentalist. "There were Orphan Annie, the Singing Lady, Bobby Benson, Chandu the Magician, and while most people knew a little Latin, everybody still spoke English."
"No wonder the Republicans lost every election that came along," says a leading campaign consultant and master of the science of clouding men's minds. "Speaking of which, shall we meet again next week after studying some fresh polls for an answer to the most vital question of the day: to wit, is there a recession, and if so, so what?"
Meanwhile, at a faraway California ranch, Tony the wonder horse is being turned away by a former leading American President with the explanation, "There's no free oats."

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Double Standard

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
The double standard in the Middle East has become built into American diplomacy and journalism. It is so taken for granted that hardly anybody notices.
It is time to notice, the most important of times. The Israeli-Arab talks supposed to start at the end of this month can be an important step in the Mideast. The credit goes to the persistence of President Bush and Secretary of State James Baker, the willingness of the Israeli Cabinet to take plain risks for peace, and the decision of some Palestinians not to let yet another opportunity pass them by. 
 At last Palestinians and Jordanians will, in a joint delegation, face the Israelis. At least in theory, a basis of the talks will be the only solution possible for some years -- Palestinian self-government for five years, hedged by Israeli military presence but meanwhile given broader horizons by negotiations about what-next.
If these talks are to get a fair chance, American diplomats, politicians and journalists of conscience, who will assess the talks day by day, ought to examine the double standard now -- in justice not simply to Israel but to all who ache for peace in the Middle East.
In some important part, the double standard comes out of the nature of Israeli society and is a great asset to the country. If a higher standard of ethics and conduct is demanded of Israelis, it is because even its antagonists know it judges itself on democratic and political standards unknown elsewhere in the Middle East. Without those self-imposed standards Israel would have no greater claim to support and affection than any other small nation.
But throughout its existence, and increasingly, the double standard has not been just a debate about ethics. It became a whole arsenal of deadly weapons against Israel that the world chooses to ignore -- vicious racial and religious insult, terrorism, boycott and embargo, refusal to abide by elementary diplomatic rules of conduct and, now, sabotage of the peace talks.
For almost a half-century Israel has been bombarded with filth -- from the ceaseless and still-continuing anti-Israel and anti-Jewish campaign in almost every Muslim country, worldwide. Filth from mouth, the press and the airwaves is meant to dehumanize a nation and make its extinction desirable. The world says nothing, does nothing.
In the United States -- even in America -- cartoons appear in the mainstream press that could have run in German Nazi papers. One showed an ugly Yitzhak Shamir beating a prostrate, tied Palestinian with a mace from which swung a menacing Star of David. The Star of David is a routine symbol of oppression now for some American cartoonists. Publishers do nothing; readers, nothing.
A Saudi Arabian is elected president of the U.N. General Assembly. Before the Foreign Minister of Israel speaks, the Saudi prostitutes his position by absenting himself from the rostrum. If an Israeli had by some mad chance been elected president of any U.N. body, and withdrawn not to soil his eyes and ears with an Arab speaker, the critics of Israel, from the most vulgar to the toniest, would have howled. I didn't hear any howls about the absent Saudi.
Israel is asked to pay heavily, in land, for the normal trade and diplomatic relations that every other country gets as an automatic mark of nationhood. Pay to end the embargo, pay to get credits, pay to receive ambassadors. What payment did the U.S. get from Saddam Hussein for pushing credits to Iraq just before the invasion of Kuwait?
And now, Syria announces its boycott of half the peace conference, possibly the more important half -- the regional discussions among Israel and her neighbors on arms control, water, economic development.
If Israel had done that -- oh my, Washington and the journalistic critics would have positively danced with rage. I see not a step.
Instead it is Israel that gets the new barrage of warnings -- shape up or starve, or as some fellow put it with such sensitive wit in The Washington Post, beggars can't be choosers.
So the anti-Israeli double standard already has made it a half-conference. The Arab states note American acquiescence. If Americans keep applying the double standard, what's left of the conference won't have much of a life expectancy.

HEADLINE: If Stability of Revenue Is the Main Goal, Choose the Sales Tax

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In recent months -- most recently in "Who Will Pay in Connecticut?" (editorial, Oct. 8) -- you have told us that sales taxes provide "highly unstable revenue." Heavy reliance on sales taxes can be criticized on several grounds, but revenue instability is not one of them.
The truth is the opposite: the sales tax is the most stable tax base available to American state and local governments. Over the last 30 years, personal consumption expenditure for durable and nondurable goods less food -- a reasonable proxy for the base of the sales tax in most states -- has never declined from one year to the next. The average year-to-year increase has been about 7.5 percent, and there were only five years in which it was less than 4 percent. 
 In contrast, the average year-to-year change in Federal taxable personal income in the 20 years before the 1986 tax reform law was close to 10 percent; for corporate income the average yearly change in the base was nearly 12 percent, with frequent year-to-year declines. If stability of revenue is the main goal, choose the sales tax.

HEADLINE: Pentagon Wizards of Technology Eye Wider Civilian Role

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
A HIGH-STAKES ideological skirmish is heating up over a little-known Federal agency that some see as the savior of America's high-technology industry and others see as another example of misguided Government meddling in the economy.
The tiny agency, credited as the unseen hand in shaping many major technical innovations, from computers to materials science, is a high technology arm of the Pentagon known as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa. The White House, Congress and some of the nation's top economists and scientists are battling over whether Darpa should explicitly try to invigorate civilian industry so the United States can better compete with international rivals, especially Japan. 
 The proposed task is challenging since Darpa has no laboratories of its own, no research scientists and no study centers. With a staff of only 150 people housed on three floors of a nondescript building in Arlington, Va., a few blocks from the Potomac, it nonetheless is widely seen as a lean, mean wizard of high technology.
The agency works by searching the land for hints of promising research and then paying select companies and universities to push back high-risk, high-payoff frontiers. Successes to which Darpa has contributed since its founding 33 years ago include Stealth aircraft, cruise missiles, tiny satellites and fundamental strides in computers, electronics, robotics, artificial intelligence and new materials.
The present battle is over whether Darpa should narrow its focus to technologies of purely military interest or broaden it to include spurring such advanced commercial technologies as high-definition television, computer chips, flat displays and fiber optics.
"It's urgent that we get a consensus," Dr. Lewis M. Branscomb, a Harvard professor and former chief scientist of I.B.M., said in an interview. "The Government and Darpa should be able to support a large category of technologies without any sense of guilt or hesitation. If not, we'll go the way of Britain, of lost markets and relative national decline."
The United States once enjoyed a commanding lead in high-technology industries, but it increasingly faces challenges in such fields as electronics, computers and aerospace. In 1990, the top holders of United States patents were all Japanese companies -- Hitachi with 908, Toshiba with 891, Canon with 868 and Mitsubishi with 862. General Electric, which once dominated the top spot, ranked fifth with 785 patents.
The Democratic-controlled Congress has backed a broadening of Darpa's mission, fearing that the United States is fast losing its technical edge and that Darpa carries a hope of reversing the slide. But the Republican White House has resisted that push and instead fought for a narrowing. It says market forces, not unqualified Federal bureaucrats, should chart the course of the nation's industrial growth.
"Government has demonstrated no capacity for choosing among promising new technologies," Murray L. Weidenbaum, a former White House adviser who is an economist at Washington University in St. Louis, recently told Congress. "To a significant degree, Darpa has succeeded by virtue of its ability to bypass much of the Pentagon bureaucracy. If it gets much larger, it likely would loose that special characteristic."
Pressure to broaden and enlarge Darpa is nonetheless rising for a host of reasons. The end of the cold war is seen in some quarters as relaxing the need to keep pushing the outer envelope of military technology, while the ailing economy and stiff competition from abroad are heightening hopes in Darpa's vaunted power to create new high-technology industries.
Perhaps most important, a number of Congressional attempts to form new civilian agency modeled on Darpa -- most notably an effort by Senator John Glenn of Ohio -- have failed in the last few years, leading to a drive to reshape the model itself.
"There is a very strong aversion to the growth of the Federal Government in the country at large," Bobby R. Inman, a retired admiral who was director of the National Security Agency and chairman of the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation, said in an interview.
"So you try to alter missions to deal with the problem. The leanest and most flexible of the research institutions in finding new technology is Darpa. So it's become the focus."
 
The Question
Should Darpa Become Narpa?
 Recently, Admiral Inman served as chairman of a 15-member task force of the Carnegie Commission on Science, Technology and Government that called for Darpa to be transformed into the National Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Narpa. The new entity would support high-risk technologies of commercial value, helping the military as well as other Federal agencies.
"The end of the cold war and the relative decline in our technical position call for new policies," Admiral Inman told the Congressional Joint Economic Committee last month in making the Carnegie plan public. "In the future, both economic and military security will depend on commercially driven technology."
Congress is now weighing legislation to turn Darpa into Narpa, although no one is predicting quick passage.
"The Federal Government is a very undiscriminating purchasing agent for the American people and will damn near buy anything," Representative Richard Arney, a Texas Republican, said last month while disparaging the Carnegie plan, adding that a Narpa would simply expand the sphere of ineptitude.
Despite such arguments, the Government over the decades has managed to pioneer a wide variety of technologies that have found civilian uses, including rockets, jet engines, communication satellites and photovoltaic cells. It has also had debacles. The $25 billion space shuttle program is still largely a technology in search of a mission. Synthetic fuels and the breeder reactor suffered a similar fate.
 
The Track Record
Smart Weapons And Computers
 Darpa, more so than most Federal agencies, has a remarkable record for spurring innovation. Moreover, its technologies have often found civilian as well as military uses because the agency has long assumed that a healthy industrial base and vigorous basic research are the sinews of national security.
Darpa almost single-handedly founded the fields of materials science and computer science in the United States, paving the way not only for the smart weapons of the Persian Gulf war but the personal computer industry.
An example of its serendipity is the technique of packet-switching. Using the technique, networks for computer data break information into billions of tiny bits and direct them to their destination across a host of different routes. If there is a pause or some other fluctuation in the electronic flow on one wire, say, when a remote computer user goes to the washroom, then the network fills the void with messages destined for someone else so as not to waste valuable time. The wire is thus always working at nearly full capacity. As a result, costs are far lower than with regular telephone lines.
Darpa pioneered packet-switching in the mid 1960's. By the early 1970's it had created Arpanet, a Defense Department network that inexpensively tied together hundreds of military computers. In the 1970's and 1980's, there was an explosion of commercial spinoffs around the world, including services known as Telenet, Tymnet, Graphnet, the Bell System's Advanced Information Service, Uninet and the I.B.M. Information Network, as well as similar systems in France, Britain, Spain, Canada and Japan.
 
A Change of Pattern
Civilian Industries Overtake Military
 Darpa's traditional role in developing so-called "dual use" technologies, of value to both military and civilians, started to undergo some criticism with the arrival of the Reagan Administration in the early 1980's. Its laissez-faire conservatives preached the virtues of free enterprise, some arguing that Darpa should be focused more narrowly.
At the same time, however, an important reversal occurred in national patterns of research spending that had, and continues to have, huge implications for the military. For the first time, beginning in 1980, American industry pulled ahead of the Federal Government as the nation's main supporter of research. As a result of this and other factors, civilian strides increasingly began to outpace the military's. Moreover, foreign civilian industries started to pull ahead even faster.
By the late 1980's, some Pentagon officials saw an ominous gap opening up that they believed would ultimately endanger national security as the military fell further behind.
"I felt if we didn't have a broad industrial base, we were going to die," recalled Dr. Robert B. Costello, who in 1988 became Under Secretary of Defense for acquisition.
Dr. Costello, to whom Darpa reported, used his influence to fight for an expansion of the agency's agenda, advocating such things as its financing of Sematech, a consortium of computer chip producers, as well as high-definition television, which provides a picture that has a crispness and a clarity comparable to that of films. It was seen as having numerous uses in civilian life as well as the battlefield.
Congress liked that approach, too. Beginning in 1988, it gave Darpa more money than the Administration wanted and mandated special attention to commercially significant technologies like advanced television, high-temperature superconductivity, new materials, manufacturing technologies and X-ray lithography for etching computer chips.
Dr. Costello, meanwhile, championed a scientist who shared his views to become Darpa's director. Dr. Craig I. Fields, then 42, took the post in May 1989, speaking out vocally in behalf of Federal sponsorship of technologies with clear commercial links.
In the Bush Administration, the lingering tensions between the free marketers and the technology planners soon exploded. The White House learned that Dr. Fields had Darpa invest $4 million in Gazelle Microcircuits Inc., a Silicon Valley electronics company working on super-high-speed computer chips made of gallium arsenide.
Under an experimental program approved by Congress, the agency made its investment much like a venture capitalist, expecting to receive a payback if the company became successful. The deal also allowed Gazelle to deflect an investment from a Japanese company, which might have entailed transferring the technology to Japan. But Administration officials wondered why the Pentagon was investing when another private company, albeit a Japanese one, was willing to put money in.
In May 1990, Dr. Fields was removed as head of the agency, ending an increasingly bitter fight with top White House officials. The Administration also diverted to other uses much of the $30 million Darpa had devoted to advanced television and sought to focus Sematech more clearly on defense needs.
 
The War Isn't Over
One Senator Tries To Be a Bridge
 The opposition to a Federal role in so-called industrial policy is said to emanate from Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and John H. Sununu, President Bush's chief of staff.
The war over Darpa is far from over. A recent victim is Dr. Michael J. Kelly, who directed Darpa's manufacturing division until it was disbanded and its parts dispersed a few months ago.
"Darpa is a fantastic organization," Dr. Kelly said in an interview. "It has outstanding people. But the greatest risk to the nation is not military. It's economic. Darpa should be doing much more to enhance the industrial base."
Dr. Kelly said he had been accused of "focusing too much attention" on that goal. After his division was disbanded, he left Darpa to direct the Manufacturing Research Center at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
What is emphasized at Darpa now are technology projects with more direct bearing on the military. For instance, the agency is financing the development of a small rocket, the Taurus, that is to be a low-cost and reliable way to send small military satellites into space.
It is also working to perfect a new type of propulsion for submarines. Known as magnetohydrodynamics, it has no moving parts, is virtually silent and promises great reliability at relatively low cost. The process works when a powerful magnet exerts a force on sea water, driving water out the back of a long tube and creating forward motion.
Darpa, thanks to Congressional largess, also still gets much money for civilian technologies, although these are now often pursued in ways that are somewhat surreptitious. For instance, its budget is growing for "high-definition systems," a fairly obvious code name for advanced television. And the programs in its manufacturing division have simply been distributed throughout the agency, not killed outright.
Congress generally gives high marks to Darpa's current director, Dr. Victor H. Reis, for walking a diplomatic line between fiercely competitive forces. "He's always going to emphasize the defense requirement," said a House aide who closely follows the agency. "But a lot of times he does dual-use projects under the guise of defense."
But Dr. Costello, the former Under Secretary of Defense, who is now at the Hudson Institute, said Darpa's efforts were often too timid to make a difference.
"If you want a flat-panel display now, you have to buy it from the Japanese," he said. "The military should have aggressively pursued them. It needs them in F-15's, in tanks, in the White House and on the backs of the Marines who are going to scurry into Iraq next time. Instead of that, we're still saddled with old equipment that does not meet the military's needs."
A member of Congress who is trying to bridge the gap between opposing camps is Senator Jeff Bingaman, a New Mexico Democrat who has pushed for dual-use Darpa programs in which research costs are shared by industry, allowing some attention to market forces. Last year he promoted a $50 million package for the development of pre-competitive technologies by industry consortia. Darpa put the money into ceramic fibers, optical electronics, superconducting electronics, linguistic data processing, parallel computers and advanced memory chips.
"The areas chosen are critical," Senator Bingaman said in a recent statement. "It is clear Darpa will be leveraging significant private sector resources in the six consortia."
Still, the Carnegie Commission would go further, transforming Darpa into a much more diverse agency. It is a proposition most analysts expect to be a hard sell with the Bush Administration, given its preference for the invisible hand of the free market.
"What does scare me," Dr. Weidenbaum told Congress, "is that once you open this door, there is no limit to the expansion of the Government's role in this major area of the economy."

Diagram: "An Engine of Invention, Running Behind the Scenes"
 The Pentagon's little-known research finance agency, Darpa, has backed winning technologies for the military; many have found wide civilian use.
 
1. TRANSMITTING DATA
In the 1960's, Darpa backed development of packet switching, which breaks computer data into tiny bits and routes them over networks in the most efficient fashion. Civilian spinoffs exploded in the 1970's and 1980's, including well-known networks like Telenet and Tymnet.
 
2. HIGH-TEMPERATURE METALS
Darpa-financed researchers largely originated the field of materials science and pioneered work on advanced crystallography, ceramics and metalurgy, including titanium-based alloys and nickel aluminide, a metal of great strength even at high temperatures.
 
3. STEALTH WEAPONS
Darpa was the force behind radar-evading aircraft, developing absorbent materials, dispersive coatings, shaping strategies and flight prototypes. The work resulted in the B-2 bomber and the F-117 fighter, which bombed Baghdad with impunity during the Persian Gulf war.
 
4. COMPUTER CHIPS
Darpa fostered the field of computer science, paving the way for the U.S. computer industry. In addition, it advanced critical areas of materials science that turned semiconductors into the computer chips at the heart of smart weapons and personal computers.
 
5. LASERS
Darpa advanced the strength and usefulness of lasers after their inital demonstration in 1960. It focused on developing laser materials and high-powered devices that might be useful in war. This research helped inspire interest in "Star Wars" anti-missile defenses.
 
6. COMPOSITES
Darpa's materials-science push helped pave the way for high-strength, light-weight composite materials that are finding their way into everything from tennis rackets to jet aircraft. It has explored complex weaves as well as random arrays of particles and fibers. (pg. C1)
