HEADLINE: Fight Is Looming in Congress On Tax Break for Home Buyers

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

DATELINE: DALLAS 

 BODY:
When Congress passed an $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers last winter, it was intended as a dose of shock therapy during a crisis. Now the question is becoming whether the housing market can function without it.
 As many as 40 percent of all home buyers this year will qualify for the credit. It is on track to cost the government $15 billion, more than twice the amount that was projected when Congress passed the stimulus bill in February. 
 In the view of the real estate industry and some economists, all that money is well spent. They contend the credit is doing what it was meant to do, encouraging a recovery in the housing market that is gathering steam. Analysts say the credit is directly responsible for several hundred thousand home sales.
 Skeptics argue that most of the money is going to people who would have bought a home anyway. And they contend that unless it is allowed to expire on schedule in late November, the tax credit is likely to become one more expensive government program that refuses to die.
 The real estate industry, including the powerful 1.1 million-member National Association of Realtors, wants Congress to extend the credit at least through next summer. The group hopes to expand the program to $15,000 and to allow all buyers, not just those who have been out of the market for at least three years, to qualify. The price tag on that plan: $50 billion to $100 billion.
 Joseph and Chassity Myers are among the two million buyers eligible for the credit this year. The newlyweds heard they could get money from the government for something they were tempted to do anyway. 
 ''It was a no-brainer,'' said Mr. Myers, a commercial underwriter. ''Owning something is the American family dream.'' 
 The couple bought a two-bedroom condominium here in the spring for $171,000 and amended their 2008 taxes immediately, receiving their windfall by direct deposit a few weeks later. 
 Their home is now a monument to the government's generosity. They bought a leather couch, a kitchen table, a bed, television stand, china cabinet, kitchen table, coffee table, grill and patio set. 
 ''We did exactly what the government wanted us to do,'' said Ms. Myers, a third grade teacher. ''We stimulated the economy.''
 Mortgage applications increased nearly 10 percent for the week ending Sept. 3 from late August, the largest gain since early April and the latest of many signs of life in real estate. The upturn can be attributed to several factors: the return of confidence, very low mortgage rates, and prices in some markets that are at decade-low levels.
 But the looming expiration of the tax credit on Nov. 30 seems to be playing a role too, particularly in relatively low-cost markets like Phoenix, Las Vegas and Dallas. 
 The 50-year-old complex that the Myerses live in, grandly named the Lawn at Bluffview, provides a snapshot of the credit's influence -- and limitations. Two years ago, the buildings were converted from apartments to condominiums by their owner, a local developer. In January, before the credit, only 30 of the 70 units had sold.
 Since then, another seven units have sold, including the one bought by the Myerses. Brian Denbow, who works for a subprime auto financing firm, also was spurred to action by the credit. He too intends to use the money for furniture. Five of the buyers did not qualify for the credit for various reasons.
 The Lawn at Bluffview remains nowhere near full. Potential buyers ''just want a deal,'' said the sales agent, Beverly Bell. Two weeks ago, the price of the unsold units was cut 10 percent. 
 The National Association of Realtors estimates that about 350,000 sales this year would not have happened without the lure of the tax credit. Moody'sEconomy.com used computer modeling to put the number at 400,000. 
 The government's efforts to directly reward home buyers began more than a year ago with a $7,500 tax credit that had to be repaid over 15 years. Last winter, amid fears of another Great Depression, the Senate came up with a much sweeter $15,000 package as part of the stimulus bill. That measure was ultimately reduced to the $8,000 credit.
 Now the sponsor of the original Senate bill, Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, is back with a new bill that would give a maximum $15,000 credit to any buyer who stays in a home for at least two years. 
 ''The problem now is not first-time buyers, it's the move-up market -- the guy transferred from Chicago to Atlanta who can't sell his house,'' said Mr. Isakson, a former real estate agent.
 Without a new and more generous credit, he warned, there would be a downward spiral of home sales and more foreclosures, provoking a second recession.
 The real estate industry is lobbying heavily for the bill, but acknowledges that in an atmosphere that is less crisis-driven than last winter it will almost certainly have to settle for less. 
 ''There will be a lot of water under the bridge, a lot of compromise, between now'' and a final bill, said Richard A. Smith, chairman of the Business Roundtable's Housing Working Group.
 Economists are sharply split on the merits of another round of government help. 
 Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Economy.com, favors expanding the credit to all home buyers, even investors, into next summer. ''The risks of not doing something like this are too great,'' he said. ''I don't think the coast is clear.''
 James Glassman of JPMorgan Chase echoed those views but said he favored continuing to restrict the credit to first-time buyers.
 On the other side of the issue is the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute. It labeled the original credit as one of the worst provisions of the stimulus package, on the grounds that the money is a bonus for people who would buy a house anyway. The center has an even dimmer view of extending the credit to all buyers.
 ''Is this the best way to spend money we don't have?'' asked senior fellow Roberton Williams.
 Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research called the credit ''a questionable redistributive policy'' from renters to home buyers, but said that he used it himself when he bought a house.
 He wrote on his blog: ''Thank you very much, suckers!''

HEADLINE: Rosh Hashana, Circa 1919

BYLINE: By JOAN NATHAN

DATELINE: Portsmouth, N.H. 

 BODY:
 ''SHALOM ALEICHEM!'' Shiva Shapiro said in a heavy Yiddish accent to her visitors. 
 As she deftly stuffed cabbage leaves with rice and stewed tomatoes, and displayed other dishes she has made on her 1900 Beauty Hub coal stove, Ms. Shapiro drew her guests into her life. 
 ''This is 1919,'' she said. ''Last year was the end of the influenza epidemic and the end of the war to end all wars. We're a Jewish family and we're keeping kosher in our home. I don't read English, only Yiddish and Hebrew. My daughter Mollie learned about bananas at school. I think that bananas are mushy, but I take her to buy a hand of bananas for 25 cents.'' 
 Mrs. Shapiro is actually Barbara Ann Paster, one of the actors here at the Strawbery Banke restoration, a living museum in which over 350 years of Portsmouth homes, stores, churches and history have been preserved. It is in Puddle Dock, which was a decrepit neighborhood destined to be razed under urban renewal until a campaign in the 1950s and '60s led by the town librarian saved 42 houses on 10 acres to create the museum. 
 The area was first settled in 1623 by the English, who found a profusion of strawberries there. By the turn of the 20th century Italians, Irish, English, French-Canadians and East European Jews had come here to find work. Although most immigrants at that time settled in large cities, some settled directly in smaller towns like Portsmouth. By 1919, 152 Russian Jews made up about a quarter of the immigrant population of Puddle Dock and 18 of them were Shapiro relatives, according to the museum. 
 As Mrs. Shapiro, the wife of a pawnbroker with a 9-year-old daughter, Mrs. Paster cooks dishes that follow the rhythm of the seasons, and the Jewish calendar. 
 She may make strawberry jam for her strudel in June, or pickle cucumbers with dill from her garden, or put up Reliance peaches with brandy in August. 
 For Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, which begins on Friday evening, she excitedly pinched rolled-out strips of pasta dough into bowtie noodles to use with leftover kasha stuffing from her roast chicken, and made traditional honey and poppy seed cakes. 
 Mrs. Paster, 61, has been portraying Mrs. Shapiro since the Shapiro house opened in 1997. ''My entire life was made for this job,'' Mrs. Paster said with a laugh. ''I married an Orthodox man. I'm Jewish from Russia, so I know the rules of kashrut and family purity. I am also a storyteller.''
 The real Mrs. Shapiro immigrated from Anapol, Ukraine, in 1905 with other family members to meet her future husband, Abraham, also from Anapol, in Portsmouth, where he went to work in a shoe factory and later became the president of Portsmouth's synagogue, Temple of Israel.
 At Strawbery Banke, visitors encounter Shiva Shapiro as a 34-year-old woman whose time is spent in her kosher kitchen with its coal stove and icebox. ''I get 50 pounds of ice for 25 cents every other day and I can keep kosher meat for up to three days,'' she said. ''There is hardly a time when I would need to keep it so long as there are two kosher butchers with delivery: Jacob Segal in a horse and buggy and Harry Liberson, who came here from an advertisement looking for a butcher in The Jewish Messenger out of New York and has stayed for 65 years.'' 
 Holidays were at the center of the Shapiro family's life, and the museum staff took great pains to ensure the historical accuracy of the foods prepared and the items the family had available. 
 ''To authenticate the Shapiro house,'' said Michelle Moon, director of education for the museum, ''the curatorial staff interviewed 30 people from the neighborhood and took pollen and seed analyses to determine what grew and was eaten in their home.'' 
 Mrs. Shapiro's grandson, Burt Wolf, 75, recalls picking seed pods for poppy seed cake or filling for his grandmother's holiday strudel.
 In 1919 it was still too early for standard East European ingredients like kasha, poppy seeds and kale to be in mainstream cookbooks like ''Fanny Farmer,'' which Mollie translated for her mother. Even Florence Greenbaum's ''International Jewish Cookbook'' (1918) had only one recipe for mohn (poppy seed) roly polys and none for kale or kasha. 
 But immigrants brought seeds of their traditional foods, like yellow Ukrainian carrots, kale and parsnips. Mrs. Shapiro bought harder-to-save seeds like beets in Jackson's hardware store. 
 ''Mr. Wolf and many older immigrants told us that they ate yellow Ukrainian tomatoes, which we know Mrs. Shapiro was growing in her garden,'' said John Forti, curator of historic landscape for the museum. She canned the more acidic red tomatoes.
 Mr. Forti found a Reliance peach tree growing out of the compost pile in the Shapiro's garden. Seed catalogs from that time included climbing Russian cucumbers and Zubrinski yellow potatoes, which are planted there now. 
 Stoneware crock shards found in the yard were a clue for the staff. ''Mrs. Shapiro was putting up the food in the old style as well as using canning jars,'' he said. ''We found kale seeds in the walls of another immigrant's house.'' 
 Jewish truck farmers in the neighboring town of Greenland grew buckwheat -- used at that time in America only for buckwheat pancakes -- for kasha, an East European staple. 
 Recipes were handed down orally, at least in the East European immigrant communities, and they also traveled between neighbors. ''Whenever Camilla Pento comes to the house she points to the mandelbrot and says 'biscotti,' '' Mrs. Shapiro said. ''She came to my house one day to show me how to make her biscotti. Nothing wrong with her recipe but in order for my family to eat it, we need to make it here so it's kosher. I made my mandelbrot and poppy seed cake and she her biscotti and pizzelles with a brand new pizzelle iron.''
 The Sabbath and holidays were the center of Mrs. Shapiro's world and they also meant a lot of work for the Shapiro matriarch. Visiting just before Rosh Hashana, the first of the Jewish High Holy Days, I spoke with Elaine Krasker, Mrs. Shapiro's great-niece, 82, who was a prominent Democratic state legislator for 16 years. Mrs. Krasker remembers going with her grandparents to farms to get chickens for holidays and the Sabbath. 
 ''We would put them in a burlap sack and bring them to be ritually slaughtered by Mr. Liberson,'' she said. ''My grandmother would singe the feathers, pluck and clean out the chickens. Everything was used. The intestines were cleaned and stuffed. We roasted chicken stuffed with kasha. Rosh Hashana was a special time, a time for families to be together.'' 
 Although Mrs. Krasker gave the museum her grandfather's safe, a Victrola with Yiddish records, and a nightie her grandmother made for her, she couldn't give up her rolling pin or scrub board. 
 ''I put the scrub board up on the wall in my laundry room,'' she said, ''to remind me how hard life was for her and how much easier it is today.''

HEADLINE: Profit Falls 22%, but Best Buy Raises Outlook

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: RICHFIELD, Minn. 

 BODY:
The Best Buy Company, the largest American electronics retailer, said Tuesday that second-quarter results fell below expectations as sales at established stores declined. 
 The results sent shares down, even though the retailer raised its guidance for the year based on stabilizing customer traffic.
 Profit for the three months ended Aug. 29 fell 22 percent to $158 million, or 37 cents a share, from $202 million, or 48 cents a share last year, hurt by higher expenses and the stronger dollar. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, on average, predicted a profit of 42 cents per share.
 Revenue rose 12 percent to $11 billion, bolstered by gains from adding 170 stores in Europe in the last 12 months. That was offset by a 3.9 percent decline of sales at established stores and the drag of the stronger dollar, which hurts international revenue because sales translate back into fewer dollars. Analysts had expected revenue of $10.79 billion.
 Top sellers were notebook computers, phones and flat-panel TVs, offset by weakness in gaming, digital cameras, music and movies.
 The company has gained market share because of the closing of Circuit City stores but has been hurt by the cutback in consumer spending amid the recession. Best Buy said it added 2.7 percentage points of market share in the quarter.
 The company said that profit had been pressured during the quarter by new initiatives to drive traffic into the stores ''intended to capitalize on competitive opportunities.'' Its gross profit rate was also hurt by the release of the new iPhone.
 The company now expects earnings of $2.70 to $3 for the year, up from $2.50 to $2.70. Analysts predict $2.87.

HEADLINE: Autos Lead an Increase in Retail Sales

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Retail sales surged in August as consumers swapped their old cars for new ones under the government's ''cash-for-clunkers'' program and spent more on gasoline at convenience stores.
 The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that retail sales in August bounded higher by a seasonally adjusted 2.7 percent over the previous month, surpassing economists' expectations of 1.9 percent. It was the largest monthly increase since January 2006.
 The figures showed surprising strength in one of the most depressed corners of the economy as clothing shops, bookstores and department stores all reported an increase in sales. 
 Economists, who had been expecting a smaller increase, puzzled over whether the numbers were statistical blips that would be scratched out by government revisions, or whether consumers were truly showing some unexpected resilience as they took advantage of bargains and tax-free shopping days as students headed back to school. 
 Sales at clothing stores and department stores each rose a seasonally adjusted 2.4 percent in August from a month earlier. Sales at stores that sell books and sporting goods were up 2.3 percent.
 Sales at automobile dealerships rose 11.9 percent in August from a month earlier, reflecting the popularity of the taxpayer-financed auto purchase program, which offered consumers rebates of $3,500 and $4,500 to trade in their older cars and trucks for more fuel-efficient models.
 Excluding sales of vehicles and auto parts, retail sales rose 1.1 percent in August.
 ''This is promising,'' said Peter Kretzmer, senior economist at Bank of America, ''but I would still be cautious about carrying it forward too much.''
 Consumer spending, which makes up 70 percent of the American economy, fell 1 percent in the second quarter of the year, and consumers trying to rebuild their personal finances and build a buffer against job losses are expected to keep saving. Individual retailers reported weak sales this summer, and their final tally of the important back-to-school season may be weak.
 ''Consumers are being very frugal,'' said Rosalind Wells, chief economist of the National Retail Federation. ''They're holding their pocketbooks closed.''
 According to the figures released Tuesday, retail spending in August was still down 5 percent from a year ago, and even with $3 billion in government incentives, sales at automobile dealerships were down nearly 9 percent from August 2008. And with no government rebates to entice car buyers into dealerships, many economists say that auto sales are likely to retreat this autumn.
 Some retail analysts are also worried that people who spent $20,000 on a new car would curtail their spending in other areas like travel, electronics or furniture, simply shifting the pain from one corner of the economy to another. 
 And few were especially cheered by the 5.1 percent increase in spending at gasoline stations in August, saying that higher fuel costs could drain spending elsewhere.
 The retail report came as the government reported that wholesale prices rebounded in August after falling a month earlier, reflecting an increase in energy prices. The government's producer price index rose 1.7 percent as the prices of energy rose 8 percent for the month.
 Taking out food and energy costs, the core rate of wholesale inflation rose 0.2 percent from July. And businesses continued to cut stockpiles of goods on their shelves in July, the Commerce Department said in a separate report. Inventories fell by a seasonally adjusted 1 percent from a month earlier.

HEADLINE: Why Did Tavern Fail?

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
TAVERN ON THE GREEN has long been the twinkling landmark for the blowout bash, the marathoners' carbo fete and the Mother's Day brunch. Many New Yorkers found it corny, but the palace of dazzle was the only destination for visitors who inhaled Rockefeller Center, took in the Rockettes, then headed to Central Park for Tavern's lobster bisque, dry-rubbed prime rib and cheesecake. 
 Then the music stopped. After three decades of high-oxygen, high-decibel life under the LeRoy family as one of the nation's top-grossing independent restaurants, this legendary cash cow filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 9, less than four months before it was to yield its operating license from the Parks Department, its landlord.
 How did it get to this point for a company that had made so much money? 
 Tavern's 30-year-old chief executive, Jennifer Oz LeRoy, who declined to be interviewed, said in a statement that the filing resulted from ''two factors -- the extreme financial distress brought on by the current financial crisis and the City of New York's decision not to renew our license.'' 
 The cavernous Tavern used to derive 60 percent of its sales from higher-profit banquet, event and corporate celebration business, more than at most restaurants. Those events declined along with Wall Street's fortunes throughout 2008, and then last fall's economic storm laid waste to its tourist business.
 Michael Desiderio, Tavern's chief operating officer, said the restaurant's revenues began to fall as early as late 2007. One reason, he said, was that the restaurant was unable to book as many reservations for weddings and banquets because of the uncertainty over ownership of the license, which expires Dec. 31. 
 The Parks Department requested proposals in February, and on Aug. 28 gave a 20-year operating license to Dean J. Poll -- who runs the Central Park Boathouse restaurant -- spurning Ms. LeRoy's company, Tavern on the Green Limited Partnership. 
 One reason, said two people with knowledge of the process who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it, was that parks officials were concerned about the LeRoy company's finances. 
 In the flotsam left in the foundering of the grand restaurant, 452 creditors were listed, including American Express, Con Edison and Time Warner Cable, as well as produce and meat purveyors, uniform suppliers and plumbers. The largest listed was Jennifer LeRoy's mother, Kay LeRoy, who in 1999 was awarded $15 million and a $5 million house in a protracted divorce from Jennifer's father, Warner LeRoy.
 Kay LeRoy, who declined comment, lent $1.9 million to the Tavern corporation in the last year ''to help it make the payroll and buy food in this economy,'' said Elizabeth J. Austin, her bankruptcy lawyer, ''so Tavern could continue in operation through the end of the year.'' 
 The next largest creditor -- owed $1,778,764 -- is a cluster of benefit funds of the New York Hotel Trades Council, which represents Tavern's more than 400 workers. The union confronted Tavern this summer about nonpayment of benefits since last fall. It won a judgment that entitled those funds to seize restaurant assets. ''It never got to that point because they went for Chapter 11,'' said Peter Ward, president of the Council.
 Keith N. Costa, a partner in Tavern's bankruptcy law firm, Akerman Senterfitt, said the union's judgment did not cause the bankruptcy, adding that other creditors could have tried to shut it down anyway. And Mr. Costa said the company also owes a bank $6 million. ''We didn't need the sword of Damocles over our head,'' Mr. Costa said.
 Creditors' reactions ranged from apoplectic to stoic. 
 ''If they knew they were having trouble paying their regular suppliers -- well, to contract with a small specialty company like ours is an unconscionable way to do business,'' said Todd Neufeld, owner of the Twisted Balloon Company in Brooklyn. He is owed $2,200 for balloons and balloon artists at Tavern's Mother's Day celebration last May. 
 Through the decades, the LeRoys' Tavern took in hundreds of millions of dollars. Restaurants & Institutions, a food-service publication, said that in the 26 years it has compiled its list of top-grossing independent restaurants, ''Tavern on the Green has consistently held a spot at or near the top.'' Tavern reported $36.2 million in revenues last year. ''People talk about $36 million but those are not profits,'' Mr. Desiderio said, ''and even in the best of years there was not much profit spun off this business.'' He would not specify how much.
 Tavern's costs are high. Unlike most restaurants, it paid union wages and benefits, in addition to its annual fee to the Parks Department, which was a minimum of $1 million or 3.5 percent of gross revenues.
 Tavern spent $750,000 to $1 million each year just to maintain the building so it could withstand 650,000 customers in peak years, Mr. Desiderio said. He described the restaurant's Con Edison bill as ''overwhelming,'' considering those 600,000 tree lights outside.
 Undeniably, Tavern's operation was perceived as challenging: a Who's Who of hospitality titans, including Donald Trump and Danny Meyer, walked away after kicking the tires during the license-renewal process. 
 And looking forward, there will be uncertainty in December, when Tavern traditionally swarms with customers and earns 22 percent of its yearly revenues. Tavern is required to have workers remove all its furnishings before Jan. 1, ''if we can't work out terms with Mr. Poll,'' Mr. Desiderio said. Mr. Poll said he would not comment on negotiations for Tavern's fixtures, or its name -- which Mr. Desiderio said had been appraised at $19 million.
 Mr. Costa said Sotheby's appraised the restaurant's furnishings ranging from deer statues to Tiffany-style windows. A Queens warehouse and its contents -- artifacts from Tavern and Mr. LeRoy's other restaurants -- is to be sold next month, he added.
 He would not discuss their value, but two people with knowledge of the appraisals, who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss them, said the furnishings were valued at $5 million, the warehouse could be sold for $4 million and its contents were assessed at $2 million or so. Sales of such assets could cover many liabilities. But Mr. Costa noted that they ''are only worth what someone is willing to pay for them.'' 
 Mr. Desiderio said ''there is a sense of disappointment and letdown,'' but argued that there was no management failure, because under Ms. LeRoy, yearly revenues grew from $32 million to as much as $38 million. 
 Mr. LeRoy, a flamboyant scion of Hollywood royalty who on occasion opened Champagne bottles with a sword, injected glamour into such restaurants as Tavern and Maxwell's Plum. 
 He left a $48 million estate at his death in February 2001 at age 65. In his will he named Jennifer -- the youngest of his four children -- as head of his dining business, which included the Russian Tea Room, which Ms. LeRoy closed in 2002.
 After opening as a restaurant in 1934, Tavern morphed into a rustic pub that ''was neglected and infested with rats,'' said the food critic Gael Greene. Then Mr. LeRoy renovated it, and reopened it in 1976 as ''Warner's fairyland,'' Ms. Greene said, ''the place that tourists had to go and the place where every benefit had to be. It was a jewel.'' Mimi Sheraton, the New York Times restaurant critic from 1976 to 1984, said that in the troubled 1970s, Mr. LeRoy ''helped to transform Central Park and the feeling about New York.''
 Though 5,000 patrons posted supportive e-mail messages on Tavern's Web site recently, through the years some customers complained about food and service. Ms. Sheraton termed the cuisine generally ''drab and uneven.'' She added: ''they had some idiots working for them,'' like one waiter ''who, as he cleared the plates, would eat from them.'' Ms. LeRoy, in a June interview, said that in a large restaurant, ''sometimes things happen that you do not want to happen.'' 
 Looking to its fleeting future, Mr. Desiderio is hoping that ''a lot of people will come in,'' he said, ''to say goodbye to the Tavern they knew.''

HEADLINE: Many Allies of U.S. Share Pain of Afghan War's Toll

BYLINE: By JUDY DEMPSEY and IAN AUSTEN; Judy Dempsey reported from Berlin, and Ian Austen from Ottawa. Matthew Saltmarsh contributed reporting from Paris.

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
For most Germans, it was a rare -- even shocking -- scene. There, on television, were coffins holding the bodies of three soldiers, all in their early 20s, all killed in Afghanistan, all draped with the national flag.
 The soldiers, Martin Brunn, 23; Oleg Meiling, 21; and Alexander Schleiernick, 23, were memorialized July 2 at a service in Bad Salzungen, in the eastern state of Thuringia, where their armored infantry battalion has its headquarters. The three were killed in the Kunduz region, where most of Germany's 4,000 troops are based, bringing to nearly three dozen the number of German soldiers killed in Afghanistan.
 For many Germans, the most recent deaths again underscored their discomfort with the deployment in Afghanistan, where they had expected troops that were focusing on peacekeeping and reconstruction to be mostly safe. Franz Josef Jung, the defense minister, who was present at the memorial service, said the deaths of the three ''showed what a high price we pay to live in peace and freedom in Germany.'' 
 Much of the attention on the war in Afghanistan has been concentrated on the losses by the United States and Britain; 830 United States troops and 214 British troops have been killed, according to icasualties.org, a Web site. But 22 other countries that have sent forces to Afghanistan have suffered deaths among their troops, with Canada bearing the next greatest burden.
 In many of those countries, as in Germany, the sight of military funerals is having a significant impact on public opinion, with some sharing a growing sense that their losses are being overshadowed.
 ''Somehow when a country like Denmark, which has 700 troops in Afghanistan -- which per capita, is one of the highest of the contributors -- suffers casualties, it slips under the radar because it is the bigger countries that tend to get noticed,'' said Klaus Carsten Pedersen, director of the Danish Foreign Policy Society. His country has lost 24 soldiers.
 In Germany, the deaths of Germans, and a controversial airstrike ordered by German commanders on Sept. 4, have forced the issue into the parliamentary election campaign, leading political parties for the first time to talk about a timetable for bringing the troops home. The NATO airstrike, directed at two tanker trucks carrying alliance fuel that had been hijacked by the Taliban, killed scores of people; the number of dead civilians remains unclear.
 Today, there are more than 108,000 troops serving in Afghanistan: 64,500 from the United States, 9,000 from Britain and 34,500 from other nations. In all, 1,386 troops have been killed.
 From Canada, the nation with the largest number of deaths after the United States and Britain, 130 soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan. Other countries that have lost service members include the Netherlands, Australia, Estonia, Germany, South Korea, Italy, Romania, Turkey, Sweden, Poland and Spain.
 In Canada, the public ritual is sadly well established. The bodies of soldiers killed in Afghanistan are flown to a sprawling air base southwest of Ottawa. After their coffins are met by a military band, politicians and family members, a rolling police roadblock clears Canada's busiest expressway for the two-hour drive to the coroner's office in Toronto. Along the way, small groups gather on overpasses with flags to salute.
 On Wednesday, this ritual is expected to be repeated for Pvt. Patrick Lormand, the 130th Canadian soldier to die in Afghanistan since 2002. He was killed Sunday after a roadside bomb detonated when he was traveling in an armored vehicle near Kandahar, the city where the base of Canadian operations is located. Four other Canadian soldiers were wounded. A member of a regiment based north of Quebec City, Private Lormand, 21, was a native of Chute-a-Blondeau, Ontario, a primarily French-speaking farm village east of Ottawa.
 Canada has had relatively few military deaths since the Korean War, which amplifies the impact there, compounded by the country's comparatively small population of roughly 33 million, about half that of Britain and about one-tenth that of the United States. Announcements of each death usually lead news broadcasts.
 The deaths have provoked a variety of reactions, along with resentment that many other NATO countries have sent their troops only under terms that keep them away from combat and out of harm's way.
 Writing in ''A Military History of Canada,'' Desmond Morton, one of the country's leading military historians, concluded that Canada's economic and military ties with the United States left it with little choice but to join the Afghan war. But, he added, ''Many countries echoed that pledge; few had Canada's practical obligation to respect it.''
 Canadians' support for the mission remains mixed.
 Although several Canadian ministers have regularly visited Afghanistan to show support for the military and the NATO mission in Afghanistan, they show little enthusiasm for prolonging the country's combat role.
 When Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the secretary general of NATO, suggested in August that Canada should stay on after 2011, the expiration date for Canada's combat role set by Parliament last year, he received a frosty response.
 Peter MacKay, the defense minister, later said the United States should expect the same sort of answer if it comes looking for a longer combat presence.
 ''There are many countries in line before Canada that should be approached before they would come knocking on our door, I would suggest to you,'' he said at a news conference at a military base in Quebec in August.
 The Dutch, with 1,770 solders in Afghanistan, have yet to decide whether they will pull out in 2010 or redeploy from the country's perilous south.
 A debate is also under way in France, which has 3,160 troops in Afghanistan.
 The forces are concentrated in Kapisa, in the northeast, and in the eastern region of Surobi, where 10 French soldiers died in an ambush and firefight with insurgents in August 2008.
 The French also hold the Kabul regional command, but they are scheduled to hand over control to the Afghans in November.
 As Capt. Christophe Prazuck, spokesman for the French chief of staff, pointed out, French soldiers are ''involved in exchanges with insurgents every day.''
 This month, the death of Sgt. Thomas Rousselle, 30, of the Third Vannes Marine Infantry Regiment, in an improvised explosive device attack, on a road in the Showkhi region, brought the total number of French killed in the war to 31.
 President Nicolas Sarkozy attended a memorial service in Vannes, on France's west coast, for Sergeant Rousselle and a colleague, Cpl. Johan Naguin, 24, who died in the same attack. Mr. Sarkozy reaffirmed the country's pledge to remain in the country until a viable Afghan state was built.
 But the French public is skeptical.
 Despite the toll, officials in a number of countries have also vowed to stay, reiterating the view that NATO is committed to preventing Afghanistan from becoming a terrorist haven again.
 Poland, which has 2,000 troops deployed, seems determined to keep them there despite the sour mood back home. Poland's defense minister, Bogdan Klich, who visited Afghanistan last week, said the mission was about bringing security, but also about ''strengthening the alliance.''
 Thirteen Poles have been killed, the most recent, Piotr Marciniak, just last week.

HEADLINE: College Student Success

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 David Leonhardt (''At Colleges, Too Few Diplomas,'' Economic Scene, Sept. 9) observes, ''The only way to lift the college graduation rate significantly is to lift it among poor and working-class students.'' To understand effective approaches to raising graduation rates among these students, we must look at colleges where most students are lower income -- and often commuters -- rather than at colleges where students are middle- and upper-income residential scholars. 
 The Education Trust has identified only 20 four-year colleges in the United States as having achieved a six-year graduation rate above 50 percent with more than 50 percent of their student population qualifying for Pell Grants, a proxy for low-income status. 
 Baruch College of the City University of New York is one of those institutions (58 percent graduation rate). Our freshman Learning Communities, robust and year-round curriculum, and focused programming outside of the class (writing, communication skills, academic advisement, career development) boost retention and graduation, as does a faculty deeply engaged in the academic progress of all students. 
 As we hold colleges to account for graduation rates -- as we should -- we must also remember that socioeconomics has a profound bearing on student success. Our students, many of whom are the first in their families to attend college, are bright, ambitious and academically successful, but many lack the on-campus housing and high family incomes that, as Mr. Leonhardt notes, often predict short graduation timelines. 
 Let's support colleges that graduate their students while embracing the mission Mr. Leonhardt correctly places at the center of our national challenge.
 Ben M. Corpus New York, Sept. 11, 2009
 The writer is vice president for student affairs at Baruch College.

The anti-abortion group Operation Rescue has told its supporters it is facing a ''major financial crisis'' and is close to shutting down unless emergency help arrives soon. Troy Newman, the group's president, blamed the economic downturn for its money woes in an plea e-mailed to donors. The organization, based in Wichita, has also been under attack from both fringe anti-abortion militants and abortion rights supporters since the May 31 shooting death of Dr. George Tiller, an abortion provider in Wichita.

HEADLINE: A Long Way Down

 BODY:
It is sadly predictable that in a recession, the poor get poorer and the middle class loses ground. But even a downturn as deep and prolonged as this one cannot fully account for the desperate straits of so many Americans. 
 The Census Bureau reported last week that the nation's poverty rate rose to 13.2 percent in 2008, the highest level since 1997 and a significant increase from 12.5 percent in 2007. That means that some 40 million people in this country are living below the poverty line, defined as an income of $22,205 for a family of four. 
 The middle class also took a major hit. Median household income fell in 2008 to $50,300 from $52,200 in 2007. That is the steepest year-to-year drop since the government began keeping track four decades ago; adjusted for inflation, median income was lower in 2008 than in 1998 and every year since then. 
 Clearly, the recession has been brutal. But even before the recession, far too many Americans were already living far too close to the edge.
 As is now painfully evident, the economic growth of the Bush era was largely an illusion. Poverty worsened during most of the boom years and middle-class pay stagnated, as most gains flowed to the top. In a recent update of their groundbreaking series on income trends, the economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez found that from 2002 to 2007, the top 1 percent of households -- those making more than $400,000 a year -- received two-thirds of the nation's total income gains, their largest share of the spoils since the 1920s. 
 Because many if not most Americans gained little to nothing from the Bush ''growth'' years, they have found themselves especially vulnerable to the recession. 
 Federal stimulus spending has helped cushion the blow. The question going forward is whether an economic recovery, when it comes, will help the poor and middle class or whether the top-heavy favoritism of the previous expansion will reassert itself. 
 The answer depends on how policy makers foster and manage a recovery. Economic growth alone does not guarantee job growth. Congress and the Obama administration must extend certain components of the stimulus package until employment does revive, including unemployment benefits, food stamps, tax breaks for working families with children and fiscal aid to states.
 Policy makers must also resist the reassuring but false notion that renewed economic growth can, by itself, raise living standards broadly. Government policies are needed to ensure that growth is shared. Reforming health care so that illness is not bankrupting -- for families or for the federal budget -- would be a major step in the right direction. 
 The administration has also said that it would let the Bush-era tax cuts for the rich expire as scheduled at the end of 2010. More progressive taxation needs to be accompanied by more progressive spending, on public education and on job training and job creation. Support for unions and enforcement of labor standards would also help to ensure that in the next economic expansion, a fair share of profits would find its way into wages. 
 As the Bush era showed, the economy can grow without any of that happening. But it also showed that such growth is neither defensible nor sustainable. With half the population falling behind or struggling to keep up, the economy cannot generate secure and adequate spending, investing or upward mobility for the country to truly prosper.

HEADLINE: Where Progress Is Rare, the Man Who Says No

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS

 BODY:
Politicians and researchers have predicted for nearly four decades that a cure for cancer is near, but cancer death rates have hardly budged and most new cancer drugs cost a fortune while giving patients few, if any, added weeks of life. For this collective failure, the man atop the nation's regulatory agency for new cancer drugs increasingly -- and supporters say unfairly -- gets the blame: Dr. Richard Pazdur.
 Patient advocates have called Dr. Pazdur, director of the Food and Drug Administration's cancer drug office, a murderer, conservative pundits have vilified him as an obstructionist bureaucrat, and guards are now posted at the agency's public cancer advisory meetings to protect him and other committee members.
 ''The industry is not producing that many good drugs, so now they're looking for scapegoats in Rick Pazdur and the F.D.A.,'' said Ira S. Loss, who follows the drug industry for Washington Analysis, a service for investors. 
 In 10 years at the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Pazdur, 57, has helped to loosen approval standards for cancer medicines and made it easier for dying patients to get experimental drugs. But he demands that drug makers prove with near certainty that their products are beneficial, a requirement that he repeated at a public advisory hearing on Sept. 1 in the slow, loud tones of someone disciplining a dog. After he spoke, the committee of experts voted to reject both drugs.
 Critics say that Dr. Pazdur's resolve has cost thousands of lives and set back the pace of discoveries. 
 ''Patients are right to be angry and frustrated with Richard Pazdur,'' said Steven Walker, co-founder of the Abigail Alliance, a patient advocacy group. ''He is a dinosaur.''
 But neither the controversies swirling about him nor his years as an oncologist treating terminal patients have dented Dr. Pazdur's naturally sunny disposition. He laughs like Charles Nelson Reilly, eats like Gandhi and likens his tenure at the drug administration to that of a Roman Catholic priest from the 1960s who had to translate the Latin liturgy into plain language.
 ''You can't win in this job,'' Dr. Pazdur said in an interview in his office. ''If you approve a drug, they accuse you of lowering standards. And if you don't approve it, you're the worst thing since the Nazi death camps and should be killed.''
 Whether Dr. Pazdur has struck the right balance between hope and certainty has enormous consequences for patients and industry. Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the United States; more than 562,000 people are expected to die of it this year. 
 Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are testing more than 860 new cancer medicines -- more than in any other disease category, according to manufacturers. Because patients are desperate and insurers are often forced by law to pay, prices are soaring, making cancer medicines among the best ways for drug makers to make money. But cancer has proven difficult to crack, leading to frustration among executives and advocates who wonder why the Food and Drug Administration is not approving more drugs.
 No cancer medicines can be sold to or even tested on people without the imprimatur of Dr. Pazdur and his staff of about 150 oncologists, toxicologists and other specialists. But pressure from advocacy groups and cancer researchers frustrated with failure have led the agency to abandon many of the usual approval requirements. 
 Federal law requires that the agency demand two ''well controlled'' trials before approving a drug; in cancer, the Food and Drug Administration is often satisfied with just one. With many experimental drugs, the agency demands trials with thousands of patients, while for cancer, it has accepted studies with a few dozen. 
 Before Dr. Pazdur's arrival, the agency largely insisted that drug makers prove that their products extended life. Companies did this by giving the drug to one group of patients, providing a placebo or an older drug to another group and then seeing which group lived longer. But some cancers take a long time to kill, making survival trials lengthy and expensive. 
 So the drug administration under Dr. Pazdur's leadership increasingly allowed some studies to track a drug's effect with X-rays. If scans showed that tumors grew less rapidly, the drug could be approved. 
 Dr. Pazdur pressed for the changes because, he said, the growing number of approved cancer medicines made determining whether any one delayed death increasingly difficult. Many patients now cycle through several medicines before dying. And some drugs that have not been proven to extend life may delay more serious symptoms and medical interventions, he said. 
 For instance, the drug administration initially rejected oxaliplatin because no trial at the time proved that it delayed death. But the agency finally relented in 2002 -- years after the drug's approval in Europe -- because scans showed that it postponed tumor growth. Oxaliplatin is now commonly used to combat colorectal cancer. 
 Criticizing Changes
 Some patient advocates -- mostly from older, more established organizations -- bemoan these changes because even if a drug shrinks tumors, it may do nothing to delay death or improve patients' last days. And because so many cancer medicines have toxic side effects and high prices, drugs that have no proven benefit may actually be harmful to patients' health and economic well-being. 
 These advocates point to mistakes like toxic chemotherapy with bone marrow transplants in breast cancer, which in the 1980s and 1990s increased the suffering of nearly 30,000 women before studies finally showed that it was ineffective. When in doubt, the drug administration should not approve, they say. 
 ''We want drugs that prolong survival, not drugs that just improve a test result,'' said Frances M. Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition.
 To others -- mostly newer, more aggressive patient organizations -- the F.D.A.'s cancer group under Dr. Pazdur's leadership has not lowered standards or sped approvals nearly enough. If there is any hint that a drug works, dying patients -- many of whom have run out of other options -- should be allowed to buy them, they said.
 And some cancer specialists say that Dr. Pazdur, after pushing for years to lower approval standards, has toughened them recently after being criticized for approving drugs that were later shown to have few benefits.
 ''I'm worried there's been a change in his thinking that could be adverse for the field,'' said Dr. Bruce A. Chabner, clinical director of the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and a member of the board of directors of PharmaMar, a Spanish biotech company whose drug Yondelis is approved in Europe but was rejected in July by the F.D.A.'s cancer advisory board after a critical introduction by Dr. Pazdur.
 Little of this controversy surrounding Dr. Pazdur affects the development of truly powerful medicines. In 2001, his agency took just 11 weeks to approve Gleevec, which has miraculous effects on a form of leukemia. But when drugs have marginal benefits, figuring out whether they work is controversial and time consuming. 
 Taking a Drug to the F.D.A.
 Many of the recent rejects have come from small biotechnology companies for which a single F.D.A. approval can be the difference between fiscal calamity and vast profits. On Sept. 1, tiny Vion Pharmaceuticals took its leukemia drug Onrigin to a Food and Drug Administration advisory committee for consideration. 
 One clinical trial found that Onrigin increased deaths threefold compared with a placebo. The drug administration told the company in meetings in 2004 and 2006 that another trial was so poorly designed that it was unlikely to pass muster. Vion persisted. 
 During the company's presentation to the advisory committee, Dr. Pazdur seemed at times visibly pained -- grimacing or shaking his head. When patients taken to the meeting by Vion spoke about Onrigin's benefits, he turned away. (''Only patients who benefit from the drugs are brought to the meetings, not those who are harmed or get nothing,'' he explained later.) He reminded the committee, ''We only have one randomized trial here which shows an increase in death.''
 The committee voted 13 to 0 to require a new study. Vion executives would not comment.
 Some small companies seeking approval of a drug have waged public campaigns with the help of investors and advocacy groups that sometimes lead to vicious attacks on Dr. Pazdur. Take the case of Xcytrin, a brain cancer medicine made by Pharmacyclics of Sunnyvale, Calif. After a critical study failed to show that the drug worked, the company's chief executive at the time, Dr. Richard Miller, blamed doctors at a hospital in France.
 ''They got a very negative result there, and it really skewed the data,'' Dr. Miller said in an interview.
 He lobbied top F.D.A. officials to approve the drug anyway. They refused. He became a prominent agency critic, writing four opinion columns in The Wall Street Journal in 2007 arguing that the agency was keeping vital treatments from dying patients.
 Dr. Miller did not make public the drug agency's reasons for rejecting Xcytrin and, because the law prevents the agency from discussing drug rejections, Dr. Pazdur remained mum. 
 A year ago, Dr. Miller was replaced as chief executive at Pharmacyclics by Robert W. Duggan. In an interview, Mr. Duggan said that the Xcytrin study was flawed and that the drug administration was right to reject the drug. 
 ''It's not just one hospital mishandling the data -- that's false,'' said Mr. Duggan, who described the trial's results as a ''dog's breakfast'' of confusing signals. Biotech executives often blame the drug administration for their own failures so they can continue to raise money from investors, Mr. Duggan said.
 Dr. Miller, who is raising money for a new company, responded, ''I think Mr. Duggan is making nice to the F.D.A.'' 
 Tony Fiorino, president and chief executive of EnzymeRx, in Paramus, N.J., said that biotech executives were often former scientists who believed so deeply in their products that ''it's an ecstatic experience.'' When the drug administration rejects their application, these executives have every incentive, he said, to ''go ballistic on the agency.''
 ''You're going to pull out all the stops,'' Mr. Fiorino said. ''This is your one lottery ticket.'' 
 And it is not just executives behind the attacks. Melvin Flores, an oxygen technician from Lowell, Ark., sent several e-mail messages last year to Dr. Pazdur, one of which said, ''You've murdered enough innocent people already -- enough is enough.''
 Mr. Flores invested in a company whose cancer medicine did not get approved, pummeling its shares and depriving patients of a lifesaver, he said in an interview. ''It's a Holocaust that has happened,'' he said.
 Besides singling out Dr. Pazdur's e-mail box, advocates have put his name on advertisements on city buses in the Washington area, sued him and shouted his name at protests. But Dr. Pazdur said he and his family had endured far worse.
 In Perspective
 His grandfather, a Polish immigrant, was crushed to death under a railroad car in the Great Depression while sweeping up loose corn kernels to feed his family. With six children, his grandmother remarried, had three more kids and was widowed again several years later when her second husband died in a construction accident. 
 His mother married her first husband two weeks before he shipped out for World War II; he was killed in the war. Dr. Pazdur's father, a factory worker for Standard Oil of Indiana, went blind from glaucoma when Dr. Pazdur was a young teenager, impoverishing his family anew. 
 An avid gym cyclist who is greyhound thin, Dr. Pazdur does not eat meat because he believes that a vegetariandiet will help protect him from cancer, although the supporting evidence is as thin as vegetable broth. His wife, Mary, said that when he travels, she buys herself a nice steak.
 Dr. Pazdur became intrigued with the Food and Drug Administration while overseeing drug trials at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. When the cancer job became available, he applied. On his first day, he was struck by how much the agency resembled the Catholic Church of his childhood. 
 ''We had a door in our old office that was controlled electronically, so someone had to buzz you in,'' Dr. Pazdur said. ''We had that same door in my grade school separating the convent from the school. It was such a secretive world here.''
 He set about changing that by reaching out to cancer advocacy and medical groups. He has held cancer advisory meetings at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the world's largest body of cancer scientists. And he began, in conjunction with others, an annual training program for cancer researchers.
 The result is that Dr. Pazdur ''has a lot of support within the mainstream cancer community,'' said Dr. Otis W. Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. In May, the oncologists' society gave him a special recognition award for ''his outstanding service to the oncology community.'' 
 Dr. Pazdur said that blaming the Food and Drug Administration for the dearth of new cancer medicines was ''like blaming the failures of American education on the SAT test.''
 ''We just do the assessments,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Taste for Chicken Feet May Keep American Poultry in Chinese Pots

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
China is threatening to cut off imports of American chicken, but poultry experts have at least one reason to suspect it may be an empty threat: Many Chinese consumers would miss the scrumptious chicken feet they get from this country.
 ''We have these jumbo, juicy paws the Chinese really love,'' said Paul W. Aho, a poultry economist and consultant, ''so I don't think they are going to cut us off.'' 
 Chicken exports were thrust to the forefront of American-Chinese trade tensions on Sunday when China took steps to retaliate for President Obama's decision to levy tariffs on Chinese tires. The Chinese announced that they were considering import taxes on automotive products and chicken meat, a development that some trade experts feared could escalate.
 American executives expressed concern about losing what recently has become the largest export market for their chickens, one that is expanding rapidly as the Chinese population grows more prosperous. But the executives also expressed relief that, so far, Chinese importers have told them to keep the feet and wings coming.
 ''We were told by our customers in China to continue to pack and ship product,'' said Michael D. Cockrell, chief financial officer of Sanderson Farms, a major poultry producer based in Mississippi. ''It gives us a little bit of optimism that we will get over this.''
 At a time when feed prices are high and domestic chicken sales to restaurants are down because of the recession, the Chinese market is important to the industry. Exports of American poultry totaled $4.34 billion last year. Of that amount, $854.3 million worth of chicken meat (less than 2 percent of total revenue by the American chicken industry) was exported to China and Hong Kong. But industry executives said the exports to China were particularly profitable.
 About half of the chicken parts sold to China are wings and feet, which are worth only a few cents a pound in the United States. As delicacies in China, they fetch 60 cents to 80 cents a pound, a price that no other foreign market comes close to matching, according to industry experts. 
 Mr. Aho said the big chicken feet result from the American preference for white chicken meat. A bird bred for big breasts is necessarily bred to have big, strong feet and legs, he said. The United States is by far the world's leading supplier of king-size chicken feet.
 Despite China's fondness for American chicken, the trade has been rife with problems since 2004, when the countries banned each other's poultry products after an outbreak of bird flu. China quickly lifted its ban, but the United States did not, because of continuing concerns about the safety of Chinese chicken. 
 The Agriculture Department partly rescinded the import ban in 2006 by ruling that China could export cooked poultry meat to the United States as long as it first imported the raw chicken meat from the United States or Canada. But Congress quickly inserted a provision in an appropriations bill that effectively prohibited the import of chickens processed in China, with lawmakers citing unclean conditions.
 Rosa L. DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut Democrat who leads opposition in the House to the imports, said the ban had nothing to do with trade policy. ''For me it's about health,'' she said in an interview.
 China appeared to be ready to cut off imports of American chicken products in July, and American poultry producers said the issuance of import permits slowed for a time. But sales have since returned to normal levels.
 In an effort to assuage Beijing, American poultry producers have made it clear that they have nothing to do with the Congressional import ban and say they do not fear competing with Chinese canned or frozen chickens.
 ''We believe in free and open trade and we feel our industry has a lot more to lose by being an obstructionist in trade than in supporting China's position,'' said James H. Sumner, president of the U.S.A. Poultry and Egg Export Council. ''If the product is fully cooked, then that would destroy any possible pathogens plus the product would be subject to further inspection when it enters the United States.'' 
 Two weeks ago, Mr. Sumner's group and the National Chicken Council joined other American food organizations in sending a letter to Ron Kirk, the United State trade representative, cautioning that action against Chinese tires could lead to retaliation. ''For some, the Chinese market is the difference between profitability and possible bankruptcy,'' the letter warned. 
 Now that the Chinese are threatening retaliation, industry officials say they can only hope Chinese taste buds outweigh protectionist impulses.
 ''It complicates the issue for the Chinese'' because of their consumer demand for American chicken parts, said Daniel Griswold, a trade expert at the Cato Institute in Washington. On the other hand, he said the American poultry industry also has a lot to lose, adding, ''If we are playing a game of chicken with China we are going to be big losers.''

HEADLINE: Teacher Layoffs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Stimulus-Assisted Schools Still Facing Crippling Cuts'' (front page, Sept. 7) captures many of the issues facing schools as they seek to use federal stimulus funds to avoid drastic cuts to student services in the wake of state and local shortfalls. 
 But I disagree with the unnamed ''experts'' on the role that teacher tenure and seniority rights play in our schools. One named source, Tim Daly, president of the New Teacher Project, claims, ''Districts tend to make their problems worse by laying off good teachers and keeping bad ones.'' 
 The claim would be true only if good equals new and bad equals veteran. 
 Yes, some inexperienced teachers are good, but nearly all of them become better over time. And there is a vast body of research to back that up. 
 Students don't need finger-pointing and ''expert'' opinions. What they need is for all adults to share responsibility for their education and recognize that we have to continue to invest in education during difficult economic times.

HEADLINE: Caution: Violin Work Not Allowed In This Zone

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Just after Labor Day, Joseph Tanen got a call from a client of the small, discreet business that he runs, by appointment only, on Broadway near 123rd Street in Manhattan.
 No, Mr. Tanen told the client, he could not help her. The law was after him.
 ''We just opened a letter from the city's padlock enforcement unit,'' he said. ''We might not be around long enough.'' 
 The city's padlock unit is an arm of the Department of Buildings that is best known for shutting down bordellos, gambling parlors and after-hours clubs.
 And then there is the business run by Mr. Tanen and his wife, Nancy Phillips, in a tiny space at 3111 Broadway: Tanen Violins. 
 Mr. Tanen repairs violins and cellos. His customers are not the internationally renowned, but the legions of school children taking their first lessons, conservatory students from the Manhattan School of Music around the corner, or professional musicians laboring in tuneful anonymity. 
 ''Under the zoning resolution, a musical instrument repair shop is prohibited in this residential district,'' said Tony Sclafani, a spokesman for the Department of Buildings. The same zoning law bans umbrella and typewriter repair shops, wedding chapels and gymnasiums. 
 These days, the good folk of New York do not suffer the plagues of the umbrella repair trade. But tucked into the nooks and crannies of the city are thousands of microbusinesses, bookbinders and jewelry makers, pet groomers and Pilates trainers. If they are prudent enough not to bother the neighbors, most of them escape official notice, even if they are in violation of zoning laws. 
 There was nothing remotely sneaky about what Mr. Tanen was up to. When he and his wife moved their business into the building two years ago, the lease spelled out precisely how they intended to use the space. The workshop occupies three small rooms on the ground floor next to the superintendent's apartment. Mr. Tanen and Ms. Phillips live several blocks away.
 In June, however, someone complained to the Department of Buildings about the workshop. ''From what we've heard, it apparently had nothing to do with us,'' Mr. Tanen said. ''A residential tenant upstairs is doing whatever can be done to bother the landlord, and made this complaint.'' 
 Even in an age when cranes are toppling, concrete strength tests are suspected of being faked and entire building facades collapse, the Tanen repair shop has managed to draw attention from the city. 
 Mr. Sclafani said his agency would not have known about the violin shop if someone had not complained. He said the department was obliged to conduct an inspection and to enforce the zoning rules. Mr. Tanen was told to stop his ''illegal'' use or face padlocking.
 ''It's like having a Stasi system,'' said Ms. Phillips, alluding to the vast informant network East Germany used to monitor its citizenry. ''The only enforcement they can have is neighbors spying on neighbors.''
 In one meticulously kept room, Mr. Tanen works at a bench, occasionally using a saw. Mostly he employs small tools scaled to the delicacy of his tasks. 
 A major hazard for old violins and cellos is the overheated New York apartment, where the kilnlike dryness draws the spring out of the wood, which cracks. ''You can always tell when the heat goes on,'' Ms. Phillips said. ''The phone starts ringing off the hook.''
 Mr. Tanen refits the wood -- sometimes it is only two and a half millimeters thick -- and refinishes the hairlines. One professional cellist, giving a lecture, used his bow to make a point, and managed to knock off the side of his instrument.
 ''Not a lot of repair shops are willing to work on less valuable instruments,'' Mr. Tanen said.
 ''It's simple economics,'' Ms. Phillips added. ''If they're working on a hundred-thousand-dollar instrument, the commission is a lot greater.''
 ''Some repair people take the view, 'I wasn't trained to work on your kid's instrument,' '' Mr. Tanen said.
 MR. TANEN, 49, learned violin repair in Boston. After working at several repair shops in Manhattan, most now shut, he set up his own in 1994. 
 When they moved to 3111 Broadway in 2007, the couple sank all their savings into outfitting the space, said Ms. Phillips, 48, who runs the business.
 ''The fact that we're managing to keep our heads above water after the last year and a half is something of a miracle,'' she said. ''Now we are spending money on a lawyer.''
 Mr. Tanen can handle violins from the 17th century. The 21st-century Buildings Department is another story.
 ''We can't take a job that's going to take a month,'' Mr. Tanen said. ''We can't take apart an instrument and have the pieces padlocked in the place.''

HEADLINE: In Portland's Restaurants, A New Down East Banquet

BYLINE: By JULIA MOSKIN

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Me. 

 BODY:
 THE overnight temperature is dropping toward frost this week and probably won't rise above it until May. Most of the cruise ships are gone, and with them the fudge buyers, the lobster seekers and the chowderheads who clog the Old Port neighborhood in the summer. 
 But the quiet and the chill are deceptive. Portland's many chefs and bakers, its turnip farmers and cookbook sellers and assorted mad food geniuses are gearing up for another lively winter.
 ''I wouldn't call it a competition, I'd call it a collective,'' Josh Potocki, the chef and owner of 158 Pickett St. Cafe in South Portland, said of the city's food scene. ''We are all trying to raise the level of food in Portland to insanely high.''
 It's working. With a simmering sense of injustice, I recently ate my way across some of the city's new and offbeat restaurants. Why doesn't my neighborhood have an all-day restaurant that makes its own spicy sausage, or one that produces house-made crackers and hot sauce for oysters? When will my market organize a ratatouille contest? 
 And how is it that students at Southern Maine Community College have unfettered access to long-fermented water-boiled bagels, when I have none?
 In the last decade, Portland has undergone a controlled fermentation for culinary ideas -- combining young chefs in a hard climate with few rules, no European tradition to answer to, and relatively low economic pressure -- and has become one of the best places to eat in the Northeast. The most interesting chefs here cook up and down the spectrum, from Erik Desjarlais's classically pressed roast ducks at Evangeline, to the renegade baker Stephen Lanzalotta's gorgeously caramelized sfogliatelle (sold out of the back of Micucci Grocery, an Italian-imports shop), to Mr. Potocki's simple but brilliant chili-garlic cream cheese and handmade bagels. 
 Tablecloths, Asian fusion and spherification are out (the locals aren't interested in, or rich enough to indulge in, frivolous food experiments, the thinking goes). Nose-to-tail, rustic French and Italian, and small plates are in.
 ''I've cooked all over, and I kept coming back to Portland,'' said Krista Kern Desjarlais, the chef and principal owner of Bresca, who has worked at Gotham Bar & Grill and Guy Savoy in Paris. Her butter-browned gnocchi with charred cherry tomatoes and her blueberry tart -- a creamy filling, usually so dull, transformed by buttermilk -- are infuriatingly delicious. (The recipe is at nytimes.com/dining.)
 Chefs here feed off one another's work in a way that's impossible in larger cities (Portland's population is about 65,000, and it has a compact urban center), constantly eating in and commenting on one another's restaurants. ''I've made enemies, for sure,'' said Joe Ricchio, a bartender who makes Vietnamese pho on his days off, has a weakness for flaming scorpion bowls, and writes a blog titled Portland Food Coma. 
 In 2007, Mr. Ricchio started a festively debauched event now known as Deathmatch, a kind of extended ''Iron Chef'' dinner, with each invited chef contributing a course. ''Each one takes five years off your life,'' Mr. Ricchio said. 
 The first one was a foie gras gorge, and later themes have included venison, Japan and, most recently, death itself, an 18-course fantasia of a last meal. That dinner began predictably, with osetra caviar, but spiraled toward feijoada, a huge croquembouche, and bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwiches served by young women dressed as Catholic schoolgirls, wielding hot mayonnaise in squeeze bottles. 
 Most of Portland's young chefs are men, marked by tough-guy tattoos and a combination of culinary idealism and anarchy. Many have worked in -- and walked out of -- one another's kitchens. Some have paired off (the chefs of Evangeline and Bresca are newly married but maintain separate restaurants) or undergone messy splits (like Mr. Potocki and his former partner Allison Reid, who now plies her bread peel a few blocks away at Scratch Baking Company, making deeply browned levain loaves and a competing strain of bagel). 
 Many have cycled through the twin temples of Sam Hayward's Fore Street or Hugo's on Middle Street, where Rob Evans is the chef. These are the kitchens that first defined Portland as a destination for rigorously local and regularly delicious food. 
 ''Faites simple,'' Escoffier's famous motto ''make it simple,'' is painted on the wall at Evangeline's dining room. Mr. Desjarlais, the chef and principal owner, says that his major culinary influence is Richard Olney, the American food writer. (Mr. Desjarlais, now 33, had not yet been born in 1974, when Mr. Olney published ''Simple French Food,'' a rustic and revolutionary answer to Julia Child's formal recipes.)
 Mr. Desjarlais's kitchen, however, has a more stress-inducing motto posted over the door: ''Always Work With a Sense of Urgency.'' In his entree of chicken breast neatly rolled in prosciutto, the flavors are almost shockingly spare -- chicken, broccoli, carrot, butter, ham -- but each plays off the others. And for an ambitious young chef to serve a boneless chicken breast dish in this day of off-cut fetishism -- even a clabber-fed, organic one -- shows true courage. 
 Local food lovers say that kind of self-directed cooking is what makes Portland's food so good.
 ''Ninety percent of the best restaurants are chef-owned, small, single-operator places,'' said Samantha Hoyt Lindgren, an owner of Rabelais, an all-food bookstore on Middle Street that serves as a hub for food-related gossip, jobs and sometimes heirloom apples and wild chanterelles. (A local forager barters extra mushrooms for new cookbooks.) ''That makes a huge difference in the quality of the food and the relationships with purveyors,'' she said.
 The city is ringed by farms, fishing grounds, dairies, apiaries, mushroom beds and smokehouses, making local lamb, potatoes, scallops, bacon, buttermilk, berries and honey easy to get. 
 And for chefs to become owners, the price of entry -- key money, kitchen renovation, etc. -- is relatively low. Masa Miyake, a chef from northern Japan who was working in New York, moved his family of five from a one-bedroom apartment in Queens to open Miyake in Portland's West End in 2007. 
 ''After so many years in New York, I wasn't close to the $500,000 I would need to open my own place there,'' he said. Also, he said, Maine's weather reminded him pleasantly of home. Now he has created Japan-Maine hybrids like quahog sushi (sometimes gathering the clams himself at low tide) and lobster sashimi, the sweet tail meat barely blanched, then glossed with olive oil and microscopic pieces of fresh garlic. 
 Fabiana de Savino and Enrico Barbiero, longtime restaurateurs in Milan, moved here, too, drawn by the notion of a clean environment for their young daughter. (They had fixed on Scandinavia, then saw a television documentary about Maine.) Now Mr. Barbiero makes springy fresh pasta daily for their restaurant and shop, called Paciarino; his tender ravioli are stuffed with sweet local shrimp and haddock, and his spaghetti is hand-stretched and perfectly cooked. 
 Paciarino raises the bar for pasta here, as Miyake does for sushi, as The Front Room does for casual American food (see: crunchy B.L.T. sandwich with roasted tomatoes, breakfast sausage with Moroccan spices), as the local brewery Allagash does for beer, and Coffee by Design does for coffee. 
 Many of the customers who keep these premium-priced places running are people ''from Away'' who have moved to Portland -- artists and academics, Web designers and some bankers -- attracted by its low cost of living, summer beaches, access to Boston and New York and handmade vibe. 
 ''It's not unusual for people who live in Portland to shop for food every day,'' said Lisa Childs, an owner of the Rosemont Markets, which stock not only locally grown fruit and vegetables but also locally produced tofu, yogurt, jam and meat. ''Whole Foods might sell Maine apples and blueberries, but we are the way for Maine chicken and Maine cheese to get to market.''
 Between Portland's two weekly farmers' markets and its ravenously locavore chefs, local organic farmers like Daniel Price of Freedom Farm and Chris Cavendish of Fishbowl Farm say that small-scale farming has become financially viable. 
 There are vigorous farm-to-table networks. Chefs compete to lock up farmers' supplies of cardoons and chickens, and they routinely buy large shares in local community-supported agriculture organizations, meaning that their menus have to change according to what's being harvested.
 ''It keeps us experimenting,'' said Guy Hernandez, the chef and an owner of the tapas bar Bar Lola. 
 Lee Skawinski, the chef and an owner of Cinque Terre and Vignola, serves particularly excellent salads and greens; they're supplied daily by a nearby farm owned by his partners.
 But for many chefs here, cooking locally is not that easy. Masa Miyake orders about 70 percent of his fish from Japan, because local stocks are limited. The season for fruit is painfully short, keeping creatures like tomatoes and chickens warm enough to thrive is expensive, and even Maine potatoes can run out during the winter. 
 ''It is hard enough to be a farmer in Italy,'' said Ms. de Savino, who imports her own olives, tomatoes and other staples. ''What the farmers do here is unbelievable.''

 Recipe: Prosciutto-Wrapped Chicken Breasts With Broccoli Puree and Glazed Baby Carrots Adapted from Erik Desjarlais, Evangeline, Portland, Me. Time: 1 1/2 hours plus chilling
 Adapted from Erik Desjarlais, Evangeline, Portland, Me.
 Time: 1 1/2 hours plus chilling
 FOR CHICKEN
 4 plump boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
 20 thin slices prosciutto (about 1/4 pound) 
 1/4 cup canola oil
 FOR BROCCOLI
 1 pound very fresh broccoli crowns or florets
 1 cup plus 1 teaspoon salt
 1 cup heavy cream
 1/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or Landaff cheese
 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
 FOR CARROTS
 1 pound very fresh whole baby carrots, trimmed and peeled (or use thickly sliced regular carrots)
 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
 1/4 cup sugar
 1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley, tarragon or chives.
 1. Cut off tips of chicken breasts to make rough rectangles. (Reserve for another use.) 
 2. Lay out about a square foot of plastic wrap. Place a chicken breast, smooth side down, in center. Starting at narrow end, roll breast into a compact cylinder. Tightly wrap in plastic and twist both ends to seal. Repeat with remaining chicken and refrigerate at least 6 hours or overnight, to set shape. 
 3. Lay out 5 slices prosciutto almost on top of one another, like a package of bacon, so short end is about as long as a rolled chicken breast. Unwrap a breast and roll it snugly in prosciutto slices. Rewrap in plastic. Repeat with remaining prosciutto and chicken. Chill until ready to cook, for 1 to 4 hours.
 4. Make broccoli puree: Bring 1 gallon of water to a boil and add 1 cup salt. Prepare an ice water bath. Blanch broccoli until bright green and just tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer to ice water and then drain. 
 5. In a saucepan, heat cream just to boiling. Turn off heat and whisk in cheese. In a blender or food processor, in batches if necessary, puree with broccoli. Mix in butter.
 6. To finish chicken, heat oven to 400 degrees. Heat oil in an ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat and add chicken, seam side down. Brown well on all sides, turning gently with tongs. Transfer to oven and roast 15 minutes. 
 7. Meanwhile, make carrots: Combine carrots, butter and sugar in a saucepan with 1 cup of water and 1 teaspoon salt. Simmer uncovered until carrots are tender and liquid is reduced to a glaze, about 20 minutes. If carrots are tender before glaze is thick, remove while liquid reduces. Mix in herbs when done.
 8. To serve, spoon broccoli puree onto center of each plate. Surround with carrots. Rest a chicken roulade on top of broccoli puree.
 Yield: 4 servings.

 Adapted from Krista Kern Desjarlais, Bresca, Portland, Me.
 Time: 1 hour, plus chilling and cooling time
 FOR CRUST
 8 ounces (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
 1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
 2 large egg yolks (or 1 1/2 if extra-large or jumbo)
 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
 Pinch fine sea salt
 2 scant cups all-purpose flour
 1 tablespoon cold heavy cream or milk
 For filling
 1 cup granulated sugar 
 3 tablespoons cornstarch 
 1 whole egg 
 3 egg yolks 
 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled
 1 1/2 cups buttermilk 
 Scrapings from 1/2 vanilla bean, or 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
 1/4 teaspoon sea salt 
 Pinch freshly grated nutmeg
 1 pint (2 cups) blueberries, preferably wild
 Lightly sweetened whipped creme fraiche or whipped heavy cream, or a combination, for serving (optional).
 1. To make crust: In a mixer, cream butter and sugar together until smooth and fluffy. Mix in yolks, vanilla and salt. Add flour all at once and mix just to combine. Add cream or milk and mix just until smooth. Form into a ball, flatten into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate, at least 1 hour or overnight. 
 2. On a floured surface, roll dough into a circle to fit a 10-inch tart pan. Transfer to pan and lightly press in, making sure dough rises about 1/4 inch above rim. Refrigerate in pan 1 hour. 
 3. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Bake until barely golden, about 30 minutes. Check halfway through baking and prick any bubbles with a sharp knife. Let cool to room temperature. 
 4. To make filling: whisk together sugar and cornstarch to remove any lumps. Whisk in egg, yolks, melted butter, buttermilk, vanilla or vanilla scrapings, salt and nutmeg, and pour into tart shell. Sprinkle surface evenly with 1 1/2 cups blueberries. 
 5. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Bake tart until surface is barely golden and still wobbly in the center, 35 to 45 minutes. Remove and let cool to room temperature. Serve at room temperature or lightly chilled, with a dollop of whipped cream (if using) and remaining blueberries scattered over each serving. 
 Yield: One 10-inch tart, about 10 servings.

HEADLINE: Promising a New Day, Again

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The A.F.L.-C.I.O., the nation's largest labor organization, has often been criticized for being ''male, pale and stale'' -- dominated by cigar-chomping, golf-playing chieftains.
 But as Richard L. Trumka assumes the group's presidency on Wednesday, he says he is determined to improve labor's image and woo a younger generation that either thinks of unions as irrelevant, or does not think of them at all. 
 Mr. Trumka -- a burly former coal miner who comes out of one of the nation's oldest unions, the United Mine Workers, and looks like Mike Ditka -- acknowledges that reversing labor's seemingly inexorable slide will be a challenge. Still, he thinks the weak economy, long stagnant or declining wages, the prospect of a jobless recovery, and the continuing exodus of jobs to developing countries will all bolster the case for unions.
 ''The generation of workers 18 to 34 probably needs union more than any generation ever before because of what's happening with this economy,'' said Mr. Trumka, 60, a forceful speaker who packs far more charisma than his immediate predecessor, John J. Sweeney, 75. 
 Of course, waiting for unions to rise to their former strength may be like waiting for Godot. 
 When Mr. Sweeney assumed the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s presidency 14 years ago, he also pledged to greatly expand labor's ranks. Instead labor's numbers fell somewhat because of many of the same forces Mr. Trumka will face, including factory shutdowns, corporations battling to beat back unions and workers' fears that their workplaces will close if they vote to unionize.
 ''It would be incredible if Trumka succeeded, but if he does not succeed he will have a lot beyond his control to blame it on,'' said Gary N. Chaison, a professor of labor relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. He said that the crisis of Detroit's automakers had given labor's image a beating. 
 ''Labor has a lot of catching up to do,'' he said.
 Michale Lotito, a management-side labor lawyer with Jackson Lewis, said Mr. Trumka could only revive labor's fortunes if Congress passes pending legislation that would make it easier for unions to organize workers. Labor and its Democratic allies have struggled to round up the 60 votes to overcome a potential Senate filibuster. But union leaders say the votes will be there once a replacement is named for the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy.
 But Mr. Trumka plans to rely on new means and new messengers too. So while organized labor has traditionally done much of its communicating through picket signs and handbills, to reach the young it will rely more on Facebook and Twitter. 
 One step in putting a fresher face on labor is Mr. Trumka's choice of Liz Schuler, 39 and a cheery and articulate former clerical worker, as the federation's youngest ever secretary-treasurer, the group's second in command. 
 By focusing on young workers, Mr. Trumka and his team are admitting many members of the millennial generation and younger are not keen on unions. 
 ''They don't hate us, they don't like us, they just don't know us,'' said Ms. Schuler, long a top assistant to the president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
 Mr. Trumka's priorities will include ways to lift not just unions, but workers, among them pushing for a tougher posture on trade -- like President Obama's newly announced punitive tariffs against Chinese tires -- expanding the federation's already powerful political operations, and seeking to unionize more low-wage minority workers.
 For the first time ever, two of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s top three officials will be women. Its executive vice president, Arlene Holt Baker, who is African-American, is an emissary to low-wage minority workers, who are generally more inclined to join unions.
 Mr. Trumka does not always fit the new image. He can come across as macho -- he fills his office with pictures of football players and labor heroes. And he is sometimes called bull-headed -- he once led a violence-ridden nine-month strike against Pittston Coal in West Virginia in which 4,000 workers were arrested for sitting in and seeking to block strikebreakers by studding roads with bent nails.
 The A.F.L.-C.I.O., a grouping of 56 unions representing 10 million workers, has commissioned several studies on what makes young workers tick. (One study found that one in three Americans between 18 and 35lives at home with their parents.) 
 ''We haven't done a good job communicating with this group,'' Mr. Trumka said. ''It's not going to be an overnight thing.''
 Surprisingly, one issue the Trumka team is debating, in response to findings from focus groups, is whether to use the word ''worker'' in talking with the under-35 generation, because so many of them, especially young professionals, do not define themselves as ''workers'' or as members of particular occupational groups -- say, steelworkers or autoworkers.
 Although the percentage of workers in unions has slid to 12.4 percent, about one-third the number of a half century ago, Mr. Trumka thinks the time is ripe for unions to increase their numbers.
 ''I think the American public is more willing to look at the way to curb excessive corporate power that's gone unchecked for years,'' he said. ''The public knows that unions are the best curb on that.'' 
 Like his predecessors, Mr. Trumka cannot tell member unions what to do, for instance to focus on organizing more young workers. But he can use his bully pulpit.
 ''Rich will lay it on the table, he'll out people if they're not doing enough organizing, '' said Gerald W. McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
 Like Mr. Sweeney, Mr. Trumka will continue to press Congress to enact a health care overhaul. But Mr. Trumka promises to be far more quotable when doing so.
 For example, here in Pittsburgh, where Mr. Obama spoke on Tuesday at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention, Mr. Trumka defended the president's health plan.
 ''We do have death panels,'' he said. ''They call them insurance companies.''
 Mr. Trumka hopes to make the federation's vaunted political operation more effective by transforming it from an operation largely during the summer and fall of Congressional and presidential campaign years to a 52-week-a-year operation that can be instantly called upon to do legislative work on the federal, state or local levels.
 Mr. Sweeney came out of a service sector union representing janitors and hospital workers, while Mr. Trumka comes out of the mine workers -- his father died of black lung disease -- and out of a region, southwestern Pennsylvania, where manufacturing was king.
 With his industrial bent, Mr. Trumka plans not just to reach out to a new generation, but to focus on expanding labor's traditional base by seeking to revive the nation's manufacturing sector, through, for example, expanding green industries.
 ''You can't be a world-class country and have a world-class economy unless you produce things,'' Mr. Trumka said. ''As we've lost manufacturing jobs in this country -- we've lost millions since 2000 -- we've lost a lot of R.&D., and when you lose the R.&D., you lose your technological edge, and when you lose that edge, you start to lose everything.''
 Mr. Trumka is already displaying a far more aggressive stance on trade than Mr. Sweeney did. Mr. Trumka talks with relish about trade policy and works closely with the Pittsburgh-based United Steelworkers Union, which has been the main force behind efforts to penalize China on tires and other exports. 
 Mr. Trumka applauded President Obama's decision, saying, ''The trade laws that weren't enforced in this country for eight years under George Bush have had a devastating effect on manufacturing.''

HEADLINE: Vacancies Raise Risks and Lower Value for Landlords

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
In the midst of an economic slump, a new 12-story building in Washington's central business district was sold this month in an all-cash deal for $207.8 million. The per-square-foot price of $830 was one of the highest ever paid in the nation's capital.
 Developed by Vornado Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust, the building, at 1999 K Street, has many attractive features, aside from its prime location in Washington, the nation's strongest office market, real estate specialists say. Its architect was Helmut Jahn, who is known for such buildings as the Sony Center in Berlin, and it received the second highest certification from the United States Green Building Council.
 But what makes the building especially valuable is the fact that it is fully leased for the next 15 years. The tenant, Mayer Brown, a law firm with offices around the world, left two buildings in Washington and consolidated its offices at 1999 K on Sept. 1. The sales price exceeded the $750-a-foot value that Green Street Advisors, a Newport Beach, Calif., company that specializes in real estate investment trusts, had placed on the building, said Michael Knott, an analyst with the company. 
 Across the country, by contrast, the Washington Mutual Center, a three-year-old prime 42-story office tower at 1301 Second Avenue in downtown Seattle, was sold recently to the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company for $115 million, or $132 a square foot, according to a document filed in Kings County, Wash. 
 The bargain-basement price reflected the dismal state of the Seattle market, where no major office buildings had sold in nearly two years. The vacancy rate last quarter was 14.4 percent, and about 3.6 million square feet of space is under construction, according to Craig E. Hill, senior vice president at the brokerage Grubb & Ellis. 
 But there was another important reason: more than half of the building may remain vacant. Russell Investments, a subsidiary of Northwestern Mutual, will occupy part of the building -- a company spokeswoman would not say how much -- and the seller, JPMorgan Chase, which acquired the building last year in its takeover of Washington Mutual, will retain several floors, a bank spokeswoman said. 
 When the real estate market was hot, investors coveted space that was vacant, or would soon be vacant, because rents were steadily rising. But now, vacancy detracts from the value of a building. ''In the past, the more vacancy a building had, the more valuable it was, because rents were on the move upward,'' said Douglas L. Harmon, a senior managing director of Eastdil Secured of New York. ''Now when you have vacancy, it applies downward pressure on values.''
 Mr. Harmon advised Deutsche Bank on its recent $590.3 million sale of Worldwide Plaza, a Midtown Manhattan building with 1.6 million square feet, which had been surrendered to the bank by the real estate investor Harry B. Macklowe. Mr. Macklowe had valued the building, which is on Eighth Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets, at $1.9 billion, or $1,000 a square foot, when he bought it in February 2007. 
 By the time it was sold to a joint venture led by George Comfort & Sons, the building's value had dropped to $369 a square foot. About 781,000 square feet are empty, according to CoStar, a research company in Bethesda, Md., including 600,000 square feet recently vacated by the advertising and public relations company Ogilvy & Mather.
 The owners of One California Plaza, a 42-story building at 300 South Grand Avenue in Los Angeles, are also taking a haircut because of vacant space. The building is in contract to be sold to a New York company, Metropolitan Real Estate Investment, for roughly $225 million, or about $225 a square foot, according to Real Capital Analytics, a research company. The seller is Macquarie Office Trust, an Australian company, which paid $325 a foot for an 80 percent stake in the building in 2006. One-fifth of the building is unfilled, and a major tenant, the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, has not decided whether to renew leases that are expiring in a couple of years. 
 ''Investors today are very hesitant to make a mistake by underwriting improvement, decreasing vacancy or increasing rent,'' said Scott A. Singer, the executive vice president of the Singer & Bassuk Organization, a New York company that arranges financing for transactions.
 Vacant floors force a new owner to spend much more money, and not just on marketing the space. The lobby may require sprucing up to attract tenants, for example. The space may sit vacant for a long time. ''It could take one year, or it could take three years,'' said H. Carl Muhlstein, an executive vice president in Los Angeles for Cushman & Wakefield.
 To clinch a deal, the landlord must offer concessions like months of free rent and help in creating or refurbishing the offices. 
 ''We're seeing the largest concession packages I've seen in the last 25 years,'' said Mary Ann Tighe, the chief executive of the New York region for CB Richard Ellis. ''When you're calculating what it costs to buy something, concession packages have to be part of that calculation.''
 Additional expenses will be accrued in converting a building that was designed for one tenant, like the Washington Mutual Center in Seattle, to multitenant use, said Robert M. White Jr., the president of Real Capital Analytics.
 Robert Von Ancken, the senior appraiser for Grubb & Ellis in New York, estimated that well-leased Midtown Manhattan buildings that were commanding $800 to $1,000 a square foot in 2007 had declined by at least $300 a square foot. Substantial vacancies inflict an additional decline in values of as much as 30 percent, he said. 
 In Lower Manhattan, a fully occupied building with high-quality tenants would be priced at $300 to $400 a square foot, while one with significant vacancies would fetch $200 a square foot or less, he said. ''We're back to where we were in 2003 to 2004,'' Mr. Von Ancken said. He said it takes $750 a square foot to build in Manhattan, including ''soft'' costs like insurance. 
 In August, Young Woo & Associates, a New York company, and Kumho Investment Bank of Korea completed their purchase of two vacant buildings in Lower Manhattan, at 70 Pine Street and 72 Wall Street, that had previously been occupied by the insurer American International Group. The price was about $150 million, or around $100 a square foot. The new owners plan to convert the buildings to residential use. 
 By contrast, SL Green Realty Corporation recently agreed to sell a 49.5 percent stake in a 31-story building at 485 Lexington Avenue, between 46th and 47th Streets, to a joint venture involving Optibase, an Israeli video company, and Gilmor, a Nigerian engineering company, for $504.2 million, or $547 a square foot. 
 The building is not only almost fully leased to well-known companies like Travelers Insurance, but when loans are hard to get, it also has long-term financing at a low interest rate, said Howard L. Michaels, the chairman of the Carlton Group, an investment bank that brought in the overseas investors. ''That's like getting the last helicopter out of Saigon,'' he said. ''It doesn't exist anymore.''
 Joel Coren, a senior director at CB Richard Ellis Global Property Advisors, who advised Deka Immobilien, a German fund, on its purchase of 1999 K in Washington, said foreign investors are now looking for properties that they can keep for a long time. ''That's really how real estate should be treated -- as a long-term asset,'' he said. ''We had sort of lost that.''

HEADLINE: Universal Lifts the Veil On a Harry Potter Park

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, the keenly anticipated Florida theme park, will open in the spring and allow visitors to tour Hogwarts, buy quidditch gear and drink butterbeer.
 Universal Orlando unveiled some details about the park, a 20-acre addition to its Islands of Adventure property, on Tuesday in a Web presentation. The resort, co-owned by NBC Universal and the Blackstone Group, secured the theme park rights to J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter books in May 2007, but has been silent about specific plans until now.
 The so-called theme park within a theme park will be faithful to the visual landscapes of the Harry Potter films produced by Warner Brothers, which licensed the rights to Universal after a flirtation with the Walt Disney Company. ''We've tried to include something from every book,'' Alan Gilmore, an art director for the films who is helping to oversee the park designs, said in an interview. 
 ''We had free range to be as grand and as excessive as we could be,'' he added. ''It's only money that holds us back in the end.''
 Universal and Warner would not discuss financial details, but analysts estimate Wizarding World will cost about $265 million, a relative drop in the bucket compared with what Universal's bigger rival spends on expansions. Disney is putting $1 billion into its California Adventure park, for instance, and just outlined hundreds of millions in expansion and refurbishment plans for other properties.
 But the Harry Potter sum is still considerable, and Universal executives hope the result will be an immersive experience unlike any theme park currently offers. ''We wanted fans to be able to truly live the experience of these movies,'' Mark Woodbury, president of Universal Creative, the research and development group responsible for designing the resort's attractions, said in an interview.
 Islands of Adventure could use the help. While the park is home to popular rides based on ''The Cat in the Hat'' and ''Jurassic Park,'' it faces an industrywide downturn in attendance because of the recession and visitor complaints that it lacks new attractions. Analysts say about 5.3 million people visited the park in 2008.
 Universal Orlando is also coping with Disney's $4 billion acquisition of Marvel Entertainment. Two of the most popular rides at Islands of Adventure are built around Marvel characters: the Incredible Hulk and Spider-Man. Universal's licensing agreements are long term but exclusive only to Florida; Disney can add the same characters to its parks in California, Europe and Asia, potentially weakening their Florida drawing power.
 Wizarding World, drawing on Ms. Rowling's legions of fans, will allow Universal to ease its reliance on the Marvel characters and, to some degree, attractions based on the movies of Steven Spielberg. Mr. Spielberg has a spectacularly rich consulting contract that gives him about 2 percent of the resort's gross, or an estimated $20 million a year, in perpetuity.
 Mr. Spielberg's contract contains a stipulation that allows him to be bought out in the coming months -- at a cost in excess of $200 million in cash -- and Universal is trying to negotiate an extension or some other contractual change. Universal Orlando has a deal in place to refinance about $1 billion in debt, but the terms rest on getting Mr. Spielberg squared away first, adding urgency to the negotiations.
 Three rides will form the center of the new park. Universal still will not talk much about the biggest one, a high-tech experience inside the castle called Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey that involves the likenesses of the heroes from the films.
 Flight of the Hippogriff is described as a family coaster that simulates a Hippogriff (the half-horse, half-eagle beast from ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'') training flight over Hogwarts castle. Dragon Challenge is a twin high-speed coaster that will feature elements from the Triwizard Tournament.
 Interactive shopping is a major component, said Paul Daurio, show producer for the park. For instance, the Ollivanders wand shop will replicate Ms. Rowling's story line: the wand chooses the wizard instead of the other way around. Other stores will offer Potter merchandise that is unavailable elsewhere, like extendable ears. 
 The castle itself will be about 150-feet tall but will appear to tower some 600 feet in the air because of architectural and filmmaking tricks, Mr. Daurio said. Over all, the park will resemble Hogsmeade, Ms. Rowling's all-wizard village.
 Wizarding World is already receiving rave reviews from at least one contingent: the actors in the films. Tom Felton, who plays Harry's towheaded nemesis Draco Malfoy, has visited the property twice, once when construction was just getting started and again in recent days.
 ''We always say on set, 'If this place was real, it would be absolutely fantastic,' '' he said in a telephone interview. ''To actually walk into this world and be able to touch it and taste it and smell it -- well, it's just going to be fantastic.''

HEADLINE: Some Bad Climate News and Some Good

 BODY:
Senators Barbara Boxer and John Kerry have delayed the introduction of their long-awaited climate change bill until the end of this month -- one more sign that Congress will be hard pressed to get a bill to President Obama's desk before the international summit on global warming in Stockholm in December. 
 The chances of action this year, never all that good, are even slimmer now that the White House and the Senate leadership have pretty much agreed to keep controversial issues -- and a bill limiting greenhouse gas emissions certainly falls into that category -- on the back burner until the health care debate is resolved. 
 Though smart politics, it is a disappointment to everyone who hoped that the United States would be able to go to Stockholm with a clear strategy in hand. 
 All is not lost. The Environmental Protection Agency is rolling out rules that, when fully effective, could place limits on at least half the greenhouse gas emissions emitted in this country.
 On Tuesday, the E.P.A. and the Department of Transportation jointly proposed standards to improve fuel economy and reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions in all new cars and light trucks beginning with the model year 2012. The E.P.A. has already sent the White House preliminary proposals involving the regulation of carbon dioxide from large stationary sources, including refineries and power plants. 
 The agency also continues to fine-tune its finding formally declaring that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases constitute a danger to human health and welfare. Under the Clean Air Act, an ''endangerment finding'' must be made before final rules limiting emissions can take effect. 
 Nobody, including the E.P.A. administrator, Lisa Jackson, believes that one agency can address the complex problem of climate change. Ultimately, Congress will have to produce robust legislation authorizing major public investments in alternative energy sources and putting a price on carbon to unlock private investment.
 That is just what the climate change bill approved by the House aims to do and what Senators Boxer and Kerry eventually hope to do with their bill. In the meantime, however, smart regulation can get the ball rolling and, we hope, goad Congress into action.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 17, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An editorial on Wednesday about the slow progress of climate change legislation incorrectly identified the location of an upcoming international summit on global warming. It will be held in Copenhagen, not Stockholm.

FASHION GIANTS
 With Bronx Roots
 This being Fashion Week in New York -- which ends on Thursday -- it seems worthwhile to recall that two big names in fashion grew up a few blocks from each other in the same striver neighborhood in the Bronx.
 Ralph Lauren (ne Lifshitz) and Calvin Klein were raised in the Norwood neighborhood near Mosholu Parkway in the 1940s and 1950s, with Mr. Klein living in an apartment house on Rochambeau Avenue and Mr. Lauren in an apartment building on Kossuth Avenue overlooking the parkway itself, according to Lloyd Ultan, the Bronx historian. They spent time at the same combined elementary and junior high school -- Public School 80 -- though roughly four years apart. 
 They may never have met, but both came from working-class homes where immigrant parents were trying to clamber their way another few rungs up the economic ladder. Mr. Klein's father was a salaried employee in his brother's grocery; Mr. Lauren's father was a house painter.
 The neighborhood was filled with low-rise apartment houses and single-family houses. Its mostly Italian, Irish and Jewish residents felt lucky to be on the leafy greenway of Mosholu Parkway. 
 But what was it about that small neighborhood that nourished such stylish tastes in fashion?
 ''It couldn't have been the choice of clothing stores on Jerome Avenue,'' said Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president from 1987 to 2001. ''They probably had to invent their own.''
 Ralphie Lifshitz was born in 1939, the son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, according to ''Genuine Authentic: The Real Life of Ralph Lauren'' by Michael Gross and several web biographies. For his bar mitzvah, he wore a blazer, a daring deviation from the dark suits his Orthodox peers wore. He also listened to Frank Sinatra, had a talent for drawing and an eye for the clothes that the more stylish neighbors wore.
 ''I was always inspired by those kind of prep-school people and their clothes,'' Mr. Lauren himself once said. ''By classic things, by the way those people looked and dressed. Maybe because I didn't have it, I always reached for it.''
 Calvin Klein, born in November 1942, was the son of a Hungarian immigrant, Leo Klein, according to ''The House of Klein: Fashion, Controversy, and a Business Obsession.'' Young Calvin often accompanied his mother, Flo, on shopping trips to Loehmann's, the discounter of high-end fashion, and often visited his grandmother's tailoring business. 
 He, too, was a talented sketch artist and was asked to paint a mural on the fifth floor of P.S. 80's hallway. After graduating from the High School of Industrial Art, he chose the Fashion Institute of Technology, where he began to study American designers who shaped his minimalist design.
 In an online review, Bernadine Morris, a former fashion writer for The New York Times, recalled how since she had gone to Hunter College's uptown campus -- now Lehman College -- in the Bronx, she had suggested an article about a remarkable coincidence involving rising fashion stars who both grew up in the Bronx. The two designers were both rejecting snobbish and elaborate French designs for clean-cut lines.
 The editors weren't interested, but she still remembered the headline she suggested: ''The Boys from Mosholu Parkway.''

HEADLINE: The Good Ol' Boys

BYLINE: By ELEANOR RANDOLPH

 BODY:
For a Southerner, one of the endearing things about Hamilton Jordan and Jody Powell was how much they enjoyed their bad-boy mystique. In the four years after the two Georgians stormed the White House with President Jimmy Carter, they relished tormenting people who felt too comfortable in pinstripes. By today's standards, they played hard. For Mr. Jordan, who died of cancer last year at 63, there was the cocaine incident that was never proved. And there was a bar-spitting incident that he always denied, but it sure sounded as if it was somebody from Georgia's clay pits brushing up against the stuffiness of Georgetown. 
 For Jody Powell, who died apparently of a heart attack at age 65 this week, the big weakness was cigarettes. It was a habit he enjoyed with such abandon that, later in life, he became an enthusiastic flak for the tobacco industry. I last saw him wearing a huge button that labeled him a proud American smoker. He smiled as people saw it and winced noticeably.
 As anyone being taunted by them knew, the prodigal side of these two sons of the South hid raw, withering wit and a biting intelligence that helped catapult their peanut farmer of a governor into the big leagues. If they were often mistaken for rednecks in Washington's salons, they were really anti-elitists. They figured out in advance that their man was probably smarter -- I.Q.-wise -- than most of the Ivy Leaguers harrumphing around the Senate. If he could win the little-known Iowa caucuses, they decided, he could outwit the rest of the pack in 1976. Winning the White House turned out to be the easy part.
 Mr. Jordan was the tactician; Mr. Powell was the liaison between the president and the news media. They had some success in the Middle East and pursued human rights across the globe. Mr. Powell was the rare press secretary who had the respect of both the president and most in the press. In their glory days, they posed for Rolling Stone as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. 
 All that wit and cockiness got lost in soaring inflation, infuriating gas lines and a hostage crisis in Iran. By 1980, voters were ready for a sunnier, smoother Ronald Reagan. ELEANOR RANDOLPH

HEADLINE: At Frankfurt Auto Show, Manufacturers Try to Shake Crisis Mentality

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
After a year that threatened to engulf the automobile business in a bruising contraction in world trade and most Western economies, manufacturers have arrived at the Frankfurt auto show more eager to sell cars than spread apocalyptic warnings.
 From compacts for the frugal to superpremium vehicles for the fabulous, the companies have new models to offer -- some of them electric -- and the world of auto enthusiasts is lapping them up as the industry begins to shake off the all-crisis, all-the-time attitude of the last year.
 ''You're talking more about products,'' Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Renault, said on Tuesday, the first day the show was open to journalists. ''We are happy.'' 
 As with so much in the post-Lehman Brothers world, the Frankfurt auto show is a more modest affair this year, with fewer companies displaying their wares across less floor space.
 Instead of the 1,046 companies at the biennial show's previous outing in 2007, there are 753 this year. That may reflect the industry's state of mind: 12 months after the Lehman debacle, things are less bad than expected and better than could be reasonably hoped for.
 Mr. Ghosn said that Renault, which controls the Japanese automaker Nissan, expected worldwide auto sales to reach 59 million units in 2009. The good news, he said, is that at the beginning of the year, he expected it to be 55 million.
 That bright spot masks different developments in different parts of the world, Mr. Ghosn and others said. The United States market is beginning to bounce back after a terrible 12 months, while China is firmly in recovery mode.
 ''The difficult crisis in the automotive industry is not over yet, but there are increasing signs that the bottom has been reached,'' Martin Winterkorn, the chief executive of Volkswagen, was quoted by Reuters as saying. ''The industry can be cautiously optimistic.''
 But the Japanese auto market has stagnated, and the European market faces a downturn late this year and early next as the cash-for-clunkers programs that have accelerated 2009 sales begin to run out. Germany spent $7.3 billion on the wildly popular program, which stimulated sales of smaller, environmentally friendly cars.
 Lewis Booth, chief financial officer of Ford Motor, said European governments should consider extending but then slowly phasing out the clunkers plans. Tadashi Arashim, the chief executive of Toyota in Europe, echoed that suggestion, pointing out that consumer confidence in Europe was still a shadow of what it was before the financial crisis hit.
 ''If the program halts too fast and sharply, then the underlying weakness of the European market will be exposed,'' Mr. Booth said.
 The question mark hanging over European spending has not stopped automakers from introducing what they say are the products of the future. Renault showed, for the first time, an all-electric sedan based on its existing Fluence line. Mr. Ghosn also announced a partnership with RWE, a German utility, to develop the infrastructure for recharging the batteries of electric cars.
 RWE's chief executive, Jurgen Grossmann, handed Mr. Ghosn a package -- and then autographed it -- the size of a mailbox from a street corner. It represents, both executives said, the electric ''filling station'' of the future.
 Burnishing its green credentials, Daimler showed off a ''plug-in hybrid'' -- a car that can run on either electricity or gasoline, but can be recharged from the wall. That the hybrid was a prototype version of the Mercedes S-Class -- the high end of an already premium brand -- suggested that no manufacturer could avoid electricity's surge. Daimler's chief executive, Dieter Zetsche, called the hybrid model ''the best of green.''
 For those who still enjoy the smell of gasoline, Porsche, the sports car manufacturer that is now being integrated into Volkswagen, roared into town for the European premiere of the Panamera. The four-door car made its debut in Shanghai this year.
 That Porsche went first to China -- a market it entered in 2001 -- and then came to Europe with the Panamera highlighted how much has changed since the last, albeit much milder, downturn in the world economy nearly a decade ago.
 No executive interviewed could recall thinking so much about the potential in Asia, specifically China or India, as previous downturns tapered off, though all were quick to emphasize that Japan, now mired in recession, was the exception.
 ''I'm not sure that 'Asia is going like gangbusters' is the right expression, but Asia is in a recovery,'' Mr. Booth said.

HEADLINE: A Word With the Winner. O.K., That's Enough.

BYLINE: By LYNN ZINSER

 BODY:
It seemed like a bit of harmonic convergence, one dynasty coming back to life as another one fell victim to an upstart not cowed by its aura. There is usually almost nothing convergent (or harmonic, for that matter) about the N.F.L. and professional tennis, but when New England revives itself behind the return of Tom Brady the same night 20-year-old Juan Martin del Potro ends Roger Federer's five-year stranglehold on the United States Open, well, there is some karma in that.
 And they even had similar postevent media dust-ups, with CBS's Dick Enberg clumsily trying to avoid letting del Potro say a few words in Spanish -- for which he is getting quite a lashing in blog commentville -- and ESPN's Suzy Kolber fighting off a stiff-arm from Brady as she tried to get a postgame comment. 
 For degree of difficulty, however, del Potro's victory certainly comes out ahead. As ESPN.com's Greg Garber points out, it is hard to overstate how big a favorite Federer was in New York, how much the specter of Federer hangs over tennis, writes Art Spander on CBSSports.com. But, as Martin Rogers writes on Yahoo.com, del Potro is young and confident enough not to wilt in the Federer shadow. SI.com's Richard Deitsch led the celebration over the rise of a new star, and Greg Couch of Fanhouse.com writes that we should be looking at this as a beginning and not an end. Of course, it is hard not to be a bit mystified at the public unraveling of Federer during that match, his temper caught by CBS microphones.
 The undoing of the Federer dominance took del Potro 4 hours 9 minutes, 1:06 longer than it took Brady to crush the hopes of the Bills and remind everyone, including ESPN.com's Howard Bryant, of his impeccable timing. This doesn't come as a surprise, knowing Brady's history, writes Clark Judge on CBSSports.com, but Yahoo.com's Dan Wetzel said the Patriots looked a lot more like a scrappy underdog than a revived dynasty. In fact, they have a lot of questions left to answer, writes Tony Masserotti of The Boston Globe.
 For Bills fans, the only question is, ''Why us?! Again!'' writes Jerry Sullivan of The Buffalo News.
 Chicago, meanwhile, is swirling with questions about what happens now that linebacker Brian Urlacher is lost to the Bears for the season. The Chicago Sun-Times's Neil Hayes proclaims the end of an era while The Tribune's David Haugh believes the Bears will persevere without him.
 An injury to Donovan McNabb means Philadelphia now finds itself with an awful lot of quarterbacks, adding Jeff Garcia to the mix that already includes an on-the-shelf Michael Vick. Jimmy Johnson writes on Foxsports.com that the Eagles should activate Vick now so he can practice in advance of his inevitable takeover of the job.
 Quarterback issues have also swamped the Panthers, who say Jake Delhomme will remain the starter but signed A.J. Feeley anyway. Jerome Bettis writes on SI.com that Delhomme has lost it and should sit, starting now.
 The start of N.F.L. season also ushers in the real meat of baseball season, during which Tim Brown of Yahoo.com takes a moment to appreciate the job done by Angels Manager Mike Scioscia in the wake of the death of Nick Adenhart. Less heartwarming is the plight of the Red Sox, who now welcome back pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka mostly because they have to, writes Jeff Passan on Yahoo.com.
 Baseball might be largely recession-proof, but parts of the N.B.A. are taking a hit, with Pat Riley actually taking a pay cut in Miami. And the N.H.L. is bracing for the impact of a Department of Transportation spat with Air Canada that threatens teams' charter service.
 All that seems insignificant if you consider the obstacles faced by deaf football players, as profiled in USA Today.
 They would understand the karma of the comeback. Think Dick Enberg would let them speak in sign language?

HEADLINE: Bernanke Says Growth Is Returning

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said Tuesday that it was ''very likely'' that the recession had ended although he cautioned that it could be months before unemployment rates dropped significantly. 
 ''Even though from a technical perspective the recession is very likely over at this point, it's still going to feel like a very weak economy for some time as many people will still find that their job security and their employment status is not what they wish it was,'' Mr. Bernanke said in response to a question about unemployment trends. ''That's a challenge for us and all policy makers going forward.'' 
 The cautiously optimistic assessment came at the end of a speech at the Brookings Institution observing a year after a market crisis that was precipitated by the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers. 
 Shortly before the speech, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales had surged in August as consumers swapped old cars for new ones under the ''cash-for-clunkers'' program. The increase, by a seasonally adjusted 2.7 percent rate over the previous month, widely surpassed analysts' expectations and was the largest monthly increase since January 2006. 
 Mr. Bernanke said the consensus of economic forecasters was for moderate economic growth for the remainder of this year and next, particularly as credit markets thaw, consumer confidence takes time to heal and the federal government begins to unwind spending and lending programs intended to mend the economy.
 ''The general view of forecasters is that growth in 2010 will be moderate, less than you might expect given the depth of the recession,'' Mr. Bernanke said, because of several issues, including continuing financial and credit problems, deleveraging by households and the need to end the economic stimulus programs. All these elements will ''make the 2010 recovery moderate, in particular not much faster than the underlying growth rate of the economy,'' he added.
 Business cycles are officially dated by a committee of economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research. The committee often spends many months sifting through economic trends before declaring the beginning and end dates of a recession. The latest recession began 12 months before it was officially declared in December 2008 by the committee.
 For policy makers in Washington, a more significant question than the actual date of the end of the current recession will be when to begin unwinding the myriad lending and guarantee programs that were hastily created in response to the crisis. Officials at the Federal Reserve have already begun to consider the question.
 Mr. Bernanke and other officials, including the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, have warned that removing the programs too early could lead to another round of problems. Historians now generally agree that, during the Great Depression, the early withdrawal of government programs in the 1930s led to deeper economic problems throughout that decade. 
 On the other hand, some analysts have warned that waiting too long could fuel significant price increases and lead to a return of corrosive levels of inflation.
 The unwinding of the various spending programs and lower-interest rate policies of the Fed is not likely to be popular because, among other things, it could increase the cost of borrowing. That also threatens to increase the borrowing costs for the federal government, which already faces record deficits. And policy makers will have to confront decisions on retrenching government lending and spending programs just as lawmakers are facing midterm elections next year. 
 In his speech, a version of which he has made before, Mr. Bernanke defended the decisions by the central bank and other policy makers throughout the crisis and said that any hesitation in taking the emergency steps that were ultimately pursued by the Fed, the federal government and foreign powers could have led to a far steeper economic decline.
 ''Without these speedy and forceful actions, last October's panic would likely have continued to intensify, more major financial firms would have failed, and the entire global financial system would have been at serious risk,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''We cannot know for sure what the economic effects of these events would have been, but what we know about the effects of financial crises suggests that the resulting global downturn could have been extraordinarily deep and protracted.''

HEADLINE: Obama Proposes Rules for Automakers on Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Mileage

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Obama administration proposed rules on Tuesday that would impose the first nationwide limits on greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles and require a nearly 40 percent increase in fuel efficiency for cars and light trucks sold in the United States by 2016.
 Officials said the rules offered concrete proof of the administration's commitment to address global warming just days before a series of international meetings on climate change open in Washington and at the United Nations. Broader legislation to deal with climate change is haltingly moving through Congress. 
 The government projects that the vehicle regulations will raise new car and truck prices by an average of $1,100, but that drivers will save $3,000 over the life of a vehicle in fuel bills. Officials also said the new program, which is to take effect in 2012, would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by nearly a billion tons and cut oil consumption by 1.8 billion barrels from 2012 to 2016.
 The regulations, 1,227 pages, will go through a 60-day public comment period before they become final early next year.
 The emissions program was first announced in May by President Obama as a way of resolving legal and regulatory conflicts among several federal agencies and a group of states, led by California, that want to impose stricter mileage and emissions standards than those set by Congress and a succession of presidents. 
 Automakers had complained that they faced a thicket of varying rules that were almost impossible to meet. The Obama compromise was endorsed by all the major auto companies, state officials and most environmental advocates.
 Addressing autoworkers at a General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, Mr. Obama said on Tuesday that the new rules would benefit manufacturers, workers and consumers.
 ''For too long,'' Mr. Obama said, ''our auto companies faced uncertain and conflicting fuel economy standards. That made it difficult for you to plan down the road. That's why, today, we are launching -- for the first time in history -- a new national standard aimed at both increasing gas mileage and decreasing greenhouse gas pollution for all new cars and trucks sold in America. 
 ''This action will give our auto companies some long-overdue clarity, stability and predictability.''
 Lisa P. Jackson, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, which along with the Department of Transportation will enforce the new rules, said at a White House briefing, ''The new standards are aggressive and achievable, and ensure that consumers have a full range of vehicle choices.'' 
 In addition to providing domestic and foreign auto manufacturers with a single national efficiency standard, the proposed rules allow them to continue to build and import all classes of vehicles, from the smallest gas-electric hybrids to monster S.U.V.'s. The mileage standard varies by vehicle size, but companies will have to achieve a fleet average of 35.5 miles a gallon in combined city and highway driving.
 The regulations say that car companies can meet the new standards largely by using existing technologies.
 ''These include improvements to engines, transmissions and tires; increased use of start-stop technology; improvements in air-conditioning systems (to the extent currently allowed by law); increased use of hybrid and other advanced technologies; and the initial commercialization of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids,'' the proposed regulations state. 
 Manufacturers can also claim credits toward the standards by selling so-called flexible-fuel vehicles capable of running on a combination of gasoline and ethanol, and by selling more efficient cars in California and in other states that planned to adopt its stringent rules. If all those tactics are fully employed, the standard comes down by 1 to 1.5 miles a gallon by 2016, according to analysts for environmental groups.
 Automakers that sell fewer than 400,000 vehicles in the United States would be allowed to meet a weaker standard to keep per-unit costs down. This group includes Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volkswagen and Subaru.
 The United States Chamber of Commerce and a group of automobile dealers have already indicated their intent to challenge the rules in court, saying the E.P.A. does not have authority to allow California to set its own emissions standards for vehicles. (The national program essentially ratifies one approved by California in 2004.) But the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the trade group representing most domestic and foreign car makers, endorsed it.

HEADLINE: Senate Health Bill Draws Fire on Both Sides of Aisle

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Jackie Calmes contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee said Tuesday that he could not support sweeping health care legislation drafted in more than three months of bipartisan negotiations by the chairman of the panel, and several liberal Democrats criticized the bill from the other side of the political spectrum.
 The statement by the Republican, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, came just as the chairman, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, put the final touches on his bill to provide health benefits to millions of the uninsured. 
 ''Unfortunately,'' Mr. Grassley said, ''we're operating under an artificial deadline set by the Democratic leadership and the White House. I'm disappointed because it looks like we're being pushed aside by the Democratic leadership so the Senate can move forward on a bill that, up to this point, does not meet the shared goals for affordable, accessible health coverage.''
 Mr. Grassley, who participated in the bipartisan negotiations, said he wanted to lower the overall cost of the bill. In addition, he said he wanted stronger guarantees that federal money would not be used to pay for abortions or to subsidize health insurance for illegal immigrants, and he is seeking unspecified ''medical malpractice reforms.'' 
 At the same time, Mr. Grassley said he hoped to ''stay at the table'' working with Democrats. ''Legislation that impacts every American should have strong bipartisan support,'' he said. 
 For their part, liberal Democrats said Mr. Baucus's bill did not go far enough to make insurance affordable to people with low and moderate incomes.
 One of the Democrats, Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, said he could not vote for the bill in its current form, in part because it did not include a new government insurance plan to compete with private insurers.
 ''The way it is now, there's no way I can vote for the Senate package,'' Mr. Rockefeller said.
 His comment came just minutes after President Obama's senior adviser, David Axelrod, met separately with House and Senate Democrats in the Capitol. Mr. Axelrod said it was urgent for Congress to overhaul the health care system, Mr. Obama's top domestic priority, and he cited public opinion polls to support his contention that Americans shared the president's view.
 Congressional Democrats voiced their concerns as Mr. Baucus prepared to unveil a detailed proposal, on which he wants the panel to vote next week.
 Four other Congressional committees have approved health care bills drafted by Democrats and passed without any Republican support.
 Democrats expressed a variety of concerns. Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said Mr. Baucus, by paring the cost of the bill, had also cut the subsidies that would help people buy insurance.
 ''This is reducing coverage for poor and working people,'' Mr. Rangel said, adding that such cuts ''could destroy the bill.''
 The House bill, in its current form, is expected to cost more than $1 trillion over 10 years, while Senate Democrats said the price tag for the Baucus proposal would be $880 billion or less.
 Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said he doubted that subsidies in the Baucus bill would be enough to enable middle-income people to buy insurance without straining family budgets, and he vowed to seek changes.
 Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, challenged Mr. Baucus's plan to help finance coverage of the uninsured by imposing $4 billion a year in fees on manufacturers of medical devices and diagnostic products.
 Mr. Baucus's plan, like the other major bills in Congress, would expand Medicaid to cover childless adults and other people with incomes less than 133 percent of the poverty level ($29,327 for a family of four). 
 In a telephone conference call with governors on Tuesday, Mr. Baucus said states would have to help pay the cost of covering people newly eligible for Medicaid. But he tried to allay the concerns of governors, who oppose any type of ''unfunded mandate.''
 Under Mr. Baucus's proposal, the federal government would pay most of the new Medicaid costs -- at least 80 percent in high-income states like Connecticut and 95 percent in poor states like Mississippi.
 This represents a significant increase in the federal share. Medicaid is jointly financed by the federal government and the states, and the federal share -- not counting extra money provided under the economic stimulus program -- ranges from 50 percent to nearly 80 percent.
 Mr. Baucus promised aid to states that have already expanded their Medicaid programs along the lines of his proposal. But officials in two such states, Massachusetts and Vermont, said they needed more details about the proposal to know how they would be affected.

HEADLINE: Bernanke Speaks, and Markets Inch Higher

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
For weeks, many of Wall Street's hopeful voices have been calling the end of the recession. And when the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said the same was ''very likely'' on Tuesday, his comment helped stock markets rise to highs for the year.
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 56.61 points, or 0.59 percent, to close at 9,683.41, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 0.31 percent or 3.29 points, to 1,052.63. The Nasdaq was 0.52 percent, or 10.86 points, higher, at 2,102.64. 
 Shares of basic-materials producers led the markets as commodities surged. Prices of oil and copper rose, and gold settled at $1,007.55 an ounce.
 During questions after a speech in Washington, Mr. Bernanke said that ''the recession is very likely over at this point,'' but warned that the economy would feel weak for some time as unemployment hovers at high levels.
 Mr. Bernanke's measured outlook reflected concerns among investors, who wonder whether the market can continue adding to recent gains if the economy is running only at half-speed. 
 But a better-than-expected report on retail sales in August calmed some worries. Bolstered by higher gasoline prices and automobile sales from the cash-for-clunkers rebate program, retail sales grew 2.7 percent last month. Even clothing stores, book and hobby shops, and department stores reported gains. 
 Shares of Macy's climbed nearly 4.6 percent, while Saks, J. C. Penney and Dillard's were also higher. 
 ''That's what fired it through the afternoon, the idea that the consumer is coming back,'' Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank, said of the gains. ''That really has been the missing piece in recovery.''
 Many forecasters expect consumers to slow a recovery, rather than propel it, as they try to rebuild their personal finances and recover from shocks in the stock and housing markets. But to bullish analysts, stronger results in the government's retail numbers suggested that consumers might be feeling a bit bolder, even with unemployment near 10 percent.
 Still, shrinking profit at the country's largest home-electronics chain and one of the largest grocers offered a stark example of how even market share and necessity are not insulating companies from the recession. 
 Earnings at the supermarket chainKroger fell 8 percent for the quarter ended Aug. 15 compared with a year earlier as shoppers focused on essential supplies and competition from discount chains increased. Shares of Kroger fell 7.5 percent, to $20.46.
 Earnings at Best Buy fell 22 percent as sales at stores open at least a year slipped and its international performance weakened. But the company said its market share had been growing, reflecting business it had picked up from the closings of Circuit City retail stores. Shares of Best Buy dipped more than 5 percent, to $38.32.
 An unexpected 1.7 percent increase in wholesale prices in August highlighted worries that inflation is creeping back as energy prices rise, lifting the cost of oil, gasoline and diesel. 
 Traders sold government bonds, whose relative returns are eaten away when prices rise. The Treasury's 10-year note fell 9/32, to 101 13/32, and the yield rose to 3.45 percent, from 3.42 percent late Monday.
 Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

HEADLINE: Obama, Appealing to a Core Ally, Rallies Labor to His Policies

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH 

 BODY:
President Obama did not deliver a robust sales pitch on the details of his health care agenda here Tuesday at a convention of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., but rather asked labor leaders to stand with him in resisting opponents of the White House and focus on lifting the economy. 
 ''We've been hearing a lot of stuff from folks who aren't that friendly to me, or the union movement,'' Mr. Obama said. ''So let's just take a stroll down memory lane. Let's just remember where we were when I took the oath of office.'' 
 A week after he asked Democrats in Congress to support the outlines of his health care plan, Mr. Obama made a similar but broader case to union audiences here and earlier Tuesday in Ohio. He said his administration had ''stopped our economic free fall,'' and he worked to make the case to labor, an important constituency group, that his policies had helped the middle class.
 Yet despite the thunderous applause he received, his mentioning the term ''public option'' only once during a 35-minute speech at the convention did not go unnoticed. Many delegates carried signs and wore T-shirts declaring that a government-run insurance program was a nonnegotiable piece of health care legislation.
 An approach that the president's advisers call pragmatic, which has riled the party's base, was on full display in another way as well when Mr. Obama appeared later in the day at a pair of Philadelphia fund-raisers with Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. 
 Mr. Specter, a Republican turned Democrat, is engaged in a bitter re-election fight, and the president's siding with him in the primary against a more liberal Democrat, Representative Joe Sestak, has agitated many liberals already angered because they believe that Mr. Obama is being too timid on health care.
 One delegate at the convention here, Kate Brennan, a retired music professor from Pittsburgh, said that she had supported and contributed to Mr. Obama's presidential campaign but that she would ''be crushed'' if he compromised on a public option.
 ''He wants to be a middle-of-the-road guy, but he was elected by us liberal people,'' Ms. Brennan, 72, said in an interview as the president, his speech over, walked from the stage. ''We've supported him. He needs to listen to us.''
 Another delegate, Allan Larsen, a 73-year-old retiree from Grove City, Pa., said, ''If he signs a bill without a public option, he won't win a second term.''
 It is, of course, too soon to know how the health care debate will play out or what impact it will have on Mr. Obama's presidency. But one reason he increasingly points to the nation's economic progress, aides said, is to remind voters that his policies have helped move the country away from the brink of a depression.
 ''I know times are still tough for working people,'' Mr. Obama said. ''I know too many people are still looking for work or worried they'll be the next ones let go. But the recovery act is making a difference. We've stopped our economic free fall, and that's something everybody can agree on.''
 Before arriving at the convention, Mr. Obama visited a General Motors assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, where about 800 workers have been called back to their jobs to help meet new demand owing to the Cash for Clunkers program, which offered drivers up to $4,500 to buy vehicles that are more fuel efficient. He inspected a Chevy Cruze, a new car that is designed to get 40 miles a gallon.
 The president said the government's intervention in the auto industry ''may not have been popular'' but had been critical to jump-starting and remaking it.
 ''In the midst of a deep recession and financial crisis, the collapse of the auto industry would have caused enormous damage to our economy,'' Mr. Obama said. ''So we intervened for one simple and compelling reason: your survival and the success of our economy depended on it.''
 The president argued that lowering health care costs and expanding coverage were essential to making further economic gains. Noting that union workers had struggled to negotiate pay increases, he said: ''That's not just the fault of the employer. It's the fault of a broken health care system that's sucking up all the money.''
 After flying later in the day to Philadelphia, Mr. Obama emerged from Air Force One with his arm around Mr. Specter as they headed to the fund-raisers, which officials said were expected to bring in more than $2 million. The president had agreed to campaign on his behalf if Mr. Specter became a Democrat, a step the senator took in bolting the Republican Party this spring. 
 And Mr. Specter's vote, the president said, is urgently needed this year on health care legislation, whose passage is ''not going to be easy.''
 ''We live in a polarized environment,'' Mr. Obama said at one of the fund-raisers, ''and politics has become sport. And it's hard to sustain complex arguments about why we have to make choices that don't always seem real attractive on the surface.''

HEADLINE: New York's Mayoral Race Shaping Up to Be Personal, Expensive and Bitter

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Here is the Michael R. Bloomberg that his Democratic rival wants you to see: a power-hungry politician who broke his promise not to seek a third term; an insensitive billionaire who raised taxes on the middle class; an overrated manager who failed to accomplish anything big in his second term.
 Here is the William C. Thompson Jr. that the mayor will describe to voters: a machine politician who ran an ineffective Board of Education; an undistinguished comptroller who mismanaged the city's pension system; and a by-the-books bureaucrat unprepared to solve the city's ills. 
 Wednesday is the first day of the general election campaign for mayor, but the outline of each side's message is already emerging. And this much is clear: The race will be combative. It will be expensive. And it will be personal.
 ''The incumbent Republican mayor defends Wall Street executives, the rich and developers,'' begins a new radio advertisement from Mr. Thompson's campaign. 
 ''The same old politics,'' intones the latest TV ad from Mr. Bloomberg's camp, in a thinly veiled reference to his Democratic opponent. 
 Mr. Thompson, the city's chief financial officer, who was the winner of Tuesday's Democratic primary, has just seven weeks to introduce himself to New Yorkers and make a case for booting Mr. Bloomberg from office. 
 It would be a tall order under normal circumstances, given the vast advantages of incumbency. But it will prove especially difficult this time. A lackluster Democratic primary, featuring a poorly financed opponent, failed to capture the imagination of voters, leaving Mr. Thompson largely unknown. And the mayor, who dips into his own fortune, estimated at $16 billion, to finance his campaigns, has an indisputable financial edge, allowing him to smother Mr. Thompson's message. So far, he has outspent Mr. Thompson by a rate of 12 to 1. 
 But two variables have injected some unpredictability into the race: the unsettled economy and the emotional battle last fall to rewrite the city's term limits law. Both issues have cast a shadow over the mayor's campaign. 
 In a city where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by a five-to-one ratio, the Democratic nominee for mayor typically starts out with at least 40 percent of the vote. Mr. Thompson's strategy to eke out a majority on Election Day is twofold: Rally black voters, as the city's first black comptroller, and appeal to a large band of undecided voters wary of the mayor.
 Eduardo Castell, Mr. Thompson's campaign manager, estimates that some 15 percent of voters have not made up their minds. ''Those voters are not breaking for the mayor,'' Mr. Castell said in an interview. ''They are sitting on the sidelines waiting for an alternative.''
 At every possible turn, Mr. Thompson will attack Mr. Bloomberg for what Mr. Castell described as ''broken promises'' and ''for playing by a different set of rules.'' 
 He will critique his record on homelessness, his autocratic approach to the schools and his tax increases. ''Life in this city has become more expensive, not less,'' Mr. Castell said. He will deride Mr. Bloomberg as a Republican, even though the mayor is a registered independent, because he is running on the Republican ballot line. 
 And in television ads set to run this week, the campaign will present Mr. Thompson as an experienced citywide officeholder and a champion of the working class -- a native New Yorker as familiar with the city's streets as he is its corridors of power. According to the campaign's first radio spot, ''Bill Thompson will worry for those New Yorkers who make New York City a great city with their daily work.'' 
 As he did in 2005, Mr. Bloomberg is running on his unusual political resume -- an independent-minded media mogul, owing favors to no one -- and his mayoral record: low crime, improved schools and efficient city services. 
 But he is tailoring that message to the difficult economic times. His ubiquitous TV commercials, radio ads and glossy mailers promote a ''five-borough economic opportunity plan'' to combat his sometimes Manhattan-centric image. He is promising to create or save 400,000 jobs, and suggests that better schools allow middle-class families to ''afford to stay in New York City.'' 
 The campaign will pointedly contrast the mayor's achievements with Mr. Thompson's, implying that it would be foolhardy to gamble on an untested leader in a recession. ''People think he's a good mayor,'' said Bradley Tusk, Mr. Bloomberg's campaign manager. ''So the choice is simple: if you think this city is run well and you want it to continue, vote for him.''
 Mr. Bloomberg's aides have already started to mock Mr. Thompson's record as the president of the Board of Education, and as comptroller, suggesting he is a creature of the political machine. ''Mike Bloomberg is not the candidate of the party bosses,'' Mr. Tusk said. ''He's not the candidate of the political clubs.'' 
 The campaign will carefully confront any creeping Bloomberg fatigue. A new ad, for example, emphasizes the mayor's humble roots, rather than his current life of luxury. And on the campaign trail, Mr. Bloomberg increasingly concedes that the city ''is not perfect,'' but he says that it's better, and suggests he is the right man to keep it from getting worse.

HEADLINE: Leader and Cabinet Start Term in Japan

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI; Mark McDonald contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Yukio Hatoyama, who led his party to a landmark victory in elections last month, took office as prime minister and named a cabinet of loyal allies on Wednesday, promising to bring change to a country mired in stagnation after a half-century of virtually uninterrupted, one-party rule.
 Mr. Hatoyama has said the Democratic Party will reverse Japan's long economic malaise, increasing social benefits and aligning policies more closely with the public's needs rather than those of big business or the country's bureaucrats. He has also spoken of redefining Japan's relationship with the United States, its closest ally. 
 ''I am trembling with deep emotion over this moment of historical change, while at the same time I know I have taken on an immense responsibility,'' Mr. Hatoyama said at a news conference. ''We are entering the realm of the unknown.''
 Mr. Hatoyama, 62, is a management professor with a doctorate in engineering from Stanford; a critic of globalization; a political scion who cast out Japan's postwar political order with a decisive victory over the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
 He inherits an economy that is emerging from its deepest recession in decades, brought on by a collapse in the country's mainstay exports amid the global economic crisis. He must also deal with debt approaching twice the size of its gross domestic product, a legacy of years of government spending on public works projects that fueled the politics of the departing Liberal Democrats.
 Unemployment is at a record high of 5.7 percent, while the cost of supporting a rapidly aging population is threatening the country's public finances.
 Blaming years of mismanagement by bureaucrats for Japan's woes, Mr. Hatoyama has made reining in their power a major goal. His rhetoric struck a chord with voters demoralized after decades of insider-driven politics and wasteful spending.
 The Democrats also promise to redistribute more funds directly to the country's struggling households, and build a stronger social safety net. They hope that more economic security will spur consumer spending, and wean Japan off its dependence on exports for economic growth.
 ''First and foremost, we will engage in policies that will boost household incomes,'' Mr. Hatoyama said. ''We will realize a world where politics does not rely on bureaucrats.'' 
 The cabinet Mr. Hatoyama picked reflects those goals.
 Hirohisa Fujii, Japan's new finance minister, is a Finance Ministry bureaucrat-turned-politician likely to play an important role in efforts to control the bureaucracy and rein in spending. He served as finance minister for a coalition government in the mid-1990s, when the Liberal Democrats briefly lost power.
 Mr. Fujii will be joined in his task by the deputy prime minister, Naoto Kan, 62, a founder of the Democratic Party who will lead a new agency called the National Strategy Bureau. Mr. Kan will take on tasks once carried out by the bureaucracy, including drawing up national budgets and filling top bureaucratic posts.
 Mr. Kan, a former activist, lawyer and lawmaker, has a record of battling bureaucrats, most famously over a government cover-up of tainted blood products that caused hundreds of hemophilia patients to contract the AIDS virus.
 Critics say the Democrats, who swept into office with 308 out of 490 Parliament seats, lack a coherent growth strategy. ''The Democratic Party is still trying to figure out how best it should engage with the global economy,'' said Izuru Makihara, a politics professor at Tohoku University. ''They say they will overhaul current policy, but it's not clear what they will replace it with.''
 In his cabinet lineup, Mr. Hatoyama also accommodated the Democrats' two coalition partners -- the Social Democratic Party and the People's New Party, a conservative splinter group.
 Those parties, with anti-free-market platforms, are expected to push the Democrats to reverse many of the pro-market reforms championed by the former prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi.
 The Democrats' election platform also called for a re-examination of Tokyo's ties with Washington, including the presence of 50,000 American service members in Japan. But Mr. Hatoyama's choice of foreign minister, the 56-year-old moderate Katsuya Okada, signals that Japan's pro-American foreign policy will not drastically change.

HEADLINE: Shares Rise on Bets For Economic Rebound

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Stock markets stampeded higher on Wednesday, and major Wall Street benchmarks touched their highest levels of the year on optimism that an economic rebound was under way.
 Investors anticipating a resurgence in industrial output snapped up crude oil, copper and other raw materials used to feed factories. Those who expect inflation pushed the price of gold higher. And optimistic stock traders helped to send the Dow more than 100 points higher.
 But a good day for stocks and commodities meant a rough ride for the dollar, whose value against six major currencies slipped to its lowest point since last September. 
 The dollar fell to $1.4723 against the euro, from $1.4659 a day earlier, and it weakened to 90.90 against the yen. Its recent decline could help American manufacturers by making their products cheaper overseas, but it underscores worries about big deficits and a swelling money supply in the United States.
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 108.30 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 9,791.71, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 1.5 percent, or 16.13 points, at 1,068.76, reaching its highest level since early October. The Nasdaq rose 1.5 percent, or 30.51 points, to 2,133.15.
 ''We've been riding this thing for a long time,'' said Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading. ''You notice that the sell-offs never last more than a couple days. We're going to stay with it. We still think there's a little bit more to go.'' 
 Mr. Strazzullo said his firm was looking for benchmarks of 1,100 and 1,150 on the S.& P. 500 (it is now trading around 1,060) as moments to pause, take some profits and reassess whether the markets seem primed for more gains. 
 It has been a good week for the bulls on Wall Street.
 A new report on industrial production showed that factories, mines and utilities increased their output for a second month in August, a sign that a recovery was under way. On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said that the recession was most likely over, though he warned of a plodding recovery.
 ''You're getting more evidence that the economy's turning,'' said Anthony Dwyer, equity market strategist at FTN Equity Capital Markets. ''This is going to be a big recovery because it was a big decline.''
 Financial shares, like those of credit card companies and regional banks, led the buying spree in stock markets.
 Shares of Bank of America rose 2.7 percent while JPMorgan Chase rose 3.4 percent, and a closely watched index of regional bank shares was up 5.9 percent. 
 The aluminum maker Alcoa gained 3.4 percent and United States Steel was up 1.7 percent, reflecting hopes for a rebound driven by industry.
 As stocks surged, Wall Street's gold rush intensified.
 The price of gold rose $9.75 to settle at $1,017.30 an ounce as traders bet that prices of precious metals would continue to climb as the dollar weakened and the economy healed.
 Investors rushed to buy crude oil, copper and other commodities that could weather an outbreak of inflation.
 Some investors say they believe that inflation -- or at least the fear of inflation -- is seeping back into the economy as factories restart production and industrial output rebounds. The government reported Wednesday that retail prices rose 0.4 percent last month, largely because of a rise in gasoline costs.
 Even though the Federal Reserve expects inflation to remain under wraps with so much slack in the economy and millions of people out of work, investors anticipating a surge in prices and a weaker dollar are betting heavily on commodities and other currencies.
 Despite the surge in stock and commodities prices, Treasury prices fell only marginally. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 4/32, to 101 9/32, and the yield rose to 3.47 percent, from 3.45 percent late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Ruling on Housing for Mentally Ill Is a Step Forward

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''New York Cited in Warehousing of Mentally Ill'' (news article, Sept. 9):
 As national advocates for people with disabilities, we welcome the ruling for people with mental illnesses who live segregated by New York State in large publicly financed ''adult homes.'' 
 While the case will probably proceed through appeals, Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis's thoroughly documented findings of fact and thoughtfully reasoned conclusions of law will echo across the nation to enable hundreds of thousands of people with mental disabilities to challenge -- even avoid -- unnecessary confinement in proprietary nursing facilities and board-and-care homes. 
 Ten years after the United States Supreme Court's landmark Olmstead decision banned needless institutionalization, it is clear that those living in private facilities enjoy the right to integration in the community.
 Ira Burnim Washington, Sept. 9, 2009
 The writer, legal director of the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, was co-counsel in Disability Advocates Inc. v. Paterson, the case at hand.
 To the Editor:
 If integration into the community is to succeed, the plan for relocation of 4,300 mentally ill people into supported housing must address three issues: 
 Economic access. Funding streams used to support people in adult homes are fragmented, and no one regulatory authority has the jurisdiction necessary to pool these funds and use them in an integrated manner. Funding streams should be merged.
 Safe, affordable housing. Too often the only affordable and available apartments are located in neighborhoods with high crime rates and drug use. Given that roughly 50 percent of people with severe mental disorders also have histories of substance abuse, this is a recipe for disaster. The stipend for housing from federal and state subsidies should be raised.
 Access to services. Residents released from adult homes must have the proper supports and links to needed services in place in order to have a chance of living successfully in the community. 
 Without a plan addressing these challenges, the relocation from adult homes to community housing will have no more success than deinstitutionalization during the 1960s and 1970s did. 
 Peter C. Campanelli New York, Sept. 14, 2009
 The writer is founder and chief executive of the Institute for Community Living, which assists people with disabilities.

HEADLINE: Hedge Funds Challenged Over Fees

BYLINE: By ZACHERY KOUWE

 BODY:
''TWO and twenty'' -- three words that long held the key to transforming fledgling hedge fund managers into instant tycoons -- may be due for a pruning.
 The phrase, shorthand for a formula in which hedge funds collected 2 percent of the assets they managed and 20 percent of the profits they reaped, has been tarnished because of a 2008 marred by losses. Now many clients who had long countenanced the hefty payouts so long as they garnered outsize returns are getting antsy.
 The debate over fees comes as the hedge fund industry is reeling. Last year, the average fund lost nearly 19 percent and investors flooded firms with withdrawal requests. More than $600 billion has been pulled from hedge funds since the peak of the credit boom, leaving the industry to oversee just $1.3 trillion, according to Hedge Fund Research.
 Even practitioners within the hedge fund world have begun questioning whether 2-and-20, let alone even more expensive formulas, should remain standard practice for compensation. 
 Howard S. Marks, whose Oaktree Capital Management oversees $60 billion in hedge funds and other investment vehicles, told investors recently that many firms in the industry were overpaid for mediocre performance.
 ''Incentive fees should go only to managers with the skill needed to add enough to returns to more than offset the fees,'' Mr. Marks wrote in July. 
 By his calculations, a typical debt-focused hedge fund would need to earn 36 percent more than a high-yield bond mutual fund, which charged a standard 0.5 percent fee, just to achieve the same return.
 ''How many managers in a given asset class can generate this incremental 36 percent other than through an increase in risk?'' Mr. Marks asked. ''A few? Perhaps. The majority? Never.'' 
 Managers who actually helped their clients weather the financial crisis deserve to be very well compensated, he argued. ''But the rest should receive smaller fees or be denied incentive arrangements,'' he said. (He added that he hoped Oaktree turned out to be one of the few hedge funds that deserved rich compensation.)
 Now some big hedge fund investors, including pension funds and endowments, are making similar arguments, though many still fear reprisal from successful managers if they criticize too harshly. These investors, who have long tried to push for smaller fees with little success, are now starting to flex their muscles, according to a June study from Barclays Capital.
 The California Public Employees Retirement System, or Calpers, the nation's largest public pension fund, has publicly called on hedge funds to reduce both their management and performance fees and to increase transparency. Calpers, which lost 19 percent in its hedge fund portfolio last year, said it would pull its money from firms that refused to follow its standards.
 Unlike some other investors, Calpers has followed through on its promise, withdrawing $1.1 billion from nine hedge funds so far this year, according to AR magazine. Among them are Farallon Capital Management, Canyon Capital Advisors and Atticus Capital. In 2007, Calpers paid the three firms a combined $12.1 million in fees.
 Larry Powell, the deputy chief investment officer for the $16 billion Utah Retirement System, issued a memo in March to hedge funds, calling on managers to put in effect ''claw-back'' arrangements that force managers to return some of the fees they collected in prior years if they fail to perform in the current one. It is unclear whether any firms actually changed their terms.
 Critics of hedge fund fees point out that several internal managers at Harvard's $26 billion endowment had to return parts of bonuses earned in prior years after the fund dropped 27 percent in 2008.
 ''Harvard is certainly on the cutting edge when it comes to pay for performance,'' said Brad Alford, a former investment executive for Duke University who now heads Alpha Capital Management, an investment advisory firm. ''It's something the industry as a whole should emulate.''
 Even with last year's losses, established hedge fund managers say they have given up little ground so far. ''There's been very little discussion of reduction in fees by those managers who perform well,'' Daniel Och, head of Och-Ziff Capital Management, said on a recent conference call with analysts.
 Still, about a third of hedge fund managers reduced their fees on existing funds this year, according to Barclays. But many have demanded that investors lock up their cash for longer periods of time. Others have been forced to restructure their funds because of poor performance last year and a high number of redemption requests, according to Andrea Gentilini, a director at Barclays Capital.
 ''We're seeing some movement on management fees, but in the area of performance fees we have seen substantial resilience,'' Mr. Gentilini said.
 New managers and existing funds looking to raise fresh capital have begun to offer more investor-friendly terms, either through lower management fees or special institutional share classes for big investors.
 Mr. Powell said he had won better terms from 10 of the 40 hedge funds in which Utah has a direct investment. Citadel Investment Group, the giant Chicago-based fund run by Kenneth C. Griffin, is raising a new $2 billion fund with lower fees in exchange for longer lockup periods, according to investors to whom the new fund had been pitched. 
 Others are taking a more customized approach based on how long investors commit to the firm.
 ''Historically, everyone had similar fund terms,'' said Stephen V. Raneri, who founded the hedge fund LionEye Capital Management earlier this year. ''But now there's much more discussion of tailoring the fee structure depending on a fund's particular strategy.''
 Criticism does not stop with lower fees. Investors also want more stringent performance requirements to ensure managers are not merely benefiting from a bull market, according to Barclays, which surveyed more than 300 hedge fund investors.
 One idea gaining ground is the imposition of a ''hurdle rate,'' which sets a specific benchmark a manager must overcome to receive his incentive fee at the end of the year. The hurdle would vary depending on the specific strategy the fund employs. For example, the manager of a simple long-short equity fund would need to beat the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index by at least 2 percentage points to be eligible for the fee.
 The debate over hedge fund compensation has also found its way into the private equity industry, where ''2 and 20'' has been the standard for more than two decades.
 The Institutional Limited Partners Association, which represents investors with $1 trillion invested in private equity funds, released a set of principles this month to guide members in negotiating terms of their private equity investments. Among other things, one of the proposed guidelines involves investors being told more about transaction and monitoring fees that private equity firms get from their portfolio companies.
 ''We want our managers to create tremendous wealth for themselves, as long as we're in that same boat,'' said Joncarlo Mark, a senior portfolio manager at Calpers.

HEADLINE: Job Prospects Are Poor, Agency Warns

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

 BODY:
Unless government programs for the unemployed are refined, high jobless rates could persist beyond 2010, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warned on Wednesday.
 ''A recovery may be in sight,'' the group said in its annual employment outlook, referring to economic output. ''But the short-term employment outlook is grim.'' 
 The international organization said that unemployment among its 30 member nations would rise to nearly 10 percent by the end of 2010.
 Disadvantaged groups, like youths and immigrants as well as low-skilled and temporary workers, will bear the brunt of the increase.
 The estimate was based on the group's June economic forecasts. Individual country projections vary from a high of 20 percent in Spain to 10 percent in the United States and 6 percent in Japan.
 There was more evidence of a jobless recovery in Britain on Wednesday.
 The Office for National Statistics said British unemployment rose 0.7 percentage points to 7.9 percent in the three months that ended July 31. A total of 210,000 people lost their jobs during the period, taking unemployment to 2.47 million. The number of 16- to 24-year-olds out of work rose to almost one million, the highest since record-keeping began.
 European unions, in particular, are seething at the fact that banks, many of which were bailed out by taxpayers, are starting to pay healthy bonuses again.
 ''The scandal of bank bonuses is only the tip of the iceberg,'' John Monks, the general secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation, said Wednesday. ''What is also urgent now is for governments and central banks to make sure banks use the support they have been given to support jobs and investment.''
 The O.E.C.D. stressed that the overall jobless rate in its 30 member countries would have been even higher -- 0.8 to 1.4 percentage points more in 2010 -- if governments had not adopted fiscal stimulus and other support measures.
 But government initiatives like job training programs do not appear focused enough to bring the unemployment rate down soon, the report said.
 ''A major risk is that much of this large hike in unemployment becomes structural in nature as many of the unemployed drift into long-term joblessness or drop out of the labor force,'' said John P. Martin, the O.E.C.D. director for employment.
 That occurred in a number of member countries during past recessions, he added, ''when unemployment remained at a new higher plateau compared with the pre-crisis level even after output returned to potential and it took many years, if ever, to bring it down again to the pre-crisis level.''

Generations ago, industrialists and financiers extracted fortunes from the copper and gold mines dug into the canyons near here. Now, their modern-day counterparts are resisting a government proposal that could shut down what has become another gold mine of sorts.
 Utah is the nation's unlikely capital of industrial banks -- niche institutions that primarily make loans to businesses. Corporations like Goldman Sachs, Target and General Electric have been attracted to the state to set up such institutions. While they have brought billions of dollars in deposits, thousands of jobs and millions in charitable donations to Salt Lake City, the banks have also drawn fire from Washington.
 The Obama administration argues that the banks pose a threat to the economy because their parent companies can engage in risky practices but are often exempt from routine scrutiny by the Federal Reserve. Treasury officials want to require the corporate owners of the nation's 41 industrial banks to accept more rigorous regulation or be forced to sell or shut them down.
 ''The president's regulatory reform plan is not about fighting the last crisis, but trying to avoid the next one,'' said Michael S. Barr, assistant Treasury secretary for financial institutions. ''If we preserve known loopholes in consolidated oversight, then we will just be inviting the next Bear Stearns or A.I.G.'' 
 But the banks are fighting back. ''We are talking about survival here,'' said Louise P. Kelly, president of EnerBankUSA in Salt Lake City. 
 Defending the institutions as safe and profitable, she and others have mounted a campaign to not only block the administration's plan, but to expand the number of such banks. The industry is deploying lobbyists, jawboning lawmakers, doling out campaign contributions and trying to persuade Treasury and banking officials. 
 So far, they appear to be winning some concessions. Sheila Bair, the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, have both said they would favor allowing owners of existing industrial banks to maintain their banking operations.
 ''They told me that divestiture would be very disruptive, and I agreed,'' Mr. Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, said in an interview, referring to Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive at General Electric, and other G.E. executives who met with him in July. ''It is not a matter of them wreaking havoc.'' 
 Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and other officials are pressing ahead with their proposal to require the institutions to submit to Federal Reserve oversight, part of a sweeping package of regulatory reforms. But the battle over the banks, expected to intensify now that Congress is back in session, demonstrates how difficult enacting tougher regulation can be.
 A Lobbying Battleground
 The nation's industrial banks hold $130 billion, only about 1 percent of federally insured bank deposits. They trace their history to the early 1900s when small lending houses sprang up to offer loans to factory workers who otherwise could not get credit. Today, the banks -- almost all are in Utah, Nevada and California -- do all manner of lending. 
 Unlike commercial banks, though, all but the smallest industrial banks are barred from offering checking accounts, so most have no retail branches. And they are not supervised by the Federal Reserve nor are their parent companies required to set aside capital reserves that could be used if a bank gets into trouble. 
 While no industrial bank has failed in the last year, Capmark Bank and Marlin Business Bank sustained losses that are forcing them to curtail operations. The F.D.I.C. recently ordered another, Advanta Bank Corporation, to stop taking new customers because it was in peril.
 Utah became a haven for industrial banks in the last decade, relaxing laws to lure them there after Congress prohibited them in states that did not already have them. Companies like BMW and Pitney Bowes, and major investment banks, including Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch, soon set up shop. Assets at such banks in Utah skyrocketed from $3 billion in 1995 to $243 billion last year, although the numbers have since dropped to $106 billion, largely as a result of a rush to convert to commercial bank status to qualify for government bailout money.
 In Salt Lake City, the banks have been a welcome presence. They created an estimated 15,000 jobs at the banks and related service companies, and their executives have sprinkled money around to everything from the Utah Symphony Orchestra to housing for the poor.
 The Obama administration plan, though, presents a double threat to the state. If the Treasury department prevails in insisting on Federal Reserve oversight for industrial banks, there is no reason for those owned by national financial services companies to be headquartered in Utah. And terminating the industrial bank charter, along with other new requirements, could force manufacturing giants like G.E. to sell their financial arms because of federal prohibitions against commercial companies operating banks.
 Indeed, perhaps no company has more at stake in the debate than G.E., which operates its $10 billion industrial bank, GE Capital Financial, at the foot of the Wasatch Mountains, 15 miles south of downtown Salt Lake City.
 Located in a new office complex, it hardly seems like a bank at all: it has no branches, no A.T.M.'s and hardly any walk-in customers. But it lends to businesses across the nation. It has financed loans to more than 5,000 fast-food restaurants, helped equip about 4,000 dentists' offices and allowed small businesses to buy tens of thousands of forklifts, delivery vans and other equipment.
 ''This is boring -- forklifts, grills at Burger King,'' said Russell Wilkerson, a G.E. executive who was visiting his company's Utah offices last month. ''It is middle-market America.''
 Those loans may be boring, but they have proven to be lucrative. G.E.'s industrial bank ranked as the nation's 46th most profitable bank earlier this year. 
 If General Electric had to sell off GE Capital -- the large financial unit of which the industrial bank is a subsidiary -- it would cost shareholders $40 billion in lost market capitalization, or 22 percent of current market capitalization, according to an estimate by a Goldman Sachs analyst, because of higher taxes, lower net income and higher capital overall requirements. ''It is first unnecessary because it did not contribute to the crisis, and second it would be disruptive to the economy and lending,'' Brackett B. Denniston, G.E.'s general counsel, said in an interview. 
 Like other industrial banks here, G.E.'s is regulated by Utah's Department of Financial Institutions, as well as the F.D.I.C. State officials resent any suggestion that they are lax in their oversight.
 ''We have proven there is a way to manage these institutions,'' said Darryle P. Rude, Utah's chief industrial bank supervisor. ''So why would you want to eliminate a system that has not been a threat?'' 
 Encouraging Risk
 But critics tick off a list of complaints about the banks, including assertions that owning them gives their corporate parents an unfair advantage and encourages risky practices.
 Companies that own industrial banks can finance lending operations more cheaply than their competitors by relying on federally insured deposits at their banks, instead of going to the more costly bond market, said Matthew Anderson, a consultant who studies bank industry earnings. 
 In addition, he and others point out, state regulators and the F.D.I.C. do not have the same powers as the Federal Reserve to demand changes in risky business practices by parent companies that might indirectly threaten their industrial banks. 
 Treasury officials have not blamed industrial banks for a role in the financial crisis, but they do argue that the regulatory loophole permitted abusive actions by some of their parent companies that fed the problems. 
 ''This is not about picking on anyone, but they contributed to risk in the system,'' said a Treasury official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment on the issue.
 A few industry observers go further in their complaints. Some companies intentionally chose an industrial bank charter -- where they could raise money through brokered C.D.'s, investor funds in cash accounts and funds from business clients -- so that they could take riskier bets and have higher leverage in their other business units, argued Raj Date, who leads a nonprofit industry research group, Cambridge Winter.
 He said that parent companies of eight of what had been the top 12 Utah industrial banks filed for bankruptcy protection or received large allotments of federal bailout funds or other federal financial support in the last year. Those companies -- including Merrill Lynch, GMAC, Morgan Stanley and CIT -- consumed $70 billion, according to Mr. Date's analysis. (Those institutions have all closed their industrial banks, in most cases a condition of accepting the money.) 
 ''The United States of America has lost billions of dollars based on inadequate regulation,'' said James A. Leach, a former Republican congressman from Iowa and longtime critic of industrial banks. ''Once you set up an exception like the industrial bank charter, the smart and the big are not dumb. They will exploit it. And that is just what they did.''
 Executives at industrial banks, including those operated by Harley Davidson, Toyota, Pitney Bowes and G.E., reject criticism they were a factor in the financial crisis, a position shared by Ms. Bair, the F.D.I.C. chairwoman. 
 The bankers said that many financial institutions without industrial banks also turned to the federal government for a bailout. They added that industrial banks have nearly twice the capital reserves of a typical commercial bank. 
 ''For the last ten years the industrial banks have been the strongest, best capitalized, most profitable, least likely to fail banks in the country,'' said George Sutton, a former Utah bank regulator who has helped set up several industrial banks.
 Campaign Contributions
 The de facto headquarters for the industry's lobbyists is a small office building a few blocks from the Utah capitol, where Douglas S. Foxley and Frank R. Pignanelli are based. The partners, one a Democrat and the other a Republican, have tried to persuade skeptics in Washington that the industrial banks are part of the solution to the economic crisis, not a cause. 
 They have appealed to Utah's Congressional delegation, the home state delegations of the banks' parent companies, and Congressional and committee leaders. The banks' parent companies have made campaign contributions to some lawmakers.
 For example, G.E., which has a variety of issues before Congress having to do with its role as a defense contractor, manufacturer and financial powerhouse, made $500,000 in donations to legislators since January, including the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada; Senator Christopher Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, the chairman of the Senate Banking committee, and Senator Bob Bennett, Republican of Utah. 
 ''What it comes down to is a lot of blocking and tackling,'' said Mr. Foxley, the lobbyist. ''We have to stop this.''

HEADLINE: Cuomo Is Said to Issue Subpoenas in Merrill Case

BYLINE: By ZACHERY KOUWE

 BODY:
Capping a week of scrutiny for Bank of America, New York Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo took another swing on Wednesday at uncovering which of the bank's executives knew about large losses and bonus payouts at Merrill Lynch just before the two banks merged last year. 
 In an unusual move that could herald closer examination of corporate boards, Mr. Cuomo issued subpoenas to five current and former directors of the bank as part of his continuing inquiry into its hastily arranged takeover of Merrill, a person briefed on the investigation said. 
 A second person briefed on the inquiry said the directors who had received subpoenas included members of the firm's audit committee, which was responsible for reviewing significant legal matters, including the takeover of Merrill. 
 Both the individuals who had been briefed on the inquiry asked not to be identified because they had signed confidentiality agreements involving the matter.
 The subpoenaed board members include William Barnet III, a real estate executive and the mayor of Spartanburg, S.C.; John T. Collins, a venture capital investor based in Boston; Tommy R. Franks, the retired four-star Army general; Walter E. Massey, the former president of Morehouse College in Atlanta; and Thomas J. May, head of the Boston utility company NSTAR, this person said.
 Mr. Cuomo's office wants to know whether Bank of America's board knew of additional losses discovered at Merrill after the merger was signed, as well as billions of dollars in bonus payments made to Merrill executives before the deal closed. 
 Based on earlier interviews with the bank's executives, investigators believe the bank's audit committee and other directors might have known about losses and bonus payments before shareholders voted to approve the deal in early December, this person said.
 ''A big unanswered question as we look back on the financial crisis is -- where were the boards?'' Mr. Cuomo said in an e-mail message. ''Did the boards of directors of our largest financial institutions protect the rights of shareholders, were they misled, or were they little more than rubber stamps for management's decision-making?''
 The scrutiny comes as Bank of America, which has accepted $45 billion in government bailouts, faces mounting pressures over its merger with Merrill. 
 This week, Judge Jed S. Rakoff rejected a settlement that would have put an end to a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into possible securities violations by the bank in the Merrill deal. In his ruling, the judge criticized the S.E.C. for not holding individuals at Bank of America accountable. The ruling could pave the way for a public court battle between the bank and the S.E.C. early next year.
 It is rare for prosecutors to subpoena members of a company's board in a criminal case. Mr. Cuomo's action is an indication that board members may not be immune to charges in cases where executives they oversee are prosecuted, said Cornelius Hurley, a professor at the Boston University School of Law.
 ''I would be very concerned if I was a director of Bank of America,'' Mr. Hurley said.
 Mr. Cuomo's office plans to issue subpoenas to all 15 board members in the coming weeks, according to one of the people briefed on the investigation. 
 Investigators plan to ask the directors how much they knew about Merrill's losses, and what role they played in decisions about disclosing information to shareholders, the person said. 
 The attorney general also plans to ask board members about what pressure the government may have brought to bear on the bank's decision to disclose the bonuses and losses to shareholders, as well as whether government officials said they would remove management and the board if Bank of America didn't proceed with the deal.
 A Bank of America spokesman, Lawrence Di Rita, said the bank will continue to cooperate with Mr. Cuomo's office. ''There is no basis for charges against either the company or individual members of the management team.''

HEADLINE: An Investment Bet: Going Small and Green

BYLINE: By CYRUS SANATI

 BODY:
WHEN Jeffrey A. McDermott left the Swiss financial giant UBS two years ago, he was one of three co-heads of investment banking, overseeing deal makers across a range of industries.
 Now, Mr. McDermott, 50, leads Greentech Capital Advisors, a boutique investment bank he founded that is a fraction of UBS's size, specializes in clean technology and has one $16.3 million deal under its belt. 
 Yet Mr. McDermott said he was confident he had made the right decision to leave the world of bulge-bracket firms. 
 Greentech is among several new start-up investment banks filling the vacuum created by the collapse and contraction of many major financial firms. As the credit crisis engulfed Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and other major companies, many bankers found open arms at smaller shops.
 Unlike other boutiques, Greentech is trying to set itself apart by being the first to focus solely on alternative-energy and clean-technology companies. Mr. McDermott acknowledged that his strategy had potential pitfalls, given the green industry's reputation for modest booms and spectacular busts.
 ''We know we are early, and our greatest risk is being too early,'' he said. ''But we think it is ultimately going to be big.'' 
 Setting up a boutique investment bank wasn't Mr. McDermott's first choice after leaving UBS. He initially joined with Michael Heisley, the billionaire who controls the Memphis Grizzlies basketball team, to set up Stony Lane Partners, a private equity firm, to invest in distressed assets. But those plans were felled by the credit squeeze. 
 So Mr. McDermott began researching alternative energy last summer, handing blank sheets of paper to his contacts in the field and asking them what they would like to see in a green-focused advisory shop.
 By the end of the summer, Greentech had taken shape. And Mr. McDermott faced the task of persuading seasoned professionals to join his start-up, often walking away from the outsize bonuses and perquisites that come with working at a big institution. Then came the fall of Lehman Brothers, and as shockwaves reverberated throughout Wall Street, Mr. McDermott suddenly had a host of candidates with the experience and contacts his fledgling firm needed.
 An early pickup was Michael J. Molnar, a former alternative-energy and coal analyst for Goldman Sachs who was laid off in November. Mr. Molnar, 35, ranked in Goldman's top 5 percent of United States equity analysts in 2008, but he was let go, along with other equity analysts who had been covering companies in areas where business, and investor interest, were weak. 
 Other hires included R. Andrew de Pass, the founder and head of Citigroup's sustainable development investment group, which closed early this year.
 ''I worked for 20 years at two firms, Morgan Stanley and Citi,'' said Mr. de Pass, 43. ''At this point, I want to work somewhere that has a culture, ethics, less dysfunction and complication of a large financial institution, where I have more control of my destiny, working with good people.''
 Working at a start-up usually means a big change. Gone are the fancy corner offices: Greentech operates out of what is essentially one large room, where the firm's partners sit side by side with researchers and analysts.
 Gone, too, for now are the raft of multibillion-dollar deals -- and the big advisory fees. Companies in the ''green economy,'' which ranges from manufacturers of wind turbine blades to companies that develop smart-grid power technologies, are worth at most a few million dollars. A company in this field seeking merger advice or financing help would have a tough time getting larger investment banks to take notice.
 ''Goldman wouldn't return your call,'' said Timothy F. Vincent, 40, a partner at Greentech who worked most recently as a Goldman managing director.
 Adding to the challenge, the green industry is suffering. In the first quarter of 2009, new financial investment in the sustainable energy sector fell 53 percent, to $13.3 billion, from the comparable period in 2008, the lowest level of quarterly investment in three years, according to a report from the United Nations Environment Program and New Energy Finance, a research company.
 The drought in financing, along with a collapse in fossil-fuel prices -- which squeezed alternative-energy sources -- has put a lot of pressure on many green companies, forcing several players' stocks into tailspins and pushing a few into bankruptcy.
 So far, Greentech has sealed just one deal, the sale of Solar Integrated Technologies to Energy Conversion Devices. Last summer, Solar Integrated had a market value of $200 million;it sold for $16.3 million in June.
 But executives at Greentech are optimistic about their firm's future. Since late spring, they have had more than 350 meetings with potential clients and advised a number of clients on acquiring green companies. The firm also has a geothermal deal scheduled to close in October, Mr. McDermott said, and has signed engagement letters with two more companies in the smart-grid sector.
 One hope for Greentech is the Obama administration's commitment to clean energy. The industry recently received $31 billion in tax credits and other financial incentives, as well as $134 billion in loan guarantees for large green projects -- well above the $30 billion the industry attracted in North America last year. But tax credits can be withdrawn, potentially leaving the industry again at a disadvantage to fossil-fuel competitors.
 Greentech is betting that technology will eventually help make renewable energies competitive with fossil fuels. In the meantime, the firm is committed to staying lean and waiting for the day when business is expected to pick up.
 ''If at the end of two years we haven't been able to achieve revenue success, hey, you know, we were either wrong about the market opportunity or we stink,'' Mr. McDermott said. ''And I don't think either will be the case.''

HEADLINE: F.D.I.C. Sells Failed Bank's Troubled Mortgages to Private Investor

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Offering the lure of cheap government-guaranteed financing, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation moved on Wednesday to push its efforts to have private investors buy distressed mortgages from troubled banks.
 Agency officials announced that they had reached a deal to sell $1.3 billion in mortgages from Franklin Bank, a Houston-based lender that failed last November and was taken over by the F.D.I.C.
 It was the first deal reached under an Obama administration program announced this spring to help banks sell their problem loans, clean up their balance sheets and get credit flowing again. 
 But even though the F.D.I.C. is providing generous subsidies that could cost taxpayers heavily in the future, banks have generally refused to sell their troubled mortgages at the steeply discounted prices that bargain-hunting investors have demanded.
 The deal announced on Wednesday is an effort to break that logjam, but it does not involve a solvent bank selling its assets and might not offer enough taxpayer-financed sweeteners to bridge the gap between the prices banks want and the prices investors will pay.
 Under the deal, the F.D.I.C. will create a joint venture with Residential Credit Solutions of Fort Worth, a three-year-old company founded by Dennis Stowe, a veteran of the subprime mortgage industry.
 Residential Credit will put up $64 million of its own money to obtain a 50 percent stake in the venture, which will hold and manage the $1.3 billion pool of mortgages from Franklin Bank. 
 The F.D.I.C. will own the other 50 percent stake in exchange for providing the loans as well as the bulk of the financing. Instead of taking cash for the loans, the F.D.I.C. will accept a government-guaranteed note for $727.8 million with an interest rate of 4.25 percent.
 Agency officials said the deal meant that investors would be paying about 70 cents on the dollar for the loan portfolio, which is a higher price than hedge funds and other private investors have been willing to pay for troubled mortgages. 
 Had the government not provided Residential Credit with the ability to borrow most of the money it needed at low interest rates, agency officials said, the investors would have probably paid about 20 cents on the dollar less than they did. 
 Agency officials said the same kind of deal could be used to buy up troubled assets from banks that are still in business, which was the original purpose of the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program. Since that program was approved by Congress last October, it has propped up banks, insurance companies, Wall Street firms and even car companies. But it has not been used to buy any troubled assets.
 The main reason has been reluctance by both banks and investors, and some industry executives said they were still skeptical. Frank Pallotta, executive vice president of the Loan Value Group in Rumson, N.J., which provides analysis of mortgage values, said that many investors were worried about the strings attached to government-backed deals. One of the biggest strings is a requirement that the investors take part in the Obama administration's Home Affordable Modification Program, which subsidizes loan modifications for borrowers at risk of losing their houses to foreclosure.
 ''The more active loan buyers are really not looking at these pools of loans,'' said Mr. Pallotta. ''I don't think this sale is going to send investors off to the races.'' 
 Officials said about 30 percent of the loans in the deal on Wednesday were nonperforming, meaning that payments were not being made on them, but said that percentage could increase depending on how much the houses being financed had dropped in value. About one-quarter of all homes are now under water, meaning that the property's current market value is less than the mortgage. 
 Because homeowners have much less incentive to stay in houses that are under water, investors have become extremely dubious about mortgages in areas where housing prices have fallen sharply, even if most of the borrowers are still current on their payments.
 The Obama administration has been working for months on two separate programs under the rubric of public-private partnerships to mop up the immense volume of bad assets tied to the housing bubble. 
 The F.D.I.C. program is intended to spur the purchase of whole mortgages, for both residential and commercial real estate, which are weighing down banks and adding to the uncertainties about their viability. 
 But banks have been extremely reluctant to sell their mortgages at a discount to their original value, because they would have to book losses. 
 The government's other main public-private effort, run by the Treasury Department, is aimed at buying up mortgage-backed securities. Treasury officials have hired a half-dozen big money-management firms, which will raise $500 million in private capital each and then receive government financing to start working out deals. 
 That program has taken longer than expected to get off the ground, but Treasury officials expect the firms to start making deals in October.

HEADLINE: All Eyes Shift To Creativity

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY

 BODY:
THE mannequins were made of hollow translucent fiberglass. Imagine a light-up choirboy from a suburban Nativity scene. Ranked in rows along the broad stairs at the Prada store in SoHo, they resembled a Ziegfeld Follies tableau, said a shopper who happened to be there when the incident occurred. 
 Adjusting a detail on one of the scores of sequentially arrayed store dummies on Sunday afternoon, a Prada employee accidentally bumped it over. Then slowly, inevitably, one after another, in domino fashion, the mannequins all went down.
 ''It was boom, boom, boom, like gunshots,'' said the shopper, who like others in the store whipped out a cellphone to snap the scene before security personnel put a stop to any picture taking. 
 Guards raced around waving their arms and shouting, according to the witness, as customers blithely recorded an awkward moment that also carried unmistakable elements of metaphor. 
 Isn't the real story of Fashion Week image slippage? Isn't there a less glamorous reality hidden in plain sight? 
 Wasn't it there all along, barely concealed behind the perfected surfaces of the runway shows; the glossy Potemkin village parties (given by independent publications like Pop, Love, V, Purple and Another Magazine, the bills being sent to corporate sugar daddies who manufacture recession-proof goods like vodka and lipstick); the retailing wishful thinking of Fashion's Night Out?
 Yes, sales in clothing stores registered an increase of 2.4 percent last month over July, the largest gain since February. But they were still 5 percent below August 2008. The news was hardly cause to break out the Champagne.
 ''People talk like the recession started a year ago,'' said Tom Kalenderian, the men's fashion director of Barneys New York. 
 ''We've been seeing it since 2007,'' he added, beginning when the West Coast was hit hard by the sub-prime mortgage crash, and consumers decided to stuff whatever cash was left in their ''It'' bags into their mattresses. 
 The news this Fashion Week was not particularly good, Mr. Kalenderian said, and yet it was not all bad. Two years into the deepest recession in seven decades, there are signs that market Darwinism has had an unexpectedly positive effect on the business.
 Behind the hoopla and the rote frivolity of Fashion Week there has been another story, one about hunkering down and renewing focus on such unfashionable notions as customer service and value-for-dollars.
 There has also been an observable surge of such neglected commodities as creativity and true design. 
 ''As much as the recession has been terrible, it cleaned house a little bit,'' Cecilia Dean, the editor of Visionaire, said at the Rodarte show Tuesday.
 During boom times, she added, designers may have gotten lazy and lost sight of some fundamentals. 
 ''When there is a lot of money, there are also a lot of people giving their opinions and the designer gets lost,'' Ms. Dean said. ''Creativity blossoms when resources are limited.'' 
 The Rodarte show was one of many hopeful auguries this week, signs that New York fashion has already started to regenerate itself through improvisation, experiment, collaboration and the locally prized habit of taking risks. 
 Staged at the Gagosian Gallery in Chelsea, the show by the designers Kate and Laura Mulleavy brought together elite talents -- the producer Alexandre de Betak, the D. J. Michel Gaubert, the hairdresser Odile Gilbert -- whose collaboration with the two designing sisters from Pasadena, Calif., demonstrated the excited buzz that a creative gift will always inspire in a business that functions tribally. 
 There was stage smoke and glitter grit on the runway. There was a passel of top-shelf models who, in a spirit of making do, changed clothes in freight containers parked curbside on 21st Street. There was an aural backdrop of Romantic gloom to set off a captivating 12-minute spectacle of neo-Gothic rags suggestive of ''The Rainbow Goblins'' (a 1970s fairy tale the designers have cited as inspiration) on a tour of Hell.
 More than anything, though, there was persuasive evidence that fashion has a very real place on the cultural mainstage. At its best, it is always about more than clothes, as the men's wear designer Patrik Ervell asserted before his Monday presentation.
 Employing cloth dyed in salt water filled with iron filings, Mr. Ervell used rust to riff subtly on a theme of decay. 
 ''Fashion is part of the culture industry, part of the overall discourse,'' he said. ''Fashion that is just about merchandise always feels like a dead end.''
 It was pretty simple during flush times, ''when people were fat and happy,'' to purvey indifferent goods with fancy labels, said Robert Burke, a luxury retail consultant. The individuality and creativity vital to fashion, he added, got lost. ''This season, though, you can feel people banding together to get consumers interested in fashion, to make it fun again to go into stores.''
 Regardless of what Fashion's Night Out, the citywide promotion Sept. 10, did for retailers' spread sheets, there is no doubting that it provided city mice an excuse to shine up in their '80s glad rags and high-degree-of-difficulty platforms and, thus attired, to disport themselves. If Americans are to be inspired any time soon to extract their wallets in earnest, what will move them to do so is novelty and real design. The kind exhibited this week in the dot prints devised by the creative team of ThreeAsFour in collaboration with Yoko Ono; and in Mario Cornejo's rigorous ongoing explorations of the curve; and in the collection of Thakoon Panichgul, whose labor-intensive workmanship was the more impressive for having trumped the budgetary constraints facing every designer without a giant multinational to foot the bills. 
 For a while now, fashion industry insiders have been chanting a mantra that calls to mind Kay Thompson's oracular pronouncements in Stanley Donen's 1957 classic, ''Funny Face.'' 
 ''Banish the black,'' Thompson exhorted. ''Think pink!''
 The point holds even in contemporary translation: bewitch consumers with what they don't already own. 
 ''Everybody in the business realizes that you have to make an effort to bring up the quality and value, but most of all the design,'' Mr. Panichgul said. 
 No designer during New York Fashion Week approached the challenge of favoring ideas over merchandising with more madcap brio than Thom Browne did.
 ''If you're going to do something people want to see, you're going to have to take the risks,'' said Mr. Browne said after a show that was alternately praised and pilloried in the press and on the blogs. 
 It would surely require a man of gumption to leave the house clad in the stuff Mr. Browne sent out on his runway: neoprene mini-skorts, polka-dotted halter rompers, belled pants lopped off at midcalf, waste-basket hats inset with sunglasses, dropped crotch trousers inspired by a mermaid's tail. 
 That was Mr. Browne's point. ''I don't expect people to take it literally,'' he said. ''I feel very strongly that, particularly in regard to the economy, it is more important not to lose creativity and to show interesting ideas.'' 
 As is usually the case with runway fashion, Mr. Browne's outre ideas will be toned down and commercially adapted by the time the clothes reach stores. They will also, if the past is any indication, turn up as the sincerest form of flattery in other people's lines. 
 ''You really need to keep people inspired,'' the designer said. ''You have to make them see there is a future for fashion and that we are moving forward, not staying in one place.''

HEADLINE: The House Collectors

BYLINE: By SARAH MASLIN NIR

DATELINE: BELLVILLE, Tex. 

 BODY:
 IN a state this vast, people with the urge to collect don't have to settle for putting Depression glass on a shelf or hanging paintings on a wall. They can play out their obsessions big time.
 They can collect houses.
 Whenever she has a few hours on her hands, Taunia Elick crisscrosses the fields near her home here in her Lincoln Navigator S.U.V., looking for the antique wood-frame country houses that she covets.
 Mrs. Elick has acquired 23 houses in the last three decades. Some she fixed up and sold. But in the mid-'90s, Mrs. Elick went from home flipper to home collector. She now has 18 houses for herself, a number of which she's picked up and moved to the nearly 10,000 acres she owns here with her husband, John. 
 Although the houses cost relatively little, or are even free if they come without land, she spends hundreds of thousands of dollars fixing them up and decorating them in period style. If the buildings are cheap enough, she'll buy them in almost any condition. 
 One of her recent purchases, for $3,000, was the Knolle-Ripple House, an early 19th century building she bought from the owner of the pasture where it has sat abandoned, slowly rotting and being reclaimed by vines and scrub brush. She plans to move it to Lonesome Pine Ranch -- one of three ranches she owns with her husband near this town an hour and a half from Houston. 
 House collecting is not uncommon in this part of Texas. John Kana, a house mover who has worked for Mrs. Elick, said he moved 50 houses a year and had four competitors in just a 30-mile radius. 
 The geography helps. The land is flat and generally treeless, with straight roads that make house moving relatively simple. ''Sometimes it's easier to go 10 miles out in the country, than 4 or 5 blocks in town,'' Mr. Kana said. 
 It is not a cheap habit. The Elicks are lawyers with a practice in this town, but even they have needed to make her hobby pay for itself by renting out their properties through a bed and breakfast called Texas Ranch Life. She charges her visitors, ranging from groups doing couples therapy to cadres of swashbuckling European bankers playing cowboy for the weekend, up to several hundred dollars a night depending on the home's size.
 Still, Mrs. Elick said, July's air-conditioning bill was sky-high, so she has pledged to be more vigilant about keeping an eye on the thermostat. 
 Mrs. Elick, who specializes in asbestos litigation, practices law with her husband, who is a generalist, from a log cabin in this tiny town next to an old filling station that Mr. Elick's father left to the couple, and a tiny yellow 1800's German wood-frame house that the Elicks had moved there. Their law offices are a half-block from a crumbling one-and-a-half-story porticoed white building, which she had just signed papers to buy. She is buying the land, too, and plans to leave the house where it is so that she and her husband can take their afternoon naps there, she said. 
 When Mr. and Mrs. Elick aren't practicing law, they're pursuing their separate passions. Mr. Elick, a former competitive bronco rider who accessorizes his suit jacket and tie with Wrangler jeans, spurs and a cowboy hat in the courtroom, trains more than 40 horses for Western riding competitions. He also uses them to push his hundreds of cattle, hybrid Texas Longhorn and Charolais, from spent grazing ground to fresh pasture.
 The Elicks live between modernity and the past. Their own home is new, but modeled after an nearby antique house called a ''Texas dogtrot,'' a classic symmetrical style where rooms wing out from a wide breezeway. 
 The glossy interior is studded with modern appliances and an imposing flat-screen television, but Mr. Elick mostly uses it to study rodeo competitions and horse training tutorials. ''The past is still the present, just like the old houses,'' Mr. Elick said. While growing up, Mrs. Elick remembers her parents' constant talk of the ''dream house'' her family would one day build. At 12, she would spend her allowance on home design books and use her free time drafting versions of what the house might look like. When she was 16, the family finally moved into the dream house, and, she said, it drove them apart. ''I remember fights that my parents would have over cabinet knobs,'' she said. ''It got to be obsessive.'' Her parents divorced shortly after.
 That contributed to her dislike of the American tendency to build big, new, expensive homes. ''It's putting too much emphasis on new and 'better,' than on the experiences they have inside,'' she said.
 The house collection started in 1995 when the Elicks built a $25,000 artificial fishing lake in the crook of two small knolls at their Lonesome Pine ranch. They were so enthralled with its beauty that they wanted a house near the water's edge, a summer home in their backyard, so to speak. Tony Gerhardt, 85, an interior decorator they'd worked with on their home, suggested they ship in an antique home. He found them ''the Lakehouse'' for $4,500, Mrs. Elick said. 
 Like almost all her houses, the Lakehouse is painted in five colors traditionally used by the area's early German settlers: yellow ocher, rust, brown, gray and deep cerulean. It had faded stencils of abstract wildflowers bordering the ceilings that were still visible even when the house was dilapidated. Mr. Gerhardt designed contemporary riffs on these, sometimes by photocopying leaves scattered on paper. His designs now dot the walls in some houses and add whimsical flourishes to floorboard planks.
 ''A lot of people think that the settlers to Texas had it really rough -- and they did -- but they still liked having nice things, they wanted pretty things,'' she said. ''They wanted to keep the ties back to the home, and they did that through their decoration.''
 The furniture in all but one of the refashioned houses is in a rough-hewn style Mrs. Elick calls ''early Texas.'' She has pulled it from a variety of places -- a file cabinet and desk in the Lakehouse once sat in her father's law office, and a handcrafted wooden icebox was purchased for $5 from a log cabin Mr. Elick once visited. 
 Around the time Mrs. Elick moved the Lakehouse, her father and stepmother were killed in a plane crash. Her relationship with her decorator, Mr. Gerhardt, and their projects became a way to fill a void left by her father's death, she said. (Mr. Gerhardt, whom she describes as lovably cantankerous, did not want to discuss the projects.)
 Her father's focus on work also prompted her to broaden her own interests. ''My dad was a workaholic, he hardly had any hobbies at all,'' she said, ''So when he died I saw everything he had worked for just almost go up in smoke.'' The houses for her are a way to escape that. ''If you leave some sort of physical legacy like a house that you preserve,'' she said, you're leaving behind something more, ''maybe a little bit self worth.''
 There are other house collections with a preservationist bent in this snippet of Texas. One is in the nearby town of Round Top (a sign says the population is 77) where the Texas Pioneer Arts Foundation operates a museum of nearly a dozen antique houses, most of which were moved there.
 Because most of the people who sell or give their houses to Mrs. Elick just want them taken off their property so they can build new ones, the real cost is in moving and restoration. 
 The Lodge, a two-story home to which she has added a cavernous entertaining space hung with a chandelier made of antlers and presided over by an enormous steer's head, cost her $1,000, she said. The most expensive housewas $10,000; three of them were free. 
 But moving them gets pricey. Larger houses had to be sliced in two and each side carted separately. Branches that overhang the route that the house will take must be pruned. But the largest expense comes from the telephone and electrical wires over the road that must be lifted by their respective utility companies to give the house clearance to pass. It has cost Mrs. Elick from $2,000 to $17,000 to move a house. 
 Then there's the work of restoring the buildings, which are sometimes in desperate shape. On a recent trip to study her new purchase, the Knolle-Ripple House, Mrs. Elick told a reporter as she clambered out of her S.U.V., ''just be sure you don't get skunked or snaked.'' 
 The house was tucked under a dense thatch of trees and creepers amid acres of grass. Inside, skunks and snakes turned out to be the least of her worries. Shoes, rusted wire, a pile of sun-bleached dresses that looked to be from the 1940s, old liquor bottles and bales of hay covered the floor.
 Mrs. Elick seemed only to notice the delicate stencils ringing the moldings, the brush strokes in the painted doors hanging off their hinges, and the quality of the house's wood planks -- longleaf pine, which is difficult to find. Some people rip it out of old houses to use in new ones, which seems silly to her. ''I just reclaim the house,'' she said. 
 Rebuilding, furnishing, plumbing, heating, electrifying and decorating the houses has cost her up to $250,000 per house, she said. Then there's the issue of property tax. ''I'll take a house that I paid $2,000 for and by the time I am finished with it the tax man is already taxing it at $125,000,'' she said. ''It's kind of like shooting yourself in the foot a little bit.''
 Mrs. Elick is endlessly acquisitive. As she drives through the countryside she searches fields for hidden run-down houses, turns onto winding dirt roads to see if a house she had her eye on is still vacant, and checks property records and lumberyard gossip for her next house. And there's always a next house.
 The profit from the bed and breakfast was intended primarily to go toward financing her hobby, said Mrs. Elick. Only recently, she said, with the pinch of the recession combined with the expense of educating their three daughters -- Lacey, 21, and Ashlyn, 19, who attend the University of Texas and Laramy, 24, who studies law at Southern Methodist University -- have the ranch's proceeds gone mostly to paying the family's bills.
 Mr. Elick said he didn't want more houses, a fact that seemed well known in town. At Greenjeans Produce Market in Bellville, when a reporter mentioned Mrs. Elick's hobby, the proprietors, Gary and Mary Morris, laughed knowingly. Mr. Elick, said Mr. Morris, told him he had been doing his best to make his wife cease and desist. 
 But she buys them anyway with her own funds, and has waited up to two years to tell him about a purchase. He always seems to come around.
 ''It's kind of like you have two babies and that's really enough and you might not want another one,'' Mr. Elick said. ''But then the good Lord gives you another and you love them just as much as when there was two, and you think, 'I don't know what I did without them.' The houses are not exactly that way, but I like all of them now that I've got them.''

HEADLINE: An Art Park Sprouts (for Now) Where New Buildings Were to Grow

BYLINE: By ERIC KONIGSBERG

 BODY:
On Friday morning, in what might be seen as evidence that tough economic times can be good for art, a new 37,000-square-foot outdoor exhibition and performance space will open in Lower Manhattan. 
 Occupying an irregularly shaped city block at the northwest corner of Canal and Sullivan Streets, it will be both a park and a showcase for established and newer artists, open from 7 a.m. till dusk daily, except in January, February and part of March. Appropriately -- given that the lot is on loan for about three years from developers who had hoped to build there by now -- the project will be called LentSpace. 
 Maggie Boepple, the president of the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, which is running the project, said that it had been in the works since early 2008, but that recent troubles in the real estate market undoubtedly contributed to ''the generous length of time'' of the loan. 
 The land is owned by Trinity Church on Wall Street, whose development company, Trinity Real Estate, cleared it of several old buildings a few years ago. Carl Weisbrod, the company's president, said that when he realized that ''the market was not yet ready for a new development here,'' he contacted Ms. Boepple to offer use of the lot to the council, which is best known for its efforts to revitalize the arts downtown after 9/11. 
 In addition to the public spiritedness of the gesture -- and to the tax write-off it earned the company -- Mr. Weisbrod said Trinity was interested in cultivating the goodwill of the neighborhood, where most of its property is located. (The site is one of several near the Holland Tunnel that the church has owned since 1705, when Queen Anne gave it about 300 acres of farmland along the west side of Manhattan.)
 For the last year, with the site shielded from view by a chain-link fence lined with black plastic tarps, workers have been transforming it into a meticulously designed, if rough-hewn, outdoor museum.
 Because of a tight budget -- Ms. Boepple said she raised about $1 million -- and the space's temporary status, the architects, Interboro Partners of Brooklyn, used inexpensive materials with an impermanent and somewhat industrial feel. The ground was covered in gravel, and benches and planters -- holding flowering plants, desert grasses and trees donated by the Parks Department -- were built from waterproof plywood.
 The architects used the planters and benches to create zones for the park and paths that would steer people crossing it into contact with the artworks.
 ''There's a lot of very strict formalism in the park if you want to look for it,'' said Adam G. Kleinman, the curator for the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council who will be programming exhibitions and performances in the park. 
 The eastern edge of the space -- abutting a pedestrian stretch of Sullivan Street and a small wedge of park known as Juan Pablo Duarte Square -- is bordered by a 215-foot fence made up of independently rotating, eight-foot-wide plywood panels. The panels' exterior sides are covered with hundreds of small silver and blue aluminum disks, which make the wall glint in the sun like a mirage.
 ''They use them on oil derricks so that people can see them shine from miles away,'' Mr. Kleinman explained, adding that the disks were the idea of Thumb, a graphic design company in Brooklyn. Every three months or so, a different design firm will be commissioned to come up with a project for the fence. (The fence's blue and silver pattern isn't random: if you look at it from the right angle, you see that the blue panels are the doors that align with the four main paths through the park.) 
 Mr. Kleinman will commission three rotating series of artworks: in addition to the fence project, there is also a print series, to be distributed in limited-edition newspapers inside the park and, most notably, a series of installations and sculptures.
 The seven sculptural pieces in the inaugural lineup all, in one form or another, incorporate visual puns playing on the conventions of city park design or on the idea of what deserves to be classified as public art.
 A small piece by Olga Chernysheva (four models of fences with holes torn in them) is encased in plexiglass and mounted on a plywood column built onto a plywood plinth. Anybody who wants to get a good look at the piece must climb onto the plinth, ''so that you're on display, like a statue you see in a typical park monument,'' Mr. Kleinman said.
 Other works, by Corban Walker, Ryan Taber, the brothers Oscar Tuazon and Eli Hansen, and Graham Hudson, make use of flagpoles, ladders, climbing wall holds, concrete, steel channels and a fluorescent light bulb. 
 A piece by Tobias Putrih began as a critique of the unsightly chain-link fence that still surrounds the park. ''The management company insisted that the fence was there to stay because it's private land,'' Mr. Putrih said. ''But what does it mean to have a fence around public art?'' 
 His work, ''Canal/Varick,'' consists of seven lengths of chain-link fence running parallel to the official one. ''It blurs the line -- the existing fence becomes part of the artwork,'' he said. ''I decided to work with it.''

HEADLINE: Buying Shares in Private Start-Ups

BYLINE: By ZACHERY KOUWE

 BODY:
RANJIT MATHODA is a 36-year-old California lawyer who runs a blog, paints, writes poetry, reads a book a day and dabbles in ''designing clever things that may not change the world,'' according to his Web site. 
 One of those ''clever things'' is a $5 million fund that Mr. Mathoda and four friends are raising from outside investors to buy stakes in Facebook from employees of the social-networking juggernaut. 
 Mr. Mathoda's new company, the Ocyle Group, is among a handful of investment managers that have popped up to buy shares in privately held start-ups like Glam Media, LinkedIn and Twitter. 
 While these funds are small compared with Silicon Valley's giant venture capital firms, they are attracting millions of dollars from investors with a high net worth. 
 ''Fund-raising is exceeding our expectations, and we are looking forward to closing the round shortly,'' Mr. Mathoda said, adding that Ocyle might raise additional money to buy stakes in other popular start-ups. (It has not yet bought any shares of Facebook.)
 ''Newfound access to stock in exciting venture-backed companies like Facebook is creating an entirely new class of investors,'' said Barry E. Silbert, the founder of SecondMarket, which operates an online marketplace for trading shares in private companies. SecondMarket says it has already brokered $30 million worth of transactions between buyers and sellers of Facebook shares.
 In some ways, the financial crisis drew interest in these types of funds. During the crisis, the market for initial public offerings dried up, denying company founders and venture capital firms one of their main ways to cash out. Many employees of start-ups have substantial parts of their net worth tied up in company stock, and some want or need to cash out.
 The idea for Ocyle came after several Facebook employees reached out to Mr. Mathoda and his partners, all of whom use Facebook, and expressed interest in selling some of their shares.
 Ocyle's other partners include a real estate lawyer who tweets about Krispy Kreme Doughnuts and the Killers, a rock band; former employees of Bain & Company and Deloitte Consulting; and a hedge fund lawyer. 
 Though the firm is based in California, Ocyle's partners decided to incorporate in Reno, Nev., in a small office near a Best Bet Motor Lodge, to contain administrative costs. Mr. Mathoda said the group chose Nevada because of its friendly climate for small limited liability companies and because several partners already did business there.
 Ocyle is seeking at least $50,000 from each investor and will claim 2 percent of assets under management and 20 percent of profits as fees, once Facebook stages an initial public offering or sells itself. 
 In July, Digital Sky Technologies, an Internet holding company with significant investments in Russian and Eastern European companies, bought $100 million worth of Facebook shares from employees. The transaction valued the social networking site at $6.5 billion.

HEADLINE: Biotech Tries to Shrug Off Setbacks

BYLINE: By JAMES FLANIGAN

 BODY:
FROM one perspective, the life sciences industry -- the biotechnology companies that develop drugs and treatments to combat disease and the biomedical firms that create medical devices -- is a picture of expanding horizons and confidence.
 Young companies are taking advantage of advances in medical and computing sciences to develop new ways of dealing with intractable health problems. 
 One new company has developed a disposable device with software that would help surgeons to perform knee replacements with greater accuracy. Another has a microscopic device implantable in the eye that would continuously release medicines to alleviate glaucoma or macular degeneration. 
 Other companies have developed potential vaccines against staphylococcus infections and drugs to preserve cardiac function after a heart attack. Indeed, the biotech industry is spreading globally to India and China, where capital is abundant and research is increasing. 
 But even as the industry seems to be making progress, its biggest benefactors are pulling back. The traditional providers of venture capital in the United States are university endowments and pension funds, whose assets have been reduced sharply over the last year in the collapse of financial markets. 
 Even a successful investor in the life sciences industry sees danger now. Domain Associates, a company based in Princeton, N.J., and San Diego, raised $500 million for a new venture fund in August. It is the eighth such fund Domain has started in 24 years, and in that time, it has backed more than 200 life sciences companies. But few other venture funds were able to raise money, said James C. Blair, a Domain partner. 
 The people investing ''in our area are hurting, and this will have long-term implications for venture capital in general,'' he said. Without new communities of capital, he said, ''we worry about where we will find other investors to participate in our best opportunities in two to three years.'' 
 He is not alone in worrying. The PricewaterhouseCoopers MoneyTree survey of venture capital recently reported a surge in financing for life sciences in the second quarter of this year. Yet the firm also reported that venture fund assets were down to levels of the mid-1990s, before the last decade's financial expansion. 
 The Southern California Biomedical Council, an organization of 240 companies in life sciences in the Los Angeles area, has set ''ways to cope with the current drought of capital'' as the agenda for its annual investors conference starting Thursday. So is the outlook bright or gloomy? Most companies, even those that have had difficulties, say it is still bright. ''We're seeing the coming together of information technology and medical science,'' said Sharon Stevenson, a co-founder of Okapi Venture Capital, a three-year-old company in Laguna Beach, Calif. 
 Okapi this year backed OrthAlign Inc., a company founded in 2008 that is awaiting approval from the Food and Drug Administration for a palm-size disposable device that attaches to instruments used in knee replacements to help surgeons do more precise cutting of the bone to improve the fit with the joint replacement. 
 ''There are about 550,000 knee replacements every year in the United States, and that is expected to grow to 3.5 million by 2025,'' said Pieter Wolters, president of OrthAlign. More people, he said, want an active lifestyle into late age and ''technology allows longer lasting function of knee replacements.'' OrthAlign has received $7.2 million in venture financing from Research Corporation Technologies of Tucson and Okapi Venture Capital. 
 Replenish Inc. of Pasadena, Calif., was founded in 2007 on technology developed at the Keck School of Medicine and Viterbi School of Engineering at the University of Southern California as well as the California Institute of Technology. Replenish plans to enter trials for F.D.A. approval next year for a refillable and programmable pump that would be implanted in the eye to feed medicine for glaucoma or for age-related macular degeneration. 
 The Replenish device can last more than five years before replacement, much longer than current treatments, said Dr. Sean Caffey, chief executive of the company. Replenish is backed by a $10 million investment from a large pharmaceutical company, Dr. Caffey said, and the Stevens Institute for Innovation at the University of Southern California and Caltech have acquired small equity ownerships for their licenses. 
 In 2005, six scientists from the University of California, Los Angeles, who were working at LA BioMed, a nonprofit research institute, founded NovaDigm Therapeutics. There, they have developed a vaccine that could prevent infections acquired in hospitals, including candida and staph infections, said Fred Haney, a venture capital investor and chairman of NovaDigm. 
 The company will begin its initial clinical trials for F.D.A. approval next year. It is backed by $18 million in venture investments from Domain Associates and has received grants from the National Institutes of Health and the United States Army to support its research. 
 Clinical trials extend over three phases and can take years, making investments in life science companies prohibitively long term. ''But, in reality it is not so long,'' Mr. Haney said. ''If we can demonstrate safety and strong immune responses in phase one or two, we could then enter a partnership or merger with a large pharmaceutical company and obtain long-term financing.''
 In a possible sign of major things to come, the Zensun Science & Technology Company, based in Shanghai, has raised $30 million to perfect a treatment to strengthen cardiac structure after a heart attack. Zensun is backed by Morningside Investments of Hong Kong and the Shanghai city government, said Jack Z. Chen, chairman of the Transworld Capital Group, a consulting firm based in Arcadia Calif., with offices in Beijing and Shanghai. 
 Zensun was founded in 2000 by Dr. Mingdong Zhou, who earned a doctorate at the State University of New York, and Dr. Xifu Liu, whose doctorate is from the Genetics Institute at the China Academy of Sciences. Its heart treatment is now in phase two F.D.A. trials, which measure effectiveness. 
 Such trials are demanding and sometimes treatments do not win approval. The Orqis Medical Corporation spent nine years perfecting a system of increasing blood flow to help damaged hearts but did not receive F.D.A. approval. So backers decided last year not to invest fresh capital. The company is for sale to any firm that would continue development and try again for F.D.A. approval. 
 The president of Orqis, Kenneth Charhut, said he regretted the setback but remained positive about the industry outlook. ''Given advances in technology and growing needs of aging populations,'' he said, ''this is a time to invest in life sciences.''

HEADLINE: Energy Costs Push U.S. Consumer Prices Higher

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
The rising cost of gasoline pushed overall consumer prices higher in August even as prices for most other goods and services remained in check, the government reported on Wednesday.
 The Labor Department's Consumer Price Index rose 0.4 percent last month after hovering unchanged in July, a sign that inflation was gradually edging back into the economy, though not nearly as fast as some investors have predicted. Prices for housing, food and recreation were up slightly, and prices for new cars and clothing fell from a month earlier.
 Prices of all other items except food and energy -- the so-called core rate of inflation -- rose only 0.1 percent in August, suggesting that most costs of living were not following the upward arc of oil and gasoline prices. 
 Over all, core prices were 1.4 percent higher than last August. Health care costs, now the focus of intense debate in Washington, rose for another month, and are among the few areas of consumer spending that did not dip even for one month as the economy tumbled into recession. Medical costs crept up by a seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent in August, and were 3.3 percent higher than a year earlier.
 Energy prices rose 4.6 percent last month, even though they were nearly one-fourth lower than the same period a year ago, when oil prices began to tumble from their record highs of around $145 a barrel. 
 Some investors are making big bets that heavy government spending and a nascent rebound in the economy will touch off another round of inflation, pushing commodity prices sharply higher and further eroding the value of the dollar. These inflation hawks have helped push the price of gold above $1,000 recently, and they point to rising oil and commodities prices as a harbinger.
 Economists said consumer prices would have risen further in August if not for a 1.3 percent decline in prices of new vehicles, which occurred because of rebates from the government's cash-for-clunkers program. The drop in new-car prices was partly offset by a 1.9 percent rise in used car and truck prices.
 The Federal Reserve still expects inflation to remain in check this year as the United States climbs out of a deep recession. Unemployment is still high, consumer demand for credit and goods and services is still subdued, and there is enormous slack in the economy.
 But slowly, that excess is fading. The Federal Reserve noted on Wednesday that mines, utilities and manufacturing businesses ran slightly closer to capacity in August. That bolstered hopes that new orders and an upswing in business were prompting factories to speed up their assembly lines, add shifts and increase output. The percentage of capacity used rose to 69.6 last month, from 69 percent in July.
 And industrial output increased for a second month, rising 0.8 percent after an increase of 1 percent in July. Production of consumer goods, business equipment and materials rose. If prices keep rising as the economy gets back on its feet, the Fed could face increasing pressure to raise interest rates as a check on inflation -- a tricky decision for policy makers struggling not to derail any fragile recovery.
 ''Providing low interest rates to the economy is like spiking the punch at a party,'' said Michael R. Englund, chief economist at Action Economics. ''There tends not to be a move to unspike the punch.''
 In another report on Wednesday, the Commerce Department said that the deficit in the current account, the broadest measure of foreign trade, dropped to $98.8 billion in the second quarter. The amount represented 2.8 percent of the total economy as measured by the gross domestic product.

HEADLINE: Barclays Sells $12.3 Billion of Illiquid Assets

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Barclays, the British banking giant, said Wednesday that it had sold $12.3 billion of illiquid assets to a fund set up by former executives of the bank to reduce its vulnerability to swings in the credit markets. 
 The sale to Protium Finance, a fund run by two former employees, Stephen King and Michael Keeley, is being financed by a $12.6 billion loan from Barclays and $450 million mainly from two unidentified investors in Britain and the United States. Mr. King once led Barclays' principal mortgage trading group, and Mr. Keeley was a member of Barclays Capital's management committee.
 Barclays said in a statement that the sale did not remove the assets, which include $8.2 billion of debt insured by monolines and $1.8 billion in residential mortgage assets, from its balance sheet, but would generate more stable returns in the form of interest paid on the loan. Shares of Barclays rose 3 percent in London Wednesday.
 ''This represents a good opportunity to create greater predictability of income and economic capital utilization,'' the bank's chief financial officer, Chris Lucas, said. ''It's part of our ongoing process to manage and reduce risk.''
 Banks had been seeking ways to sell toxic assets. But a lack of buyers has forced many to hold on to illiquid assets like securities backed by residential mortgages that continue to weigh on balance sheets at a time when regulators are asking banks to set aside a bigger capital cushion.
 Simon Maughan, an analyst at MF Global Securities in London called the Barclays deal a ''cosmetic accounting shift'' and said that it ''is Barclays' way of holding these assets.'' The hope is ''out of sight out of mind,'' he said, adding that ''it does significantly reduce their direct monoline exposure, which they always considered a huge discount to their stock price.''
 Under the deal, Barclays will not book a gain or loss from the sale. The bank would help finance the purchase with a 10-year loan that is expected to generate $3.9 billion in interest over the life of the loan and would be repaid by income from the assets. 
 Protium would use the cash from the assets to first pay $40 million in management fees to the fund's owners and a 7 percent interest a year to the fund's investors. Then, it would repay Barclays. 
 Mr. Lucas said the deal meant Barclays would still have to take an impairment charge should the fund fail, but it allows the bank to benefit from any increase of the assets' value and a more stable income stream until then. He said the bank and its former executives had discussed the arrangement ''for a few months'' before Barclays ''became convinced that the value is in the cash flow rather than the fair value'' of the assets. The cash flow of the assets is about $120 million a month, he said.
 Protium was set up mainly to acquire and manage the Barclays assets and is run by Mr. King and Mr. Keeley's asset management firm, C12 Capital Management. C12 is made up of 45 former Barclays employees and is ''completely independent'' of Barclays, with neither the bank nor any current Barclays employees among the fund's investors, the bank said.

HEADLINE: Executives Inject Real-World Knowledge Into Classrooms

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

DATELINE: BETHLEHEM, Pa. 

 BODY:
 MIDWAY through one of his undergraduate seminars on mergers and acquisitions at Lehigh's business school, John R. Chrin reached a topic he knew intimately. 
 As his students dissected the case study, ''Investment Banking in 2008: A Brave New World,'' Mr. Chrin couldn't help adding his personal twist to the discussion of Bear Stearns's collapse.
 ''I remember sitting there with the finance chief and the C.E.O., Alan Schwartz,'' he said. ''They could not open for business on that Monday. That's why the government was so hopeful for someone to do a deal.''
 Last year, Mr. Chrin was a senior investment banker at JPMorgan Chase, advising his boss, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive, on the daring takeover of Bear. Today, he has the ear of 25 deal-makers in training in Finance 372, an hourlong course each Thursday that mixes the basics of mergers and acquisitions with war stories from the financial crisis. 
 ''It's an opportunity to recharge, give back and bring a little bit of what I have learned,'' said Mr. Chrin, perhaps the only Lehigh professor who bounds into class wearing a bespoke navy blue pinstriped suit. 
 It is also a lot of work, he said, comparing the class to preparing for a board meeting with 25 directors.
 Mr. Chrin, Lehigh's global financial services executive in residence, is one of a handful of top deal-makers who have recently traded the boardroom for the classroom: Gregory Fleming, Merrill Lynch's former president, is co-teaching a course on the causes of the financial crisis at his alma mater, Yale Law School; Thomas Russo, Lehman Brothers' former chief legal officer, taught a class on crisis decision-making at Columbia Business School. 
 Others are accepting ivory tower posts. Edward C. Forst, a senior Goldman Sachs executive, took a top administration job at Harvard for a year before returning to the Wall Street firm. And Frank Yeary, Citigroup's former global head of mergers and acquisitions, is now a vice chancellor at the University of California, Berkeley.
 Universities have long brought in business leaders to inject real-world know-how into their lesson plans. But they have redoubled that effort amid the fallout from the financial crisis.
 At the Wharton School, students and professors arranged a series of ''24-hour teach-ins'' over the last year, and during the spring semester brought Wall Street alumni to campus each week for a class on the crisis. Dartmouth's business school this fall introduced a 14-person economics seminar on crisis economics, co-taught with Michael G. Stockman, a former Wall Street risk manager. 
 Meanwhile, business school deans are trying harder to reach out to corporate leaders and alumni to give their students a hand in one of the toughest job markets for Wall Street in years by broadening their network of contacts. Faculty members are relying on practitioners to keep their research current on fast-moving policy topics, like financial regulatory reform, and bring business case studies to life.
 Jeffrey Garten, the former dean of the School of Management at Yale, said that bringing in more experts from business and government was crucial to helping financial leaders of the future avoid past mistakes.
 ''There is a crying need for more understanding,'' he said.
 That is one reason why Mr. Chrin, who graduated from Lehigh with an engineering degree in 1985, came back to campus as a teaching fellow this fall.
 In January, the dean of Lehigh's business school, Paul R. Brown, contacted Mr. Chrin and other alumni on Wall Street. He wanted to identify executives willing to come to Lehigh for a semester to discuss the crisis and help students with their job hunt. Six weeks later, Mr. Chrin offered to come.
 ''A student can read about it,'' Mr. Brown said in an interview. ''John can bring a historical perspective of being in the trenches.''
 Mr. Chrin, 46, had been contemplating a midcareer break after advising on several shotgun bank mergers last year, including Wells Fargo's takeover of Wachovia. He committed to teaching at Lehigh for the 2009-10 academic year.
 Two days a week, Mr. Chrin returns to campus to lead an introductory business course for freshmen and a deal-making seminar for seniors that he planned. The seminar draws heavily from his 21 years as an investment banker, where he rose to co-head of mergers and acquisitions in the financial institutions group at J. P. Morgan.
 Over the summer, Mr. Chrin canvassed former colleagues and clients for ideas on case studies and topics for the course. Finance 372 is that rare class where the reading list includes the annual M.&A. bible from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, the law firm involved in many heavyweight deals.
 Last week, Mr. Chrin guided his students through a whipsaw tour of recently announced deals, using Walt Disney's takeover of Marvel Entertainment as the basis of a discussion on whether to run a sales auction or work with a sole bidder. 
 When the discussion shifts to events he has lived through, Mr. Chrin intersperses concepts like moral hazard with his own financial insights.
 ''What was the ultimate catalyst?'' he asked the class. ''It's Banking 101 -- you don't take long-term assets and fund them with short-term debt.''
 It is Mr. Chrin's hope that students will eventually navigate a proxy statement with ease and walk away with a better grasp of investment banking. For one of their final grades, students will have the option of analyzing major issues in the Bear Stearns sale. ''If they want to do that one, that's fine,'' he said. ''I have a little more experience on that.'' 
 Of course, life inside academia is instructive, too. Mr. Chrin said his time on campus had made him ''way more empathetic to how people can get really angry with the outright levels of pay'' on Wall Street. He would not discuss his salary other than to acknowledge that he had taken a substantial pay cut. 
 Next semester, Mr. Chrin said he would also teach a freshman course on business ethics and may assist with faculty research. He may even stay at Lehigh for another year or two.
 In the meantime, Mr. Chrin has told students that he will be as available to them as he once was to top banking clients. He did not announce regular office hours on the first day of class. Instead, he handed out his phone number.
 ''I'm a banker, so feel free to call me,'' Josefa Palma, one of Mr. Chrin's students, said he told the class. ''I'll always have my cellphone.''

HEADLINE: The Green Zone Takes Fire for a Second Day During Biden's Visit to Baghdad

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS; Riyadh Mohammed contributed reporting from Baghdad, and Marc Santora from Camp Bucca.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD 

 BODY:
Baghdad's heavily fortified international zone was attacked by rocket fire for a second night on Wednesday, this time just after Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki had made brief public remarks and sat down for a traditional dinner to break the Ramadan fast.
 One rocket landed on the edge of the American Embassy compound, about a mile from the building where the two leaders met, wounding several people at a security company, according to the Interior Ministry. 
 A second landed on the opposite side of the Tigris River near the Babylon Hotel, a towering landmark in the cityscape, killing one and wounding two, a ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity under the ministry's rules.
 The attacks punctuated Mr. Biden's second day in Iraq, one devoted to meetings with many of the country's political leaders, all of whom live and work in the fortified area known as the Green Zone. Not long after his arrival on Tuesday, similar attacks killed two and wounded five.
 Neither Mr. Biden nor Mr. Maliki directly addressed the attacks, focusing their remarks on pledges of cooperation on issues ranging from security to investment in Iraq's oil-rich but still weak economy. 
 ''The enemies of national unity in Iraq are ready to murder innocent civilians as they intend to reignite sectarian conflict,'' Mr. Biden said, expressing President Obama's condolences to the victims of two huge suicide bombings on Aug. 19 that struck two government ministries in Baghdad and killed at least 132 people. 
 ''We are confident -- we are confident -- the terrorists will fail,'' he added.
 Early on Wednesday the American military announced that American and Iraqi forces had raided a house and, after a gun battle, arrested three men suspected of carrying out the attacks the night before. Later in the day, however, a subsequent statement said the men had been released for lack of evidence.
 An insurgent group known as the Mujahedeen Army claimed responsibility for Tuesday night's attack, according to the Site Intelligence Group, an organization based in Bethesda, Md., that researches international militant extremist organizations. The statement, which included racist and anti-Semitic references to Mr. Biden and President Obama, said the attack was a message ''to saddle for your departure and pull out from our country as God will not let us down as long as we fight you to uphold his word.''
 Mr. Biden and Mr. Maliki, in their remarks, referred only obliquely to one of the main goals of the vice president's trip: pressing Iraq's fractured political leadership to move ahead with political reconciliation before parliamentary elections in January. Neither took questions, but the stalemate in legislation and other political agreements ahead of the elections has worried American officials. 
 ''I think the threat is that the political process will not give the country sufficient cohesion to work on its economic issues and otherwise become a strong and stable factor in the region,'' the American ambassador, Christopher R. Hill, told reporters Tuesday night.
 Also on Wednesday, the American military announced that the last 180 Iraqi prisoners in Camp Bucca, once the largest prison in Iraq, were being transferred to other prisons in Baghdad. It was another milestone in the gradually diminishing American military presence in the country. At its peak in 2007, the prison held more than 26,000 Iraqis detained during the war. 
 Over the course of the war, the American military has held more than 100,000 prisoners. The vast majority have been released or turned over to the Iraqi authorities; only about 8,400 prisoners remain in American custody in two prisons near Baghdad.

HEADLINE: Obama Gives Ways to Rate Efforts in Afghan Region

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, THOM SHANKER and ERIC SCHMITT

 BODY:
This article is by David E. Sanger, Thom Shanker and Eric Schmitt.
 WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration delivered to Congress on Wednesday about 50 measures to determine whether a broad military and nation-building campaign to stabilize Afghanistan and Pakistan was succeeding, paving the way for the White House to argue that the American combat effort in the region would not be open-ended.
 The long-awaited measures were delivered in closed meetings with key members of the House and Senate, just as President Obama emphasized that he would take his time in evaluating a forthcoming request from the military for more combat forces. 
 ''My determination is to get this right,'' he said, as he met with Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada, whose military forces are scheduled to leave Afghanistan in two years.
 ''There is no immediate decision pending on resources, because one of the things I'm absolutely clear about is you have to get the strategy right,'' Mr. Obama added, in words that appeared intended to calm Democrats who have raised objections about deepening the American combat involvement.
 But Mr. Obama faces growing skepticism, if not outright opposition, from several members of his own party over the direction of his Afghanistan policy. 
 ''I really have great misgivings about adding additional troops without some sort of timeline and an understanding that the rest of the world, particularly our NATO allies and others, are going to play a significant and robust role,'' said Senator Byron L. Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat. 
 Senator Jim Webb, a Virginia Democrat, added: ''It's really important that they have a clearly articulated, understandable policy that has an endpoint in military terms that everyone can understand. I don't think they're there yet.'' 
 Many of the ways the administration told Congress it would measure the success of the mission were familiar: the disruption of terrorist networks in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the building of effective justice systems and the development of economic security, with an emphasis on agriculture instead of narcotics. 
 Administration officials said they hoped the measures would build confidence -- in Congress, around the country and among allies -- that the administration was assessing progress honestly, even if the review fueled political arguments over how long the United States should remain engaged in combat missions.
 ''This will be an honest effort to grade ourselves,'' one senior administration official told reporters, saying that in some cases ''there will be a significant public relations challenge'' if the White House, or an outside panel, determines that elements of the program are failing. 
 The official, who the White House insisted could not be identified, volunteered that the effort to grade progress would meet an early test in Afghanistan. One of the measures, written before last month's presidential vote there, called for an assessment of whether the country was holding ''credible elections.'' 
 ''Guess what? That one's not going to get a glowing rating,'' he said. The vote appears to have been so deeply ridden with fraud that Mr. Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton have been torn about how openly to criticize President Hamid Karzai; many in the administration fear they will be working with an ally seen as illegitimate by many Afghans.
 The senior official said that the administration, in conducting its quarterly assessment of how well the standards were being met, would look at polling data to indicate ''whether the election was viewed as legitimate by the Afghan people.'' 
 Mr. Obama seems acutely aware that he is confronting two clocks on the American engagement in Afghanistan that are ticking at different speeds: a political clock here at home, and a combat clock in the region. The White House is concerned about dividing Democrats on an increase in forces in Afghanistan at a time when the president is trying to hold the party together on his health care overhaul. 
 Meanwhile, pressure from the Pentagon to approve additional forces is building, since the new military strategy calls for rolling back insurgent advances and protecting the population.
 A senior House Democrat on military matters emerged from the closed-door briefing to express support for continuing the mission in Afghanistan -- and for sending additional combat troops if requested by Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the senior commander in Afghanistan.
 The Democrat, Representative Ike Skelton of Missouri, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, has called for the administration to write specific and detailed measurements for success in the war.
 ''It's a tough fight,'' Mr. Skelton said in a telephone interview. ''But this is a true national security effort, and that's why we need a way to show progress toward a solid outcome.''
 Although the bulk of the metrics presented to members of Congress are unclassified, some remain secret, including those for measuring success in the effort to ''disrupt terrorist networks in Afghanistan and especially Pakistan to degrade any ability they have to plan and launch international terrorist attacks.''

HEADLINE: SENATOR UNVEILS BILL TO OVERHAUL U.S. HEALTH CARE

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday unveiled his long-awaited plan to remake the nation's health care system and insure millions of Americans. But he did not win support from a single Republican despite tailoring his proposal to be less costly and to extend the reach of government less than other health bills moving through Congress.
 The chairman, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, said the committee would start voting next week on his proposal, which embodies President Obama's top domestic priority.
 The bill closely resembles what Mr. Obama said he wanted, except that it does not include a new government insurance plan to compete with private insurers. 
 Given reservations expressed Wednesday by members of both parties, the Baucus bill is likely to be modified as it lurches through the committee to the Senate floor and then, presumably, on to negotiations with the House, which is working on a more costly, more expansive measure.
 Mr. Baucus described his plan as ''a good balanced bill that can pass the Senate.'' But the prospects that Congress will deliver a comprehensive bill to Mr. Obama by the end of the year, as he has requested, are difficult to gauge. In seeking a middle ground, Mr. Baucus disappointed many liberal Democrats.
 Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House bill, drafted by Democrats, was superior in many ways and ''clearly does more to make coverage affordable for more Americans.''
 With the release of Mr. Baucus's proposal, a huge fight over the role of government in American life -- comparable to the struggle over creation of Social Security in 1935 -- moves to a new phase, in which hundreds of lobbyists and millions of average citizens will be engaged.
 The Congressional Budget Office said Mr. Baucus's bill would still leave 25 million people uninsured in 2019. About one-third of them would be illegal immigrants. By contrast, the budget office said, 17 million people would be left uninsured under the House bill. At least 46 million people are now uninsured. 
 For more than three months, Mr. Baucus has been negotiating with three Republican senators, and some of their ideas are incorporated in his bill. He predicted that some Republicans and most Democrats would eventually support a version of his bill.
 Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine and one of the senators Mr. Baucus has been negotiating with, said she was not ready to endorse the plan, but would continue working with Mr. Baucus with the hope of getting a deal. 
 The need for action is urgent, Mr. Baucus said, declaring: ''Our health care system is simply unsustainable. It's breaking the bank for everyone, from families to businesses to governments.''
 Mr. Baucus's bill is the least expensive of five major health care bills moving through Congress. The Congressional Budget Office said the expansion of coverage would cost $774 billion over 10 years, compared with price tags of more than $1 trillion for the other measures. 
 The budget office said the cost of Mr. Baucus's bill would be fully offset by new taxes and fees, along with savings squeezed from Medicare, so it could reduce the cumulative total of federal budget deficits by $49 billion over the next 10 years. At the end of that period, it said, new revenues and savings would be growing faster than costs, so the bill could also help reduce deficits in the decade after 2019.
 Like the other bills, Mr. Baucus's proposal would require most Americans to have health insurance, with financial penalties for those who flout the requirement. But his plan differs from the others in significant ways:
 Instead of creating a new government health plan, Mr. Baucus would set up nonprofit insurance cooperatives in every state. The Congressional Budget Office said the co-ops ''seem unlikely to establish a significant market presence in many areas of the country.'' This finding provides ammunition to liberals who say the co-ops could not compete effectively with big insurance companies.
 The Baucus plan, like the other bills, offers subsidies to help low- and middle-income people buy insurance. But eligibility is more limited, and the subsidies appear to be less generous than in the other proposals, causing some Democrats to suggest that many people could still find insurance unaffordable.
 Unlike the other bills, the Baucus plan would impose a new excise tax on insurance companies that sell high-end policies costing more than $8,000 for individuals and $21,000 for families. Mr. Baucus hopes the tax would put downward pressure on health costs. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees denounced the tax, saying it would hit ''health plans that provide benefits for many middle-class families.''
 The bill would not require employers to offer coverage. But employers with more than 50 workers would have to reimburse the government for some or all of the cost of subsidies provided to employees who buy insurance on their own. 
 The legislation would reshape the $2.5 trillion-a-year health care industry, which accounts for roughly one-sixth of the American economy. It would significantly expand Medicaid and substantially reduce Medicare payments to hospitals, managed care plans and many other health care providers. 
 The bill would create state insurance marketplaces, or exchanges, where consumers could shop for insurance and compare plans. Insurers would have to meet strict new requirements and could not deny coverage or charge higher premiums because of a person's health status or pre-existing medical conditions.
 The White House issued a low-key statement saying the Baucus plan provided ''another boost of momentum for the president's effort to reform the health system.''
 The mixed feelings among Democrats were illustrated in two statements issued by the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, who is up for re-election next year.
 In one statement, Mr. Reid praised the Baucus plan, saying it ''brings us a step closer to having a comprehensive health insurance reform bill on the Senate floor.'' But in the other, he expressed concern that the bill would force his state to increase its Medicaid spending, and he said the measure ''needs improvement.'' 
 Conservatives savaged the Baucus plan. ''Democrats should scrap their expensive plans and work with Republicans on a fiscally responsible proposal,'' said the House Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio. 
 Mr. Baucus would extend benefits to millions of the uninsured by expanding Medicaid, at a federal cost of $287 billion over 10 years, and by offering subsidies to individuals and families, at a cost of $463 billion over 10 years.
 He would offer tax credits to help small businesses buy insurance, at a cost to the Treasury of $24 billion over 10 years.
 The budget office said the proposed tax on high-premium insurance plans would generate $215 billion in revenue over the next 10 years.
 People who go without insurance would pay penalties totaling $20 billion, it said, while employers who do not offer coverage would pay penalties of $27 billion. A family without insurance could face a penalty up to $3,800 a year.

HEADLINE: Europe Plans to Endorse Call For Controls on Bankers' Pay

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE

 BODY:
European leaders are set to endorse a call for more government control over bankers' pay ahead of the Group of 20 summit meeting next week in Pittsburgh. 
 In a statement expected to be adopted at a European Union meeting in Brussels on Thursday evening, the leaders called on G-20 members to stand by commitments made this month in London ''to encourage sound risk management and a strong link between compensation and long-term performance, while ensuring a level playing field.'' 
 The leaders reiterated that ''binding rules'' should be ''backed up by the threat of sanctions at the national level,'' but did not elaborate.
 A copy of the draft was obtained Wednesday by The International Herald Tribune.
 European leaders, including President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, have been outspoken in calling on regulators to better monitor what bankers are paid, arguing that the financial crisis stems partly from the foolish credit risks taken by bankers thinking only of their next bonuses. Mr. Sarkozy has reportedly threatened to walk out of the meeting in Pittsburgh if an agreement is not reached. 
 Regulators in the United States have not taken as hard a line as the Europeans, and there is uneasiness in Washington -- not to mention on Wall Street and in the City, London's financial district -- about having the government set pay policy in the private sector. But leaders are expected to paper over their differences in Pittsburgh. 
 The draft, which could still be amended at the meeting Thursday night, calls for the G-20 to ensure that bonuses ''be set at an appropriate level in relation to fixed remuneration and made dependent on performances of the bank, the business unit and individuals; taking due account of negative developments, so as to avoid guaranteed bonuses.''

HEADLINE: Air Force Leads Again In Tanker Contract

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW

DATELINE: NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Wednesday that he would put the United States Air Force in charge of awarding a $35 billion contract for refueling tankers even though it botched two earlier efforts. 
 Boeing and a joint venture that includes Northrop Grumman and the European maker of Airbus planes are competing for the contract. Air Force officials plan to release a draft proposal within the next two weeks that details the type of plane they are seeking.
 While Mr. Gates said he would let the Air Force run the competition instead of having his office do it, he cautioned that the Pentagon ''cannot afford the kind of letdowns and parochial squabbles and corporate food fights that have bedeviled this effort over the last number of years.''
 He also said, in a speech at an Air Force Association convention, that his office would continue to have ''a robust oversight role.'' 
 The Air Force's first effort to obtain new tankers collapsed in 2004 amid corruption charges involving a proposed leasing deal with Boeing. Northrop Grumman and the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, known as EADS, then teamed up and won a competition last year against Boeing, the Chicago aerospace giant that built most of the aging tankers now in use.
 Boeing protested that award, saying the Air Force had unfairly given extra points to the Northrop and EADS team for offering a larger plane than the service had sought and made other mistakes in evaluating the proposals. The Government Accountability Office, a Congressional auditing agency, said some Boeing complaints were valid and blocked the award.
 Boeing and Northrop Grumman both released statements on Wednesday saying they were ready to renew the battle. If anything, the political and economic stakes seem even higher now, with spending on big military programs expected to tighten and with high-paying jobs in the balance.
 The Pentagon has valued the initial phase of the contract at $35 billion. But it also has said the work could be extended for decades and eventually cost $100 billion for 400 to 500 tankers, which can refuel fighter planes and bombers during military operations.
 Boeing, which builds planes in Washington, has the support of that state's Congressional delegation, while Northrop Grumman and EADS have political champions in Alabama, where they said they would assemble their tankers. 
 The political jockeying has been heating up since Sept. 4, when the World Trade Organization issued a draft ruling that Airbus had benefited from unfair subsidies from European governments in its competition with Boeing for sales of commercial planes.
 Boeing's supporters have questioned whether the Pentagon should award the tanker contract to a company that might have unfairly taken sales and jobs from Boeing. But Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, has said that the W.T.O.'s ruling was only preliminary.

HEADLINE: Split Ruling for Protesters At Group of 20 Gathering

BYLINE: By SEAN D. HAMILL

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH 

 BODY:
A federal judge on Thursday ordered the City of Pittsburgh to allow a group's tent city protest during the Group of 20 meeting next week, but he denied two other requests for permits for demonstrations, saying the city's goal of ''protecting visiting foreign leaders is of the highest interest.'' 
 The judge, Gary L. Lancaster of Federal District Court, made his ruling just over a week before the leaders of 20 of the world's largest and emerging economies meet here in a gathering that has become a rallying point for a variety of protesters. 
 Six groups sued the city, state and federal governments last week after being denied permits after months of discussions.
 Since their lawsuit was filed, the city granted permits to three of the groups: for an interfaith march by the G6 Billion group; for another march by the group Bail Out the People; and for permits for a group of artists to use a city park. 
 Judge Lancaster granted one of the remaining groups, CodePink, the right to use Point State Park in downtown Pittsburgh to hold a tent city demonstration Sunday night through Tuesday night. The city had tried to deny the permit, saying it would conflict with a run in the park, as well as a free-speech festival being organized by a group supported by former Vice President Al Gore. Denying CodePink the right to hold its tent city ''would result in the loss of CodePink's First Amendment freedoms,'' Judge Lancaster ruled.
 Jules Lobel, a lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights, which was representing the organizations along with the American Civil Liberties Union, said the ruling for use of the park ''shows that it's not just for the powerful, but for everyone.''
 Judge Lancaster denied a request from the Thomas Merton Center to end a march through the city on Sept. 25 with a rally on the Seventh Street Bridge, near the convention center where the meeting will be held.
 He said the city's view that such a rally, with 5,000 to 7,000 people on a bridge, would be unsafe was valid. The judge also denied a request from the 3 Rivers Climate Convergence to camp out overnight in a city park all of next week because it would put too much of a burden on the city to clean up after the campers, and set a precedent for other groups.

HEADLINE: Life in the Slow Lane: Navigating the Erie Canal

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
ON THE ERIE CANAL, N.Y. -- With a hand on the sturdy brass tiller I sighted ahead and steered our boat, the Seneca, down the center of the placid green ribbon that is the modern Erie Canal. Bikers went faster than we did as they zipped along the towpath, now a biking and walking trail. Even Rollerbladers and joggers passed us going in the same direction. 
 At top speed, motor thrumming, we plowed along at a very relaxed five miles an hour.
 Just a day earlier I'd been racing along the New York State Thruway at 70 m.p.h., anxious not to be late to pick up the canal boat. 
 But I found that life on the canal was plenty fast for me.
 That meant chugging down the middle of the 150-foot wide, 12-foot-deep ditch that in its heyday transformed New York and the nation, ushering in an age of industrial and economic power. It meant maneuvering through locks and under bridges, as boats had done on the canal for nearly 200 years. That meant getting a backyard view of upstate New York, slipping past lawns and docks, past oversize summer homes and modest trailers at water's edge. It meant gliding by farms, woods and marshes, watching herons wade in the shallows. And it meant exploring the small towns that line the canal, searching for traces of its past. 
 Our family of five picked up the boat for a three-day trip in Macedon, N.Y., east of Rochester, at a marina run by Mid-Lakes Navigation, the largest of several companies that rent houseboats on the canal. The first step was instruction in how to operate the 42-foot-long, 12-ton craft. 
 Our instructor, Matt Christ, was unfazed when he learned that my wife, Sarah, and I had little experience with anything larger than a canoe. Operating the Seneca, he said, was as easy as driving a car. 
 But first he cheerfully went over all the things that could go wrong. Don't run aground by going on the wrong side of a buoy. Don't let the boat's ropes get caught in the propeller. And don't tie the boat to the side of a lock as the water is draining, or you could find yourself hanging from the lock wall before the boat's weight starts to tear it apart. ''That,'' he said, ''will end your vacation early.'' 
 We took a short training run, which included lessons in docking and in passing through a lock. After that we were on our own, heading west, on our floating home. 
 As promised, the boat was easy to handle. It helped that it didn't go fast enough to get us into much trouble, and that the canal has about as much current as a bathtub. 
 There were two locks and four lift bridges (they have to be raised to give the boat room to pass) along our route, and they added immensely to the sense of novelty and history. Locks were one of the marvels of the canal when it was first built, making it possible to create a navigable waterway across upstate New York's uneven terrain. 
 My 11-year-old son, Max, quickly took on the role of radio operator. ''Lock 33, Lock 33, this is the Seneca, requesting westward passage,'' he said into the handset as we approached our first lock. 
 On the outward trip we were heading upstream. That meant the lock's function was to raise our boat to the level of the water on the upstream side, about 25 feet above the point where we entered the lock. We pulled in, and the tall gates shut behind us with a metallic clang. Our job was simple: hold on to guide ropes on the side of the lock to keep the boat from drifting. Then the operator opened a sluice gate and the water crept upward, until it had raised us nearly three stories to the upper level. 
 Work on the canal began in 1817. It was completed in 1825, stretching 363 miles from Albany on the Hudson to Buffalo on Lake Erie. For the first time goods could travel quickly by boat from New York City up the Hudson, through the canal, all the way to the Great Lakes and the interior of the country. It led to an upstate boom, and the industries, inventions and ideas that sprung up in the vicinity of the waterway helped create the modern world: the first factories for building mechanical harvesters (Brockport in the 1840s) and for making cheese (Rome, 1851); the invention of the Kodak camera (Rochester, 1888); an early large-scale hydroelectric plant (Niagara Falls, 1895); the start of the women's movement (Seneca Falls, 1848); the creation of Jell-O (Le Roy, 1897). 
 In its earliest days the canal was just 40 feet wide and 4 feet deep, and boats were pulled by mules clomping along the towpath. Over the years it was enlarged twice and ultimately had room for huge modern barges. Commercial traffic fizzled out by the mid-1970s, and the canal became a recreational waterway, maintained and operated, as it always had been, by the state. 
 On the first day we got as far as Henpeck Park in the town of Greece, about six hours of steady motoring from our starting point. There are no docks jutting into the narrow canal. Instead boats tie up at concrete walls along the water's edge. 
 We barbecued a steak on a portable gas grill provided with the boat, then lay beside the canal in the quiet park and watched meteors streak across the sky. 
 The Seneca was roomy and beautifully constructed (Mid-Lakes designs and builds its own boats), with two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a shower, and a kitchen with a refrigerator and stove. The kitchen table folded down to make a third bed. Max and our daughters, Emma, 8, and Romy, 4, loved having the run of the boat as we motored along: it was like having an RV you could ride on top of. (When they were on the roof, the kids wore life jackets.) 
 The next morning we cruised for about an hour and put in at the town of Spencerport for a brief exploration and then lunch at Barton's Parkside Hots, a cart on South Union Street. They take their frankfurters, which they call hots, seriously in western New York, and a long line of regulars forms at Barton's at lunchtime. 
 We then continued west about an hour and a half to Brockport. The town is home to the College at Brockport, part of the state university system, which helps give it a funky, bookish feel. The town, with about 8,300 residents, retains a good deal of 19th-century architecture, and a brochure available at a dockside visitors center lays out a detailed walking tour. 
 We strolled along Main Street and browsed in the friendly Lift Bridge Book Shop. Then we set off in search of a playground (we found one at Utica and Holley Streets) and wandered through the tree-shaded town, admiring the flower gardens and old buildings. 
 Back at the canal eight other boats, from a little Boston Whaler to a 43-foot motor yacht, were pulled up for the night. There was a lively scene canalside, with boaters trading sea stories and locals out for an evening walk. 
 We cooked dinner on the boat and then returned to Main Street, for ice cream at Seaward Candies. The shop also makes its own chocolates, in fanciful shapes that include Band-Aids, a nearly life-size revolver and a tableau of the Last Supper. 
 The next day we headed back east. I noticed things on the return trip I hadn't seen on the way out. One was the Great Embankment, a section of the canal built on an earthen mass piled seven stories above the surrounding countryside to carry it across a steep valley. 
 Early the following day we arrived back at the marina in Macedon. By now we felt like experienced ''canawlers,'' as the boatmen in mule-power days called themselves. We had gotten used to the canal's easygoing rhythms, and we were reluctant to say goodbye to the Seneca -- and life at five miles an hour.
 IF YOU GO
 WHAT TO DO
 The New York State Canal Corporation lists charter companies with boats for hire on its Web site, nyscanals.gov. Mid-Lakes Navigation (800-545-4318, midlakesnav.com) rents boats from May to mid-October.Rates vary depending on the size of the boat and the length of the trip. The regular three-night rate for the boat we rented, one of the largest, was $1,875. But last spring, midrecession, when I booked the trip, the company was offering discounts and we agreed on a rate of $1,675. With tax and a $75 charge for insurance, the total came to nearly $1,900. 
 WHERE TO EAT
 Barton's Parkside Hots, South Union Street, between Slayton and Lyell Avenues, Spencerport, (585) 303-4265. 
 Seaward Candies, 7 South Main Street, Brockport, (585) 637-4120, serves ice cream and unusual custom-made chocolates.

HEADLINE: China's Economy Roars Back, While U.S. Still Ails

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Hilda Wang contributed reporting to this article.

DATELINE: WUXI, China 

 BODY:
Just eight months ago, thousands of Chinese workers rioted outside factories closed by the global downturn. 
 Now many of those plants have reopened and are hiring again. Some executives are even struggling to find enough temporary staff to fill Christmas orders. 
 The image of laid-off workers here returning to jobs stands in sharp contrast to the United States, where even as the economy shows signs of improvement, the unemployment rate continues to march toward double digits. 
 In China, even the hardest-hit factories -- those depending on exports to the United States and Europe -- are starting to rehire workers. No one here is talking about a jobless recovery.
 Even the real estate market is picking up. In this industrial town 90 miles northwest of Shanghai, prospective investors lined up one recent Saturday to buy apartments in the still-unfinished Rose Avenue complex. Many of them slept outside the sales office all night. 
 ''The whole country's economy is back on track,'' said Shi Yingyi, a 34-year-old housewife who joined the throng. ''I feel more confident now.''
 The confidence stems from China's three-pronged effort -- a combination of stimulus, liberal bank lending and broad government support for exports. 
 The Chinese central bank said the country's economy surged at an annualized rate of 14.9 percent in the second quarter. The United States economy shrank at an annual rate of 1 percent in that period. 
 ''So often China and the U.S. are mixed together as being in the same situation, and that is totally wrong,'' said Xu Xiaonian, an economist in Beijing with the China Europe International Business School.
 That does not mean the two nations are not connected, of course. China's rebound in growth may slow if the American economy does not pick up. China needs the United States to buy its goods, and the United States needs China to continue to buy its debt.
 This mutual dependence makes it harder for either country to let the current dispute over Chinese tires and American chicken and auto parts to grow into a trade war. 
 But with more economic planning than the United States, China has been able to disburse its stimulus much faster, turning it into new rail lines and highways.
 China's finance ministry announced in late June that half the $173 billion in central government spending had already been allocated to specific projects. The White House said in early July that a quarter of the spending authority and tax cuts in the $789 billion American stimulus had been allocated or used.
 But even more key to China's recovery, economists say, are two other government efforts that are paying big dividends: looser lending and export supports.
 The state-controlled banking system here -- which breezed through the global financial crisis with minimal losses as American financial institutions reeled -- unleashed $1.2 trillion in extra lending to Chinese consumers and businesses in the first seven months of this year. That money is financing everything from a boom in car sales, up 82 percent in August from a year earlier, to frenzied factory construction.
 Beijing also has given huge tax breaks and other assistance to exporters. They include placing broad restrictions on imports and intervening heavily in currency markets to hold down the value of the renminbi, to keep Chinese exports competitive even in a weakened global economy. 
 Indeed, subsidies abound at all levels of government: the Wuxi municipal government just offered up to $146,000 to each local business that increases exports in the last three months of this year.
 To be sure, not all the laid off workers throughout China have been hired back. 
 ''Some plants reduced worker numbers by 20 to 30 percent, now they hire back 10 percent,'' said Stanley Lau, deputy chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, which represents export-oriented factories employing 10 million Chinese workers. 
 Even so, American trade data shows that imports from China only eroded 14.2 percent in the first seven months of this year while imports from the rest of the world plunged 32.6 percent. China's trade surplus, already the world's largest, was $108 billion for the seven-month period.
 ''We definitely see an upswing in sales orders in the second half of this year when compared to the first half,'' said Gu Fung, the sales manager at the Wuxi Baolai Batteries Company. 
 China's well-capitalized banking system allowed for rapid investment.
 Chinese banks came into the crisis with enormous excess reserves, the result of three years of tight regulatory limits on lending to prevent the economy from overheating. When those limits were removed, and authorities urged bank executives to lend, the total value of loans outstanding shot up more in the first seven months of this year than in the previous 24 months.
 By contrast, total loans and leases outstanding at financial institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation actually fell $249 billion, or 3.2 percent, in the first half of this year. 
 Though Washington has used taxpayer money to bail out American banks, it does not have Beijing's power to force banks to lend that money to businesses and consumers.
 As much as a third of the extra bank lending in China appears to have gone into real estate and stock market speculation. But the bulk has gone into investments by companies and local governments, with tangible results.
 China's currency and trade policies, though highly effective, would be hard for the United States to emulate.
 For instance, government intervention in currency markets has prevented the renminbi from moving appreciably against the dollar in more than 14 months, and has pushed the renminbi down by 18 percent against the euro since March. 
 Government agencies have been told not to buy imported goods with money from economic stimulus programs unless no domestic alternative is available. Washington has imposed a less restrictive rule, misleadingly known as ''Buy American,'' requiring that construction materials for the stimulus program be bought from any of the 39 countries that have agreed to free trade in government procurement -- which China has not.
 Still, China's stimulus efforts could be sowing the seeds of future distress. With so much money washing into the system so fast, regulators have voiced concerns about corruption in government investment projects.
 Cheap cash has a way of inflating bubbles -- just ask Wall Street -- that could damage China's economy and its banks when they pop. 
 ''You have to imagine the rigor and due diligence'' that mainland banks have been showing in rushing out so many loans, said Benjamin Hung, the chief executive of the Hong Kong unit of Standard Chartered Bank. 
 But such concerns are so 2008.

QUEENS COUNTY FAIR
 Every so often an animal escapes its confines and runs free on the streets of New York City. This spring it was a cow, Molly, who escaped slaughter. Her hooves pounding pavement, she drew the onlookers who invariably gather to witness the jarring juxtaposition of city and country living. 
 This weekend that juxtaposition is more fully expressed at the county fair at the Queens County Farm Museum. An annual fair in the city's sole stand-alone farm, it is a two-day extravaganza that includes blue-ribbon contests for produce, crafts and the sort of livestock that can exist in New York: rabbits, guinea pigs and the like. It is partly a tribute to the area's agricultural roots. 
 ''Back in the 1800s especially, these fairs were a way for local farmers to learn about new equipment, for farmers who were living a little far away to see each other, to sell and buy livestock,'' explained Amy Fischetti-Boncardo, executive director of the Queens County Farm Museum. ''We want to mimic those fairs.'' 
 With a few refinements of course. The fair's main purpose seems to be to entertain as much as serve as a reminder that asphalt does not preclude agriculture. In addition to rural-inspired events like petting zoos, hayrides and corn-husking contests, there are musical performances, a German band and dancers, and an arm-wrestling competition. 
 But there has been a surge in interest in the main draw. Applications for competitions have steadily risen, coinciding with the advent of the locally grown food movement and the recession. ''A typical urbanite might not have done anything years ago that fell into this category,'' Ms. Fischetti-Boncardo said. ''But now people might be at home tweaking their artistic ability. It's a little bit like a country-in-the-city type thing.'' On purpose, unlike Molly's mad dash.

HEADLINE: Recruiting Goals Exceeded, Marines Toughen Ad Pitch

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
Calvin Klein it's not. The advertisement shows men crawling through mud and under barbed wire, being smacked in the head with padded fighting sticks, vomiting after inhaling tear gas and diving, boots and all, into a swimming pool. 
 If it sounds like a teaser for a survival reality show, that's not far off the mark. On Saturday, the Marine Corps will unveil its newest advertising campaign, and unlike past campaigns featuring the Marines' stately Silent Drill Platoon in dress uniform, the new spot highlights in high-definition detail the grit, sweat and tears of boot camp. 
 ''It's not soft,'' said Maj. Gen. Robert E. Milstead Jr., who heads the Marine Corps Recruiting Command. ''It's not showing people in a nice uniform. It's not showing all the good things. It's in your face.''
 The new approach is a result of recruiting successes, General Milstead said. Thanks in part to the weak economy, the corps is ahead of its recruiting goals not only for this year but for the next three as well. And so the high command has concluded that it can be pickier about new recruits.
 ''We're going to toss a challenge,'' General Milstead said. ''And if you rise to the challenge, we'll make you only one promise: we'll make you a United States Marine. That resonates to young men and women.''
 The corps is not the only service meeting its goals. As is typical when job markets are weak, all the services have been meeting or exceeding their targets, including the Army, which struggled just a few years ago when the economy was strong and the Iraq war was sending home large numbers of casualties. 
 General Milstead said that in 2008, the corps had its most bountiful recruiting year since 1984, bringing in about 42,000 new Marines. He also noted that the quality of recruits was higher: nearly 99 percent this year are high school graduates, up from 95 percent in 2007.
 The bumper crop has been such that many new enlistees must now wait six months or more to get a spot in boot camp, and the corps has already met its five-year mission to expand by 27,000 Marines. Two years ago, when Congress authorized the corps, the smallest of the military services, to grow to 202,000 from 175,000, the leadership thought it could not reach the goal until 2012. Instead, it was reached this summer.
 The new advertising campaign tries to capitalize on the Marines' image, part reality and part burnished myth, as the toughest and most selective of the services. A 60-second spot shows three young men -- one black, one Latino and one white -- hearing a silent call, and then running toward the rigors of basic training, a drill instructor shouting, ''Move it!'' 
 The spot, which will first be televised during the Florida-Tennessee college football game on CBS this Saturday and during pro football games Sunday and then Monday night, was produced by JWT, the advertising agency that has long been a consultant to the corps. The director was Simon Crane, whose film credits include helping direct the Normandy beach scene in ''Saving Private Ryan.'' 
 Shot on location mostly at Parris Island, S.C., the corps's East Coast training station, the spot shows real Marines doing real basic training exercises, although actually the Marines shown are members of the elite Silent Drill Platoon, not new recruits.
 With its focus on men doing rigorous basic training exercises, the new spot has a more testosterone-fueled quality than last year's campaign, which featured the precise rifle-handling exhibition of the Silent Drill Platoon at iconic American locales, from Times Square to the Hoover Dam. 
 It also makes no effort to show the emotional or mental challenges involved in being a Marine, like coping with combat stress or death. General Milstead said future spots might take on some of those themes.
 General Milstead called the new campaign, titled ''America's Few,'' a ''prequel'' to last year's campaign, because it shows how recruits are transformed into Marines. ''It's the truthful, gritty image of what it takes,'' he said.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about a new recruiting campaign for the Marine Corps misstated its rank in size among the military services. It is the second smallest, not the smallest. (The Coast Guard is the smallest.)

HEADLINE: For Every Action, An Unequal Reaction

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
It takes gall to riff on Raymond Chandler, which doesn't mean it can't be done. Robert Altman did it brilliantly in his 1973 movie, ''The Long Goodbye.'' And now Jonathan Ames is putting a droll, Brooklyn hipster spin on the genre with ''Bored to Death.''
 Altman shocked Bogart purists by casting Elliott Gould as a sleepy, muttering Philip Marlowe adrift in a post-Woodstock Los Angeles populated by Malibu beach bums and hippie chicks (or as Mr. Gould put it, ''crazy ladies''). 
 ''Bored to Death,'' which begins on Sunday on HBO, stars Jason Schwartzman (''Shopgirl,'' ''Rushmore'') as Mr. Ames's fictional alter ego, conveniently, if unimaginatively, named Jonathan Ames. Jonathan is a blocked writer, stoner and white-wine tippler who falls into a funk when his girlfriend dumps him. He consoles himself by reading ''Farewell, My Lovely,'' and that inspires him to advertise as a private eye on Craigslist. 
 Very quickly he attracts clients, though the cases are Craigslist-level mysteries -- a stolen skateboard, a cheating boyfriend. And Jonathan doesn't have many qualms about his imposture. 
 ''I say that I'm not licensed, and that makes it more legal ... ish,'' Jonathan tells his best friend and fellow Brooklyn loser, a graphic artist named Ray (Zach Galifianakis, ''The Hangover''), who is appalled. 
 On the other hand, Jonathan's sometime boss, George (Ted Danson), a dissipated magazine publisher and socialite, is all for it -- as long as it doesn't prevent Jonathan from being on call to supply pot and last-minute companionship. 
 Mr. Danson steals every scene in the role, which he plays as a loonier, more endearing version of Arthur Frobisher, the amoral business tycoon he portrays on ''Damages.'' When Jonathan asks George if he really needs so much Viagra, George primly replies: ''Yes, as a matter of fact, I do. My heart medicine and heavy drinking have taken a toll.''
 ''Bored to Death'' is as idiosyncratic and delightful in its own way as ''Curb Your Enthusiasm,'' which returns on Sunday for a seventh season. The two shows are linked, and not just by Mr. Danson, who plays himself on ''Curb Your Enthusiasm.'' Together they form the twin pillars of HBO comedy, equally funny in mirror-opposite ways. 
 ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' finds humor in unleashing operatic hostility and rudeness on the blandest of settings. ''Bored to Death'' reverses the conceit, injecting a counterintuitive fillip of sweetness and tolerance into seemingly implacable social confrontations. 
 Larry David, the creator and star of ''Curb Your Enthusiasm,'' posits a universe in which people respond to friends and strangers without manners or inhibition. It isn't just that Mr. David gives offense; offense is always taken, instantly and loudly, by blind dates, receptionists, store clerks, doctors, old friends and new acquaintances. 
 In real life, people usually respond to a verbal affront by ignoring it or smoothing it over with nervous laughter. In Larry Davidland, even ladies snarl and snap at his faux pas like unchained Rottweilers. 
 On ''Bored to Death'' the surprise lies in the way incendiary conflicts are deflected or turned upside down. The opening scene has Jonathan outside his Brooklyn apartment watching woefully as Israeli movers heave the possessions of his girlfriend, Suzanne (Olivia Thirlby), into their van. 
 Jonathan, though distraught, is distracted by the movers' ethnicity. It's easy to envision that Larry, in the same situation on an episode of ''Curb Your Enthusiasm,'' would also say something along the lines of Jonathan's remark: ''It seems unusual, you know, to have Jewish movers, right? Doing such muscle-oriented work?'' 
 But Larry would most likely not respond as Jonathan does to the mover's scalding retort, ''What are you, another self-hating New York Jew?'' 
 Jonathan gazes at the mover with Buster Keaton gravity, then nods, as if relieved at being accurately assessed. ''Uh huh,'' he says. ''I guess I am. Yeah.''
 There are other reversals. One of the underlying jokes of ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' is that Larry and his clan of Hollywood movers and shakers are as placidly idle and relaxed as unemployed musicians in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. One of the charms of ''Bored to Death'' is that the hero, a pothead and screw-up, secretly moonlights as a man of action, tracking missing persons and solving mysteries. 
 This season Larry putters around as usual, doing small though usually daunting errands, but he also takes on a television project, not because he craves work, but because he wants to get back together with his wife, Cheryl (Cheryl Hines), who moved out last season. (As the season begins, Larry is living not so happily ever after with Loretta, played by Vivica A. Fox.)
 Cheryl is trying to restart her acting career, and Larry, who has rejected every entreaty to write a ''Seinfeld'' reunion show, decides that he if he agrees, he could create a part for Cheryl, and regain her respect, or at least a sense of obligation. 
 Jonathan also hopes to win Suzanne back, but finds it hard to live up to her demand that he quit drinking and smoking pot. He is impressed, however, when Ray tells him that he gave in to his girlfriend's request that he have colonic cleansing to improve his mood.
 ''If I had changed for Suzanne, she wouldn't have moved out,'' Jonathan says mournfully. 
 Ray is more pragmatic: ''I'm not going to change, I'm going to pretend to change. I can't change, that's impossible.''
 Both ''Bored to Death'' and ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' have heroes who are hell-bent on doing the impossible and are doomed to fail. And it's impossible not to prefer them just as they are.

HEADLINE: Despite Their Prices, Gourmet Teas Thrive As Global Economy Sags

BYLINE: By SONIA KOLESNIKOV-JESSOP

DATELINE: SINGAPORE 

 BODY:
The global economic crisis may have damped the appetite for high-end goods, but one small daily luxury -- gourmet tea -- has been posting surprisingly strong sales, prompting some tea brands to consider expanding around the world.
 With names like Silver Moon, Emperor's White Garden, Gout Russe Douchka and Sakura, the teas reflect a wide range of exotic flavors, attracting an almost religious following among tea lovers. While the rarest teas, like yellow teas, can cost $2,120 for a kilogram, or 2.2 pounds, gourmet teas cost 30 percent more than standard teas on average, making them an affordable luxury for many.
 ''There is definitely no crisis when it comes down to gourmet tea; our sales have been increasing every year by 15 to 25 percent ever since we started in 1987,'' said Francois-Xavier Delmas, founder and chief executive of Le Palais des Thes in Paris. 
 He said the company, which is privately owned, posted annual revenue growth of 19 percent in 2007-8, with sales of 9.66 million euros ($14.2 million). 
 Le Palais des Thes' experience has been similar to that of other luxury tea brands, as well as specialty retailers. 
 ''Demand for quality products has remained strong,'' said Mark Daley, chief executive of Dean & DeLuca, a gourmet retailer based in the United States. ''People are enjoying more time together, more time sharing with friends, more time home entertaining.'' 
 Mariage Freres, a French merchant of exclusive teas, will open a boutique in Hamburg in November and another in Munich in December. It plans to expand to London in 2010 and then to New York and China.
 Its director, Philippe Cohen-Tanugi, said the company, which posted revenue of 50 million euros ($73.4 million) in 2008, could grow much faster if it developed a franchise network, something it declined to do.
 ''Believe me, so many have called us for that, we could have opened a store a month and become a Tea Starbucks,'' he said, ''but our rules of management have remained unaltered since 1983: complete integration and central decision taking in order to keep full control on the Mariage Freres image and identity.''
 Dammann Freres, another French gourmet tea company, which sells about 800 tons a year, used to offer its teas only through businesses like delicatessens and luxury hotels. But last year, it started to market itself to retail customers, opening its first tea boutique in Paris. Since then, it has opened three boutiques in Japan and is considering a second in the French capital and one in London, said Pierre Merlanchon, marketing manager at Dammann Freres.
 One of the most aggressive players is a new entrant to the market. TWG Tea, based in Singapore, has managed in two years to expand its annual sales to 650 tons from nothing while also securing shelf space at Dean & DeLuca and getting served in Singapore Airlines' first-class cabins.
 TWG Tea's chairman, Manoj Murjani, said he decided to invest $10 million to found TWG Tea with four partners after an investment he made in a small tea company gave him a sixfold return within 18 months.
 ''We're really going for the high end of the market, and we're thinking big and we're starting big,'' he said. ''From Year One to Year Two, we've grown in terms of revenues tenfold, and going forward, I think we will be growing at fivefold a year.'' He declined to give specific sales figures.
 TWG Tea has one boutique in Singapore and plans to open a second one there in October, then its first in Japan and one in the Middle East in the first quarter of 2010. There are also plans for a shop in New York next year and a counter to open soon at a Dean & DeLuca store in New York. 
 The company clearly has a strong eye for marketing, positioning itself as an innovator with seasonal creations and developing beautiful, elaborate packaging. TWG teas start at $4.20 for 50 grams, or 1.76 ounces. 
 As with other specialist tea merchants, it aims to offer a large range of distinctive blends, including White House Tea, a pai mu tan white tea from Fujian, China, blended with red berries and rose petals, created to celebrate the presidential inauguration of Barack Obama.
 Gourmet tea remains very much a niche segment of the overall tea market, which has grown steadily in recent years, largely because of tea's perceived health benefits, market analysts said. 
 According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, world tea consumption increased to 3.75 million tons in 2007 from 2.95 million tons in 2003, the latest available data.
 Data from IBISWorld, an industry research company, show that tea consumption in the United States is on the rise, but it is still only the sixth-most-popular drink (not including tap water), after soft drinks, bottled water, beer, milk and coffee.
 Specialty and gourmet tea is a fast-growing segment within the tea industry. In the United States, it is estimated to account for 8.5 percent of the $2.1 billion in sales in 2009.
 ''The growth in the number of specialty tearooms in the U.S., which is estimated to total over 2,600, has further stimulated demand for gourmet and specialty tea products,'' IBISWorld wrote in a research note. ''Similar to cafes, these establishments are changing the landscape of tea consumption to become a more social occasion.'' 
 Even though tea consumption has been more strongly identified with the British, French companies have had a strong hold on the gourmet market for the last 20 years. 
 ''I think that's because unlike the British that are very used to drinking tea, the French had no preconception about tea; they are willing to experiment,'' said Mr. Delmas, of Le Palais des Thes.
 Mr. Cohen-Tanugi of Mariage Freres said, ''The French drink the widest range of teas in the world, bringing the same attention and connoisseurship to the choice of the right tea as they would the proper wine.''
 Milton Pedraza, chief executive of the Luxury Institute, a market research company in New York, said he thought many tea suppliers had seen tea as a mass-market commodity and sold it that way, leaving space for entrants at the high end of the market.
 ''With the growing popularity of tea, there is an opportunity to differentiate at the top level, even in these challenging economic times,'' Mr. Pedraza said. ''There is consumer interest in the premium end of almost any category, and I believe a larger segment of tea connoisseurs can be developed globally. But it will take a great deal of education to help consumers to discern differences and be willing to pay a premium, so it will be a slow build.''

HEADLINE: Klein Pressures Principals to Hire Reserve Pool's Teachers

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
With more than 1,500 existing teachers on the city's payroll without permanent job placements, the schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein, has told principals that if they do not fill those jobs by the end of next month, they will lose any money they had allocated for their teacher vacancies. 
 Principals across the city have resisted hiring teachers from the so-called absent reserve pool, in which teachers are placed if they lose their posts when a school is shut down or forced to shrink its teaching staff because of budget cuts or declining enrollments.
 Though the pool has shrunk to about 1,500 teachers, from 1,983 about three weeks ago, it would still cost the department roughly $127 million this year. By forcing principals to fill the remaining 1,050 vacancies in the system from the existing pool, education officials expect to save about $75 million. 
 In a letter sent to principals this week, Mr. Klein called the pool a ''fiscal liability we cannot sustain.''
 ''Nobody dislikes this situation more than I do,'' Mr. Klein wrote to the principals. ''Limiting your hiring freedom goes against what I stand for, but because of the economic reality, we must control costs and protect our schools from deeper budget cuts.''
 The letter was first reported by InsideSchools.org, a Web site that covers New York City education issues. Mr. Klein has lifted the hiring restrictions in some subjects, like special education and science, and several principals have said they received waivers to hire new teachers in math and bilingual education.
 The Education Department is continuing to hold job fairs over the next several weeks and requiring those teachers in the pool to attend the fairs.
 Ernest Logan, the president of the Council of School Supervisors and Administrators, said in a statement that the council was pleased that the human resources department was ''stepping up to the plate'' with the job fairs, but sounded a note of caution. ''We would like to know more about what the Department of Education will do if appropriate licensing matches are not made or if excessed teachers fail to show up at the recruitment fairs,'' he said.

Exuberance Defies
 Sober New Reality
 Is irrational exuberance back in the markets? Evidence abounds that it may be. With financial chaos abating, the return of risk appetite in stock and lending markets is logical -- up to a point. But risk-taking that aspires to the boom-time norm, rather than a more sober new reality, could be premature and dangerous.
 True, it's important not to get stuck in a crisis mentality. Markets probably fell too much, and some level of recovery is therefore only a return to a sensible middle ground. For instance, the risk premiums over Treasury yields on junk bonds, now roughly 8 percentage points, are more or less back to where they were before Lehman Brothers went bust. They are still much larger than their 2007 bull market levels below 3 percentage points, and well above the long-term average, which lies somewhere in between. 
 The Chicago Board Options Exchange VIX index of United States stock market volatility, also seen as a gauge of investor fear, is in the same category. It spiked sharply after the Lehman collapse and has subsided, but it is nowhere near its lows. 
 So far, so good. But there are clear signs of an overshoot on the upside, a so-called echo bubble, along the lines already seen in Chinese stocks. Sensible analysis of stock prices, for instance, suggests that after the run-up of recent months, little in the way of crisis aftershocks is priced in, and some see markets as overvalued. 
 A recent rash of bond issues and planned stock offerings can be viewed as a return to business as usual. But some also look overly opportunistic. When Blockbuster, until recently widely seen as an anachronistic video-rental business condemned to permanent decline by the digital revolution, can pull enough demand to double the size of a debt offering to $675 million, as it did on Wednesday, it raises the question of whether investors are looking for an early return of bull market conditions. 
 Similarly, Kodak, another company struggling with a secular decline of its core business, was able to raise up to $700 million from a sale of securities to investors led by the buyout house Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. AMR, the parent of American Airlines, sold air miles and tweaked its aircraft financing to gain access to nearly $3 billion of extra funds, a move that sent its share price soaring by about 20 percent. 
 There is also anecdotal evidence that banks are willing to fund leveraged buyouts again, and that the terms under consideration have become rapidly more aggressive in recent weeks. 
 The ramping-up of prices for commodities like oil and gold also suggests a return of speculative activity, although gold may also be in favor as a hedge against possible inflation. Either way, though, it's hard to escape the feeling that all the cheap government money still sloshing around, and that keeping short-term interest rates down is more likely than not to stoke a new bubble. 
 Investors are also ''tired of talking about the macro issues,'' according to Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup's chief equity strategist. That's perhaps no bad thing given the return of some stability to markets. It makes sense, for instance, to distinguish between the investment potential of different companies rather than indiscriminately tarring all their stocks and bonds with the same brush. 
 Yet the things that keep people awake at night should still be the big macro concerns. Is the American consumer going to pull back further? Is a continuing downturn in commercial property going to undermine the credit recovery? Are bad things still lurking in the banking system? And with governments critical to market confidence, will they tackle challenges in monetary policy, tax, regulation and trade without making mistakes big enough to upset the apple cart? 
 Warren E. Buffett said this week that a lot has to go right for Kraft Foods to justify the price it has already put on the table for Cadbury. Yet if the British confectioner's share price is anything to go by, investors seem to expect a significantly higher offer to be forthcoming. That is today's markets in a nutshell. 
 The foundations of a recovery are scarcely in place and the optimists are already looking for the elevator to the new skyscraper's observation deck. They'll be lucky if they don't trip on some rubble while they wait. RICHARD BEALES

HEADLINE: Few Cases of Fraud Involving Stimulus Money Have Been Detected, Officials Say

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
It would not ordinarily go down in the annals of crime. But when Robert Fitzsimmons was arrested this summer and accused of cashing a check made out to his long-dead father at a Pay-O-Matic check cashing store in Manhattan, he became one of the first people in the country accused of stealing some of the $787 billion in federal stimulus money.
 And officials fear there could be many more to come. 
 At issue was one of the millions of $250 stimulus checks that were sent to all Social Security recipients in May; Mr. Fitzsimmons was accused of cashing one that was made out to his late father, according to a complaint filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, which goes on to accuse him of stealing Social Security money for at least four years. His lawyer, Julia Gatto, said he intended to plead not guilty.
 Compared with the immense size of the stimulus program, the actual number of arrests so far has been microscopic. Earl E. Devaney, the chairman of the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, the watchdog for stimulus money, said recently that federal prosecutors were looking at only nine stimulus-related cases, including accusations of Social Security fraud and of businesses improperly claiming to be owned by women and members of minorities.
 ''Quite frankly, I'm a little surprised it's that small,'' Mr. Devaney testified recently before the Senate, explaining that his office passes along questionable expenses to the various federal inspector general offices following the money, as well as to the Department of Justice. ''I know, from talking to them, they're very interested in sending some very loud signals early, as often as they can, with this money.''
 The small number of cases is partly a function of how much stimulus money has been spent so far, and how it has been spent. While more than $150 billion of it has been pumped into the economy, according to a recent report by the White House, some $62.6 billion of that was in the form of tax cuts. Of the rest, $38.4 billion was sent to states for fiscal relief; $30.6 billion was spent to help those affected by the recession by expanding unemployment benefits and other safety-net programs, and $16.5 billion was spent in areas like infrastructure, technology and research. 
 The biggest accusations of stimulus-related fraud so far have not involved the theft of public money at all. Rather, they have involved con artists fleecing gullible people and businesses hoping to profit from the stimulus. 
 Some cases involve fraudulent get-rich-quick schemes sold to dupes hoping to win slices of the stimulus money. The Federal Trade Commission has been working with several states to try to shut down an operation that used a telephone recording that said, ''If you're one of the lucky few who knows how to find and apply for these grants, you will receive a check for $25,000 or more, and we guarantee it.'' The recording was actually pitching a $59 book on grant writing and hundreds of dollars worth of other grant-writing services. 
 The commission has also taken aim at fraudulent Web sites, recorded phone calls advertising ''free grant money,'' and schemes intended to make unauthorized charges to people's financial accounts. 
 Other schemes are aimed at contractors and other legitimate recipients of stimulus money. The Department of Transportation has warned contractors not to respond to official-looking requests for confidential financial information without checking with its procurement office to see that the queries are legitimate, and said that it had referred bogus queries to law-enforcement officials. 
 But investigators are bracing for more serious efforts on the public money. The conventional estimate is that 7 percent of government spending is lost to waste, fraud or abuse. Some government officials are warning that using that percentage, $55 billion worth of the $787 billion stimulus package would be lost. To try to prevent that, the various federal inspector general offices, state comptrollers and auditors, and federal and local prosecutors have trained their sights on the stimulus money.
 To oversee its stimulus spending, California named an inspector general, who has met with federal, state and local investigators and held fraud-awareness training programs for recipients of the money. In New York, a bridge-painting contract was blocked after the state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, raised questions about the proposed contractor's connections to a company barred from getting state work.
 Keeping track of all the money is a challenge as it makes its way from the federal government to states and then to contractors, municipalities or community groups. Mr. Devaney, at the recovery act board, is preparing to start a Web site this fall that tracks the stimulus money in great detail. 
 In a recent interview at his office near the White House, Mr. Devaney said that the board used analysts to look for connections between contractors and companies suspected of fraud in the past, and that they would make referrals to various inspector general offices for inquiries or audits, or to the Justice Department. 
 ''That will be a fast track to prosecution if somebody were to be stupid enough to steal this money,'' he said. 
 Once the Web site goes live, Mr. Devaney said, he expects to get tips from the public.
 ''Then I've got my millions of citizen I.G.'s that I'm unleashing, who are going to presumably see stuff that we in Washington, inside the Beltway, would never see,'' he said. ''Stuff like, you know, 'That's the mayor's brother-in-law!' We're not going to know that, because it's a different name. But the people out there are going to know.''
 Some prosecutors are still looking at fraud related to the last economic stimulus, the $300 to $1,200 tax rebate checks sent out near the end of the Bush administration. In one case, Cynthia Annette Elliott, a tax preparer from Georgia, was accused in Federal District Court in Atlanta of depositing stolen stimulus checks into a bank account she controls. A lawyer for Ms. Elliott did not respond to two requests seeking comment.

HEADLINE: Housing Starts Increase To a Nine-Month High

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The government said that housing construction rose in August to the highest level in nine months as a surge in apartment building offset a decline in single-family activity.
 The August performance was another sign that the nation's housing industry had begun to recover from its worst downturn in decades.
 The Commerce Department said in a statement that construction of new homes and apartments rose 1.5 percent to an annual rate of 598,000 units last month. That is slightly lower than the 600,000-unit pace that economists had forecast. 
 The increase pushed building activity to the highest level since last November and left home construction 24.8 percent above the record low hit in April. 
 Applications for building permits, a forecaster of future activity, posted a 2.7 percent rise in August to an annual rate of 579,000 units, slightly below the 580,000 level that had been forecast. Permits for single-family homes dipped by 0.2 percent while multifamily units rose by 15.8 percent.
 The 1.5 percent rise in housing starts followed a 0.2 percent dip in July. The August strength came from a 25.3 percent surge in construction of multifamily units, a volatile sector which had fallen by 15.2 percent in July.
 The larger single-family sector dipped 3 percent last month to an annual rate of 479,000 units, the first setback after five straight monthly gains.
 By region, construction shot up 23.8 percent in the Northeast and 0.9 percent in the Midwest. Activity was flat in the West and fell 2.4 percent in the South.
 In another report, the number of newly laid-off workers seeking unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level since early July, evidence that layoffs were slowing.
 The Labor Department said initial claims for unemployment insurance dropped to a seasonally adjusted 545,000 from an upwardly revised 557,000 the previous week. Wall Street economists expected claims to rise by 5,000, according to Thomson Reuters.
 The decline is the third in the last four weeks. The four-week average, which smoothes fluctuations, dropped 8,750 to 563,000. That is still far above the 325,000 a week typical in a healthy economy.
 The number of people claiming benefits for more than a week rose by 129,000 to a seasonally adjusted 6.2 million.
 When federal extended benefits are included, 9.01 million people received unemployment insurance in the week ended Aug. 29. That was down from 9.16 million the previous week. Congress has added up to 53 weeks of extended benefits on top of the 26 weeks provided by the states.
 Thursday's report comes a day after the Federal Reserve said production by the nation's factories, mines and utilities increased for the second straight month in August, the latest sign the economy is recovering.
 The jobless rate is widely expected to peak next year above 10 percent, up from its current 9.7 percent. Some analysts say that claims need to drop below 400,000 before the unemployment rate will start to decline.
 Among the states, Washington had the largest increase in claims of 4,546, which it attributed to greater layoffs in the construction, public administration and manufacturing industries. The next largest increases were in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, North Carolina and Illinois. The state data lags initial claims by a week.
 California had the largest drop in claims of 2,751. The next largest decreases were in New York, Wisconsin, Texas and New Jersey.

HEADLINE: Making a New Appeal Using Vintage Images

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
WITH the economic downturn kindling a longing for less volatile eras, many companies have turned to nostalgia marketing. Examples are Volkswagen, featuring a 1964 Beetle in advertisements, General Mills, selling Cheerios and other cereals in retro boxes, and Nationwide Insurance, resurrecting its ''Nationwide is on your side'' catchphrase. 
 Now a charity is about to test if that approach to consumer goods also applies to good deeds. The American Lung Association is introducing a campaign for its century-old Christmas Seals fund-raiser that weaves vintage Christmas Seal images into contemporary advertisements. 
 The Christmas Seals program, where millions of households are mailed decorative stamp-sized seals for holiday-card envelopes, and are asked for a donation, is in decline: donations plummeted to $12.6 million in 2008, from about $28 million in 1995. 
 The annual direct-mail effort, which once featured public service announcements from celebrities like John Wayne and Gary Cooper, has not been advertised since the early 1990s, when previous leaders at the nonprofit deemed the program so popular that promoting it was overkill, according to Carrie Martin, an American Lung Association spokeswoman.
 The new campaign -- by Red Deluxe of Memphis -- evokes the history of the association, which began in 1904 to fight tuberculosis and now tackles respiratory threats like air pollution and smoking.
 In one television spot, an actor wearing a red scarf climbs a ladder that leans against an old-fashioned gaslight, as a voice intones, ''In 1946, the American Lung Association added clear skies to America's Christmas wishes.'' 
 After the actor lights the gaslight, a hand holding a white rectangle with a serrated boarder appears on the screen and frames the footage, which freezes in what turns out to be the identical lamp-lighting pose from a 1946 Christmas Seal. As the still image changes into the illustration, the lung association's double-barred cross logo appears along with the word ''greetings.'' Then that same hand -- holding an actual seal -- presses it onto an envelope as the voiceover says, ''For over 100 years your gifts to Christmas Seals have helped us fight for healthy lungs and air. Celebrate another year.''
 That approach -- filmed vignette freeze-framing in a seal of yore -- is taken in two other spots, one a boy singing carols in a 1953 seal another a girl wrapping a gift as her father hangs a wreath in a 1961 image. 
 The nonprofit group picked a challenging moment to rejuvenate Christmas Seals. Charitable giving in the United States dropped 2 percent to $308 billion in 2008, the first drop since 1987, according to ''Giving U.S.A.,'' which is published by the Center of Philanthropy at Indiana University. 
 According to a June report by Target Analytics, a unit of Blackbaud Inc., which provides software and services to nonprofit groups, health organizations suffered the worst declines in donations during the downturn, dropping 12 percent in the year ended April 1. 
 That compared with an 11 percent drop for arts and culture organizations, a 3 percent fall for animal welfare groups and a decline of less than 1 percent for religious organizations. Also problematic is the fact that the program hitches its wagon to traditional mail -- mailing donation requests with seals, whose purpose is to adorn holiday cards -- at a time when mail is faltering. In the nine-month period that ended June 30, mail volume in the United States dropped 12.6 percent, according to the Postal Service, the result not just of the recession but also of the Internet being used increasingly for correspondence, bill paying and invitations. 
 Addressees currently receive an average of four pieces of mail a day, compared with six in 2000, and the Postal Service, which said it could lose $7 billion this fiscal year, is considering cutbacks including ending Saturday delivery. 
 The average direct mail donor to Christmas Seals is a 68-year-old female, said Ms. Martin. Only 10 percent of respondents aged 25 to 34 said they were ''very familiar'' with Christmas Seals, compared with nearly half of those over 65, according to research conducted by the association. 
 The association is trying to appeal to younger donors by promoting the campaign not just on television but online, with a Facebook application for sending virtual Christmas Seals to friends. On www.christmasseals.org, meanwhile, users can send e-cards featuring seals from as far back as the program's beginning, in 1907. On the Web site, the organization also is for the first time selling Christmas Seals merchandise, including cards and ornaments.
 The goal, said Susan Davis, chief development officer at the lung association, is to ''augment direct mail with e-philanthropy,'' the term for online giving. 
 The nonprofit claims that Christmas Seals was the country's first major direct mail campaign, but does not exactly expect kudos for that.
 ''We created direct mail -- we invented it,'' Ms. Davis said. ''I'm sure there are a lot of people who would like to beat us up these days because their mailboxes are so clogged.''
 Because it has no advertising budget, the campaign relies solely on donated airtime. This year ads will appear in six cities -- Chicago, Nashville, Omaha, Seattle, Raleigh, N.C., and Albany -- chosen for their geographical diversity and because they have reliably shown health-related public service announcements, according to Jeffrey Boal, the founder of PlowShare Group, a consulting group that analyzes P.S.A. trends that is working with the organization.
 The nonprofit hopes to run an advertising campaign more widely next year. 
 ''Christmas Seals is a very vital asset so we can't allow it to wither away,'' Ms. Davis said. ''But the question is can it bring in a younger audience to help me young up my donor base.''

 Museums
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: PATRICIA CRONIN: 'HARRIET HOSMER, LOST AND FOUND,' through Jan. 24. The contemporary New York artist Patricia Cronin channels the life and art of the 19th-century American sculptor Harriet Hosmer (1830-1908) in a show of watercolor depictions of Hosmer's works, both those that survived and those no longer traceable. Ms. Cronin has also published the watercolors -- including her ghost images of missing works -- in a scholarly book that stands as a Hosmer catalogue raisonne. The result is a complex package: a total work of art that is a historical document of the careers of two artists and a homage by one woman to another. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)20090917 
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'REFLECTIONS ON THE ELECTRIC MIRROR: NEW FEMINIST VIDEO,' through Jan. 10. Q: What is feminist video? A: A good way to reduce overcrowding in museums. Unless, that is, you are referring to this entertaining exhibition of recent videos by nine artists featuring the creators themselves as performers. Works by Klara Liden, Kate Gilmore, Cathy Begien and the team of Harry Dodge and Stanya Kahn are variously funny, dark and poetic. Starring in antique-looking, silent-movie-style commercials, Shannon Plumb is a wonderfully agile physical comedian. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20090917
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'THEY CALLED ME MAYER JULY: PAINTED MEMORIES OF A JEWISH CHILDHOOD IN POLAND BEFORE THE HOLOCAUST,' through Oct. 1. Introducing the reluctant painter and accidental memoirist Mayer Kirshenblatt, now 92, who has devoted the last two decades to documenting life between the wars in and around the provincial city of Opatow (Apt in Yiddish), Poland. Wrought with irresistible detail and folk-art dispatch, the paintings begin with his mother's kitchen and reflect an omnivorous curiosity about everyday everything, aided by an apparently photographic memory. Labels pick up where the paintings leave off; words and images combine in a marvel of a book accomplished in collaboration with the artist's daughter, a folklorist whose career choice was shaped by her father's stories. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street , (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)20090917
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2010. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20090917
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'VERMEER'S MASTERPIECE ''THE MILKMAID,'' ' through Nov. 29. This small contextual show surrounds ''The Milkmaid'' (1657-58) with all five of the Met's Vermeers and a smattering of domestic scenes by other 17th-century masters, among them Pieter de Hooch, Gabriel Metsu and Nicolaes Maes. The 18-inch-high ''Milkmaid'' is one of Vermeer's strangest and best works. In this arresting treatment of a prosaic subject -- a young woman laboring in the kitchen -- Vermeer forsakes his well-known optical sensations for earthier pleasures. And in unprecedented fashion, he endows this domestic worker with traits typically reserved for higher-class women: virtue, diligence and a rich interior life. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090917
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'CINNABAR: THE CHINESE ART OF CARVED LACQUER,' through Feb. 21. The exhibition's approximately 50 carved lacquer dishes, platters, boxes, vases and other domestic objects -- including a spectacular folding screen -- are as engrossing for their formal beauty as for their amazing craftsmanship. The pigment cinnabar gives them a rich, dark red color, and intricate patterns, ornamental animals and pastoral vignettes carved and incised into their lustrous surfaces make every object a pleasure to behold. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090917
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ROXY PAINE ON THE ROOF: MAELSTROM,' through Nov. 29. An awesome spectacle awaits visitors to the museum's roof garden: a gnarly thicket of trees and branches extending from one end of the open-air deck to the other. It looks as if a tornado had ripped through Central Park and deposited its gleanings here -- except that it is all made of shiny metal pipe, as if all that wood had been transformed by someone with a stainless-steel Midas touch. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090917
 MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'SCRIPTURE FOR THE EYES: BIBLE ILLUSTRATION IN NETHERLANDISH PRINTS OF THE 16TH CENTURY,' through Sept. 27. Abounding in sex, violence and supernatural happenings, the Bible has been a great source of inspiration for visual artists. This superb show features pieces by some of the biggest names in the history of Western printmaking. Woodcuts and engravings by Lucas van Leyden and Hendrick Goltzius alone would make a visit to the museum worthwhile, but among the 79 works on view there are lots more wildly imaginative and technically amazing feats of printmaking. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street , (212) 408-1500, mobia.org. (Johnson)20090917
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'RON ARAD: NO DISCIPLINE,' through Oct. 19. The first large American survey of this Israeli-born, London-based designer proves some of the virtues but many of the vices of its subtitle. Rambunctious, installed to poor advantage and ultimately inconclusive, it demonstrates with only mediocre results Mr. Arad's ambition to extend the design discipline into architecture and sculpture. There are too many toys for rich people here, along with evidence that when Mr. Arad sticks closest to functional design, he also comes closest to art. You have to set limits to transcend them. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090917
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'COMPASS IN HAND: SELECTIONS FROM THE JUDITH ROTHSCHILD FOUNDATION CONTEMPORARY DRAWINGS COLLECTION,' through Jan. 4. The Modern's largest gift of drawings -- a windfall of 2,500 works by 650 artists -- started out as a kind of stunt and matured without becoming a triumph. Initially a yearlong shopping binge in pursuit of a ''cross section'' of drawing at a certain moment, it also tried to fill decades-old gaps in the Modern's drawing collection, often with works by familiar names. These dominate the sampling of the gift: a lackluster exhibition of 354 works by 177 artists that emphasizes the Modern's ambivalence about moving beyond the Minimalism/Post-Minimalist canon, and its tendency to pick big or hot names over truly great drawings. The bottom line? Connoisseurship matters. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090917
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'WHAT WAS GOOD DESIGN? MOMA'S MESSAGE, 1944-1956,' through Nov. 30. With 102 objects and excellent labels, the Modern explores its role as arbiter of postwar American design, when, channeling the Bauhaus, it deemed good, affordable design a human right. Its campaign included exhibitions titled ''What Is Good Design?,'' design competitions and use of the MoMA seal of approval by selected department stores. Signature items like the Eames storage unit and the Chemex coffee maker mingle with surprises like a back-to-basics chair of string and wood by, of all people, Alexey Brodovitch, Harper's Bazaar's influential art director. The prevailing sense of beauty, restraint and economy is an implicit rebuke to today's inane material excesses. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090917
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MONET'S WATER LILIES,' through April 12. Devotees of late Monet can rejoice. The Museum of Modern Art has hung its three ''Water Lilies'' together for the first time since 2001, along with a relatively recent acquisition and two guests. That's six waterlily paintings, all completed in the last dozen years before the artist's death in 1926. In addition, these canvases are isolated from the onward march of Modernism according to MoMA, and their separateness emphasizes their meditative, immersive quality. But it also confirms their radical achievement. While bringing Monet's Impressionism to a grand conclusion, they also open the path to Abstract Expressionism. It can still stop you in your tracks. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090917
 NEUE GALERIE: 'FOCUS: OSKAR KOKOSCHKA, WORKS FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through Oct. 5. More a taste whetter than a substantial introduction, this exhibition presents six of the Expressionist portraits that made Kokoschka's reputation in the pre-World War I era and about 40 works on paper. The early paintings of eminent Viennese citizens still pack a considerable psychological punch. The gaunt, hollow-eyed ''Martha Hirsch (Dreaming Woman)'' projects an eerie, erotic charm, while her male counterparts resemble zombies and mad professors. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street , (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Johnson)20090917
 NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'DOROTHY IANNONE: LIONESS,' through Oct. 18. High priestess, matriarch, sex goddess: the self-taught American artist Dorothy Iannone has been called all these things and more. Now, at 75, Ms. Iannone is having her first solo show at an American museum. It includes just a smattering of early work: four paintings, one sculpture, an artist's book and a series of wooden cutouts. It is complemented, however, by an exhibition at the Anton Kern Gallery in Chelsea that spans the 1960s to the present. Both shows deliver an invigorating shock to an art world lulled, as of late, by the tasteful, conservative and blue-chip. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street , (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090917
 NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'INTERSECTIONS INTERSECTED: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF DAVID GOLDBLATT,' through Oct. 11. Celebrated internationally for his socially engaged photography, Mr. Goldblatt has been producing deceptively understated photographs in South Africa since the early '60s. His landscapes, urban scenes and portraits do not show the kinds of horrific images you might expect of witness-bearing photography in the land of apartheid and its violent aftermath, but their reticence speaks volumes. The 114 subtly elegant pictures in this slow-burning show cast a spell of love and mourning. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side , (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090917
 STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: HURVIN ANDERSON: 'PETER'S SERIES, 2007-2009,' through Oct. 25. These deft, photo-based oil paintings focus on an attic barbershop in London that caters to Caribbean immigrants like the artist's father. Seen from an unchanging perspective, this unassuming setting is subjected, from painting to painting, to a formal process of subtraction and addition. Isolated walls approach near abstraction, or sometimes resemble abstract paintings. Then furniture, mirrors and clients are reintroduced. The thinly painted images suggest a fragile, transient realm -- an immigrant's world, perhaps, or a place, shot through with a gentle melancholy, where we have all been at one point or another. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Smith)20090917
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'DAN GRAHAM: BEYOND,' through Oct. 11. This beautifully installed retrospective pays tribute to an influential artist who doesn't necessarily call himself that, and it tends to bear him out. Most impressive are a series of early Conceptual artworks involving surgically precise uses of language and magazines; a series of deadpan, Minimalist-inspired photographs of New Jersey architecture; and ''Rock My Religion,'' an imaginative video about the roots of rock 'n' roll. The video installations and walk-in glass-and-mirror pavilions -- admired because they are interactive -- quickly grow tedious or gimmicky. The many artists who claim Mr. Graham as precedent may surpass him, but there is more than one way to be important. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)20090917
 Galleries: 57th Street
 'PAUL JENKINS IN THE 1960S AND 1970S: SPACE, COLOR AND LIGHT,' through Sept. 25. While seriously overhung, this exhibition affords a rare, extensive look at the work of an artist who borrowed from Abstract Expressionism and then Color Field painting to devise flowing, billowing veils of color that dazzle with their formal acrobatics and luminous, jewel-toned hues. Working with his well-known ivory knives, Mr. Jenkins makes his colors leap, overlap and splinter, pitting them against whiplash lines and stark white backgrounds that increase their luminosity. His paintings have frequently been too gorgeous for their own good, which means that they can verge on slick. But the selection here shows him at the height of his powers. D. Wigmore Fine Art, 730 Fifth Avenue , (212) 581-1657, dwigmore.com. (Smith)20090917
 Galleries: Chelsea
 'PHASE TWO,' through Oct. 25. For a glimpse of the future of contemporary art, or at least a slice of that future, spend some time with the second round of exhibitions at X Initiative. Each of the three largest provides immersion in the work of a young, promising European artist working in time-based mediums. Luke Fowler's films about artists and eccentrics push the documentary form into art. Keren Cytter's visceral videos wreak havoc with numerous cinematic genres and a few from television. Tris Vonna-Michell combines slide projections and recordings of his rapid-fire spoken-word performances to trace his experiences in ways both random and crazily obsessive. X-Initiative, 548 West 22nd Street , (917) 697-4886, x-initiative.org. (Smith)20090917
 Galleries: SoHo
 TAUBA AUERBACH: 'HERE AND NOW/AND NOWHERE,' through Oct. 17. The two big dot paintings in this young artist's beautiful exhibition look like giant sheets of crumpled paper; up close they atomize into buzzing fields of black spots. Another series creates the illusion of creased and wrinkled pieces of single-color fabric. The main attraction, however, is an eccentric wooden pipe organ with half a keyboard at either end. At five o'clock every evening, two performers play a transporting duet. Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, (212) 343-7300, deitch.com. (Johnson)20090917
 Galleries: Other
 SARA GREENBERGER RAFFERTY: 'TEARS,' through Oct. 25. Pursuing her interest in popular culture, Ms. Rafferty has carved out some new ground in the crowded turf of appropriated and manipulated photographs. Her technique involves splashing water onto scanned and printed images of well-known comedians and actors -- Goldie Hawn, Vicki Lawrence, Bill Cosby and Madeline Kahn -- until the color runs. The results are mysterious wisps of personality and painterliness that hover on the brink of familiarity while also seeming tinged with violence. Despite their slightness, the best have an unexpected emotional force. Rachel Uffner Gallery, 47 Orchard Street, near Hester Street, Lower East Side , (212) 274-0064, racheluffnergallery.com. (Smith)20090917
 JACK TWORKOV: 'AGAINST EXTREMES -- FIVE DECADES OF PAINTING,' through Oct. 27. The painter Jack Tworkov (1900-82) made his name at the height of Abstract Expressionism, but he was never really comfortable with the angst-filled, tortured aspects of that movement. A noted intellectual and a sharp-eyed critic, he held his art to high, self-imposed standards of clarity and coherence. And, as this small survey confirms, he did more soul-searching on paper than on canvas. The 26 paintings on view are supplemented by journals, jottings and works on paper. Among the highlights are ''Pink Mississippi'' and ''Watergame,'' late-1950s abstractions that pit vertical against horizontal strokes and roseate pinks against steely blues. UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, at 51st Street, (212) 713-2885, ubs.com. (Rosenberg)20090917
 Out of Town
 NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART: 'THE ART OF POWER: ROYAL ARMOR AND PORTRAITS FROM IMPERIAL SPAIN,' through Nov. 1. Drawn from the Royal Armory in Madrid, one of the oldest and greatest repositories of armor in the world, this exhibition presents full suits of armor, as well as individual helmets, shields, swords and armor for horses. There are portraits of 16th- and 17th-century Spanish kings in armor, too, and three spectacular tapestries. But it is the sumptuous metalwork, produced not for warfare but for ceremonial occasions, that is the main attraction. National Mall, Fourth and Constitution Avenue NW, Washington , (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Johnson)20090917
 Last Chance
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'YINKA SHONIBARE MBE'; closes on Sunday. This is an important show for Mr. Shonibare, a British-Nigerian artist who emerged in the late 1990s and was made a member of the Order of the British Empire in 2005. His sculptural tableaus, which revolve around Victorian-era costumes made from 20th-century fabrics associated with Africa, are riotously colorful; their themes of frivolity and excess feel current. But with few exceptions, Mr. Shonibare serves his post-colonialism straight up. The show is rescued by smart integration with the permanent collection: a kind of scavenger hunt through the museum's American period rooms, where Mr. Shonibare's figures of children at play inhabit historical settings. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090917
 'THE FEMALE GAZE: WOMEN LOOK AT WOMEN'; closes on Saturday. With a photograph by the eminent Victorian photographer Julia-Margaret Cameron -- as well as paintings by Joan Mitchell and Marlene Dumas, a video by Lynda Benglis and recent sculptures by Louise Bourgeois and Vanessa Beecroft -- this exhibition not only counters the so-called male gaze traditional to Western art with instances of the female one, it also represents a complexity of viewpoints that throws the entire gender-based dichotomy into question. Lust, love, desire and the urge for power can all be found in the works here, some of which could easily have been made by men (not necessarily a bad thing). But there are also above-average levels of empathy, autonomy and dignity in play, and a fascinating process of recontextualization. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street , (212) 242-7727, cheimread.com. (Smith)20090917
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'AVEDON FASHION: 1944-2000'; closes on Sunday. The first museum retrospective devoted to Richard Avedon's fashion photography exudes a contagious joie de vivre. With postwar Paris as a stage set, Avedon made fashion photography new by adding movement and then narrative to his images, along with ironic self-awareness and a buoyant exuberance. The best of his early images are as perfect as the best work of Jackson Pollock or Jasper Johns from this period, and as profoundly representative of it. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street , (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Smith)20090917
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'AFGHANISTAN: HIDDEN TREASURES FROM THE NATIONAL MUSEUM, KABUL'; closes on Sunday. The 200 pre-Islamic objects in this important and moving show date from the Bronze Age to the first century A.D. They dropped from sight during the country's recent turmoil, which was deadly for both people and artwork alike. Courageous curators were their salvation; the rediscovery of the pieces was a moment of national thanksgiving. Consisting of vessels, sculpture, architectural ornaments, jewelry and furniture decoration made of bronze, stone, glass, ceramic, ivory, gold and gemstone, they attest to an astounding cosmopolitanism and diverse cultural heritage. Once, many trade routes led through Afghanistan, and proof of its former centrality is both dazzling and heartening. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20090917
 'NAKED!'; closes on Saturday. Although it includes some images of men, a more accurate title for this entertainingly lubricious exhibition would be ''Naked Women of Childbearing Age.'' A big part of the show's appeal is its wacky eclecticism. The 44 works range from a 1626 painting of the river god Alpheus chasing the nymph Arethusa, by Moyses van Uyttenbroeck, to Mel Ramos's 2007 sculpture of a voluptuous woman emerging from an open banana peel. Paul Kasmin Gallery, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street, Chelsea , (212) 563-4474, paulkasmingallery.com. (Johnson)20090917
 'PLOT/09: THIS WORLD & NEARER ONES'; closes on Sunday. The big draw in the city's first quadrennial of public art -- an exhibition of 19 site-specific works organized by Creative Time on Governors Island -- is the beautiful, haunted, car-free island itself. Standouts among the uneven melange of artworks include videos by Guido van der Werve, Adam Chodzko, Judi Werthein and the ingenious Bruce High Quality Foundation. Outdoors, beyond the dark rooms, Susan Philipsz, Teresa Margolles, Tue Greenfort, Mark Wallinger and especially Klaus Weber also add substance. But the degree of site-specificity fluctuates wildly, and the concept as a whole is inadvertently called into question. (212) 206-6674, creativetime.org. (Smith)20090917
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'SADIE BENNING: PLAY PAUSE'; closes on Sunday. A new stop-action animation by this former film prodigy uses an avalanche of simple, almost naive gouache drawings, sometimes tinted with color, to prowl the margins of urban society. The result is low-key with undercurrents: a picture of the everyday sublime riddled with suggestions of longing, otherness and the difficulties of connection. Solveig Nelson has provided its beautifully accurate (yet largely electronic) soundtrack of city sounds, whether a subway singer or squirrels rifling through a garbage can, people talking in a bar or gates being called in an airport.

HEADLINE: Communism and Capitalism Are Mixing in Laos

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER

DATELINE: VIENTIANE, Laos 

 BODY:
Hammer-and-sickle flags flutter above government offices in downtown Vientiane, and the entrance to the national museum is decorated with massive sculptures glorifying the workers' revolutionary struggle.
 Officially, this sparsely populated country is still communist -- and has been since 1975. But these days, that really depends on whom you ask.
 Three months ago the Obama administration declared that Laos, the country the United States tried so hard to prevent from toppling toward communism during the Vietnam War, had ''ceased to be a Marxist-Leninist country.''
 Following similar announcements in past decades for China and Vietnam, the White House made the declaration without fanfare in a June 12 memorandum that lifts a ban on Laotian companies from getting financing from the U.S. Export-Import Bank. 
 But in Vientiane, the capital, news of the U.S. policy change was perplexing for Klongmanee Boonliang, an amiable saleswoman in a government-run bookshop. Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin are still best sellers, she said.
 Every month, schools and offices buy 400 to 500 poster-size portraits of the two men and hang them in prominent places. ''The Smile of Lenin,'' one of several booklets praising Lenin on the shelves, also sells well.
 ''He was a brave and smart person,'' she said, offering an impromptu homily to the founder of Soviet communism. ''Everyone wants to get lessons from him. It's still important.''
 What to make of Laos, the former French colony that became a focal point of great powers during the Vietnam War, only to slide back into obscurity once the Cold War ended?
 Landlocked and mountainous, Laos has long had a reputation as more somnolent than its hard-charging neighbors. Today, however, Vientiane's streets are filled with the hallmarks of conspicuous consumption -- Hummers, Mercedes and other fancy cars. Purse snatchings are on the rise, a sign perhaps that people have more to steal. In a center-city gym, a group of high school girls spend their evenings practicing dance moves that might make teenagers in Los Angeles blush, let alone the ashen-faced members of the Lao Politburo.
 Capitalism is making inroads in Laos, but mastering the ideology might require some re-education. The country is scheduled to open its first stock exchange next year, a plan that prompted a local newspaper to run a series of articles offering a glossary of capitalist terms (''A stock market itself is like any other market,'' said a recent explanatory article. ''Everything has a price.'')
 The official line from the government is that Laos is a one-party democracy -- only members of the Communist Lao People's Revolutionary Party are allowed to contest elections.
 ''Marxist-Leninist theory is practical and is suitable for the current situation in Laos,'' President Choummaly Sayasone said in a speech to military veterans earlier this year that was reported in the English-language Vientiane Times.
 Yet even some government offices are enthusiastically entrepreneurial. Provincial authorities have encouraged the construction of lucrative casinos that cater to Chinese and Thai gamblers (Lao citizens are not allowed). And in Vientiane, the Foreign Ministry charges 1 million kip, about $120, as a ''registration fee'' for visiting journalists and $24 for every day in the country -- princely sums for this impoverished country.
 Laos is, above all, divided between the rising incomes of Vientiane and a handful of other towns and the poverty of the countryside, where most of the country's seven million people live -- and where ideology of any stripe can seem irrelevant.
 In a village about 15 miles outside Vientiane, Thai Lee, a rice farmer, said he had never heard of Marx.
 Lenin? He guessed he might be a famous Vietnamese leader.
 ''If I had studied more, I might know more about it,'' Mr. Lee said.
 Even during the Cold War, Laos was never a communist country in the style of the more industrialized and developed Soviet satellites in Europe.
 Efforts to establish farming communes in the early 1980s were so unpopular that they were abandoned within a few years. And children in Laos are often educated in Buddhist schools, where Marx and Lenin take a back seat to Siddhartha.
 Although the cities show signs of newfound wealth, Laos is also too poor overall to be a textbook communist government capable of providing for all of its people. The government is so skeletal that public spending makes up only 11 percent of the country's economy, according to World Bank numbers, compared with more than double that level in the world's capitalist headquarters, the United States.
 Politically, Laos remains authoritarian, and dissent from the party line is banned. But there have been signs of glasnost, the openness that Mikhail Gorbachev described in the dying days of the Soviet Union.
 The National Assembly, the country's Parliament, inaugurated a hot line two years ago, encouraging citizens to call in with complaints, which were researched and in some cases aired publicly. Earlier this year, the government passed a law allowing citizens to form nonprofit organizations, a move that chips away at the Communist Party's monopoly on political life.
 ''Civil society in Laos is still very immature at the moment, but it's growing,'' said Viengsamay Srithirath, a communications officer at the World Bank office in Vientiane. ''You see a number of grass-roots organizations coming up.''
 For the United States, the decision to change Laos's Marxist-Leninist status might be seen as a belated coda to the Secret War, the effort by the U.S. government four decades ago to keep Laos from becoming communist and to interdict Vietnamese supply lines through the Ho Chi Minh trail, much of which ran through Laos.
 The war, conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency and kept secret because it violated Laos's neutrality, featured tens of thousands of hill tribe mercenaries on the U.S. payroll and a devastating bombing campaign.
 The bombings ultimately failed to shut down the Ho Chi Minh trail, and Lao communist forces, backed by Vietnam and China, were victorious in 1975.
 Ravic Huso, the current U.S. ambassador to Laos, says the decision to change Laos's Marxist-Leninist status was not a comment on the country's political system.
 ''Are they still a one-party state? Yes,'' Mr. Huso said during an interview in his office. ''The legislation was not intended to apply to that. It was intended to apply to the way the economy was run.''
 In the June memorandum, President Barack Obama said, ''I hereby determine that The Lao People's Democratic Republic has ceased to be a Marxist-Leninist country.'' The memo includes a reference to the U.S. Export-Import Bank's definition of Marxist economies.
 The definition reads: '''Marxist-Leninist country' means any country that maintains a centrally planned economy based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism, or is economically and militarily dependent on any other such country.'' 
 The change in U.S. policy was years in the making, Mr. Huso said. Cambodia was removed from the list at the same time. Only North Korea and Cuba remain, he said.
 So, is Laos communist?
 Southanom Inthavong, the head of the country's Olympic Committee who has graduate degrees from universities in Moscow and Minnesota, answers the question with a question.
 ''What is China today?''

HEADLINE: Unmasking the Ghosts

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER and DUFF WILSON

 BODY:
The scientific integrity of medical research has been clouded in recent years by articles that were drafted by drug company-sponsored ghostwriters and then passed off as the work of independent academic authors. 
 Yet the leading medical journals have continued to rely largely on an honor system of disclosure to detect such potential bias, asking authors to voluntarily report any industry ties or contributors to their manuscripts.
 But now, in light of recently released evidence that some drug makers have gone to great lengths to turn scientific articles into marketing vehicles for their products, some influential medical editors are cracking down on industry-financed ghostwriting. And they are getting help from some members of Congress. 
 These editors are demanding that journals impose tougher disclosure policies for academic authors and that the journals enforce their own rules by actively investigating the provenance of manuscripts and by punishing authors who play down extensive contributions by ghostwriters. 
 In medical journal circles, the exorcism of industry-financed editorial assistance even has its own name: ghostbusting. 
 In an editorial last week calling for a zero tolerance policy, the editors of the medical journal PLoS Medicine, from the Public Library of Science, called for journals to identify and retract ghostwritten articles and banish their authors. 
 ''Any papers where this breach is substantiated should be immediately retracted,'' the editors wrote. ''Authors found to have not declared such interest should be banned from any subsequent publication in the journal and their misconduct reported to their institutions.''
 In the past, researchers have raised allegations of ghostwriting in articles about quality-of-life drugs like antidepressants, painkillers and diet pills. But the situation has become more serious this year after a few editors said they had discovered ghostwriting in manuscripts about life-and-death products like cancer and hematology drugs.
 As Washington tries to revamp the health care system, concerns about ghostwriting are taking on new urgency. One of the underlying assumptions of the health care overhaul effort is that money can be saved and medical care improved by relying more heavily on research showing which drugs and procedures are the most effective. But experts fear that the process could be corrupted if research articles are skewed by the hidden influence of drug or medical device makers. 
 One senator on the trail of ghostwriting is Charles E. Grassley, a Republican of Iowa and a member of the Senate Finance Committee, which has taken a leading role in the health overhaul effort.
 In July, Mr. Grassley wrote letters asking eight leading medical journals about their ghostwriting policies. He also asked whether, since 2004, the journals had taken action against any author who had failed to report the involvement of a third party in the development of a manuscript.
 None of the editors reported taking action against an author for ghostwriting. Their replies to the senator, obtained by The New York Times, varied from assurances of editorial diligence to the equivalent of ''don't ask, don't tell.'' One editor in chief, for example, wrote that because his journal prohibited ghostwriting, the publication did not have a specific policy on the practice. 
 Journals without explicit ghostwriting rules can expect to hear more from the senator.
 ''Objective research is really at the heart of public trust in medicine,'' Mr. Grassley wrote in an e-mail message to a reporter last Friday. 
 Allegations of ghostwriting first surfaced several years ago in the promotion of the diet drug combination fen-phen, which was taken off the market because of safety concerns in 1997, and the painkiller Vioxx, withdrawn in 2004. And last month, documents made public in litigation against the pharmaceutical giant Wyeth showed that the company had paid a medical writing firm to draft articles, published through 2005, favorable to its Premarin family of hormone drugs even as evidence mounted that certain hormone drugs could increase the risk of breast cancer.
 Some researchers say industry ghostwriting is widespread and continuing. Even with disclosure policies already in effect at many publications, unnamed authors played a role in more than 40 articles published last year at six major medical journals, according to a study made public last week. That study, conducted by an editorial team at The Journal of the American Medical Association, or JAMA, defined ghostwriting broadly as any uncredited significant contribution to research or writing, regardless of whether it was financed by industry.
 Over the last few years, international associations of medical journal editors have developed stricter disclosure criteria for authors of and contributors to scientific manuscripts. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, for example, defines an author as a person who makes a substantial contribution to developing a study or analyzing its results and in drafting a manuscript, and who approves the final version of an article. Authors should identify other contributors to an article and their financing sources, according to the group.
 Drug companies say they are about to put these publication principles into effect for clinical trials.
 ''The pharmaceutical industry is moving in lock step with the editors of medical journals,'' Jeffrey K. Francer, assistant general counsel of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, an industry trade group for drug makers, said in an interview last week. The new standards are to take effect in October, he said.
 But even though disclosure policies are already in place at many journals, the new JAMA study found a ghostwriting rate of more than 7 percent at JAMA and PLoS Medicine, and nearly 11 percent at the New England Journal of Medicine. Joseph S. Wislar, who led the study, said in an interview last week that The New England Journal of Medicine may have had a higher rate because the journal did not require lead authors to list all other contributors.
 Editors of The New England Journal of Medicine said that they were puzzled by and skeptical of the JAMA data, but confirmed that the publication left such disclosures to the discretion of authors.
 Experts who study disclosure said authorship policies might be inadequate in part because they asked for incomplete information, but also because they typically had no teeth.
 ''Requiring someone to write a retraction or barring them from publishing in academic journals for some period of time -- that would be an effective deterrent,'' said George Loewenstein, a professor of economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh who has conducted research on the effect of conflict-of-interest disclosures in medicine.
 A few editors said they were already taking tougher stances after discovering their disclosure policies had allowed authors to acknowledge writers financed by drug companies without explaining that the paid writers played primary roles in creating the manuscripts.
 The problem of incomplete disclosure is particularly worrisome for opinion pieces like review articles, in which an author brings a personal perspective to a wide body of research, according to an editorial in The Oncologist. 
 ''These articles are likely to influence the direction of new investigation as well as the practice of oncology,'' wrote Dr. Bruce A. Chabner, the clinical director of the cancer center at Massachusetts General Hospital and the editor in chief of The Oncologist. ''It is critical that such articles represent the unbiased views of the authors, and not those of a ghostwriter or a drug's sponsor.''
 The Oncologist plans to continue publishing clinical trials sponsored by drug companies, Dr. Chabner wrote. But the journal no longer accepts opinion pieces that involve writers with ties to companies that have a commercial interest in an article's content -- nor will its editors correspond with hired writers who are not named as the authors of manuscripts. 
 Mr. Francer, of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said such measures could be detrimental because they could ''chill research and chill support for research.''
 But the trend may be too far along to deter. 
 In January, editors at Blood, the journal of the American Society of Hematology, discovered that an unsolicited manuscript submitted by a prominent researcher involved significant contributions from a pharmaceutical company employee named in the acknowledgments -- a major role in the manuscript that should have qualified the employee to be listed as an author of the paper. Further detective work quickly turned up two other ghostwritten manuscripts.
 Editors decided to make their discoveries public in an editorial titled '' 'Ghostbusting' at Blood'' in which they wrote that the journal would henceforth reject opinion pieces that had industry ties. 
 In an interview last month, Dr. Cynthia E. Dunbar, the editor in chief of Blood, said that, in the future, the journal would consider a ban of several years for authors caught lying about ghostwriting, in addition to retracting their ghosted articles.
 But, said Dr. Dunbar, who is a hematologist at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, ''I hope we don't have to do that.''

HEADLINE: Scathing Report on Border Security Is Issued

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Government auditors reported Thursday that the effort to secure the Mexican border with technology and fences has fallen years behind schedule, will cost billions of dollars extra in maintenance costs and has no clear means of gauging whether illegal crossings have been curtailed. 
 Mark Borkowski, who directs the Secure Border Initiative for the Department of Homeland Security, stood by the program as ''transformational,'' but did not challenge the findings. ''We are as frustrated as anybody is'' with the setbacks, Mr. Borkowski said in an interview.
 The report, by the Government Accountability Office, Congress's watchdog, said the department had fallen about seven years behind its goal of putting in place the technology the Bush administration had heavily promoted when it announced the Secure Border Initiative in 2005.
 In 2006, the report said, the department estimated it would have a system of cameras, radars and sensors in place to aid a force of border guards by the end of 2009, but the completion date is now projected as 2016.
 ''Flaws found in testing and concerns about the impact of placing towers and access roads in environmentally sensitive locations caused delays,'' said Richard M. Stana, an author of the report. The cameras and radars, a ''virtual fence'' in a system designed by the contractor, Boeing, have fallen prey to weather and mechanical problems.
 The effort to build 661 miles of fences blocking vehicles or pedestrians is nearly complete, but with 28 miles left to go, it has been delayed by lawsuits from landowners in Texas. 
 The government has spent $2.4 billion on such ''physical infrastructure,'' but the report said it could cost $6.5 billion over 20 years to maintain it.
 For all the money spent, the department has not set up a way to evaluate the fences' impact, relying mainly on the judgment of senior Border Patrol agents.
 Mr. Borkowski said the government auditors were overly ''pessimistic,'' and, while he offered no guarantees, he predicted the system would prove successful. He said the department was studying ways to judge its success beyond managers' opinions.
 The apprehension of illegal immigrants at the border has fallen to lows not seen in decades, but scholars and Mexican officials say the recession and the lack of jobs in the United States have contributed to the drop.
 Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi and the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said in response to the report that department officials needed to get the Secure Border Initiative ''right or find an alternative technology solution.''

HEADLINE: Old Master Steps Out, Heading To Market

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
A Rembrandt portrait that has been hidden in a private collection and not seen by the public for nearly 40 years is being sold at Christie's in London on Dec. 8. 
 ''Portrait of a Man, Half-Length, With His Arms Akimbo,'' from 1658, depicts an unknown sitter, his expression imperious and his pose self-assured. Experts at Christie's say it could fetch $29.7 million to $41.2 million, the highest estimate ever for an old master painting coming to auction.
 Too bad Rembrandt is not around to reap some of the profit. The year he painted the portrait he was forced to sell his house and move to a small studio, having declared bankruptcy two years earlier. 
 Although Christie's will say only that the painting is from a ''distinguished private collection,'' the seller is well known in the old-master world and a regular seller at auction. She is Barbara Piasecka Johnson, the Polish-born collector who once lived in Princeton, N.J., and now makes her home in Assisi, Italy. Ms. Johnson inherited about $300 million from her husband, J. Seward Johnson, son of the founder of the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical company, after he died in 1983. Over the years she has sold paintings, furniture and decorative objects at both Sotheby's and Christie's. As recently as July she auctioned a group of less important old master paintings at Sotheby's in London. 
 The portrait has a rich history. It was first shown publicly in 1847, when it was included in an exhibition at the British Institution in London, on loan from George Folliott, a notable British collector. His grandson sold it in 1930 at Sotheby's, where it brought $:18,500, then a huge price. Soon after that it was acquired by George Huntington Hartford II, the supermarket heir, who was in his 20s at the time. He donated it to Columbia University in 1958, and it hung in the president's office until 1968, when, because of student demonstrations, it was removed for safekeeping and put in storage. 
 In 1970 Columbia lent it to ''Rembrandt After 300 Years,'' an exhibition at the Detroit Institute of Arts. That was the last time it was seen in public. Four years later Harold Diamond, a New York dealer, sold it to the Johnsons on behalf of the university, which used the proceeds to benefit an endowment fund. The only other known Rembrandt executed the same year is a self-portrait in the Frick Collection. ''It has a similar monumental presence,'' said Nicholas Hall, international director of the old master and 19th-century art department at Christie's. ''Both are painted with a gravity and a monumentality.'' 
 WHERE FLAT RULES
 The public has seen all kinds of things at City Hall Park besides screaming protesters and grandstanding politicians. A herd of two-dimensional white sheep was once installed there, as well as hulking figures that at first seemed to be molded out of colorful dripping wax and even a 25-foot-high twisted chimney. 
 Next will be a group of 13 sculptures, from 8 to 10 feet tall, with an eerie familiarity. If you think you're seeing Michelangelo's ''David'' or Picasso's ''She Goat'' or Barnett Newman's ''Broken Obelisk'' or Rodin's ''Thinker,'' you are. But in silhouette and fashioned from inch-thick aluminum painted black. 
 The work of the New York artist Peter Coffin, the exhibition, ''Untitled (Sculpture Silhouettes),'' will be on view from October through May. The artist's first outdoor New York exhibition features his personal take on art history's greatest hits. 
 Some of Mr. Coffin's silhouettes, like ''She Goat'' or Louise Bourgeois's ''Untitled (With Hand, 1989),'' were made specially for this exhibition. Others have been shown before, in Los Angeles, Miami and elsewhere. 
 ''It seemed like the perfect project for City Hall,'' said Susan K. Freedman, president of the Public Art Fund. ''It's very accessible and hopefully will encourage people to think about art.'' 
 Visitors who call the city's information line, 311, can hear recorded commentary by the artist. They can also do their own compare-and-contrast exercise by viewing many of the real works in New York City museums. Picasso's ''She Goat'' and Newman's ''Broken Obelisk,'' for instance, can be found at the Museum of Modern Art. 
 ON AGAIN AT YALE 
 Like so many architectural projects, the second phase of the Yale University Art Gallery renovation and expansion that was to have begun in January was instead suspended that month because of the tanking economy. 
 In a surprising reversal of fortune, the gallery said this week that Jock Reynolds, its director, was able to raise the necessary money for the project to go ahead. It will resume next month. 
 Three years ago Polshek Partnership Architects, a New York firm, completed the first part of the work, the renovation of its 1953 Louis I. Kahn building. But the gallery found itself $30 million short of the $76 million needed to carry out Phase 2 -- joining three buildings that stand next to one another but represent very different styles. They are the modernist Kahn building, the Italianate Gothic-style Swartwout building and a Victorian Gothic by Peter Bonnett Wight. The project will significantly increase space for the educational museum's galleries and classrooms. 
 Between April and August Mr. Whitney was able to raise the remaining money from several private donors, said Jill Westgard, the gallery's deputy director for museum resources and stewardship. The entire project is to open in 2012. During the construction the Kahn building will remain open, with a full schedule of programs.
 RECALLING FLAVIN
 Dan Flavin, the minimalist sculptor who died in 1996, spent his life producing graceful light sculptures. But what happens when a bulb breaks? And how easy are they for collectors to install? 
 The Chelsea dealer David Zwirner has just begun to represent the artist's estate. On Friday he is starting a Web site (davidzwirner.com/danflavin) that is intended as a practical resource for Flavin aficionados, covering issues of conservation and installation as well as the artist's exhibition history and examples of his work. 
 In November his gallery will present ''Dan Flavin: Series and Progressions,'' a show that includes work from Flavin's four-decade career, including his earliest pieces from 1964, ''Nominal III,'' and a series that was originally shown in the 1970s at the German art dealer Heiner Friedrich's gallery in Munich. 
 NEW LEADER FOR DEALERS
 The Art Dealers Association of America has selected a new president. She is Lucy Mitchell-Innes, an owner of Mitchell-Innes & Nash, the Madison Avenue gallery, and a former head of contemporary art at Sotheby's. Ms. Mitchell-Innes succeeds Roland Augustine, the Chelsea dealer.

HEADLINE: After an 11-Month High, Markets Take a Breather

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks fell slightly Thursday, pulling benchmark indexes down from 11-month highs on concern the rally outpaced prospects for earnings growth as FedEx and Oracle reported sales that missed analysts' estimates.
 Shares of FedEx slid 2.23 percent, while Oracle stock dropped 2.76 percent. Chesapeake Energy and Nabors Industries led energy shares lower. Verizon Communications lost 3 percent.
 ''We're in rarefied air here,'' said Peter Kenny, the managing director in institutional sales at Knight Equity Markets in Jersey City. ''We've had lots of good economic news, lots of stocks that have moved very dramatically. We need a breather.'' 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 0.31 percent, or 3.27 points, to 1,065.49. On Wednesday, the index closed at the highest level since Oct. 3. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 7.79 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 9,783.92.
 The Nasdaq composite index was down 6.40 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,126.75.
 In Japan, the Nikkei 225 stock average rose 173.03 points, to 10,443.80 after the central bank raised its assessment of the country's economy.
 Equities rallied in early trading on upbeat data for jobs and manufacturing. Speculation that government measures will help revive the economy and better-than-estimated earnings at companies from Goldman Sachs Group to Johnson & Johnson have spurred a 57 percent rally in the S.& P. 500 from a 12-year low on March 9.
 The dollar was within a cent of the lowest level versus the euro in a year as the manufacturing gain and an unexpected drop in initial jobless claims spurred investors to sell the greenback and buy higher-yielding assets. It fell to $1.4749 a euro, from $1.4723 on Wednesday.
 ''It's tough to buck this trend of dollar weakness,'' said Sacha Tihanyi, a currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto. ''The numbers are reasonably positive. In the current environment, it's hard to call a turn.''
 Treasuries rose amid speculation that recovery from the worst economic slump in seven decades will be slow. The price on the 10-year note rose 23/32, to 102 while the yield fell to 3.38, from 3.47 late Wednesday.
 The Treasury market's inability to drive yields below resistance levels will lead to lower prices as investors prepare for auctions, according to RBS Securities. The government plans to sell a record $112 billion in two-, five- and seven-year notes next week. The government has raised $1.2 trillion in new cash this year through sales of debt.
 ''Economic growth is slow, which justifies lower rates,'' said Lawrence Dyer, an interest-rate strategist in New York at HSBC Securities USA, one of 18 primary dealers that trade with the Federal Reserve. ''There is still uncertainty about what 2010 will bring when the Federal Reserve's support winds down.''
 Housing starts in August rose to the highest level in nine months and manufacturing in the Philadelphia region expanded more than forecast in September. The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits fell unexpectedly last week.
 Crude oil was little changed as optimism that the United States is pulling out of the recession was tempered by ample petroleum inventories in the world's biggest energy consumer.
 A government report on Wednesday showed that supplies of crude oil, gasoline and distillate fuel, a category that includes heating oil and diesel, were higher than average last week.
 ''A lot of what we are seeing is a reaction to what's happening in the financial markets,'' said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Mass. ''The fundamentals of the oil market are poor. At some point, attention will have to be paid to them.''

HEADLINE: Banker Pay to Face Global Limits at G-20 Session

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE

 BODY:
European Union leaders on Thursday agreed to use the Group of 20 meeting next week in Pittsburgh to press for binding global rules on bankers' pay and new controls on bonuses, but avoided any explicit call for a ceiling on remuneration. 
 The agreement, reached at a three-hour meeting over dinner in Brussels, allows European nations to go to Pittsburgh united behind a call for new global rules ''backed up by the threat of sanctions at a national level.''
 The accord, supported by all 27 European Union nations, called for the major part of bonuses to be deferred over time, ensuring that they ''could be canceled in case of a negative development in the bank's performance.''
 The meeting was the culmination of weeks of negotiation among European countries, with France and Germany determined to take a strong message to the G-20 to put pressure on President Obama. The leaders of both countries blame excessive risk-taking by bankers, motivated by the prospect of bonuses, for part of the economic crisis.
 ''Europe is united on a strong political message,'' Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, said. 
 The idea of a ceiling has been opposed in London and in Washington, where it was seen as unworkable. 
 But, speaking before the summit meeting, the British prime minister, Gordon Brown, endorsed the principle of extending payments over several years and clawing back bonuses ''if they were not owned over a long period of time.'' There was, he added, ''no going back to the bonus structure of the past.''
 In a statement, the European leaders called on the G-20 to ensure that bonuses ''be set at an appropriate level in relation to fixed remuneration and made dependent on performances of the bank, the business unit and individuals; taking due account of negative developments, so as to avoid guaranteed bonuses.'' 
 On climate change, Fredrik Reinfeldt, the prime minister of Sweden, which holds the European Union's rotating presidency, said that while the bloc welcomed draft climate change legislation by the United States Congress, more needed to be done ''to reach the levels we have in Europe.'' 
 The European Union wants others to match its pledge to cut emissions by at least 20 percent by 2020. In their statement, European leaders called on the United States and others to ''urgently make ambitious commitments'' to deeper cuts. 
 It said that the costs of helping poorer countries adapt to climate change and prevent the worse problems could amount to 100 billion euros annually by 2020.

HEADLINE: AMR Raises $2.9 Billion, and Its Shares Soar

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines, said it had raised $2.9 billion in troubled credit markets and would shift to more profitable routes.
 Investors viewed the improved cash position and outlook for growth positively, sending the company's shares soaring nearly 20 percent to $8.80 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 In a letter to employees, Gerard J. Arpey, AMR's chief executive, said the company's ability to raise money in troubled capital markets was a vote of confidence from lenders. But he expressed caution as the company tries to find its way out of the economic downturn.
 ''The fact is, we cannot borrow our way to prosperity,'' Mr. Arpey said. ''Moreover, the bar we must get over just got higher, since the additional debt we have taken on will mean higher interest expenses going forward.''
 The $2.9 billion, which includes cash and financing, will help AMR meet some of its debt commitments. That includes $1 billion from the advance sale of frequent flier miles to Citigroup and a $280 million loan from GE Capital Aviation Services, secured by company-owned planes.
 AMR also received $1.6 billion in sale-leaseback financing commitments from GE Capital Aviation for Boeing planes AMR had ordered.
 On Wednesday, United Airlines' parent company, UAL Corporation, said it had liquidity initiatives planned for this year. AMR also said it would reallocate service to its hubs in Dallas/Fort Worth, Chicago, Miami and New York. Chicago will be most affected by the shift, where AMR said it would add 57 daily flights at O'Hare International Airport to the summer 2010 schedule compared with the winter routes. St. Louis will have the deepest service cuts, with 46 daily departures eliminated.
 Airlines in the United States have been downsizing since last year, struggling to match supply with falling demand. AMR has trimmed its consolidated capacity -- which includes its regional partners -- by 11 percent for the 2009 schedule compared with 2007.
 But as signs of stability in travel demand return, AMR expects a slight increase in its consolidated capacity next year.

HEADLINE: U.N. Chief Says Working Poor Still Suffer

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS 

 BODY:
While economists in developed nations are cautiously pointing to the first signs of renewed economic growth, the global financial crisis is slamming some of the working poor around the world, Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, said Thursday. 
 ''There is talk of green shoots of recovery, but our data show another picture,'' Mr. Ban told a news conference. ''It is not the chronic poor who are most affected, but the near and working poor whose lives had improved significantly over the past decade.'' 
 Although the ability of the United Nations or any other global entity to collect accurate figures about poverty is in dispute, a point Mr. Ban conceded, there is general consensus that the poorest people in the world are staggering from the impact of the crisis. 
 Some 100 heads of state and government are expected to gather at the United Nations in New York beginning next Tuesday for what the organization is calling its biggest annual assembly ever. Much of the focus will be on climate change, with a special meeting on the subject the first day. 
 But Mr. Ban also wants to highlight the need to keep aid flowing in the middle of still-turbulent economic times. He compiled a report, ''Voices of the Vulnerable,'' which he distributed to all the foreign missions on Thursday and plans to make a centerpiece of his own address to the General Assembly. 
 It includes a variety of grim figures: 
 As many as 222 million workers run the risk of joining the ranks of the working poor, earning less than $1.25 a day, according to an estimate by the International Labor Organization. 
 Remittance flows, which reached $328 billion in 2008, will drop by 7.3 percent in 2009, the World Bank predicts.
 Hunger rates are up in every region in the world, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization. 
 There are also figures for how many people would be viewed as living below the poverty line, with the report suggesting it will be more than 1.3 billion people, up by more than 100 million in 2009. 
 But there is no consensus on that number. New World Bank figures suggest that while the overall number of poor people is falling, it is not falling as fast as it might. There are 50 million people living in poverty, defined as those making less than $1.25 a day, who might have climbed out in the absence of the economic crisis, said Martin Ravallion, director of the Development Research Group at the World Bank. 
 ''If it wasn't for the crisis, the number of impoverished would have been 50 million lower,'' he said, noting the trend was continuing, with data for this year still incomplete. 
 Some economists dispute the data, claiming that the United Nations is pushing numbers that have little basis in reality to justify its own programs. 
 ''When you start talking about the number of people who live on less than $1.25 a day, we just don't have any hard evidence for that,'' said Prof. William Easterly, the co-director of the Development Research Institute at New York University. ''Talking about the acuity of the crisis based on these numbers is more of a political exercise than an exercise in real analysis -- they want to raise the moral urgency.''
 Mr. Ban acknowledged in the report that despite its far-flung agencies, the United Nations lacks real-time data to gauge the full extent of the problem. ''The current snapshot is in shades of gray, not full color,'' he wrote. 
 One of his proposals is for the international community to provide the financing for just such a global data-collection system.
 The idea that the effects of the economic crisis, with its plunging employment rates and dropping demand for raw materials, have been delayed across the developing world is more a matter of anecdotes. ''The economic crisis generally has hit poor countries later than it did the rich world,'' said Jon Slater, the spokesman for Oxfam International, based in London. ''Rather than hit by the financial collapse, they were hit by falling trade flows, falling investments, falling remittances.''
 Unemployment numbers also tend to reflect the loss of jobs in developed nations that track such figures much more closely. In poorer countries, employment tends to be much more diffuse as more family members take the lowest-paying jobs in order to survive, said Lawrence J. Johnson, chief of the employment trends group at the I.L.O. Those coping mechanisms have also been battered by recent events -- drought, then rising food prices, then the financial crisis. 
 The most pessimistic estimates on employment and the working poor may not be reached, however, because some global companies are beginning to increase their demand for raw materials from poorer nations, which tends to help better-paying jobs, he said.

HEADLINE: Obama Seeks National Oversight of Waters

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN

 BODY:
The Obama administration called Thursday for a comprehensive national system for regulating the use of federal waters along the nation's marine and Great Lakes shores, now administered by a hodgepodge of federal, state or other agencies with often-conflicting goals. 
 The recommendation, outlined in an interim report by a panel appointed in June by President Obama, said regulators should consider marine regions as a whole when issuing rules rather than, say, regulating fishing one species at a time. 
 It also said they should keep the health of marine ecosystems in mind when allocating particular activities in particular places, like fishing, shipping or energy. 
 The report says this planning would be the major focus of its final report, due in December. The panel comprises representatives of environmental, transportation and other agencies.
 The interim report also calls for greater integration of environment-related science in federal rule-making and the creation of a National Ocean Council to oversee the effort. 
 ''The oceans sustain life on earth,'' Jane Lubchenco, administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said at a telephone news conference about the report. ''In turn, we must commit to sustaining the oceans.''
 Many groups have long urged a more integrated approach to regulating federal waters. More than half the nation's population lives in marine or Great Lakes coastal counties, they point out, many of them in low-lying areas threatened by climate change and rising seas. 
 Fishing and other shore-related tourism in those counties adds tens billions of dollars and millions of jobs to the economy, even as many coastal areas suffer overdevelopment, overfishing, habitat loss, pollution and other environmental woes.
 ''Sometimes we have competing economic, ecological, recreation or other interests,'' Rear Adm. Sally Brice-O'Hara of the Coast Guard said at the news conference. ''We welcome a comprehensive national approach.'' 
 The Pew Oceans Commission, a private group, and a federal ocean commission made similar points in reports in 2003 and 2004, urging the establishment of a wide-ranging federal regulatory regime for the coast. 
 In response, President George W. Bush in 2004 appointed a Commission on Ocean Policy, but the new report said ''numerous parties'' on and off that panel were critical of its work. 
 In a statement, the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative, a collaboration between the original Pew and federal commissions, said the new effort would ''significantly advance the effort to develop a strong, cohesive and effective'' management system for marine and Great Lakes coasts.

HEADLINE: Net Wealth Rose in 2nd Quarter

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Americans' wealth rose this spring for the first time in nearly two years, with stocks and home values gaining as the recession faded.
 Still, household net worth remains about 19 percent below its peak in the third quarter of 2007, before the recession began. 
 The Federal Reserve said net worth grew by $2 trillion, to $53.1 trillion in the April-to-June quarter. Net worth, or the value of assets like homes, checking accounts and investments minus debts like mortgages and credit cards, rose nearly 4 percent from the first quarter, the Fed said.
 Even with the gain, Americans' net worth stands well below the $65.3 trillion it reached two years ago.
 The second quarter increase in net worth was the first since wealth peaked. According to the Fed report, the pickup was led by gains in stock portfolios. The value of Americans' stock holdings rose 21.6 percent from the first quarter.
 Net worth in the second quarter also was bolstered by higher home prices. The value of real estate holdings rose 1.8 percent, according to the Fed report.
 This week, the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said the worst recession since the 1930s probably was over. Most analysts say the United States economy is growing in the current quarter, which ends Sept. 30, at an annual rate of 3 to 4 percent. The economy shrank at a 1 percent pace in the second quarter, much slower than in previous quarters.
 Mr. Bernanke warned that the pace of recovery probably would not be brisk enough to generate solid job growth and keep the unemployment rate -- now at a 26-year high of 9.7 percent -- from rising.
 Collectively, homeowners had 43.1 percent equity in their homes in the second quarter, according to the Fed report. That was up only slightly from 41.9 percent in the first quarter.

HEADLINE: FedEx Is Upbeat, Despite a 53% Drop in Quarterly Profit

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
FedEx reported a 53 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday as the worldwide economic downturn continued to weigh on shipping volumes.
 But the company, an economic bellwether, said most of its markets were continuing to show signs of improvement, raising the prospect of a wider rebound that might help lift other companies and sectors out of the slump. 
 ''Confidence appears to be improving, the housing sector seems to have bottomed and the auto sales have picked up,'' Frederick W. Smith, the chairman, chief executive and president of FedEx, said in a conference call to discuss the results. ''These are encouraging signs of a more stable economy.''
 FedEx said it planned to increase shipping rates in the United States an average of 5.9 percent for domestic and export services, effective Jan. 4, a sign of confidence in a market where excess capacity had been pressuring pricing.
 FedEx reported a profit of $181 million, or 58 cents a share, for the first quarter that ended on Aug. 31, down from $384 million, or $1.23 a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 20 percent to $8.01 billion, from $9.97 billion a year ago.
 Lower energy prices weighed on the company's numbers, resulting in what FedEx characterized as a ''substantial decline'' in fuel surcharges. But it said the planned rate increase in the new year would help offset declining revenues from the surcharges, which lag real-time prices and had helped lift profitability over the last year as oil prices plummeted.
 FedEx's main rival, United Parcel Service, has not disclosed plans to raise 2010 rates, though the two companies tend to track one another closely.
 The exit of DHL from the market in January has strengthened the hand of the two remaining players.
 The results announced on Thursday were better than FedEx had originally forecast, but were not a surprise.
 Last week, the company disclosed its results, saying it would report first-quarter earnings of 58 cents a share. It also said second-quarter earnings would be 65 to 95 cents, an outlook it reiterated on Thursday. At the time, the company said it was benefiting from an increase in international priority shipments and cost controls.
 Shares of FedEx, which jumped more than 6 percent last week when the company released figures, gave back some of those gains on Thursday. The shares fell $1.74, or 2.2 percent, to $76.46.

HEADLINE: Indictment Issued and Plea Entered in Property Sale Cited in Trump Lawsuit

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON and CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Four years ago, an angry Donald J. Trump sued his former Hong Kong partners, claiming that they had failed to get the highest price for their 77-acre residential development on the West Side of Manhattan and evaded millions in taxes on the profits. It sounded a lot like sour grapes.
 That is until Thursday, when Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, indicted a central figure in the transaction. 
 Barry D. Gross, who worked for the Hong Kong investors and helped to broker the $1.76 billion transaction, which was then the largest residential real estate deal in the city's history, has been charged with grand larceny and other crimes related to tax evasion.
 Prosecutors say that Mr. Gross, 45, disguised a $1 million bonus he received as a fee for Itamar Capital, a shell company he controlled, thereby avoiding city and state taxes.
 Mr. Morgenthau revealed that the indictment arose from a two-year investigation into whether the Hong Kong partners evaded taxes on $17 million they may have received in addition to the sales price.
 Investigators say that the Hong Kong partners, who operated under the name Hudson Waterfront Associates, told the buyers, the Extell Development Corporation and the Carlyle Group, to pay a $17 million finder's fee to Fineview, a company based in the British Virgin Islands, Mr. Morgenthau said.
 But prosecutors said they believed that Fineview was not a legitimate third-party broker and that the $17 million might have ended up in the hands of the Hong Kong partners.
 Mr. Morgenthau said investigators were able to track the flow of the money, which was transferred to from the Channel Islands and to London, before ending up in Hong Kong in the hands of someone associated with the investors. By routing the $17 million through Fineview, Mr. Morgenthau said, the investors were able to avoid paying income taxes on it as part of the purchase.
 Mr. Morgenthau said he hoped that more arrests were coming in the case, but his office was still trying to track financial records that would spell out the relationship between Fineview and the more than a dozen Hong Kong financiers with connections to Hudson Waterfront Associates. 
 Prosecutors said that their investigation dealt with a case of potential tax evasion and had no direct link to Mr. Trump's claims in the civil suit that the association priced the land too low in the sale. That suit is still pending.
 Mr. Trump said Thursday, ''I greatly commend the district attorney for his work and feel certain it will continue.'' 
 Mr. Morgenthau hinted in a press conference in his office that he was hoping for cooperation from Mr. Gross, who prosecutors said avoided paying more than $13,000 in state taxes. Mr. Gross, who faces up to seven years in prison if convicted of third-degree grand larceny, the top charge against him, pleaded not guilty Thursday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
 A lawyer for Mr. Gross, Benjamin Brafman, said he hoped to persuade Mr. Morgenthau's office to drop criminal charges.
 ''In my view, this should have been handled as a civil tax matter,'' Mr. Brafman said outside the courtroom.
 Mr. Gross's father is a diamond merchant and business associate of Henry Cheng, chairman of New World Development Ltd. and a leader of the consortium that sold the property that runs from 59th Street to 72nd Street along the Hudson River.
 Mr. Cheng and his partners -- including Vincent Lo, chairman of Shui On Construction and Materials, and Edward Wong of the Edward Wong Group -- bought Mr. Trump's $300 million mortgage on the land for $82 million in 1994 after Mr. Trump was in danger of losing the still-vacant property to his lenders during the recession. But Mr. Trump retained a share of any profits from a sale.
 Mr. Trump, who had first bought the former railyard in 1974 and whose name was characteristically stamped on some of the buildings, was outraged by the 2005 sale, filing a lawsuit claiming that the deal was a ''staggering breach'' of his partners' duty to get the highest price. He said that the partners had ignored bids of nearly $3 billion from Colony Capital, an investment company in Los Angeles, and Richard LeFrak, a New York developer. 
 Further, the lawsuit claimed that the investment group led by Mr. Cheng had failed to report hundreds of millions of dollars of profit to ''avoid paying taxes in China and the United States.'' The suit said that Mr. Trump had uncovered ''fraud by the Cheng group amounting to at least $19.7 million.''
 Mr. Trump took further umbrage when the partners, instead of immediately handing him his 30 percent share -- nearly $500 million --used the proceeds to buy the Bank of America Center in San Francisco, and 1290 Avenue of the Americas, a 2 million-square-foot skyscraper in Manhattan. In 2007, the Hong Kong investors sold their stake in those two buildings to Vornado Realty Trust. Mr. Trump retained his portion.

HEADLINE: No, It's Not About Race

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 You wouldn't know it to look at me, but I go running several times a week. My favorite route, because it's so flat, is from the Lincoln Memorial to the U.S. Capitol and back. I was there last Saturday and found myself plodding through tens of thousands of anti-government ''tea party'' protesters. 
 They were carrying ''Don't Tread on Me'' flags, ''End the Fed'' placards and signs condemning big government, Barack Obama, socialist health care and various elite institutions. 
 Then, as I got to where the Smithsonian museums start, I came across another rally, the Black Family Reunion Celebration. Several thousand people had gathered to celebrate African-American culture. I noticed that the mostly white tea party protesters were mingling in with the mostly black family reunion celebrants. The tea party people were buying lunch from the family reunion food stands. They had joined the audience of a rap concert.
 Because sociology is more important than fitness, I stopped to watch the interaction. These two groups were from opposite ends of the political and cultural spectrum. They'd both been energized by eloquent speakers. Yet I couldn't discern any tension between them. It was just different groups of people milling about like at any park or sports arena. 
 And yet we live in a nation in which some people see every conflict through the prism of race. So over the past few days, many people, from Jimmy Carter on down, have argued that the hostility to President Obama is driven by racism. Some have argued that tea party slogans like ''I Want My Country Back'' are code words for white supremacy. Others say incivility on Capitol Hill is magnified by Obama's dark skin.
 Well, I don't have a machine for peering into the souls of Obama's critics, so I can't measure how much racism is in there. But my impression is that race is largely beside the point. There are other, equally important strains in American history that are far more germane to the current conflicts.
 For example, for generations schoolchildren studied the long debate between Hamiltonians and Jeffersonians. Hamiltonians stood for urbanism, industrialism and federal power. Jeffersonians were suspicious of urban elites and financial concentration and believed in small-town virtues and limited government. Jefferson advocated ''a wise and frugal government'' that will keep people from hurting each other, but will otherwise leave them free and ''shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned.''
 Jefferson's philosophy inspired Andrew Jackson, who led a movement of plain people against the cosmopolitan elites. Jackson dismantled the Second Bank of the United States because he feared the fusion of federal and financial power.
 This populist tendency continued through the centuries. Sometimes it took right-wing forms, sometimes left-wing ones. Sometimes it was agrarian. Sometimes it was more union-oriented. Often it was extreme, conspiratorial and rude.
 The populist tendency has always used the same sort of rhetoric: for the ordinary people and against the fat cats and the educated class; for the small towns and against the financial centers.
 And it has always had the same morality, which the historian Michael Kazin has called producerism. The idea is that free labor is the essence of Americanism. Hard-working ordinary people, who create wealth in material ways, are the moral backbone of the country. In this free, capitalist nation, people should be held responsible for their own output. Money should not be redistributed to those who do not work, and it should not be sucked off by condescending, manipulative elites.
 Barack Obama leads a government of the highly educated. His movement includes urban politicians, academics, Hollywood donors and information-age professionals. In his first few months, he has fused federal power with Wall Street, the auto industry, the health care industries and the energy sector.
 Given all of this, it was guaranteed that he would spark a populist backlash, regardless of his skin color. And it was guaranteed that this backlash would be ill mannered, conspiratorial and over the top -- since these movements always are, whether they were led by Huey Long, Father Coughlin or anybody else.
 What we're seeing is the latest iteration of that populist tendency and the militant progressive reaction to it. We now have a populist news media that exaggerates the importance of the Van Jones and Acorn stories to prove the elites are decadent and un-American, and we have a progressive news media that exaggerates stories like the Joe Wilson shout and the opposition to the Obama schools speech to show that small-town folks are dumb wackos.
 ''One could argue that this country is on the verge of a crisis of legitimacy,'' the economic blogger Arnold Kling writes. ''The progressive elite is starting to dismiss rural white America as illegitimate, and vice versa.''
 It's not race. It's another type of conflict, equally deep and old.

HEADLINE: Baucus And the Threshold

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
So Senator Max Baucus, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has released his ''mark'' on proposed legislation -- which would normally be the basis for the bill that eventually emerges from his committee. And serious supporters of health care reform will soon face their long-dreaded moment of truth. 
 You see, it has been clear for months that whatever health-care bill finally emerges will fall far short of reformers' hopes. Yet even a bad bill could be much better than nothing. The question is where to draw the line. How bad does a bill have to be to make it too bad to vote for? 
 Now, the moment of truth isn't here quite yet: There's enough wrong with the Baucus proposal as it stands to make it unworkable and unacceptable. But that said, Senator Baucus's mark is better than many of us expected. If it serves as a basis for negotiation, and the result of those negotiations is a plan that's stronger, not weaker, reformers are going to have to make some hard choices about the degree of disappointment they're willing to live with.
 Of course, those who insist that we must have a single-payer system -- Medicare for all -- won't accept any plan that tries, instead, to cajole and coerce private health insurers into covering everyone. But while many reformers, myself included, would prefer a single-payer system if we were starting from scratch, international experience shows that it's not the only way to go. Several European countries, including Switzerland and the Netherlands, have managed to achieve universal coverage with a mainly private insurance system.
 And right here in America, we have the example of the Massachusetts health reform, many of whose features are echoed in the Baucus plan. The Massachusetts system, introduced three years ago, has many problems. But as a new report from the Urban Institute puts it, it ''has accomplished much of what it set out to do: Nearly all adults in the state have health insurance.'' If we could accomplish the same thing for the nation as a whole, even with a less than ideal plan, it would be a vast improvement over what we have now.
 So something along the general lines of the Baucus plan might be acceptable. But details matter. And the bad news is that the plan, as it stands, is inadequate or badly conceived in three major ways.
 First, it bungles the so-called ''employer mandate.'' Most reform plans include a provision requiring that large employers either provide their workers with health coverage or pay into a fund that would help workers who don't get insurance through their job buy coverage on their own. Mr. Baucus, however, gets too clever, trying to tie each employer's fees to the subsidies its own employees end up getting. 
 That's a terrible idea. As the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities points out, it would make companies reluctant to hire workers from lower-income families -- and it would also create a bureaucratic nightmare. This provision has to go and be replaced with a simple pay-or-play rule.
 Second, the plan is too stingy when it comes to financial aid. Lower-middle-class families, in particular, would end up paying much more in premiums than they do under the Massachusetts plan, suggesting that for many people insurance would not, in fact, be affordable. Fixing this means spending more than Mr. Baucus proposes.
 Third, the plan doesn't create real competition in the insurance market. The right way to create competition is to offer a public option, a government-run insurance plan individuals can buy into as an alternative to private insurance. The Baucus plan instead proposes a fake alternative, nonprofit insurance cooperatives -- and it places so many restrictions on these cooperatives that, according to the Congressional Budget Office, they ''seem unlikely to establish a significant market presence in many areas of the country.''
 The insurance industry, of course, loves the Baucus plan. Need we say more?
 So this plan has to change. What matters now is the direction in which it changes.
 It would be disastrous if health care goes the way of the economic stimulus plan, earlier this year. As you may recall, that plan -- which was clearly too weak even as originally proposed -- was made even weaker to win the support of three Republican senators. If the same thing happens to health reform, progressives should and will walk away.
 But maybe things will go the other way, and Mr. Baucus (and the White House) will, for once, actually listen to progressive concerns, making the bill stronger.
 Even if the Baucus plan gets better, rather than worse, what emerges won't be legislation reformers can love. Will it nonetheless be legislation that passes the threshold of acceptability, legislation they can vote for? We'll see.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Moves to Ban Edge Held by Fast Traders

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
It is an obscure art of Wall Street, a technique that gives a scattering of traders an edge over everyone else -- and the Securities and Exchange Commission wants to stamp it out. 
 The S.E.C. on Thursday proposed banning what are known as flash orders, which use powerful computers to glimpse at investors' orders. The practice is often associated with a controversial corner of finance called high-frequency trading, which has grown, largely hidden from view, into a potent force in the markets. 
 The proposed ban was announced on the same day that the S.E.C. put forward new rules for credit ratings agencies, which were widely criticized for their role in the financial crisis. Together, the moves telegraphed a tougher line from the commission after a series of prominent missteps, including its failure to spot the Ponzi scheme orchestrated by Bernard L. Madoff. 
 Critics say flash orders favor sophisticated, fast-moving traders at the expense of slower market participants. Using lightning-quick computers, high-frequency traders often issue and then cancel orders almost simultaneously and get an early peek at how others are trading. 
 Mary L. Schapiro, the chairwoman of the S.E.C., said on Thursday that in proposing the ban, the commission was trying to balance the often competing interests of long-term investors and short-term traders. The proposal requires a second vote by the commission to become binding. 
 ''Flash orders may create a two-tiered market by allowing only selected participants to access information about the best available prices for listed securities,'' she said during a meeting in Washington. Other modern market practices, she said, are similarly opaque. 
 Fast-moving electronic exchanges have upended old-fashioned stock trading. Buyers and sellers no longer must interact on exchange floors and haggle over prices. Today, traders employ powerful computer programs to execute millions of orders a second and scan dozens of marketplaces simultaneously. 
 While anyone can gain access to flash orders for a fee, only very powerful computers can process and act on the information. In July, flash orders represented 2.8 percent of the roughly 9 billion shares of stocks traded in the United States.
 According to Richard H. Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill who studies stock exchanges, the average trade is executed, or completed, in less than 10 milliseconds and often as fast as 5 milliseconds. 
 The proliferation of high-frequency trading has pushed up average daily volume on the nation's stock exchanges by 164 percent since 2005. Proponents of the practice argue such trading enhances the liquidity and greases the wheels of the markets. 
 ''High frequency trading has made the markets more efficient, and generally speaking, markets that are more efficient are better for all participants,'' said Justin Schack, a vice president at Rosenblatt Securities. 
 Even so, Mr. Schack said he was pleased the S.E.C. was moving to ban flash orders, which he said tended to ''benefit everyone except for the customer.'' 
 Direct Edge, an electronic exchange, has benefited the most from the use of flash orders, analysts said. But other electronic exchanges, including Nasdaq and BATS also jumped into the market, prodded by competitive pressures. 
 Getting flashed an order offers traders a distinctive edge. When buy and sell orders come into an exchange, they are first flashed to those paying to see them for 30 milliseconds -- 0.03 seconds -- before they are available to everyone else. In the blink of an eye, the systems can detect patterns and get a jump on other investors. Before others even sees the order, high-frequency traders swoop in and then out. 
 The move to ban flash orders drew praise from some on Capitol Hill. 
 ''This ban, as proposed, is pretty much water-tight and should not be weakened by the commission as the rule-making process goes forward,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. ''This proposal will once and for all get rid of flash trading.''
 The parent of the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Euronext, which never adopted flash trades, trumpeted the proposal. ''I think this was a practice that gave unfair access to information flow to a select group of brokers, disadvantaged customer orders and led to a two-tier market system,'' said Larry Leibowitz, head of United States markets and global technology at NYSE Euronext. 
 The S.E.C. on Thursday also passed rules aimed at improving transparency at credit rating agencies and reducing conflicts of interest at the companies. 
 One rule will force certain investors to rely less on credit ratings and more on their own research. Another requires the agencies to disclose rating histories and requires them to share information about securities they have rated with competitors so they too can rate the securities. 
 ''These are baby steps, clearly,'' said Jerome S. Fons, an independent consultant and former managing director at Moody's, one of the major ratings agencies. He said even greater public disclosure was needed from the agencies.

HEADLINE: CITY JOBLESS RATE CLIMBS TO 10.3%

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Continuing layoffs on Wall Street drove New York City's unemployment rate to 10.3 percent in August, a 16-year high that underscores the need to retrain former financial services workers for other jobs, state officials said Thursday.
 In the year since the Lehman Brothers investment bank collapsed and others had to be rescued from failing, the number of unemployed city residents has risen to more than 415,000, the highest total on record. The still-shrinking financial sector, which had been the main engine of employment growth in the city before the downturn, has essentially been declared to be in a state of emergency. 
 The State Department of Labor has begun using a ''national emergency grant'' of $11 million in federal funds to help those laid off on Wall Street shift into other fields, like health care and education. Emphasizing the need for such a shift, M. Patricia Smith, the state labor commissioner, said, ''Our economists don't see the financial-services sector ever coming back as strong as it was.''
 Ms. Smith joined Gov. David A. Paterson and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver at a news conference in Lower Manhattan to discuss the latest jobs data and promote the retraining program. Mr. Paterson said the latest increases in the state and city unemployment rates showed that the recession was continuing in New York.
 Referring to the recent pronouncement from Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, that the national recession is probably over, Mr. Paterson said, ''What he's saying about the national recession doesn't apply to us.'' He said New York faced at least another year of ''tough sledding.''
 The city's unemployment rate, which rose from 9.5 percent in July, is now well above the national rate of 9.7 percent. Until July, unemployment had been the same or lower in the city than it was in the country for more than 18 months. Last month, the state's unemployment rate rose to 9 percent, from 8.6 percent in July. Excluding the city, unemployment in New York State was 8 percent.
 Still, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg found a bright spot in the report. ''While the job market is tight,'' he said, ''the city is losing jobs at less than half the rate of the rest of the country. This is an important sign that despite the challenges, people continue to be optimistic about the city's future.''
 Ms. Smith said the divergence between the city and the rest of the state was largely attributable to continued cutbacks on Wall Street and the ripple effect of the loss of those high-paying jobs. She emphasized that most of the Wall Street layoffs have involved mid- and lower-level workers who did not earn millions of dollars a year.
 Under the retraining program that began in July, more than 450 people have begun classes to prepare for a career shift, and state officials say they have enough money to help at least 1,000 more.
 One person in the program, Marisha Clinton, 39, of Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, said she lost her job analyzing technology stocks for Bear Stearns after it collapsed early last year. A year later, she was laid off by another securities firm.
 Now, Ms. Clinton is using the $12,500 subsidy offered by the Labor Department to take courses at the New York Institute of Finance that might help her find other work. 
 ''I'm keeping my options open,'' Ms. Clinton said. ''I've been working since I was 14 years old. I'd rather be working than not.''
 The emergency federal grant went to New York. New Jersey and Connecticut, which received a combined $22 million to retrain people who have lost jobs since June 2008 at any of 31 companies -- mostly large financial firms like Citigroup and Lehman Brothers.
 Lana Umali, who worked for JPMorgan Chase for 20 years before losing her job in Manhattan last year, has already put Wall Street behind her. Ms. Umali, who lives in Middletown, N.J., used the state subsidy to help pay for courses to prepare her to work with elderly people. She is hoping to find work at a company that operates assisted-living facilities.
 Immediately after she was laid off in June 2008, she said, ''I was determined to go back into financial services. I never really thought about anything else.'' But after a fruitless search, Ms. Umali said, ''I got in touch with a whole other side of me.''

HEADLINE: Afghan Ballot Uncertainty Creates Dilemma for U.S.

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and HELENE COOPER; Thom Shanker contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Obama administration now fears that the Afghan election may not produce a clear winner until next spring, which officials said could throw President Obama's policies into flux by leaving Afghanistan without a credible leader for months.
 The prospect of a runoff election is growing after President Hamid Karzai was awarded 54.6 percent of the votes in the much disputed presidential election last month. But even as American officials noted that the Afghan authorities had begun printing ballots for a second round of voting, these officials said they were worried that a runoff could not be held before Afghanistan's fierce winter starts in November.
 Such a long delay could deepen Mr. Obama's troubles in Afghanistan, at a time of deteriorating security there and mounting skepticism in Washington about whether the United States should deploy more troops to try to stabilize the country. 
 For the White House, a winter of political uncertainty in Afghanistan may be the worst of all possible situations, officials and outside experts said. There is already vocal disenchantment with the war, across the country and among Democrats in Congress.
 ''We are well aware that we have 12 to 18 months to start to show progress,'' said a senior administration official, who asked not to be identified in order to freely discuss internal policy. ''The clock starts to run out after that.''
 Mr. Karzai's final vote tally was significantly smaller than administration officials expected, even if he needs to clear only 50 percent to avoid a runoff. But accusations of ballot-stuffing and other fraud have led election authorities to order an examination of ballot boxes in 10 percent of polling places. If some votes are invalidated, that could push him below the 50 percent threshold.
 While the United States has warned Mr. Karzai not to declare victory before the ballot investigation is complete, administration officials acknowledge that he remains the most likely winner. His main competitor, Abdullah Abdullah, a former foreign minister, finished a distant second, with 27.8 percent of the vote.
 Administration officials expressed surprise that Afghan authorities were laying the groundwork for a second round of voting, even before the investigation of the first round had been finished. But the calendar works against holding a runoff before the spring. The country's brutal weather and forbidding geography would make going to the polls extremely difficult.
 ''There is an exquisite dilemma here,'' said Bruce Riedel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who helped develop the administration's policy. ''The strategy requires an Afghan government that is credible and legitimate, both to get Afghans to support it and to get Americans and their allies to help. The strategy can't work around a South Vietnamese-style government.''
 A runoff would be preferable to a discredited first-round Karzai victory, Mr. Riedel said. But if the vote is put off until next spring, he said, the administration will have to deal with an interim leadership that will be much less effective in helping with American priorities, like peeling off moderate elements of the Taliban.
 ''What is placed on hold is any kind of political reconciliation, of trying to split the Taliban,'' he said. ''It's very hard to do that because you need the Afghan government as your partner.''
 The Obama administration had also planned to begin a major new anticorruption drive in Afghanistan, once the dust settled from the elections. That strategy would include assigning more civilians to the American Embassy in Kabul to work with the Afghan government on reforms of the legal system, as well as looking for ways to crack down on the drug smuggling that has fueled the resurgence of the Taliban.
 None of this was going to be easy to begin with, in part because Mr. Karzai has proved resistant to Western attempts to rein in corruption. Before the election, he struck political deals with Afghans who have been accused of drug smuggling, including his running mate, Marshal Muhammad Qasim Fahim.
 Administration officials had hoped that in a second term, free of worries about his political future, Mr. Karzai would be more amenable to a Western-style anticorruption campaign -- or that Mr. Abdullah, if he won, would be more amenable to working with the West to crack down on drug smuggling and corruption.
 ''The plan was to hit the ground running right after the elections with the anticorruption work,'' another senior official said. It is not clear the administration could begin such a campaign as long as the election results remain uncertain.
 Western officials said the best they might hope for is some kind of political deal, under which Mr. Abdullah could end up working with Mr. Karzai in a prime minister-type role. But that, too, may be too much to hope for, given the enmity between the two men.
 In the meantime, Afghanistan faces a tense wait, with the risk of an expanding Taliban insurgency that could even take aim at Mr. Karzai or Mr. Abdullah personally, Mr. Riedel said.
 Elements of Mr. Obama's strategy can continue without a political resolution, he said. The Pentagon can conduct operations against the Taliban and train Afghan forces, while other parts of the Obama administration can assist economic development.
 But even the basic question of whether to send more American troops has been caught up in uncertainty over the election. At a news conference on Thursday, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates noted that the administration's original timetable called for assessing the need for more troops after the election results were in. ''There is no question that the nature of the election in Afghanistan has complicated the picture for us,'' he said.
 Still, Mr. Gates said it was proper for the president and his senior advisers to take time to absorb the recently completed assessment of the Afghanistan security situation by the senior commander there, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, before deciding.
 ''I think, there's been a lot of talk this week and the last two or three weeks about Afghanistan,'' Mr. Gates said. ''And frankly, from my standpoint, everybody ought to take a deep breath.''

HEADLINE: Zeta to Mass-Produce Efficient Homes

BYLINE: LEORA BROYDO VESTEL


HIGHLIGHT: Amid a lingering economic slump, a maker of high-efficiency modular homes prepares to open a 91,000 square-foot manufacturing facility in California. 

 BODY:
The same economic downturn that wreaked havoc on home manufacturers appears to be creating opportunities for Zeta Communities, a hopeful purveyor of ultra-efficient multifamily housing. 
To date, the company has built just one 1,540-square-foot demonstration home in Oakland to support its thesis that high-efficiency can also be affordable. 
The installed cost for the unit - which was factory-built and includes photovoltaics, automated energy controls and high-performance insulation - is about $165 a square foot. A comparable unit built on site would cost about $250 a square foot, according to Zeta. 
Now flush with orders arising from the demonstration home, Zeta tells Green Inc. that it is poised to cut the ribbon on a 91,000-square-foot factory for building modular homes in Sacramento County. 
The plant -- on a former Air Force hangar that had most recently housed a conventional modular home factory -- will have the capacity to churn out 400 prefabricated "green" units a year, according to Zeta representatives. The company plans to hire 200 workers -- including some from the now defunct company that previously occupied the site.
The company is aiming to become the first mass producer of what is known in green building circles as "net zero energy" homes - those that generate enough renewable energy on site to equal or exceed their annual energy use. 
The factory is scheduled to begin production next week. 
"The reopening of the factory is symbolic of moving into the new green economy and creating new jobs," said Naomi Porat, Zeta's chief executive officer.
While the recession has slowed or halted many housing projects - including zero energy projects - private investors have continued to push the green building envelope. 
Zeta, for example, received a $5 million infusion of venture capital financing last October.
Public agencies are also investing heavily in the zero-energy concept. The Department of Energy - which recently announced its own zero-energy initiative - is doling out $100 million for research projects that "advance zero-energy building technology."
And state regulators at the California Public Utilities Commission are poised to approve $43 million for zero-energy projects, including the construction of pilot buildings and the development of ways to measure and verify their true costs and energy savings. 
California agencies are already aiming for all new residential construction in the state to be zero-energy by 2020, with all new commercial buildings hitting the mark by 2030.
"At a government level we hope to provide funding for the private sector to ensure California has the most comprehensive zero net energy program in the world," said Dian Grueneich, a C.P.U.C. commissioner. "Companies like Zeta are showing this is not some academic idea, but is something that can be done in the here and now with existing technologies."
The efficiencies of building homes in a factory setting, together with an integrated design process (where the architect, structural engineer and construction manager work in parallel), contribute to reduced costs, Ms. Porat explained. 
She said Zeta's start-to-finish development process required 50 percent less time compared with the typical design-and-build process.
"It wasn't just the credit crisis," she said, reflecting on the financial drubbing home builders have experienced in recent years. "The old system was not sustainable or resource-efficient."

HEADLINE: After a Short Hiatus, Another Taste of Optimism

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Investors popped the stock market's rally back in gear Friday after analyst upgrades increased optimism about the economy.
 A 36-point advance in the Dow Jones industrial average left the index at a high for the year and with a gain of 215 points for the week. Stock indexes have risen in 9 of the last 11 days.
 The market got a boost from a new economic forecast by Barclays Capital, which raised its projection for growth in the nation's gross domestic product for first three months of next year to 5 percent from 3 percent. The G.D.P. has been shrinking, although many economists think it will return to growth for the July-September quarter. 
 Meanwhile, Procter & Gamble pulled the Dow higher after an analyst raised her rating on the giant consumer products company, citing the company's price-cutting strategy. 
 Marc Harris, co-head of global research for RBC Capital Markets in New York, said the strength of the market rally had surprised many investors because some of the stocks posting the biggest advances were of lower-quality companies with weak balance sheets that investors only months ago feared might go out of business.
 ''Even turkeys are going to fly in a hurricane,'' Mr. Harris said. ''Those lower-quality companies are leading the charge here.''
 Financial companies and home builders have been among the biggest gainers in the recent run. Many of those companies still face major hurdles with bad debt and the weak housing market.
 The market's run will slow but might not stop, according to many analysts, as investors shift their holdings from industries where the gains have been strong, like technology, to other areas that have lagged.
 The Dow rose 36.28, or 0.4 percent, to 9,820.20. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.81, or 0.3 percent, to 1,068.30, while the Nasdaq composite index advanced 6.11, or 0.3 percent, to 2,132.86.
 For the week, the Dow rose 2.2 percent, while the S.& P. 500 and the Nasdaq advanced 2.5 percent.
 Bond prices fell, pushing yields higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 21/32, to 101 11/32, and the yield rose to 3.46 percent from 3.38 percent late Thursday.
 Overseas, Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.2 percent, Germany's DAX index fell 0.5 percent and France's CAC-40 slipped 0.2 percent. Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.7 percent.
 The dollar was mixed against other major currencies, while gold prices fell.
 Crude oil fell 43 cents to settle at $72.04 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Procter & Gamble rose $1.79, or 3.3 percent, to $57.32 after its upgrade from Citi Investment Research.
 Palm Inc. posted a wider fiscal first-quarter loss on Thursday and provided a disappointing sales forecast. Shares fell 43 cents Friday, or about 3 percent, to $14.01.
 Stocks rallied during the week in part because of improvements in economic reports on retail sales and manufacturing. Investors were also encouraged by a comment by the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, that the recession had ''very likely'' ended, though he warned that problems like high unemployment would linger.
 Many analysts still say the rally is due for a break. Linda A. Duessel, equity market strategist at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh, said a retreat of 10 percent or more in major stock indexes would not be surprising. The S.& P. 500 index has rocketed 57.9 percent from a 12-year low in early March. An advance that size might often take five or six years to occur.
 She said that even if there were slides, stocks were likely to resume climbing because so many investors had missed the rally.
 ''The most common question I get when I travel is, 'Do you think I'll get a pullback so I can get in?' That's so bullish,'' she said.
 Three stocks rose for every two that fell on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 2.3 billion shares compared with 1.5 billion Thursday.
 Trading was heavy because of the occurrence of a quarterly ''quadruple witching,'' which marks the simultaneous expiration of four kinds of options and futures contracts.

HEADLINE: August Joblessness Hit 10% in 14 States and D.C.

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
In 14 states and the District of Columbia at least a tenth of the work force was unemployed in August, according to a Bureau of Labor Statisticsreport released Friday.
 Even as some economic indicators in housing and elsewhere showed signs of improvement, jobless rates declined in 16 states from July to August. In every other state the portion of workers who could not find jobs stagnated or, in most places, grew. 
 Compared with the same time last year, unemployment rates increased in every state and the District of Columbia, fueling expectations that the many government efforts to tame the recession will not prevent a jobless recovery.
 ''We're not really seeing recovery anywhere yet, and it'll still be awhile before we see much of a difference,'' said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. 
 The regions that have been hit hardest -- primarily those with once-bustling construction and manufacturing industries -- continue to suffer, Mr. Baker said. ''The only positive news, probably going into next year, will be slower rates of decline, not job additions.'' 
 Michigan continued to have the country's highest jobless rate, at a seasonally adjusted 15.2 percent, compared with a national rate of 9.7 percent. In the Detroit metropolitan area, the rate reached 17.3 percent.
 Nevada and Rhode Island followed Michigan, with unemployment rates of 13.2 percent and 12.8 percent, respectively. The rates in Nevada, Rhode Island and California -- where unemployment reached 12.2 percent -- were the highest on record for those states.
 Generally, Western states had the weakest job markets, with Plains-state labor forces relatively more resilient. North Dakota, South Dakota and Nebraska all registered jobless rates of 5 percent or lower. Compared with places like California, unemployment has barely budged in these states over the last year.
 Nonfarm payroll jobs -- calculated from a different government survey -- declined in 42 states and the District of Columbia. Texas lost the most jobs from July to August of this year, with a net loss of 62,200 positions. It was followed by Michigan and Georgia.
 North Carolina, Montana and West Virginia registered the biggest month-over-month increases in nonfarm payrolls. Economists caution that because such monthly state payroll measures can be volatile, these increases may not indicate a turnaround.
 New York did not have a statistically significant change in payroll employment from July to August, but over the last year the state had lost 188,400 jobs.
 The state's unemployment rate was 9 percent in August, up from 8.6 percent in July, and unemployment in New York City alone reached 10.3 percent in August, from 9.5 percent in July.

HEADLINE: Happily Ever After

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
''Guiding Light,'' the longest-running daytime drama in history, breathed its last on Friday. This may be the beginning of the end for soap operas. And since it's being replaced by ''The Price Is Right,'' there's really no way you can spin this as a step forward.
 ''Guiding Light'' certainly did its best to provide a happy ending. In the final episode, several couples got married in rapid succession and two young women announced that they had gotten into Berkeley. The whole cast had to race from one of the weddings to wave goodbye to them, because they both had to leave the very minute they were accepted. (The University of California has become way too spontaneous.) 
 A long line of former residents walked in to announce they were moving back to town forever. Then everybody went on a picnic. Many Champagne toasts. ''This isn't supposed to happen. ... I'm getting everything I wanted,'' a woman told her partner. A man holding a baby got a dream job as a coach. Another man with a baby got a job in construction. Then Josh and Reva, major characters of many decades' standing, met at a lighthouse and drove off together in a truck. 
 The whole thing had an air of unreality, and this was only in part because 72 years of tears and trauma ended in the greatest explosion of bliss since the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Previous cost-cutting efforts had caused the series to stop spending money on studio space, and the cast and crew have been wandering around Peapack, N.J., ever since, without much help in the way of costumes or makeup. If ''Guiding Light'' had lasted another year, the actors would probably have been replaced by bloggers.
 Now we're Guiding Lightless for the first time since 1936. (The program debuted on the radio as ''The Guiding Light,'' but in our fast-paced era, we have no time to waste on meaningless modifiers.) The original story involved a minister who left a light in the window so people could see that he was home and ready to listen to their problems. While it is conceivable that you could sell an idea for a series like that today, the minister in question would probably have to be a vampire.
 There was a time when soap operas were hot. In 1976, Time did a cover story on ''their huge popularity and money-making capacity,'' which the magazine attributed to ''housebound women, students, hippies and the unemployed.'' 
 Now there are only seven left, some clearly listing toward the fate of ''Guiding Light.'' Their decline is blamed on the fact that women have all gone off to work -- although there seem to be plenty of unemployed people around to close the gap. The real problem may be that for younger viewers, the desire to watch an ongoing drama involving very average people who talk endlessly about their feelings is filled by ''Big Brother'' and ''The Bachelorette.''
 That'd be a shame for those who believe that written stories almost always trump real life on screen. But it's hard to get too sentimental about a form that seldom posed a question more profound than: ''Can a girl from a little mining town in the West find happiness as the wife of a wealthy and titled Englishman?'' 
 At the beginning, though, soaps were a revelation. For women who had spent millennia at home, working in silence, the company of the first radio dramas was heaven.
 I once read a diary that a Kansas farmwife named Mary Dyck kept during the Depression. The doings of her real family were all mixed up with the things like, ''Bob is making plans to get his Marriage Lisense tomorrow,'' which occurred on ''Betty and Bob,'' a soap opera about a secretary who marries her boss. She wasn't confused about what was real and what was fiction. But there were probably days in the Dustbowl when Betty and Bob's wedding plans kept her sane.
 Now, the remaining soaps are much-maligned for over-the-top story lines -- Reva of the truck-finale had a history that included 9 or 10 husbands and being cloned. But it's hard to create exciting stories about the personal lives of average people who stay in the same town/hospital for decades without throwing in a mad scientist or split personality here and there. It's also difficult for the writers to keep all the relationships straight. Every once in a while they'll forget that somebody had a hysterectomy in 1997 and make her pregnant with triplets.
 My favorite factoid along that line involved ''Days of Our Lives,'' whose writers once sent Uncle Tommy upstairs for a nap and left him there for two years. Imagine how great it would be if we could manage stuff like that in the real world. Glenn Beck has been looking a little weary lately. A rest would do him good, and when he came back downstairs in 2011, he'd probably feel like a new man.

HEADLINE: Now Even Millionaires Can See the Benefits of Budgeting

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
SOMEONE with $100 million has nothing to fear, not even fear itself. 
 But not long ago, a client with such assets called and asked Bruce Bickel, her wealth adviser at PNC Wealth Management, to put her on a budget. 
 ''She said we've never done this before, and we think we should,'' said Mr. Bickel, managing director of private foundation management services at PNC. ''It's all relative. Their loss has put them in a fear response.''
 That mindset is a direct result of the financial panic that turned one year old this week. At this time last year, Richard Fuld was center stage in the financial crisis; Ken Lewis, chief executive of Bank of America, was being hailed as Merrill Lynch's savior; and Bernard L. Madoff was little known beyond the financial world. 
 None of that is true today. And even though a year has passed, wealthy investors remain cautious. 
 The Boston Consulting Group predicted this week that worldwide wealth would not return to 2007 precrisis levels until 2013. It also said it found that the number of millionaires was down 18 percent and that, across the board, clients of wealth management firms had lost trust in their advisers. 
 ''There is a shattered confidence we haven't seen in a long time,'' said Bruce Holley, senior partner at the firm. ''The wealth management business is a very emotional business, and people can react in kind to that.'' 
 This explains how someone with more than $100 million in assets can ask her adviser to put her on a budget. As far-fetched as it may sound to someone struggling to make a mortgage payment, such a request reflects the changes in attitudes about wealth in the last year. 
 SHOW ME THE MONEY Watching where your money goes is more than just having a budget. ''One of my families said, 'If you're worried about spending, then you're not wealthy,' '' Mr. Bickel said. ''But across the board, there is greater discernment with use of discretionary income.'' 
 That discernment has taken many forms. One is charity. Many of the two dozen private foundations Mr. Bickel advises have become more focused in their giving. In one case, the family used to give to various cancer-related charities, but it now concentrates on cancer research. The family has not reduced what it gives, just focused it on a particular area to have greater effect. 
 Still, any budgeting is bound to encompass personal expenses, even for those with plenty.
 ''People who would get a new Mercedes S550 every couple of years aren't doing it now,'' said G. Moffett Cochran, chief executive of Silvercrest Asset Management, which has an average account size of $30 million. ''The next car may not be an S550; it may be an Acura. There's an awareness of conspicuous consumption.''
 This feeling is gaining ground. Mr. Bickel said he has been helping parents talk to children about cutting back and doing so without feeling guilty. ''They say, 'My teenager isn't driving a BMW; she has to drive a Ford Focus,' '' he said. ''I tell them not to worry about it. The need is the car. The desire is the BMW.'' 
 In both cases, the car buyers could probably buy any car they wanted. But they are thinking more about what else they could do with that money. This caution, too, is reflected in their investing practices. 
 EASY DOES IT Even though stock markets have rebounded from their lows this year, wealthy investors have not rushed back in. 
 Nancy Rooney, head of the Northeast investment business for J.P. Morgan private wealth management, which serves clients with $1 million to $25 million, said she has seen two types of investors become cautious in their investing. 
 The first have new money and had not experienced serious market swings before. They had been focused on their quarterly gains and largely ignored the risks. Having lost a lot more money than they thought possible, they are struggling with the shock of it. 
 Or, as Mr. Cochran put it, ''Many people thought they were gunslingers.'' Now, he said, ''They're not gunslingers any more.'' Mr. Holley described the sentiment as a return to ''meat and potatoes'' investing.
 Now, that group is focused more on the risk of an investment than its possible return. One result is they are poring through all the disclosures before investing, and they are not as worried about missing out if they are pressured to invest too quickly. 
 The second group is older and held wealth longer. They exhibited almost a knee-jerk reaction to the crisis and put a lot of money into cash early on. They continued to stand on the sidelines through the initial rebound. Only now are they looking to invest in safe assets, like prerefunded bonds secured by United States government obligations. 
 ''We are very gradually working with them,'' Ms. Rooney said. ''For many of them, it was a loss of confidence in themselves as well as in the markets.'' 
 Mr. Cochran said he believed many clients thought the world was coming to an end last September. That it did not end has not consoled them. They are still hesitant with new investments.
 One reason is that many do not want to tie up their assets and then not have access when and if they need money. No one wants to have to sell a good asset at a bad price to cover living costs. The problem, though, is that cash or money market funds will not keep pace with inflation. So they will have to dip into the principal of their portfolio.
 One longtime real estate investor Ms. Rooney spoke to said he understood the ebb and flow of investment returns but was still spooked by what happened last fall. ''The inability to access all of his funds immediately sent a panic though him that he hadn't focused on before,'' she said.
 This means, for now at least, that even savvy investors are willing to pass on investing with a top manager if they feel their money would be locked up too long.
 ''Even when the markets rebound, we don't expect people to get in with the same speed as before to the high-yielding assets,'' said Monish Kumar, global leader of asset and wealth management at Boston Consulting.
 THE FUTURE Caution, like thrift, can be detrimental to an economy in crisis. If wealthy investors steer clear of stocks for the medium term, the trading rally of the last few months could slow. If they are afraid to lock up their capital for the longer term, private equity partnerships and hedge funds could suffer. And if wealthier people eschew the heavy debt load they had recently embraced, their savings may increase but the banks that had eagerly lent to them will feel the effect. And this will then affect less-affluent investors.
 Yet these are all ifs born of a mild recovery. Last year at this time, few advisers would have predicted that the economy would have come back this far this soon.
 ''Many of our clients are very happy to be sitting on bond portfolios and cash reserves,'' Mr. Cochran said. ''What I can't answer is whether that money is permanently on the sidelines.''
 Regardless, a budget isn't a bad idea.

HEADLINE: In Hard-to-Define Laos, Communism and Capitalism Are Now Mixing

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER

DATELINE: VIENTIANE, Laos 

 BODY:
Hammer-and-sickle flags flutter above government offices in downtown Vientiane, and the entrance to the national museum is decorated with massive sculptures glorifying the workers' revolutionary struggle.
 Officially, this sparsely populated country is still communist -- and has been since 1975. But these days, that really depends on whom you ask.
 Three months ago the Obama administration declared without fanfare that Laos, the country the United States tried so hard to prevent from toppling toward communism during a secret war four decades ago, had ''ceased to be a Marxist-Leninist country.''
 Following similar announcements in past decades for China and Vietnam, the White House made the declaration in a June 12 memorandum that lifted a ban on financing for Laotian companies from the United States Export-Import Bank. 
 But in Vientiane, the capital, news of the American policy change was perplexing for Klongmanee Boonliang, an amiable saleswoman in a government-run bookshop. Marx and Lenin are still best sellers, she said.
 Every month, schools and offices buy 400 to 500 poster-size portraits of the two men and hang them in prominent places. ''The Smile of Lenin,'' one of several booklets praising Lenin on the shelves, also sells well.
 ''He was a brave and smart person,'' she said. ''Everyone wants to get lessons from him. It's still important.''
 Such dueling perceptions can easily trip up visitors to this former French colony that became a focal point of great powers during the Vietnam War, only to slide back into obscurity once the cold war ended.
 Landlocked and mountainous, Laos has long had a reputation as more somnolent than its hard-charging neighbors. Today, however, tourism and a growing textile industry have begun to create an urban middle class. 
 Vientiane's streets are filled with the earmarks of conspicuous consumption: Hummers, Mercedes-Benzes and other fancy cars. Purse snatchings are on the rise, a sign perhaps that people have more to steal. 
 And with the wealth has come foreign influences, welcome or not. In a center-city gym, a group of high school girls spend their evenings practicing dance moves that might make teenagers in Los Angeles blush, let alone the ashen-faced members of the Lao Politburo.
 Capitalism is making inroads in Laos, but mastering the ideology might require some re-education. 
 The country is scheduled to open its first stock exchange next year, a plan that prompted a local newspaper to run a series of articles offering a glossary of capitalist terms. ''A stock market itself is like any other market,'' a recent explanatory article said. ''Everything has a price.''
 The official line from the government is that Laos is a one-party democracy -- only members of the Communist Lao People's Revolutionary Party are allowed to run for election.
 ''Marxist-Leninist theory is practical and is suitable for the current situation in Laos,'' President Choummaly Sayasone (pronounced chou-MALEE say-NYA-son) said in a speech to military veterans this year that was reported in the English-language Vientiane Times.
 Yet even some government offices are enthusiastically entrepreneurial. Provincial authorities have encouraged the construction of lucrative casinos that cater to Chinese and Thai gamblers. (Lao citizens are not allowed to play.) And in Vientiane, the Foreign Ministry charges 1 million kip, about $120, as a ''registration fee'' for visiting journalists, and $24 for every day in Laos -- princely sums for this impoverished country.
 Laos is, above all, divided between the rising incomes of Vientiane and a handful of other cities and the poverty of the countryside, where most of the country's seven million people live -- and where ideology of any stripe can seem irrelevant.
 In a village about 15 miles outside Vientiane, Thai Lee, a rice farmer, said he had never heard of Marx.
 Lenin? He guessed he might be a famous Vietnamese leader.
 ''If I had studied more, I might know more about it,'' he said.
 Even during the cold war, Laos was never a communist country in the style of the more industrialized and developed Soviet satellites in Europe.
 Efforts to establish farming communes in the early 1980s were so unpopular that they were abandoned within a few years. And the crackdown on religion that was a hallmark of Soviet communism did not materialize here: children in Laos have long been often educated in Buddhist schools, where Marx and Lenin take a back seat to Siddhartha.
 Although the cities show signs of newfound wealth, Laos is too poor over all to have a textbook communist government capable of providing for all its people. The government is so skeletal that public spending makes up only 11 percent of the country's economy, according to World Bank numbers, compared with more than double that level in the world's capitalist headquarters, the United States.
 Politically, Laos remains authoritarian; dissent from the party line is banned and the military still hunts down former anti-communist rebels who hide in the jungles. But there have been signs of glasnost, the openness that Mikhail Gorbachev described in the dying days of the Soviet Union.
 The National Assembly, the country's legislature, inaugurated a hot line two years ago, encouraging citizens to call in with complaints, which were researched and in some cases aired publicly. This year, the government enacted a law allowing citizens to form nonprofit organizations, a move that chips away at the Communist Party's monopoly on political life.
 ''Civil society in Laos is still very immature at the moment, but it's growing,'' said Viengsamay Srithirath, a communications officer at the World Bank office in Vientiane. ''You see a number of grass-roots organizations coming up.''
 For the United States, the decision to change Laos's Marxist-Leninist status might be seen as a belated coda to the secret war, the effort by the United States government in the 1960s and early 1970s to keep Laos from becoming communist and to interdict Vietnamese supply lines through the Ho Chi Minh Trail, much of which ran through Laos.
 The war, conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency and kept secret because it violated Laos's neutrality, featured tens of thousands of hill tribe mercenaries on the United States payroll and a devastating bombing campaign.
 The bombings ultimately failed to shut down the Ho Chi Minh Trail, and Lao communist forces, backed by Vietnam and China, were victorious in 1975.
 Ravic Huso, the current United States ambassador to Laos, says the decision to change Laos's Marxist-Leninist status was not a comment on the country's political system.
 ''Are they still a one-party state? Yes,'' Mr. Huso said in an interview in his office. ''The legislation was not intended to apply to that. It was intended to apply to the way the economy was run.''
 The change in United States policy was years in the making, Mr. Huso said. Cambodia was removed from the list at the same time. Only North Korea and Cuba remain, he said.
 So, is Laos communist?
 Southanom Inthavong, the head of the country's Olympic committee, who has graduate degrees from universities in Moscow and Minnesota, answers the question with a question.
 ''What is China today?''

HEADLINE: Loving Your Stock Only When It's High

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris's blog on finance and economics is at nytimes.com/norris

 BODY:
CORPORATE America loved its own stock when prices were high. When prices fell, the companies were no longer as interested in buying.
 Standard & Poor's reported this week that stock buybacks by companies in the S.& P. 500 fell to $24.2 billion in the second quarter of 2009. That was down 28 percent from the first quarter and was 72 percent below the figure for the same quarter of 2008. 
 The amount was also the lowest for any quarter since S.& P. began tallying the figures in 1998.
 Share buybacks were hailed by Wall Street as a way of returning cash to shareholders. Critics said they benefited only shareholders who sold, but advocates said they helped all holders by supporting the price.
 Share buybacks would clearly be beneficial to continuing investors if companies made them when their share prices were unreasonably depressed. But the pattern is the opposite; companies seem to buy stock when prices are high and times are good. When prices fall, they no longer have the money or, in some cases the confidence, to buy many shares.
 At the peak of the buyback boom, in the third quarter of 2007, companies in the S.& P. 500 spent $171.9 billion repurchasing shares. The stock market peaked on Oct. 9 of that year, a few days after the quarter ended.
 This year, the stock market hit bottom on March 9, and is up more than 50 percent since then. But buybacks continued to decline in the second quarter. Since companies report buyback levels only when they file quarterly reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, it will be some time before it is clear whether buybacks began to recover in the current quarter.
 One reason investors have viewed buybacks as a positive was that they indicated corporate management and boards were confident that their share prices were low and that the company would not need the cash for a possible downturn in business. 
 Unfortunately, there is little evidence that is the case. In the first quarter of 2007, as the first subprime lenders began to go broke, financial companies spent almost $34 billion on buybacks, the most ever for that group. This year, with financial share prices far lower, they spent less than $2 billion in the first six months.
 One of the strongest spenders in 2007 -- ranking 21st among all companies and fourth among financial stocks -- was the American International Group, which spent $6 billion buying back stock. It spent another $1 billion on buybacks in the first quarter of 2008. Six months later, it would have been broke without a federal bailout.
 Bad timing was not limited to financial companies. Home Depot spent more than $10 billion in the third quarter of 2007 buying back stock. That buying might have slowed the drop in its stock price as the housing market collapsed, but the result was that the company spent an average price of $37 a share. Early this year, when Home Depot was no longer a buyer, the price fell to under $18.
 Many companies have also been forced to cut back on dividend payments. The $47.6 billion paid by the companies in the S.& P. 500 index in the second quarter of this year was 8 percent less than in the first quarter and 23 percent below the level of a year earlier. It was also the lowest quarterly figure for the index since the third quarter of 2004.

HEADLINE: Talks at Impasse, N.B.A. Locks Out Referees

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

 BODY:
The N.B.A. locked out its referees on Friday, virtually ensuring that the league will use replacement officials when it opens the preseason in two weeks.
 Dozens of nonunion referees, most of them from the W.N.B.A. and the N.B.A.'s Development League, will attend training camp in New York next week. Barring a breakthrough in negotiations, three of those referees will be on the court in Utah on Oct. 1. It would be the first time since 1995 that the league has used replacement referees.
 Although they have agreed on the broad parameters of a deal, the N.B.A. and the National Basketball Referees Association remain at odds over proposed changes in retirement benefits. 
 League officials say the proposed cuts are necessary because of declining revenues and a global recession, and that they are less extensive than reductions already made by a number of franchises.
 ''The proposals we have made to the N.B.R.A. are extraordinarily fair and reasonable, given the current economic circumstances,'' Rick Buchanan, the N.B.A.'s executive vice president and general counsel, said in a statement. ''It is extremely disappointing that the N.B.R.A. has ignored the economic realities, rejected our offer, and left us with no choice but to begin using replacement referees.''
 In an unusual move, Buchanan went into detail about the most contentious issue on the table: the gradual elimination of a severance package that, according to the N.B.A., provided some referees with a bonus of up to $575,000 upon retirement, in addition to pension benefits in excess of $2 million.
 Lamell McMorris, the chief negotiator for the referees, called the disclosure ''a low blow.'' He accused league officials of hypocrisy, saying the N.B.A. awarded generous raises and bonuses to the three officials who supervise the referee program. 
 A league spokesman declined to comment on the issue.
 McMorris also disputed the salary figures attributed to Buchanan in his statement. Entry-level referees make $91,000, not $150,000, McMorris said, and the most tenured referees make less than $400,000, not $550,000.
 ''It's inaccurate and a feeble attempt at spin control,'' McMorris said.
 The lockout declaration was widely expected after negotiations broke down over the previous two days. The N.B.A. rejected the referees' last proposal on Thursday, a day after the referees unanimously rejected a league proposal that Buchanan referred to as the league's ''final contract offer.''
 That offer included flat salaries for this season and modest raises in 2010-11, with cuts in benefits and travel. At the referees' request, the N.B.A. agreed to limit the contract to two years, allowing the possibility for a better deal in 2011, if the economy improves. Previous contracts have spanned five years.
 Both sides say it is possible to reach an agreement before the preseason begins, but they are preparing for a long standoff. The regular season opens on Oct. 27.
 The notion of replacements officiating regular-season games sent a shudder through some league veterans. Shaquille O'Neal, who was 23 and in his fourth N.B.A. season during the last lockout, called the referees ''vital to this league.''
 ''They should be treated accordingly,'' O'Neal told FanHouse.com. ''We need perfection out there. The league needs to get this done.''
 The replacement referees were considered a disaster by fans and players in 1995. According to figures compiled by the referees union, the N.B.A. issued $202,500 in fines and suspended players a total of 26 games in November 1995. The league issued $147,000 in fines and suspended players for 22 games for the entire 1994-95 season, the union said.
 Games officiated by replacements were often chaotic. O'Neal needed surgery for a broken thumb after being fouled by Matt Geiger in a preseason game. Chris Webber missed a month after injuring his shoulder in a preseason fight with Luc Longley.
 McMorris said fans should again expect to see a flurry of fines and injuries if replacement referees start the season.
 ''This is not going to be a pretty scene for fans and players,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Beyond the Garden

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
For the first eight months of her husband's presidency, Michelle Obama has made a practice of steering clear of most policy debates, spending more time in the public eye promoting the White House's vegetable garden than its agenda. 
 But a speech on Friday, which Mrs. Obama delivered to leaders of several women's groups, signaled the beginning of an increased role in the health care debate.
 Overhauling the nation's health care system is critically important to women and is part of ''the next step'' in their quest to assure full opportunities and equality, the first lady said, speaking at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, on the White House grounds.
 ''Women aren't just disproportionately affected by this issue because of the roles that we play in families,'' she said. ''Women are affected because of the jobs that we do in this economy.''
 ''We all know that women are more likely to work part time or to work in small companies or businesses that don't provide any insurance at all,'' she said, adding that women were also affected because ''in many states, insurance companies can still discriminate because of gender -- and this is still shocking to me.'' 
 Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said health care was an important issue to the first lady. ''She's obviously a very popular figure in America,'' he said. ''If she can help out, we're happy to have her.''

HEADLINE: California Joblessness Reaches 70-Year High

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
California's unemployment rate in August hit its highest point in nearly 70 years, starkly underscoring how the nation's incipient economic recovery continues to elude millions of Americans looking for work. 
 While job losses continue to fall, the state's new unemployment rate -- 12.2 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- is far above the national average of 9.7 percent and places California, the nation's most-populous state, fourth behind Michigan, Nevada and Rhode Island. Statistics kept by the state show California's unemployment rate was 14.7 percent in 1940, said Kevin Callori, a spokesman for the California Employment Development Department.While California has convulsed under the same blows as the rest of the country over the last two years, its exposure to both the foreclosure crisis and the slowdown in construction -- an industry that has fueled growth in much of the state over the last decade -- has been outsized.
 Total building levels in California have fallen to $23 billion this year from $63 billion in 2005; home building this year is less than a quarter of what it was in 2005, according to the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. Roughly 500,000 of the state's job losses have been in construction, finance, real estate and industries related to construction. 
 ''We were at the epicenter of the housing bubble, and we are at the epicenter of the fallout,'' said Stephen Levy, senior economist and director of the center. ''The reason we are doing worse in California than other states is construction.'' 
 While California has enjoyed some signs of a comeback in recent months, unemployment, which is often the last economic indicator to turn around in a protracted recession, is expected to remain high for the near future. For example, a recent study by the University of California, Los Angeles, predicted that while the state would enjoy 2 percent quarterly growth in 2010, the unemployment rate would remain above 10 percent. 
 Such numbers have caused deep pain to a state overly reliant on personal income taxes to balance its budget. The near collapse of the stock market, which greatly reduced personal wealth in the state, and job losses related to the housing bust combined to sharply reduce that source of revenue. 
 In July, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a budget that closed a roughly $24 billion two-year gap with extensive cuts to social services, parks and education. This has left the state with large numbers of people without jobs seeking government services, which further strained its resources and hindered potential consumer spending among laid off and furloughed government workers. 
 The governor seized on California's grim unemployment milestone Friday to make a case for his current pet projects: revising the state's tax system, fixing its broken water system, which has contributed to unemployment in the state's farm regions, and tapping the federal government for all he can get. 
 ''The latest unemployment numbers reinforce the importance of combining federal, state and local efforts to put Californians back to work and to help all those struggling in this difficult economy,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger said. ''Immediately addressing our challenges, which include reforming the state's antiquated tax structure and updating our water delivery system will move the state forward and build a stronger, more diverse economy. While I am pleased to see fewer jobs lost, my administration will not rest until job growth resumes and employment returns to normal.''
 Earlier this week, Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, proclaimed that the country was emerging from its protracted recession, and doubtlessly, California is showing its own signs of recovery. In Southern California, the center of the housing bust, home sales rose 11 percent in August from a year earlier, and prices have begun to tick up as well. In addition, the state's exports are once again growing as international economics, particularly in Asia, have begun to recover and create demand for goods, and layoffs have slowed statewide.
 ''Any economist would tell you we're in a recovery,'' Mr. Levy said. ''Job losses are lessening, the G.D.P. is rising, the housing market is stabilizing, and have you looked at the stock market lately? But the unemployment rate is the thing families care about. They don't care about G.D.P. or China coming back; they care about jobs.''

HEADLINE: Back to the Grind

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The Great Recession is pushing many highly educated women who had left work to stay at home with their children to dive back into the labor pool, according to several nationally recognized experts on women in the workplace. 
 Many of these women are sending out job applications for the first time in years because their husbands were laid off, fear being laid off or had their salaries cut or because their family's investments plunged in value. 
 Last February Trudi Foutts Loh felt compelled to find full-time work, some 20 years after she quit her job to care for her two children. Her job back then as a lawyer and three hours of daily commuting made balancing everything impossible. 
 She occasionally worked as a political consultant and writer, but numerous economic worries made her conclude that that was not enough. 
 She pointed to investment losses ''in the healthy six figures,'' along with ''some very high medical expenses for a family member and having two daughters in college. And then the value of our home and pension plan has taken a tumble.''
 She feels lucky because a law school friend hired her at a prestigious firm in Pasadena, Calif.
 For Lisa Hughes, a mother of two, it was an unexpected layoff that shoved her back into the labor pool. 
 A former corporate lawyer, she moved from Montclair, N.J., to California last year, after the World Poker Tour recruited her husband to be its chief operating officer. Then, squeezed by the recession, the tour laid him off, pushing Ms. Hughes to pursue full-time work for the first time in 16 years.
 ''Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine he would be unemployed a year later,'' she said. She plans to start a solo practice because ''it's hard to find jobs after 16 years.''
 According to some economists, these women, once part of a privileged minority that could afford not to work, are now collateral damage of the recession -- not forced out of work, but back into it. 
 ''What's happened is 78 percent of the people who lost their jobs in the recession are men,'' said Joan Williams, director of the Center for WorkLife Law at the University of California Hastings College of Law in San Francisco. ''That has brought home to many families that having one income places you in a very vulnerable position. Some women who expected to take a long time out of the work force suddenly felt they needed to re-enter, in some cases much more quickly than they expected.''
 The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics found preliminary evidence of affluent women returning to the labor force. When it comes to women with a college education who are 25 to 44 years old and living with a spouse, the proportion of those working or looking for work increased to 78.4 percent in the first half of 2009, from 76 percent in the first half of 2007. Economists say this is surprising because the percentage of people in the work force usually drops as unemployed workers grow discouraged and stop looking for work in a recession.
 Over the same period, the proportion of men of the same age and circumstance inched down, falling from 97.4 percent to 97.1 percent. 
 It is too early to tell whether those numbers reflect an increase above and beyond the long-term growth of women's participation in the work force.
 Examining women's work force participation -- and especially women with children -- has been one of the battlefields of economics. 
 In the last several years, some researchers have suggested that many affluent working mothers chose to leave the work force during the boom times of the 90's and early this decade, saying there was a trend of women opting out of careers once they had children. The suggestion -- highlighted in an Oct. 26, 2003 New York Times Magazine cover article -- prompted a huge controversy. 
 Critics responded that most women had no choice but to work and that only a small affluent minority could chose not to. They said many working mothers left the labor force not because they were opting to, but because they were forced to by workplaces that made it too difficult to balance family and work. Separately, some economists argued that the decrease in women working was not caused by opting out, but by the 2001 recession that was followed by years of weak job growth. 
 Heather Boushey, a senior economist at the liberal Center for American Progress and a fierce critic of the notion of opting out, said her studies showed little difference in how often mothers and women without children left the labor force.
 Ms. Boushey nonetheless agreed that the current recession was pushing women who had stopped working for whatever reason to re-enter the labor force. 
 She said this helped explain why the percentage of women aged 20 and above in the work force has remained relatively flat during the recession, while the percentage of men has fallen slightly. ''This does indicate that some women are opting back in,'' she said. 
 One of them is Patricia Smart. She quit her banking job 14 years ago when her son was born. But last April, her husband received a layoff notice. ''It was a cosmic kick in the butt,'' said Ms. Smart, who had toyed with returning to work for years. ''It forced me to do something.'' 
 After a quick job search, she landed a job in July as a full-time manager at Wachovia Bank in Charlotte, N.C. 
 Carolyn Bednarz was not as fortunate. The former lawyer at Milbank & Tweed spent nine years at home raising three children, but she became frightened for her family's future after her banker-husband endured four rounds of layoffs and reduced bonuses. 
 Ms. Bednarz started looking for work. After a 10-month search she couldn't find a paying job. 
 ''I probably applied for 30 jobs on Craigslist, and hardly anyone writes back,'' she said, complaining that many employers aren't interested in hiring someone who has not worked in years. ''This is just the most humbling experience.'' 
 In the end, she took a position as an unpaid intern at a law firm in Marin County, Calif., north of San Francisco.
 Several studies have found that two different groups of women are likely not to return to work after giving birth: affluent ones and poor ones unable to afford child care. 
 Sylvia Ann Hewlett, founder of the Center for Work-Life Policy in New York, an independent research group, and several other economists and experts argue that there is an unmistakable trend toward women returning to the labor force -- and not just professional women. 
 ''Women are at a watershed moment,'' Ms. Hewlett said, pointing to the recession's squeeze on incomes. 
 Anna Bresnahan of Spokane, Wash., says she would not have returned to work if she and her husband had not started worrying that the bank where he worked might fail. ''I decided I could start looking. He said, 'That would be nice.' '' 
 Ms. Bresnahan, who quit a marketing job in 2001 after her first child was born, found a position with an accounting firm in December, although at a lower salary. (Studies have found that for every two years a woman is out of the labor force, her earnings fall by 10 percent, a penalty that lasts throughout her career.)
 Karen Boon felt pressured to return to working full time after staying home for five years to raise her two children. Her husband's job for Boston Scientific, a manufacturer of medical devices, was shaky and the family's investments had plunged. 
 Ms. Boon regularly visits the Opting Back In chat room, sponsored by the Hastings College of Law, where lawyers with new jobs trade stories, tips, hopes and complaints.
 ''If my husband had been laid off, it would have been a world of hurt,'' she said.
 In April, she found a temporary job as counsel for a Bay Area company that oversees surgery centers, replacing someone on maternity leave.
 She said it was a pleasure to be working with adults again.
 Still, she added, ''It is really hard to do two jobs at once -- the kids still need to be fed and the laundry still needs to get done.'' 
 Ms. Bednarz, the former Milbank lawyer turned intern, also participates in the chat room. ''The women who lead the chat room say, 'Don't jump into something until you find something that's just right,' '' she said. ''That's all well and fine, but some of us have to find something right now. It's not like we have that luxury in today's job market.''

HEADLINE: In Blow to Antidoping Efforts, Athletes Gain Leeway in Court

BYLINE: By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT; Judy Battista contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A federal court ruling has jeopardized the National Football League's ability to enforce its drug-testing program and raised significant doubts about the programs of other professional sports in the United States.
 The ruling revealed a new door for athletes to challenge their doping suspensions: players in the N.F.L., Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League may now turn to state courts, hampering the leagues' abilities to discipline players. The other leagues and the United States Anti-Doping Agency, which oversees the testing of Olympians, were so concerned about these prospects that they filed friend-of-the-court briefs supporting the N.F.L.'s position.
 ''This is the most significant legal challenge we have ever seen to the collectively bargained drug-testing programs in this country,'' Travis Tygart, the chief of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, said. 
 A three-judge panel from the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in Minneapolis, last week upheld a lower court ruling that prohibited the N.F.L. from suspending two Minnesota Vikings players who violated the league's antidoping policy, saying they could contest their suspensions in state court. The ruling was a victory for the players because Minnesota state laws -- and laws in about half of all states -- are considered worker-friendly and say that an employee cannot be penalized for an initial positive drug test.
 ''Why should a football player not have the same rights that a person in Minnesota has?'' said Mark S. Levinstein, a lawyer in Washington for the firm Williams & Connolly who has represented dozens of professional athletes, including Lance Armstrong. ''The idea that the N.F.L. is more important than the views of state legislators is ridiculous. The N.F.L. is just confronting what most businesses have to deal with, which is different laws in different states. That is just how our country is set up.''
 Scott Boras, an agent for many of the top players in baseball, said an adherence to state workplace laws would reshape the collective bargaining process, which includes the creation of doping policies. ''The parties will now have to consider the limitation of employment rights,'' he said. 
 The ruling handcuffed N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell in the league's case against the two Vikings players, Pat Williams and Kevin Williams. Goodell said that because he wanted to impose discipline evenly, he would also not enforce the four-game suspensions of two New Orleans Saints players who tested positive for the same substance. The result, for now, is that four players who violated the antidoping program are allowed to play all season without penalty.
 (All four said they had inadvertently ingested the banned substance -- the diuretic bumetanide -- when they took an over-the-counter weight-loss supplement called StarCaps.)
 ''We have players subject to two sets of rules -- six months from now, who knows how many?'' said Jeff Pash, the N.F.L.'s chief counsel. 
 He added: ''The state law issue has cast a needless cloud of uncertainty over the way in which the program is going to operate. For the first time, we have an effort to attack the program through the vehicle of one state's law, and the union's failure to stand behind the collectively bargained program has compromised it.''
 The two Vikings players initially filed suit in Minnesota state court claiming that the suspensions violated the state's Drug and Alcohol Testing in the Workplace Act and the Consumable Products Act. 
 The N.F.L. and other leagues have limited options. The N.F.L. can appeal the decision to a larger panel of federal judges. However, even though state-court suits for breaches of collective bargaining law are pre-empted by federal law, the Supreme Court has made clear that that is a relatively narrow category.
 The pro sports leagues could also try to lobby Congress to pass legislation that would state that their collective bargaining agreements trump state laws. But turning to Congress -- which is dealing with two wars, a recovering economy and health care reform -- could be difficult and presents risks because Congress could compel the leagues to adopt even more transparent and rigorous antidoping programs.
 ''They are headed down a dangerous path,'' Gabe Feldman, a professor of sports law at Tulane University, said. ''The leagues have been fighting for years to keep Congress away from meddling with their drug policies, and now they are asking for the opposite: their help. Congress rarely gives things out without asking for something in exchange, like, in this case, forcing the leagues to toughen their policies.''
 As troubling as the ruling is for the leagues, it is not known how many players will try to challenge their positive tests.
 ''I don't think competitive balance would be destroyed by this because the Vikings players are now all of a sudden going to use steroids and start looking like RoboCop,'' said Levinstein, the lawyer who has represented athletes. ''Maybe the N.F.L. should decide to test those players more in light of the state laws.''

HEADLINE: Thompson Welcomes Paterson's Backing, but Can It Help?

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
He is one of the most unpopular New York governors in a long time, if recent surveys are to be believed. He is viewed as such a liability that those same surveys say two-thirds of the state's Democrats prefer that he not run for a full term next year.
 But when it comes to political endorsements, Gov. David A. Paterson's word still counts for something -- at least it does for City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. 
 On Friday morning, Mr. Thompson eagerly accepted Mr. Paterson's endorsement of his candidacy for mayor. And he did so with gusto and without hesitation.
 ''I'm proud to have David Paterson's support and endorsement,'' Mr. Thompson said at a news conference with the governor in Madison Square Park. ''He's the governor of the state of New York. He's the leader of the Democratic Party of the state of New York.'' 
 ''David's a friend,'' he added, ''and he's someone I have a great amount of respect for. So I am honored to have his support. Is it a great day? You bet it is.''
 Mr. Paterson's endorsement was not exactly a shock. He and Mr. Thompson go back years and used to be regular dinner companions, together with Assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright. In fact, their fathers -- Basil Paterson, a former state senator and deputy mayor, and William C. Thompson Sr., a former state senator, City Council member and appellate court judge -- have been longtime political friends, too.
 But Mr. Paterson has been considered so politically unpopular lately that some people were wondering whether a Paterson endorsement could actually hurt Mr. Thompson. Indeed, the fact that the endorsement was announced on a Friday, on the same day as the start of the Jewish High Holy Days, immediately raised questions about whether Mr. Thompson was trying to play down the announcement.
 It also did not help matters that not long after the Paterson announcement, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg rolled out another notable name on Friday, when Representative Nita Lowey, a veteran Democratic lawmaker from Westchester, became the latest Democrat to buck her party's nominee. 
 Then again, Mr. Thompson does not have much choice in embracing Mr. Paterson's support, according to political analysts, because he is already down in the polls and Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire many times over, has said he is prepared to spend up to $100 million to win.
 ''I don't think that the endorsement is going to hurt Thompson,'' said Kenneth Sherrill, an emeritus political science professor at Hunter College. ''I don't think anybody is going to vote against Bill Thompson because they don't like David Paterson. That's really far-fetched.''
 Come Election Day, analysts say, what will matter is turnout, and Mr. Thompson will lean heavily on Mr. Paterson to encourage African-American and Hispanic voters in his Harlem backyard to vote Democratic.
 ''When you're outgunned 100 million to 1, you need all the help you can get,'' said Scott Levenson, a political consultant who is not affiliated with either campaign. ''Regardless of where the governor's poll numbers are, when he does a subway stop on 125th and Frederick Douglass Boulevard as he did on Election Day with council member Inez Dickens, he is a rock star in his community. And it is essential that for Billy Thompson to win, David Paterson's base -- which is north of 96th Street -- must come out to vote.'' 
 Of course, it would have helped if Mr. Paterson offered more of a full-throated endorsement. He repeatedly refused to say anything bad about Mr. Bloomberg during Friday's news conference, even going so far as to say that the mayor had ''done a good job in his two terms'' and that ''he hasn't done anything in the last year that necessarily persuades me otherwise.''
 He added, ''It is no way a put-down of Michael Bloomberg's two terms of service to this city by insisting that there be new blood in City Hall.'' 
 In praising Mr. Thompson, Mr. Paterson cited his ''courage'' in staying in the race even after Mr. Bloomberg succeeded in changing the city's term limits law so he could seek a third term.
 That thought did not placate Stuart Appelbaum, the president of the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union. He was standing beside Mr. Paterson and Mr. Thompson, and he felt compelled to jump in after Mr. Paterson spoke.
 ''Mayor Bloomberg's policies have been hurting working people in this city,'' he said, his voice rising in anger. ''We're looking at 10.3 percent unemployment in New York City. That's outrageous. If you want specifics, look at his economic development policies. They're geared towards enriching the wealthy and keeping the working people in poverty-level jobs.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Checks for a Pulse, and Finds One

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY; Bernie Becker contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Less than a year after an election that nearly wiped them out politically, conservatives are showing signs of life.
 They are still searching for new leaders and new ideas. Their victories have been more about taking advantage of President Obama's missteps than advancing an agenda that can recapture large numbers of voters. 
 But they have shown in recent weeks that they can have at least some influence as the voice of the opposition -- and in the process energize what remains of their movement. The more upbeat mood was evident in Washington on Friday at a jubilant and crowded Values Voter Summit that brought together some of the most passionate social conservatives. 
 They cheered as speakers recalled the turnout for the protest against Mr. Obama last Saturday in Washington, the August public forums that put Democrats on the defensive on health care, the successful campaign to force the White House to fire its green-jobs czar, and the push in Congress to cut financing for a community organization group, Acorn, that has long been a target of the right. 
 ''While some are prepared to write the obituary on our values and our movement, I believe we are on the brink of a great American awakening,'' Representative Mike Pence, Republican of Indiana, said at the summit, raising cheers from the crowd in the room. ''I believe we are on the brink of a great American awakening. I can see it. I can feel it wherever I go.''
 Whatever problems the conservative movement has encountered -- a string of electoral defeats, evidence that its membership is getting smaller and older, the demands of coming up with a new ideological agenda to meet changing times -- these recent victories have given new hope to this formerly dispirited base of the Republican Party that it can still command public attention and influence policy in Washington. And this is no small matter for Republicans going into next year's midterm Congressional elections, in a year when Mr. Obama will not be on top of the ballot.
 Yet while the conservative movement seems to be finding its voice again, it may be premature to say that it is back on its feet. At a time when the Republican Party is in search of new leaders, the procession of familiar faces on stage Friday and in the audience was striking. Two of the party's biggest names -- Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, and Sarah Palin, the party's vice-presidential nominee in 2008 -- did not show up at all, citing scheduling conflicts.
 Many Republicans have been arguing that the party's focus on social issues is a mistake at a time when voters are concerned about the economic downturn and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. But the emphasis at the summit, sponsored the Family Research Council, was still decidedly on issues like same-sex marriage and abortion. The crowd rose to its feet to applaud Carrie Prejean, the former Miss California who caused a furor by denouncing same-sex marriage at the Miss USA contest, as she declared that ''God chose me'' to make the case she made.
 That this bloc of the Republican Party is becoming re-energized presents complications for any Republican thinking about running for president in 2012. It is going to be hard to win the nomination without strongly courting this segment of the party.
 Finally, even though many Republicans have argued that the party needs new ideas to counter Mr. Obama, the overwhelming sentiment at the summit was that the conservative message of the past 30 years was as effective as ever.
 ''There are so many people who have told us as conservatives that we should move to the center, on the sanctity of marriage or the sanctity of life,'' said Mike Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas who ran for president in 2008 and is likely to run again in 2012. '' 'Just move to the center.'
 ''I'm not sure the center makes a whole lot of sense when it's coming from people who certainly don't have our interest, or our country's interest, at heart.''
 It is not so much that the political climate is shifting to the right; it is more that the conservative movement has found ways to break through and get attention -- often with decidedly unorthodox methods, including combative town-hall-style meetings. And the conservative movement has been helped by the backlash to the cost and sheer ambition of Mr. Obama's first-year agenda: the big economic stimulus package, the intervention in the automobile industry and the effort to reshape the health care system. The argument that the White House may be overreaching has, at the very least, given conservatives an opening.
 ''What holds the conservative movement now is how appalled everyone is at what liberals are trying to do,'' said Maggie Gallagher, the president of the National Organization for Marriage, which is fighting efforts to advance same-sex marriage. ''I think the conservative movement is far more energized than it was six months ago.''
 For now, the most significant thing about this swing of the pendulum may be simply that a part of the electorate that largely sat out the last election is suddenly interested again. ''There were conservatives that were never moved to exercise themselves that now are,'' said Erika Barger, 21, a Georgetown University student from Ormond Beach, Fla. 
 After the year that conservatives have endured, that is by any measure welcome news for them.

HEADLINE: Irving Kristol, Godfather of Neoconservatism, Is Dead at 89

BYLINE: By BARRY GEWEN

 BODY:
Irving Kristol, the political commentator who, as much as anyone, defined modern conservatism and helped revitalize the Republican Party in the late 1960s and early '70s, setting the stage for the Reagan presidency and years of conservative dominance, died Friday in Arlington, Va. He was 89 and lived in Washington. 
 His son, William Kristol, the conservative commentator and editor of the magazine The Weekly Standard, said the cause was complications of lung cancer.
 From a variety of positions -- in publishing, in academia, in the pages of The Wall Street Journal and in research groups like the American Enterprise Institute -- Mr. Kristol exerted influence across generations, from William F. Buckley Jr. to the New York Times columnist David Brooks. 
 He was known as the godfather of neoconservatism, even by those who were not entirely sure what the term meant. In probably his most widely quoted comment, Mr. Kristol defined a neoconservative as a liberal who had been ''mugged by reality.''
 It was a description that summarized his experience in the 1960s, along with that of associates like Daniel Bell, Nathan Glazer and Daniel Patrick Moynihan. New Deal Democrats all, they were social scientists who found themselves questioning many of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society ideas. 
 Mr. Kristol translated his concerns into a magazine. In 1965, with a $10,000 contribution from a wealthy acquaintance, he and Mr. Bell started The Public Interest. Its founding is generally considered the beginning of neoconservatism. ''Something like a 'movement' took shape,'' Mr. Kristol wrote, ''with The Public Interest at (or near) the center.''
 The Public Interest writers did not take issue with the ends of the Great Society so much as with the means -- the ''unintended consequences'' of the Democrats' good intentions. Welfare programs, they argued, were breeding a culture of dependency; affirmative action created social divisions and did damage to its supposed beneficiaries. They placed practicality ahead of ideals. ''The legitimate question to ask about any program,'' Mr. Kristol observed, ''is, 'Will it work?','' and the reforms of the '60s and '70s, he believed, were not working. 
 For more than six decades, beginning in 1942, when he and other recent graduates of City College founded Enquiry: A Journal of Independent Radical Thought, Mr. Kristol's life revolved around magazines. Besides The Public Interest, he published, edited and wrote for journals of opinion like Commentary, Encounter, The New Leader, The Reporter and The National Interest. 
 All were ''little magazines,'' with limited circulations, but Mr. Kristol valued the quality of his readership more than the quantity. ''With a circulation of a few hundred,'' he once said, ''you could change the world.''
 Shunning the Spotlight
 Small circles and behind-the-scenes maneuverings suited Mr. Kristol. He never sought celebrity and was puzzled by writers who craved it. Described by the economics writer Jude Wanniski as the ''hidden hand'' of the conservative movement, he avoided television and other spotlights; he was happier consulting with a congressman like Jack Kemp about the new notion of supply-side economics and then watching with satisfaction as Mr. Kemp converted President Ronald Reagan to the theory. Mr. Kristol was a man of ideas, an intellectual who waged his fiercest battles against other intellectuals.
 All the while he nurtured new generations of thinkers. In an e-mail message Friday, the columnist George F. Will wrote that Mr. Kristol had ''discovered and mentored younger writers who were receptive to his belief that the purpose of the social sciences is not to tell us what government should do but rather to tell us what government is doing that is not working, which always is a lot.''
 Neoconservatism may have begun as a dispute among liberals about the nature of the welfare state, but under Mr. Kristol it became a more encompassing perspective, what he called a ''new synthesis.'' Against what he saw as the ''nihilistic'' onslaught of the '60s counterculture, Mr. Kristol moved increasingly to the right, mounting an ever more muscular defense of capitalism, bourgeois values and what he called the aspirations of the common man.
 For him, neoconservatism, with its emphasis on values and ideas, had become no longer a corrective to liberal overreaching but an ''integral part'' of conservatism and the Republican Party, a challenge to liberalism itself, which, in his revised view, was destructive and had lost touch with ordinary people.
 Neoconservatism maintained a lingering sympathy for certain aspects of Roosevelt's New Deal, but its focus had shifted to upholding traditional standards. Liberalism led to ''moral anarchy,'' Mr. Kristol said, arguing the point with one of his wisecracking encapsulations: In the United States today, ''an 18-year-old girl has the right to public fornication in a pornographic movie -- but only if she is paid the minimum wage.''
 Some of his associates later became disaffected, among them Jacob Heilbrunn, a senior editor at The National Interest and the author of ''They Knew They Were Right: The Rise of the Neocons.'' By the 1990s, Mr. Heilbrunn wrote in an e-mail message on Friday, ''the neoconservative movement had ossified into its own kind of orthodoxy, as Kristol became an unabashed cheerleader for the Christian Right and the culture wars.''
 Many of Mr. Kristol's disciples went to become major influences on the foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration and were prominent supporters of the Iraq war.
 Mr. Kristol's rightward drift, though it brought him new allies like Buckley and Robert L. Bartley, head of The Wall Street Journal's editorial board, broke up the original Public Interest family. Moynihan went on to a successful career as a Democratic senator from New York, and Bell gave up the co-editorship of the magazine in the early '70s, declaring himself a socialist in economics, a liberal in politics and a conservative in culture. (He was replaced by Nathan Glazer.) 
 The Family Business
 But neoconservatism turned quite literally into a family affair for Mr. Kristol. His wife, Gertrude Himmelfarb, the distinguished historian of 19th-century England, wrote books and articles critical of modern permissiveness and urged a return to Victorian values. His son, William, who had been Vice President Dan Quayle's chief of staff, became a leading spokesman for neoconservatism in his own right as a television commentator, the editor of The Weekly Standard and briefly a columnist for The Times. Friends referred to them as America's first family of neoconservatism.
 Mr. Kristol's weapon of choice was the biting polemical essay of ideas, a form he mastered as part of the famed circle of writers and critics known as the New York Intellectuals, among them the ferocious literary brawlers Mary McCarthy and Dwight Macdonald. Mr. Kristol once described feeling intimidated at a cocktail party when he was seated with McCarthy on one side, Hannah Arendt on the other and Diana Trilling across from him. 
 He learned the hard way that he was not destined to be an author of books. In the late '50s he spent three months researching a study of the evolution of American democracy, only to abandon the project, he said, once he realized ''it was all an exercise in futility.'' An attempted novel was consigned to his incinerator. ''I was not a book writer,'' he said.
 The four volumes published under his name -- ''On the Democratic Idea in America'' (1972), ''Two Cheers for Capitalism'' (1978), ''Reflections of a Neoconservative'' (1983) and ''Neoconservatism: The Autobiography of an Idea'' (1995) -- are collections of previously published articles.
 As an essayist, Mr. Kristol was sharp, witty, aphoristic and assertive. ''Equivocation has never been Irving Kristol's long suit,'' his friend Robert H. Bork said of him. Before achieving his reputation as a writer on political and social affairs, he was a wide-ranging generalist. In the 1940s and '50s, his subjects included Einstein, psychoanalysis, Jewish humor and the Marquis de Sade.
 His erudition could burst out at unexpected moments. An attack on environmental extremists uses a quotation from Auden; a passage about American men's obsession with golf cites T. S. Eliot. But he could be a verbal street fighter as well. John Kenneth Galbraith, he wrote, ''thinks he is an economist and, if one takes him at his word, it is easy to demonstrate that he is a bad one.'' After it was revealed that Magic Johnson had tested H.I.V. positive, Mr. Kristol wrote: ''He is a foolish, reckless man who does not merit any kind of character reference.''
 Mr. Kristol seemed to need enemies: the counterculture; the academic and media professionals who formed what he called the New Class; and, finally, liberalism in its entirety. And he certainly made enemies with his harsh words. 
 Yet underlying the invective was an innate skepticism. This stalwart defender of free enterprise could manage only two cheers for capitalism. ''Extremism in defense of liberty,'' he declared, taking issue with Barry Goldwater, ''is always a vice because extremism is but another name for fanaticism.'' The two major intellectual influences on him, he said, were Lionel Trilling, ''a skeptical liberal,'' and Leo Strauss, ''a skeptical conservative.'' 
 ''Ever since I can remember,'' he said in summing himself up, ''I've been a neo-something: a neo-Marxist, a neo-Trotskyist, a neo-liberal, a neo-conservative and, in religion, always a neo-orthodox, even while I was a neo-Trotskyist and a neo-Marxist. I'm going to end up a neo. Just neo, that's all. Neo-dash-nothing.''
 City College Leftist
 Irving William Kristol was born on Jan. 20, 1920, in Brooklyn into a family of low-income, nonobservant Jews. His father, Joseph, a middleman in the men's clothing business, went bankrupt several times; his mother, Bessie, died of cancer when he was 16. ''We were poor, but then everyone was poor, more or less,'' Mr. Kristol recalled.
 In the late 1930s he attended the highly politicized, overwhelmingly Jewish City College, where his indignation at the injustices of the Great Depression pushed him to the left, but not the far left. In the large, dingy school cafeteria were a number of alcoves where students could gather with like-minded colleagues. There was an athlete's alcove, a Catholic alcove, a black alcove, an R.O.T.C. alcove. But the alcoves that later became famous were Numbers One and Two.
 Alcove One held leftists of various stripes; Alcove Two housed the Stalinists, including a young Julius Rosenberg. The Stalinists outnumbered the anti-Stalinists by as much as 10-1, but among the anti-Stalinists were Daniel Bell as well as the future sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset and the future literary critic Irving Howe. Howe recruited Mr. Kristol into the Trotskyists, and though Mr. Kristol's career as a follower of the apostate Communist Leon Trotsky was brief, it lasted beyond his graduation from City College, long enough for him to meet Gertrude Himmelfarb at a Trotskyist gathering in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. He fell in love, and the two were married in 1942, when she was 19 and he was just short of his 22nd birthday. Besides William, they also had a daughter, Elizabeth. They, along with their mother and five grandchildren, survive him.
 After marrying, Mr. Kristol followed his wife to Chicago, where she was doing graduate work and where he had what he called ''my first real experience of America.'' Drafted into the Army with a number of street-tough and often anti-Semitic Midwesterners, he found himself shedding his youthful radical optimism. ''I can't build socialism with these people,'' he concluded. ''They'll probably take it over and make a racket out of it.''
 In his opinion, his fellow G.I.'s were inclined to loot, rape and murder, and only Army discipline held them in check. It was a perception about human nature that would stay with him, creating a tension with his alternative view that ordinary people were to be trusted more than intellectuals to do the right thing.
 After the war he and Ms. Himmelfarb spent a year in Cambridge, England, while she pursued her studies. When they returned to the United States in 1947, he took an editing job with Commentary, then a liberal anti-Communist magazine.
 In 1952, at the height of the McCarthy era, Mr. Kristol wrote what he called his most controversial article: '' 'Civil Liberties,' 1952 -- A Study in Confusion.'' It criticized many of those defending civil liberties against the government inquisitors, saying they failed to understand the conspiratorial danger of Communism. Though he called McCarthy a ''vulgar demagogue,'' the article was remembered for a few lines: ''For there is one thing that the American people know about Senator McCarthy: He, like them, is unequivocally anti-Communist. About the spokesmen for American liberalism, they feel they know no such thing. And with some justification.''
 After leaving Commentary, Mr. Kristol was executive director of the American Committee for Cultural Freedom, an anti-Communist organization, then moved to England in 1953 to help found Encounter magazine with the poet Stephen Spender. They made an unlikely pair: Spender, tall, artsy, sophisticated; Kristol, short, brash, still rough around the edges. Together, they made Encounter one of the foremost highbrow magazines of its time. 
 But another explosive controversy awaited Mr. Kristol. It was later revealed that the magazine had been receiving financial support from the C.I.A. Mr. Kristol always denied any knowledge of the connection. But he hardly appeased his critics when he added that he did not disapprove of the C.I.A.'s secret subsidies.
 Back in New York at the end of 1958, Kristol worked for a year at another liberal anti-Communist magazine, The Reporter, then took a job at Basic Books, rising to executive vice president. In 1969 he left for New York University, and while teaching there he became a columnist for The Wall Street Journal.
 It was during this time that Mr. Kristol became uncomfortable with liberalism, his own and that of others. He supported Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey in his 1968 presidential campaign against Richard M. Nixon, saying that ''the prospect of electing Mr. Nixon depresses me.'' But by 1970 he was dining at the Nixon White House, and in 1972 he backed Nixon's re-election. By the mid-'70s he had registered as a Republican. 
 Always the neoconservative, however, Mr. Kristol was delighted when President Reagan, another Democratic convert, expressed admiration for Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1987 Mr. Kristol left New York University to become the John M. Olin Distinguished Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.
 A Preacher of Faith
 By now Mr. Kristol was battling on several fronts. He published columns and essays attacking liberalism, and in 1978 he and William E. Simon, who had been Nixon's secretary of the treasury, formed the Institute for Educational Affairs to funnel corporate and foundation money to conservative causes. In 1985 Mr. Kristol started The National Interest, a journal devoted to foreign affairs.
 But he railed not just against the left. He criticized America's commercial class for its greed, and urged it to take responsibility for itself and the larger society. Republicans, Mr. Kristol said, had for half a century been ''the stupid party,'' with not much more on their minds than balanced budgets and opposition to the welfare state. He instructed them to support economic growth by cutting taxes and not to oppose New Deal institutions. 
 Above all, Mr. Kristol preached a faith in ordinary people. ''It is the self-imposed assignment of neoconservatives,'' he wrote, ''to explain to the American people why they are right, and to the intellectuals why they are wrong.''
 Mr. Kristol saw religion and a belief in the afterlife as the foundation for the middle-class values he championed. He argued that religion provided a necessary constraint to antisocial, anarchical impulses. Without it, he said, ''the world falls apart.''
 Yet Mr. Kristol's own religious views were so ambiguous that some friends questioned whether he believed in God. In 1996, he told an interviewer: ''I've always been a believer.'' But, he added, ''don't ask me in what.''
 In 2002, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, often considered the nation's highest civilian honor. It was another satisfying moment for a man who appears to have delighted in his life. He once said that his career had been ''one instance of good luck after another.'' Some called him a cheerful conservative. He did not dispute it. He had had much, he said, ''to be cheerful about.''

HEADLINE: Tired Protectionism

 BODY:
After President Obama decided to impose a 35 percent tariff on Chinese-made tires, China reacted angrily and predictably: threatening to impose its own tariffs on American auto products and chicken meat. Nationalist bloggers urged China's leaders to strike back even harder and to stop buying United States government debt. 
 Both governments need to make sure the situation doesn't spin out of control. A trade war would have no real winners and millions of losers in both countries. 
 China's export-dependent economy would suffer more. It exports almost four-and-a-half times as much to the United States as it imports. If it abruptly stopped buying Treasury debt, it would slash the value of its own, mostly dollar-denominated foreign reserves. But the United States would also lose. American consumers and companies would have to pay more for Chinese goods. And if China were to cut back its purchases of United States government bonds, the Treasury Department would have to raise interest rates, driving up the deficit even further.
 An all-out trade war between the world's two largest economies would wreak havoc on the global economy just as it is struggling to come back. 
 Neither side can claim the high ground. Mr. Obama acted unwisely, invoking a never-before used section of American trade law that allows him to penalize even fair Chinese competition if it results in sharply increased imports and job losses in the United States. China can legally retaliate in car parts and chicken meat, but only if it can prove actual dumping -- selling below cost, a much stricter standard. 
 China has not been competing unfairly on tires -- just more effectively, mainly because of its far lower labor costs. As a result, its tire exports to the United States tripled from 2004 to 2008. Four United States tire factories have shut down since 2006, with more to follow. 
 Armed with these findings, the Obama administration tried to persuade Beijing to restrain its tire exports. After that failed, it acted on its own, announcing the stiff new tariffs. That kind of protectionist remedy may be legal, but it is bad economics and bad foreign policy. 
 Let's be clear. China has its own very worrisome trade record. It imposes export taxes and other restrictions on domestic supplies of raw materials essential to steel and aluminum manufacturing, giving its own companies an unfair advantage. It refuses to enforce intellectual property agreements. And it maintains its currency at suspiciously low values against the dollar, artificially cheapening the cost of its exports to the United States. 
 All of these issues should be the focus of serious bilateral discussions. Now that Mr. Obama has invoked the tariff on tires, he has to keep them in place at least through spring. He should start looking now for ways to walk back from the brink. He will meet China's president, Hu Jintao, next week at the Group of 20 economic summit meetings in Pittsburgh. The two leaders need to work together to revive the world economy and constrain the nuclear ambitions of both North Korea and Iran. 
 Mr. Obama's tariff decision followed strong protests from American tire workers and their union, the United Steelworkers. But the additional duties are unlikely to give them lasting relief. In a globalized economy, raising tariffs cannot long protect uncompetitive businesses. If the price of Chinese-made tires goes up, American companies and businesses will buy tires from other low-cost producers. American tire factories will continue to be phased out, and jobs will continue to disappear. 
 Like all American workers, these workers can best be helped by regenerating growth at home and abroad. Protectionist remedies, even legal ones like this, impede that growth without providing long-term replacements for vulnerable, trade-threatened jobs.

HEADLINE: New Rules Seek To Force Banks To Restrict Pay

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and LOUISE STORY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve and the Treasury are preparing broad new rules that would force banks to rein in practices that made multimillionaires out of many financial executives during the housing bubble, officials said.
 The rules depart from the hands-off approach that dominated bank regulation for the last three decades, but are not as strict as proposals from some European leaders and suggestions from some members of Congress angered by the financial troubles of the last year.
 Fed officials would give banks wide leeway in how they structure their rewards. They would not prohibit million-dollar pay packages or address issues of fairness. Rather, the rules are intended to restrict pay plans that encourage reckless behavior by rewarding only short-term gains. 
 And because the rules would be applied through the confidential bank examination process, it would be hard for consumers and investors to judge how strictly the rules were being applied. 
 The effort is also meant to be a credible alternative to the call by some European leaders for specific limits on bonuses to financial executives, an idea opposed by the Obama administration. Officials from Europe and the Treasury are negotiating over compensation and other financial industry regulations in advance of a summit meeting next week in Pittsburgh of leaders from the Group of 20 industrialized and large emerging countries.
 The Obama administration opposes strict caps on pay, arguing that the size of the bonuses are not as important as the risk to the financial health of the bank that bonuses linked to performance can create. 
 ''The simple proposition should be that you don't want people being paid for taking too much risk, and you want to make sure that their compensation is tied to long-term performance,'' said Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, in an interview by telephone. 
 Coming at a time of fierce political debate about the Fed's failure to rein in reckless mortgage lending, the rules may have the side benefit of helping the agency improve its image in Congress as it considers whether to trim or expand the Fed's authority. 
 The draft rules, which are expected to be introduced in the next several weeks, would apply not just to the pay and bonuses of top executives but also of traders, loan officers and others. The biggest and most complex institutions, roughly 20 companies, would have to present their compensation plans to bank regulators, who could then demand changes.
 Fed officials do not plan to impose specific rules on how those banks structure their pay plans. Instead, they are expected to spell out ways in which banks can reduce incentives for excessive risk-taking. 
 For example, examiners will be looking to see whether banks defer bonus compensation for several years, allowing enough time for risks and potential losses to surface. 
 Examiners are also expected to look for banks to link the size of performance bonuses to the riskiness of particular businesses. And they will support ''clawbacks'' that would enable companies to reclaim money if profits turn out to have been illusory after an executive has been paid.
 ''It's more than window-dressing,'' said Simon Johnson, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, who has often accused the Fed and the Obama administration of being too timid about reforming bank practices. 
 Bank executives said they welcomed the Fed's efforts, which were first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Some executives, speaking on the condition of anonymity so as not to antagonize lawmakers, said they hoped that the Fed's efforts would dissuade Congress, many of whose members were furious over bonuses paid to American International Group, from passing much stricter limits on pay. 
 Some industry analysts said the Fed's plan would complement what banks have already started doing in their own self-interest.
 ''The bigger banks have been on this,'' said Stuart Plesser, an analyst with Standard & Poor's Equity Research. 
 Though the Federal Reserve has been in charge of the effort, Fed officials have been working closely with the Treasury in the run-up to the Group of 20 meeting.
 Already, American and European officials appear to have smoothed over some of their differences. In a statement on Thursday outlining positions at the coming meeting, the Europeans called for many of the same proposals as the United States on executive compensation and softened calls by France for specific limits on bonuses.
 The European statement called on global leaders to ''explore ways to limit total variable remuneration,'' instead of calling for immediate agreement on such limits.
 Fed officials are expected to have a two-tier system of supervising pay, using different approaches for the nation's 20 biggest bank holding companies on the one hand, and the thousands of smaller banks on the other.
 The money-center bank holding companies, like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, would present their compensation plans to bank regulators, who would then evaluate them to see if the pay incentives properly balanced goals of short-term growth and long-term stability.
 Bank regulators would have the authority to demand changes in the pay packages, and they would monitor pay practices as part of their regular examination.
 For smaller institutions, Fed officials would issue supervisory ''guidance'' on the principles that banks should follow in designing their compensation programs.
 The Fed program would come on top of what Kenneth Feinberg, the Treasury Department's special master for executive compensation, is already doing to scrutinize executive pay at companies that received money from the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program. 
 Mr. Feinberg is reviewing the pay packages at hundreds of banks, but he only has the power to demand changes for the few dozen most senior or highly paid executives at the seven institutions, including American International Group, Citigroup, Bank of America and General Motors, that received ''exceptional'' government assistance. 
 By contrast, the Fed's program would affect about 5,000 bank holding companies as well as state-chartered banks. It would reach much more deeply into the operational levels of a bank, setting rules for midlevel traders, loan officers and office managers whose pay is tied to revenues generated by local branches.
 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees national banks, is also considering new pay rules for its banks, a government official said. 
 It remains to be seen if the lack of specificity sits well in Congress, where Democratic critics of the Fed, like Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, chairman of the Senate banking committee, want to strip the agency of its authority to regulate consumer lending practices. 
 Some critics also oppose President Obama's plan to expand the Fed's authority as a ''systemic risk'' regulator, arguing that it was not vigilant enough during the housing bubble.
 But Republican critics are attacking the Fed as well, charging that it has accumulated far too much power during the financial crisis and become too autocratic in telling banks what to do.

HEADLINE: Even Walking Away, They Still Look Good

BYLINE: By CATHY HORYN

 BODY:
The dresses at Calvin Klein were light and squashy. Go ahead and play. ''It's not precious,'' the designer, Francisco Costa, said backstage at Calvin Klein, grabbing a silvery gray parachute dress and wadding up the silk organza in his hands. He released it, and the long crinkly dress floated back into place on its rail.
 Mr. Costa, in jeans and a white shirt, shrugged. ''After all the stiff stuff that I've been doing, this is refreshing,'' he said. 
He wasn't dismissing the ''stiff stuff'' -- the matte wool of fall that looked nibbled by moths, the molded white cubes of spring. He was merely saying that it was time for a change.
 Well, timing is everything in fashion. Many designers used fabrics for spring that were washed, crinkled, pleated, bonded, perforated, needle-punched, sanded, frayed and dyed or printed to resemble other fabrics. And because some of these processes are also used by makers of fast fashion -- at lower prices and with widely varying results -- innovators have to be that much more clever.
 The cottons and lightweight wools that Mr. Costa developed for his latest collection would challenge a copycat. They even puzzled editors watching his show on Thursday.
 Was a loose tank dress with smudged bands of gray, smoky brown and ivory a print? Actually, it consisted of strips of wool, silk and nylon that were sewn together. Needle-punching gave the seams the hand-done texture of darning.
 In an exemplary way, then, Mr. Costa made new fabrics the star of his show. The shapes were relatively simple: racer-back tank dresses, floaty shifts with single sleeves, boyfriend blazers and slim pants. In the past there has sometimes been a tug of war between the cut of Mr. Costa's clothes and the fabrics. This time there was perfect harmony.
 Ralph Lauren's homage in denim and faded silk to the resilience of Americans during the Depression remained firmly on a commercial level. It's a little surprising that Mr. Lauren chose a theme of hard times. (Isn't the current recession coming to an end?) In any case, he didn't shatter any assumptions. He showed weathered jeans, loose bib-front dresses with vests, and some pretty dresses in country florals. The last were reminiscent of styles that Laura Ashley produced in the 1980s, and which were popular with a lot of women.
 For a collection based on American virtues, the clothes didn't exactly cut a strong figure. There were smart-looking pinstripes, but these are a Lauren staple. As for the many faded and crinkly fabrics, in blue and silvery white, they looked limp and uninspired.
 Served up between the Lauren and Calvin Klein shows were the collections of L'Wren Scott and Isaac Mizrahi. Each was awash in gorgeous color, and seemed determined to say something fresh about American fashion. Just in the nick of time, too: the collections ended on Thursday. 
 Held at the Gagosian Gallery, where guests had a view into the backstage area, Ms. Scott's show included an ivory silk taffeta jacket paired with a papery ruffled blouse and sexy gray jeans, a one-piece shorts set in satiny pink silk, and a goodly number of sheath dresses that were kept light and interesting with small changes like a wide, low back or a boat neck with tiny cap sleeves.
 One of Ms. Scott's signature headmistress dresses, in pink wool, had a candy-striper pink collar. It didn't exactly say ''nurse.''
 Recreating the backstage mood of a movie set or perhaps a Broadway stage, Mr. Mizrahi sent out soft, flirty skirts in mottled silk prints with masculine cropped jackets or a stiff wool bustier. There were cheeky takes on the polo shirt (in knit with sheer nylon backs), and the strappy three-tone shoes seemed a deconstructed version of a hoofer's fancy wingtips. Bags were miniature versions of vintage suitcases.
 Mr. Mizrahi had fun. At intervals during the show, theatrical rain poured down on raised platforms as a Woody Allen-type -- an actor and comic named Stuart Jenkins -- trotted from the sides and opened an umbrella for a model. Later, another stagehand drove out onto the runway in a golf cart, transporting a model in a black sequin jacket and shorts with a white polka-dot silk jacquard blouse. On her head was a cardboard skipper. 
 Fashion is all entrance, at least in Mr. Mizrahi's mind. It just so happens that the clothes are good-looking and wearable, too.

HEADLINE: The Financial Turmoil, One Year Later

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''A Year After a Cataclysm, Little Change on Wall St.'' (front page, Sept. 12): 
 It is outrageous that a year after the second greatest financial collapse in the history of our country, broad new financial regulations have not been introduced. With $600 trillion of unregulated derivatives, banks continue to be excessively leveraged, and bonuses based on paper profits continue to remove investor liquidity from the market. 
 Who is protecting investors and taxpayers from Wall Street greed and reckless behavior? The absence of regulation reflects the power of the banking lobby, and the gross incompetence of our government. 
 Dan Petashnick West Hartford, Conn., Sept. 12, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Lehman Had to Die, It Seems, So Global Finance Could Live,'' by Joe Nocera (Talking Business column, front page, Sept. 12): 
 Mr. Nocera's argument hinges on the view that if Henry M. Paulson Jr., Treasury secretary at the time of Lehman Brothers' demise, and Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, had permitted the firm to live, Congress would not have panicked and passed legislation authorizing $700 billion to strengthen the financial sector. 
 Without that legislation, the crisis could have been much worse, he argues, as the government would not have been in a position to save A.I.G. or Merrill Lynch, whose failures posed more danger to the global system.
 But given the close, complex links between banks and financial institutions, and the lack of trust between counterparties at that time, the effect of a Lehman failure would have been much wider than that firm's size alone would indicate.
 While Lehman was not itself a bank with a key position in the payment system -- which other banks rely on as an intermediary when making payments to one another -- Lehman's financial dealings with such key banks made those banks' financial positions very sensitive to a shift in confidence. 
 And if confidence were shaken, deposits and other short-term financing could be withdrawn at short notice, causing such a bank to fail. The mere rumor that a key bank had material business with Lehman could have had huge effects. 
 The Fed and the Treasury should have taken over Lehman to safeguard the smooth functioning of the payment system. Shareholders would have absorbed losses first, and senior management would have been replaced.
 The idea that Congress would not have passed the bailout if Lehman had been seized and stabilized, while tantalizing, ignores the fact that various other key banks and financial institutions were also on the brink. And with Lehman stabilized, Congress would have had more time and, perhaps, passed better legislation.
 Clarence Schwab Managing Partner, C. Schwab Larchmont, N.Y., Sept. 16, 2009
 To the Editor:
 The unfairness lies not in Lehman Brothers' being allowed to fail, but in the bailout of other firms like Bear Stearns, Citigroup and AIG.
 If bank holding companies like Citigroup had failed instead of being rescued, their separately incorporated and well-capitalized commercial bank subsidiaries would have simply continued in business under new ownership, with no necessary losses to depositors or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
 Last year Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, and Henry M. Paulson Jr., Treasury secretary at the time, did irreparable harm to the principle of financial responsibility. The Senate should resoundingly reject Mr. Bernanke's nomination for a second term.
 J. Huston McCulloch Upper Arlington, Ohio, Sept. 12, 2009
 The writer is a professor of economics and finance at Ohio State University.
 To the Editor:
 Some may question the memory of this 85-year-old, yet I have no doubt that less than a year ago the nation was being assured by government officials that the huge bailouts of financial institutions were necessary because -- in the interest of avoiding a national disaster -- those institutions were too large to be allowed to fail. 
 Despite that, our government has permitted (or encouraged) some banks to gobble up others. For example, JPMorgan Chase acquired Washington Mutual, and Bank of America absorbed Merrill Lynch. 
 So I was dismayed that your suggestions in ''Reforming the Financial System'' (editorial, Sept. 14) did not include reducing the size of financial institutions in order to minimize the chances of future huge bailouts at taxpayer expense.
 Lester Goldstein Seattle, Sept. 15, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Robbed by the Bank,'' by Jane Pedreira, who was laid off from Lehman Brothers a week before it went bankrupt (Op-Ed, Sept. 15): 
 Ms. Pedreira's self-pitying line -- ''did I deserve to be robbed because of the mistakes of others?'' -- would be more appropriate posted on the hundreds of thousands of houses in foreclosure. 
 Compensation at investment banks is tied to the game of gambling with other people's money: heads I win, tails you lose. 
 Now that the downside has finally become clear, we're being told by some on Wall Street that it's a bad idea to limit bonuses because employees might run away, as if they were rare specimens who must be cultivated at any cost. Wrong! These are ordinary, easily replaceable people. 
 The really rare specimens on which our civilization depends are those who are motivated by a passion for their work, from researchers to kindergarten teachers. These are the ones we must cultivate; if not, we are doomed.
 Thomas E. Stern Valbonne, France, Sept. 16, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Judge Rejects a Settlement Over Bonuses'' (front page, Sept. 15):
 It was a single person who insisted that some of the culprits in our financial calamity not only be identified but actually be held accountable. It wasn't the executive branch, or the regulators, or Congress. It was Judge Jed S. Rakoff. 
 All those who are interested in equality before the law should be grateful to our founding fathers for their wisdom in establishing an independent third branch of government that isn't susceptible to campaign contributions and lobbying. He is the kind of judge they envisioned, and he has met their highest expectations.
 James P. Tuthill Lafayette, Calif., Sept. 15, 2009
 The writer is a lecturer at the School of Law at the University of California, Berkeley.
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Bernanke Says Growth Is Returning'' (Business Day, Sept. 16):
 Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, says that the recession is ''very likely'' over and that it may be months before unemployment starts to drop. That's like saying the cancer is cured when the patient dies. 
 Let's define ''recession'' so it means something real.

HEADLINE: Real Men Tax Gas

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Do we owe the French and other Europeans a second look when it comes to their willingness to exercise power in today's world? Was it really fair for some to call the French and other Europeans ''cheese-eating surrender monkeys?'' Is it time to restore the French in ''French fries'' at the Congressional dining room, and stop calling them ''Freedom Fries?'' Why do I ask these profound questions?
 Because we are once again having one of those big troop debates: Do we send more forces to Afghanistan, and are we ready to do what it takes to ''win'' there? This argument will be framed in many ways, but you can set your watch on these chest-thumpers: ''toughness,'' ''grit,'' ''fortitude,'' ''willingness to do whatever it takes to realize big stakes'' -- all the qualities we tend to see in ourselves, with some justification, but not in Europeans. 
 But are we really that tough? If the metric is a willingness to send troops to Iraq and Afghanistan and consider the use of force against Iran, the answer is yes. And we should be eternally grateful to the Americans willing to go off and fight those fights. But in another way -- when it comes to doing things that would actually weaken the people we are sending our boys and girls to fight -- we are total wimps. We are, in fact, the wimps of the world. We are, in fact, so wimpy our politicians are afraid to even talk about how wimpy we are.
 How so? France today generates nearly 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear power plants, and it has managed to deal with all the radioactive waste issues without any problems or panics. And us? We get about 20 percent and have not been able or willing to build one new nuclear plant since the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, even though that accident led to no deaths or injuries to plant workers or neighbors. We're too afraid to store nuclear waste deep in Nevada's Yucca Mountain -- totally safe -- at a time when French mayors clamor to have reactors in their towns to create jobs. In short, the French stayed the course on clean nuclear power, despite Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, and we ran for cover.
 How about Denmark? Little Denmark, sweet, never-hurt-a-fly Denmark, was hit hard by the 1973 Arab oil embargo. In 1973, Denmark got all its oil from the Middle East. Today? Zero. Why? Because Denmark got tough. It imposed on itself a carbon tax, a roughly $5-a-gallon gasoline tax, made massive investments in energy efficiency and in systems to generate energy from waste, along with a discovery of North Sea oil (about 40 percent of its needs).
 And us? When it comes to raising gasoline taxes or carbon taxes -- at a perfect time like this when prices are already low -- our politicians tell us it is simply ''off the table.'' So I repeat, who is the real tough guy here? 
 ''The first rule of warfare is: 'Take the high ground.' Even the simplest Taliban fighter knows that,'' said David Rothkopf, energy consultant and author of ''Superclass.'' ''The strategic high ground in the world -- whether it is in the Middle East or vis-a-vis difficult countries like Russia and Venezuela -- is to be less dependent on oil. And yet, we simply refuse to seize it.'' 
 According to the energy economist Phil Verleger, a $1 tax on gasoline and diesel fuel would raise about $140 billion a year. If I had that money, I'd devote 45 cents of each dollar to pay down the deficit and satisfy the debt hawks, 45 cents to pay for new health care and 10 cents to cushion the burden of such a tax on the poor and on those who need to drive long distances. 
 Such a tax would make our economy healthier by reducing the deficit, by stimulating the renewable energy industry, by strengthening the dollar through shrinking oil imports and by helping to shift the burden of health care away from business to government so our companies can compete better globally. Such a tax would make our population healthier by expanding health care and reducing emissions. Such a tax would make our national-security healthier by shrinking our dependence on oil from countries that have drawn a bull's-eye on our backs and by increasing our leverage over petro-dictators, like those in Iran, Russia and Venezuela, through shrinking their oil incomes.
 In sum, we would be physically healthier, economically healthier and strategically healthier. And yet, amazingly, even talking about such a tax is ''off the table'' in Washington. You can't mention it. But sending your neighbor's son or daughter to risk their lives in Afghanistan? No problem. Talk away. Pound your chest.
 I am not sure what the right troop number is for Afghanistan; I need to hear more. But I sure know this: There is something wrong when our country is willing to consider spending more lives and treasure in Afghanistan, where winning is highly uncertain, but can't even talk about a gasoline tax, which is win, win, win, win, win -- with no uncertainty at all.
 So, I ask yet again: Who are the real cheese-eating surrender monkeys in this picture?

HEADLINE: A Liquid Keepsake

BYLINE: By JONATHAN MILES

 BODY:
SOMETHING borrowed, something blue. And something shaken, something stirred.
 The signature cocktail at wedding receptions -- a novelty 10 years ago, when brides besotted with ''Sex and the City'' began calling for Cosmopolitans all around -- has gone, in the last few years, from optional to almost obligatory. 
 ''It's absolutely become part of the wedding party checklist,'' said David Tutera, a New York City party planner and the host of ''My Fair Wedding'' on cable television. The mad rush to the bar that once started receptions, sometimes evoking Wal-Mart on the morning after Thanksgiving, is being steadily replaced by something tamer: a server bearing a tray of pre-selected cocktails, greeting arriving guests. 
 But until recently, what went into those cocktails was usually an afterthought, or dictated by the wedding's color scheme. ''We used to be able to throw together some prosecco with pomegranate juice, for some pink color,'' said Xochitl Gonzalez, a Manhattan wedding planner, ''but now it's gotten more thoughtful.''
 Cross-cultural couple? Look for a signature cocktail with ingredients from both cultures mixed into the drink. Geographic touchstone? The cocktail can tell that story, too, as an Alabama slammer did at a reception last month, orchestrated by Ms. Gonzalez, for a New York couple relocating to Alabama. ''Crazy as it sounds,'' Mr. Tutera said, ''the drink can make a statement about the couple.''
 Sometimes the statement is subtle. At her wedding reception last summer, at Arrows Restaurant in Ogunquit, Me., Jane Brown, 26, chose a sake-based cocktail, to reflect her husband's fondness for Asian cuisine, along with a classic sidecar for herself. Danielle Johnson, the restaurant's events coordinator, said she had seen a significant increase over the last two years in the attention couples are paying to their cocktails. Extensive tastings are now commonplace. 
 So are offbeat requests. Recently, Ms. Johnson said, ''we had a bride who was a pastry chef who wanted to use cocoa powder in a drink.'' The restaurant's bartender devised a cocktail in which gin is shaken with red currant sorbet and cocoa-infused simple syrup, then served in a glass rimmed with cocoa powder. It's a lively, complex drink -- a far cry from the weak gin-and-tonics that once defined wedding reception drinking.
 Ms. Gonzalez, along with several other wedding planners, pinned the intensifying focus on cocktails to brides and grooms who are increasingly savvy about their drinking. ''The whole mixology trend has definitely transferred to bridal,'' she said. ''The game has been raised.'' 
 Some, like Mr. Tutera, also credited the economic recession for spurring the trend, noting that serving a signature cocktail, no matter how thoughtful or complex, is considerably less costly than hosting a full open bar. 
 For Mrs. Brown, however, there are more lasting benefits to a memorable signature wedding cocktail. ''It's something like the first-dance song,'' she said. ''Something iconic that you can hold on to for years to come. Even now, when we're out to dinner, my father-in-law will sometimes get a goofy look on his face and say, 'I'll have a sidecar.' ''

HEADLINE: Treated Like Dogs? Yes, and Very Well

BYLINE: By DAVID CORCORAN

 BODY:
HERE is a first, for me anyway: a restaurant owner whose day job is training dogs.
 No jokes, please. If you think about it, working with pets requires an instinct for human behavior; as Cesar Millan, the famed Dog Whisperer, puts it: ''I rehabilitate dogs. I train people.''
So perhaps it wasn't such a stretch for Joshua Cederbaum -- the buoyant 30-year-old owner of Doggy Tales, a company that works with animal shelters to rehabilitate lost or abandoned dogs -- to open Market in downtown Montclair in May, in the midst of the worst economic downturn in memory. And in hindsight, it's clear he knew just what it would take to captivate this food-obsessed town: 
 A staff as outgoing as he is, one that observes his dress code -- miscellaneous T-shirts and shorts or jeans -- and imparts a ''We try harder'' ethic that feels genuine and winning.
 A sweetly nostalgic early-20th-century railroad-car diner (the former Greek Delights) with just 45 seats, 18 of them at a counter trimmed with a hand-painted nursery rhyme: ''To market, to market to buy a fat pig ... .'' 
 And most important, a menu (top price: $19) that lives up to the restaurant's name -- abundant with fresh produce from local markets, mainly organic and grown or raised on farms within a day's drive of Montclair.
 ''Sustainable and seasonal'' is the culinary mantra du jour, of course, and such claims should be viewed with narrowed eyes, even at a restaurant whose countertops hold wooden crates overflowing with fat, gorgeous eggplants and ears of corn in the bright green peak of health. 
 But to sample one of the ''market plates'' here -- a choice of appetizer-size, largely vegetarian dishes, at one for $5 or four for $16 -- is to know that Market means what it says. The chef, Dave Augenti, a 28-year-old Morris County native who acquired his fresh-and-local chops in the kitchen of a seaside restaurant in Northern California, delivers an all-star lineup.
 One recent evening, our group of six (seated at two adjoining booths, since the old diner's configuration means a limit of four to a table) shared two of these plates, passing them back and forth. They were magazine-cover art, and they tasted as exuberant as they looked. 
 On one plate were glowingly purple beets, steamed until tender and tossed with goat cheese and walnuts; pale green cucumbers in a satiny cilantro creme fraiche; bright red heirloom tomatoes in chive pesto; and perfect golden Jersey peaches, seared with honey and cinnamon. 
 The assortment on the other plate was not quite so photogenic but texturally bolder: whole baby carrots, glazed with honey butter; half an ear of corn flecked with black from the grill; green beans sauteed with almonds and orange zest; and a dish that competed with a hanger steak entree for meatiest: thick, chewy collard greens with a generous, smoke-infused hunk of bacon.
 Whew. Perhaps fortunately, since I was nearly full by then, few main courses reached such heights. The hanger steak was pleasant, with a sweet coffee-orange glaze; the dish's strongest element was a tangy horseradish potato salad. Two pan-fried chicken thighs in ale batter got the comfort-food job done, especially with their side of blue corn bread drizzled with citrus honey. 
 A monkfish kebab was moist, peppery and handsomely charred, with the firm texture of lobster, but grouper en papillote -- steamed and served in cooking parchment -- was seriously overdone.
 My favorite desserts were the individual blueberry and peach pies, served in bake-sale foil pans, with a scoop of mouth-puckering house-made frozen yogurt. (You can also order the yogurt by itself, with various toppings.)
 Market's kitchen is so tiny it can hold just a single six-burner stove, with no room for a walk-in refrigerator. So Mr. Cederbaum says he is already looking for more spacious quarters downtown. More power to him. Skilled trainer that he is, he already has this demanding town eating out of his hand.

 THE BAR Bring your own wine.
 THE BILL Brunch entrees, $6 to $12. Dinner entrees, $13 to $19. American Express, MasterCard and Visa are accepted.

HEADLINE: Asian Universities Seek Students From Nearby Shores

BYLINE: By LIZ GOOCH

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR 

 BODY:
Attending a university overseas has long been an aspiration for many Chinese.
 ''My father said 'Why do you want to stay in China? Open your mind, look at the world,''' said Bao Qianqian, 25.
 The predictable choice might have been Australia or Britain, where her two sisters and thousands of her countrymen have studied. But Ms. Bao decided to embark on a journey that would keep her closer to her home in the eastern Chinese city of Ningbo, improve her English while still giving her the chance to converse with Chinese speakers, and enjoy substantially lower costs.
 She chose Malaysia, where she is currently a third-year business student at HELP University College, a private institution in Kuala Lumpur.
 With the appetite for higher education showing no signs of abating among the growing Asian middle class, more countries in Asia are positioning themselves to attract students like Ms. Bao. 
 Educators have been stepping up their efforts to exploit the global student market, whether by relaxing quotas on non-local students or encouraging overseas institutions to set up local campuses. The words ''education hub'' have infiltrated the mission statements of governments hoping to attract students to their shores.
 Typically foreign students who pay their own way not only provide a welcome boost for university coffers; they can also represent another stream of talented graduates who may join the local workforce and continue contributing to the economy of their host country after their college days are over.
 In 2007, more than 2.8 million students were enrolled in higher education institutions outside their country of origin, a 53 percent increase since 1999, according to a Unesco report released in July.
 While the United States, Britain and other Western countries continue to draw the most Asian students, the report also showed that Asian students were increasingly attending universities within their own regions.
 In East Asia and the Pacific, 42 percent of students who left home remained in their region in 2007 compared with 36 percent in 1999, according to the 2009 edition of Unesco's Global Education Digest. Unesco officials attributed this in part to the growing local availability of higher education.
 Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong all want to attract thousands more international students. Malaysia wants 100,000 foreign school and university students by next year, compared with 71,000 enrolled in the current academic year. Singapore hopes to attract 150,000 by 2015, up from 97,000 in 2008. Hong Kong has not set specific targets, but it recently doubled its quota for non-local students in its public universities.
 All three are attempting to capitalize on the fact that they can offer a university education in English, and often for considerably less than more expensive Western nations can, but each has its own selling points.
 Singapore, which has only three public universities, has made attracting the involvement of foreign institutions central to its ''Global Schoolhouse'' policy.
 Some schools, such as the University of Nevada and the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, have established branch campuses in Singapore, while others, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University, offer joint degree programs through local universities.
 The government, which hopes to increase education services' share of the gross domestic product to 5 percent in 2015 from 3 percent in 2007, boasts that this enables Asian students to get a degree from world-renowned universities without leaving Asia.
 Toh Wee Khiang, executive director for human capital at the Singapore Economic Development Board, said the government aims to attract, develop and retain talent.
 ''The war for talent is at the heart of economic growth, and education plays an important part in creating and sustaining talent in Singapore,'' he said, adding that another government agency was linking graduating students with Singaporean employers in key growth industries.
 Although Malaysia's schools are not well known internationally, the country has made progress toward meeting its goal of attracting 80,000 foreign university students and 20,000 secondary and primary school pupils by next year. Most of the 71,000 foreign students now enrolled are in private institutions, because of a 5 percent cap on foreign undergraduates in public universities.
 Since Malaysia liberalized its education sector in the 1990s, allowing the establishment of more private institutions, the number of providers has expanded to 20 public universities, 36 private universities and 5 foreign branch campuses.
 Morshidi Sirat, director of the National Higher Education Research Institute at the Universiti Sains Malaysia, said that now that more Malaysians of Chinese and Indian ethnicity can enroll in public universities, thanks to the removal in 2004 of a quota system that had favored ethnic Malays and indigenous groups, local enrollments have declined slightly at private institutions. Private schools have been trying to attract more foreigners to take their place, he said.
 Hong Kong might be better placed to cash in on international students, with three of its institutions ranked in the world's top 50 universities in the Times Higher Education rankings for 2008. Still, in the 2008-09 academic year, Hong Kong enrolled only about 8,400 non-local students, up from about 3,700 in 2003; more than 90 percent of those came from mainland China.
 The Hong Kong government imposes a quota on non-local students in public universities, which it increased last year to 20 percent from 10 percent. It has also relaxed employment restrictions and now allows students to remain in Hong Kong for 12 months after graduation, which the government hopes will help enhance the quality of the workforce.
 In a statement, the Hong Kong Education Bureau said Hong Kong needs to ''nurture and attract'' talent to sustain its economic and social development.
 Cheng Kai-ming, professor of education at the University of Hong Kong, said that Hong Kong suffers from severe space constraints, limiting the abilities of schools to build or expand campuses .
 ''There is always an argument within the government that land is precious and is one of the biggest sources of income for revenues,'' he said. ''Hence, unless higher education is given priority in allocating land, there is practically no space for developing any new institutions.''
 While Malaysia may have the edge among price-conscious students, Mr. Morshidi identified Thailand and Vietnam as two low-cost future contenders. Japan has also been admitting large numbers of Chinese and South Korean students as its domestic enrollments have declined.
 Despite the best efforts of universities around the region, their success may be influenced by factors beyond their immediate control. Education researchers say after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States and the subsequent tightening of its visa rules, some students began looking for alternatives. Malaysia, a Muslim-majority nation, was among the countries to benefit.
 Of the more established providers, Australia, which counts education as its third-largest export after iron ore and coal, may have more cause for concern than others. Its reputation as a safe destination offering high quality education took a battering this year after what many have dubbed ''racist attacks'' on Indian students in Melbourne and Sydney.
 But Chris Nyland, a professor of international business at Monash University in Melbourne, said an increase in the countries pushing for foreign students did not necessarily mean Australia's share of the market would decline. ''There are more suppliers coming into the industry,'' he said, ''but there are more and more people in China and India who can afford higher education.''

HEADLINE: The Rebirth, and the Beat, Goes On

BYLINE: By SARAH MASLIN NIR

 BODY:
At times, central Harlem seems to be an urban scene straight out of central casting: Step off the No. 2 or 3 train at the 116th Street stop one evening, and the air is filled with the snap-snap of double Dutch jump ropes hitting the pavement and girls tensely debating just whose turn it is. Old men hunker down over folding domino tables, and young men preen and spar with one another. But mixed with these Spike Lee-esque vignettes is another Harlem, chugging on in defiance of the recession. It includes slick boutiques and cafes, bars that attract Hollywood types and places for music that make you wonder when exactly Harlem's Renaissance happened -- then, or now? 
 4:30 P.M. At the start of World War I, said Jeffrey S. Gurock, the author of ''When Harlem Was Jewish, 1870-1930,'' central Harlem had a Jewish population of 125,000. That heritage lives on at Lee Lee's Baked Goods, 283 West 118th Street, (917) 493-6633, where Alvin Lee Smalls bakes the most buttery rugelach (70 cents each, but try and buy just one) in a small bakery appointed like a country kitchen. Mr. Smalls, who is black, is known for his old tongue-in-cheek window sign that once advertised the cinnamon and raisin pastry as ''rugelach by a brother.''
5 P.M. Sit at the communal butcher-block tables at Society Coffee, 2104 Frederick Douglass Boulevard, (212) 222-3323, and wash down the rugelach with the house Ethiopian Yirgacheffe coffee ($1.75 small, $2.25 large) or a single shot of espresso from Trieste, Italy ($1.50). With all the media types inking movie deals at the tables, you'll want to double-check that you're not on the set of ''Entourage.''
 6 P.M. Walk down 116th Street between Adam Clayton Powell Jr. and Malcolm X Boulevards, and you'll catch strains of French and blasts of Malian pop music as you pass African shops selling shea butter, palm oil, bright fabrics and dazzling jewelry. The center of this area, Little Africa, is the Malcolm Shabazz Harlem Market, 52 West 116th Street, (212) 987-8131, where West African vendors sell native handicrafts of wood, shell and bone, from a few dollars for beaded earrings to a few hundred for a goatskin-covered djembe drum). English is little heard, and women wrapped in Technicolor fabrics plait microbraids into customers' hair as their colleagues beckon passers-by. If you demur, be warned: These hairdressers are not turned down easily.
 7 P.M. Mojo, 185 St. Nicholas Avenue, (212) 280-1924, is an opulent restaurant in a purple hue that opened last spring. The husband-and-wife owners, Mounir Jabrane and Helena Greene, attend to customers who have included Danny Glover and Gov. David A. Paterson. Try the Sexy Grits, grits dressed as polenta with truffle oil and wild mushrooms ($9), perhaps washed down with one of the $11 cocktails named for Harlem locales.
 9 P.M. Minton's Playhouse was the birthplace of bebop, the fast-tempo jazz pioneered by greats like Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis, and its latest incarnation is called Uptown Lounge at Minton's Playhouse, 206 West 118th Street, (212) 864-8346. Opened in 1938, it was shuttered in 1974 and then, three years ago, it was reopened with an Art Deco aesthetic and a nightly jazz lineup. There's a two-drink minimum and a $5 cover charge on Fridays, $10 on Saturdays. Don't fear the occasional gaggle of tourists deposited by tour buses; the club still offers world-class jazz (a video is online at nytimes.com/nyregion).
 10 P.M Head back east on 118th Street, and along the way say hello to some neighborhood residents, like the Carr family. The Carrs' building, between Lenox Avenue and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, has been in the family for more than 60 years, said Janella Carr, 22, adding that some Carr or other has sat on its stoop just about every warm evening over those years. If you're feeling spry, ask the youngest Carr for a turn at double Dutch.

HEADLINE: A Life on the Decline And Then the 'Why?'

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP. 
E-mail: Generationb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IN the late 1970s, not long after coming out to his parents, Steven Schnipper left his hometown, Summit, N.J., for Manhattan and did not look back. By then he'd earned a master's in graphic design from Yale and was excited to live in a city that so pleased his aesthetic sense.
 He loved museums, architecture, reading, first edition books, the theater, seeing four movies in one day with his friend Annette Williams; the clothes at Barneys, Bergdorf and Armani; cosmetics counters, face creams, spas, manicures and pedicures; travel; five-star hotels; Swiss Style design; Helvetica typeface; the simple beauty of a straight, clean line.
 His brother Scott, five years younger, would visit and wonder how the Schnippers had produced such an aesthete. 
 ''He came from a family of dress salesmen, shoe salesmen, shopkeepers, schleppers, furriers and restaurant owners,'' Scott Schnipper said. ''His art and expression and culture and sophistication and taste stood out.''
 Steven Schnipper was an award-winning designer, who kept getting better jobs. At Estee Lauder, he worked his way up to a position as an executive director of design. 
 For cosmetics lines like Prescriptives and La Mer, he created the packaging, brochures, advertising, in-store displays and direct mailings that looked like fine art.
 As his first lover and lifelong best friend, Wesley Mancini, a fabric designer, said, ''His 40s were definitely the best decade of his life.'' He was making a (low) six-figure salary at Lauder, and in 2001, moved from an Upper East Side studio to a one-bedroom in the heart of Chelsea's gay community. He supported the Gay Men's Health Crisis, marched yearly in the AIDS walks and volunteered to deliver food to a senior center in the West Village.
 But as Mr. Mancini said at the memorial service, ''in his 50's his world began to go amuck.'' In 2003, during a round of downsizing, he was let go after 20 years at Estee Lauder. He quickly found work as a creative director at Revlon, but after three years lost his job there, too, when the company cut its work force 8 percent. He was hired by Coty, but let go in 2007, and never worked steadily again.
 As the contraction of the cosmetics industry segued into the Great Recession, he grew desperate. This man who'd studied design under the legendary Paul Rand at Yale and won awards from AIGA (formerly the American Institute of Graphic Arts) was turned down for jobs as a salesclerk at Design Within Reach and a teller at Citigroup and TD Bank.
 To make his condo payments, he began withdrawing $25,000 every three months from his 401(k). ''What will I do if I can't find a job?'' he'd ask his brother, sobbing.
 On March 19, six months after the economic collapse and a week and a half after the Dow fell below 6,600 -- the last night of the gloomiest winter in memory -- Steven Schnipper, 56, was found dead in his apartment. The medical examiner ruled suicide from an overdose of antidepressants. The downstairs neighbors told police they thought they heard a thump on the floor at 2 or 3 a.m. the night before. There was no note, just a list of his relatives left on the living room table.
 ''Until now,'' said his brother, ''Steven never caused anyone any trouble.''
 People lose jobs all the time and don't kill themselves. Why Steven Schnipper? Scott, who's now 51 and an editor at Bloomberg News, said he knew that Steven was depressed and was seeing a therapist, but didn't understand he suffered major depression. ''I think it was masked by his work and income and the prestige of the jobs at the cosmetics companies. This stripped away his protective layer. Steven couldn't think straight.''
 Statistically, he was vulnerable. Boomers 45 to 64 have the highest suicide rate of all age groups, according to 2006 figures, the latest available, from the National Center for Health Statistics. Dr. Myrna Weissman, a Columbia psychiatry professor and member of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, said that starting about 20 years ago researchers noticed a higher rate of depression in boomers than the previous generation at that age. They attributed the increase to a number of stresses: more divorces, more-transient lifestyles, more drug use. ''We expected to see this generation's suicide rate increase, since people are more likely to kill themselves as they age,'' Dr. Weissman said.
 The economy is an A-1 stressor. According to the federal Suicide Prevention Resource Center Web site, ''widespread increases in unemployment'' are ''strongly linked with increases in suicide rates.'' Men are most affected. While women attempt suicide three times as often as men, men ''succeed'' four times more often. In 2006, 33,308 Americans committed suicide, 26,308 of them men.
 Scott Schnipper, who lives in Brooklyn, last saw his brother in February. He suggested an outing to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and brought along his son Adam, 4, to cheer up Uncle Steven. A mistake. ''I was pulled between trying to care for Steven and trying to shield Adam from his distraught uncle,'' Scott said. He tried to tell his brother he had options. He could sell the condo at a profit, move to a less-expensive area. Several friends and family members -- Mr. Mancini (Charlotte, N.C.); a cousin, Jody Doman on the Upper East Side; Steven's twin, Marc, in Madison, Wis.; their father in Glendale, Calif. -- had offered spare rooms and even a garage apartment.
 Two friends gave him part-time bookkeeping work when they had it; one put Steven on his employee health insurance.
 Through the years he had partners, and though that was not so recently, he was hardly alone. ''A lot of people cared about Steven,'' Scott said. He was famous for never forgetting to send a birthday card. Loving beautiful things, he made elaborate gift lists that he'd review endlessly with his friend Ms. Williams.
 In those final weeks, when Scott was trying to nudge his brother toward selling the condo, he suggested getting an estimate for having the apartment repainted. ''I didn't want to overwhelm him with tasks,'' said Scott, ''so I said, 'Let's just see if you can get that lined up by April.' He said, 'O.K.' ''
 Scott believes that living in the heart of Manhattan's gay community had become so central to Steven, leaving was unacceptable.
 Their last conversation, he'd called Steven by cellphone while walking home from the subway after work. ''All I could get out of him was, 'Yes. No. O.K.' ''
 Steven had a strong sense of privacy, so it was hard to know how much to intrude.
 At the memorial service in May, attended by 100 friends and family, people blamed themselves for not intruding more.
 Scott has spent the past months giving away his brother's possessions to friends, family and the Housing Works thrift shop. He has donated Steven's design work to professors at Parsons and Pratt. After a recent visit to clear out a few last items before the condo sale goes through, he rode the subway home to Brooklyn. At Cobble Hill Park, his wife, Lara, was waiting for him on a bench holding their two-month-old, Samuel. When Adam spotted his dad, the 4-year-old raced over, jumped up, kissed him hard on the lips, then wiggled away. ''Look what I can do, Dad,'' he yelled, running off.
 For a while they worried how to explain the suicide to Adam, but then they decided the easiest way was to tell him the truth: Uncle Steven died of a disease called depression.

HEADLINE: Plugged-In Age Feeds a Hunger For Electricity

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD and KATE GALBRAITH

 BODY:
With two laptop-loving children and a Jack Russell terrier hemmed in by an electric fence, Peter Troast figured his household used a lot of power. Just how much did not really hit him until the night the family turned off the overhead lights at their home in Maine and began hunting gadgets that glowed in the dark.
 ''It was amazing to see all these lights blinking,'' Mr. Troast said.
 As goes the Troast household, so goes the planet. 
 Electricity use from power-hungry gadgets is rising fast all over the world. The fancy new flat-panel televisions everyone has been buying in recent years have turned out to be bigger power hogs than some refrigerators. 
 The proliferation of personal computers, iPods, cellphones, game consoles and all the rest amounts to the fastest-growing source of power demand in the world. Americans now have about 25 consumer electronic products in every household, compared with just three in 1980.
 Worldwide, consumer electronics now represent 15 percent of household power demand, and that is expected to triple over the next two decades, according to the International Energy Agency, making it more difficult to tackle the greenhouse gas emissions responsible for global warming.
 To satisfy the demand from gadgets will require building the equivalent of 560 coal-fired power plants, or 230 nuclear plants, according to the agency.
 Most energy experts see only one solution: mandatory efficiency rules specifying how much power devices may use.
 Appliances like refrigerators are covered by such rules in the United States. But efforts to cover consumer electronics like televisions and game consoles have been repeatedly derailed by manufacturers worried about the higher cost of meeting the standards. That has become a problem as the spread of such gadgets counters efficiency gains made in recent years in appliances.
 In 1990, refrigerator efficiency standards went into effect in the United States. Today, new refrigerators are fancier than ever, but their power consumption has been slashed by about 45 percent since the standards took effect. Likewise, thanks in part to standards, the average power consumption of a new washer is nearly 70 percent lower than a new unit in 1990.
 ''Standards are one of the few ways to cheaply go after big chunks of energy savings,'' said Chris Calwell, a founder and senior researcher at Ecos, a consulting firm that specializes in energy efficiency.
 Part of the problem is that many modern gadgets cannot entirely be turned off; even when not in use, they draw electricity while they await a signal from a remote control or wait to record a television program.
 ''We have entered this new era where essentially everything is on all the time,'' said Alan Meier, a senior scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and a leading expert on energy efficiency.
 People can, of course, reduce this waste -- but to do so takes a single-minded person. 
 Mr. Troast, of South Freeport, Me., is just the kind of motivated homeowner willing to tackle such a project. His day job is selling energy efficiency equipment through an online business. He was not put off by the idea of hunting behind cabinets to locate every power supply and gadget, like those cable boxes, Web routers or computers that glowed in the dark.
 The Troasts cut their monthly energy use by around 16 percent, partly by plugging their computers and entertainment devices into smart power strips. The strips turn off when the electronics are not in use, cutting power consumption to zero. 
 While Mr. Troast's experience demonstrates that consumers can limit the power wasted by inactive devices, another problem is not as easily solved: many products now require large amounts of power to run.
 The biggest offender is the flat-screen television. As liquid crystal displays and plasma technologies replace the old cathode ray tubes, and as screen sizes increase, the new televisions need more power than older models do. And with all those gorgeous new televisions in their living rooms, Americans are spending more time than ever watching TV, averaging five hours a day.
 The result is a surge in electricity use by TVs, which can draw more power in a year than some refrigerators now on the market. 
 Energy experts say that manufacturers have paid too little attention to the power consumption of televisions, in part because of the absence of federal regulation.
 Another power drain is the video game console, which is found in 40 percent of American households. Energy experts -- and many frustrated parents -- say that since saving games is difficult, children often keep the consoles switched on so they can pick up where they left off.
 Noah Horowitz, at the Natural Resources Defense Council, calculated that the nation's gaming consoles, like the Xbox 360 from Microsoft and the Sony PlayStation 3, now use about the same amount of electricity each year as San Diego, the ninth-largest city in country. 
 Mandatory efficiency standards for electronic devices would force manufacturers to redesign their products, or spend money adding components that better control power use. 
 Many manufacturers fight such mandates because they would increase costs, and they also claim the mandates would stifle innovation in a fast-changing industry. 
 The government has never aggressively tackled the television issue because of opposition from the consumer electronics lobby in Washington, experts say. In 1987, before televisions had swelled into such power hogs, Congress gave the Energy Department -- which generally carries out the standards -- the option of setting efficiency rules for TVs. 
 But industry opposition derailed an effort in the 1990s to use that authority, according to Steve Nadel of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. A more recent attempt to require home electronics to use no more than one watt of power in standby mode met the same fate. The federal government has moved forward on only two standards for electronics, covering battery chargers and external power supplies.
 In the absence of federal action, a few states have moved on their own. The California Energy Commission just proposed new standards for televisions that would cut their power consumption in half by 2013. But that effort has set off a storm of protest from manufacturers and their trade group, the Consumer Electronics Association. (It is still expected to pass, in November.)
 A spokesman for the industry said that government regulations could not keep up with the pace of technological change.
 ''Mandates ignore the fundamental nature of the industry that innovates due to consumer demand and technological developments, not regulations,'' said Douglas Johnson, the senior director of technology policy at the association. 
 Mr. Johnson said that California's limits on manufacturers, which he called arbitrary, might delay or even prohibit some features of new devices. Instead, he praised the government's voluntary Energy Star program, which he says encourages efficiency without sacrificing innovation. 
 ''Mandatory limits, such as we see in California, threaten to raise prices for consumers and reduce consumer choice,'' he said. 
 Estimates vary regarding how much a mandatory efficiency program for gadgets would cost consumers. For some changes, like making sure devices draw minimal power in standby mode, experts say the cost may be only a few extra cents. At the other extreme, the most energy-efficient of today's televisions can cost $100 more than the least energy-efficient. (That expense would be partly offset over time, of course, by lower power needs.)
 Some types of home electronics are rated under Energy Star, a program that classifies products in more than 60 categories according to their energy consumption. But that program, while a boon to conscientious consumers who buy only the most efficient products, does not prevent the sale of wasteful devices and has not succeeded in driving them off the market.
 The lack of regulation of gadgets is a notable contrast to the situation with appliances.
 Congress adopted the nation's first electrical efficiency standards in the 1980s, focusing initially on kitchen and other large appliances. That effort made some steep gains, particularly for refrigerators, which were once among the biggest power hogs in a typical home.
 The federal effort lagged during the administration of George W. Bush, and the Energy Department missed a string of deadlines set by Congress. But the Obama administration has vowed to make maximum use of existing law, speeding up the adoption of 26 standards on a host of products that include microwave ovens and clothes dryers. Tougher lighting standards, embraced by both the Bush and Obama administrations, are due to take effect in coming years.
 But Congress has never granted any administration the authority to set standards for power-hogging electronic gadgets like game consoles and set-top boxes. Even now, when both the administration and Congress are focused on the nation's energy problems, no legislation is moving forward to tackle the issue. 
 Experts like Dan W. Reicher, who directs Google's energy efforts, argue that the United States must do better, setting an example for the rest of the world.
 ''If we can't improve the efficiency of simple appliances and get them into greater use,'' Mr. Reicher said, ''it's hard to believe that we'll succeed with difficult things like cleaning up coal-fired power plants.''

HEADLINE: Poof! How Home Loans Transform

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
IT could be said -- with a bit of imagination -- that mortgage-backed securities, a prime trigger of last year's financial meltdown, are to this age what strains of the bubonic plague or thermonuclear explosions were to others: something widely feared, if not entirely understood. Who, beyond Wall Street, even knows what one looks like? Here is one, issued by Bank of America in 2006, at the height of the mortgage-backed security craze.
 For decades, a homebuyer seeking a mortgage would, generally, get a loan from a local bank, to which the buyer would repay the money with interest. Securitization means lenders sell such loans to investors, to shift risk away from themselves and to raise more money to make more loans. 
 To create this mortgage-backed security, the lender, Bank of America, transferred $478,411,100 worth of mortgages to the Banc of America Funding 2006-B Trust, a shell company, or special purpose vehicle, created to insulate the bank from default. Banc of America 2006-B Trust then sold the securitized mortgages to investors, like mutual funds, with the help of a broker, the Bank of America Securities LLC. Yet another corporate cousin, the Bank of America, National Association, is the servicer of this security, meaning it received monthly mortgage payments from real people in real houses and passed the money on to investors.
 THE FIRST MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITY was created by the Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae, in February 1970. Demand rose steadily over the next three decades, reaching a high in 2003, when $3 trillion worth of mortgage-backed securities were issued in a single year. Of the $12 trillion in mortgages outstanding in the United States, slightly more than half have been turned into securities, said Tom Deutsch, deputy executive director of the American Securitization Forum. With the credit crisis, the market in bank-issued, or ''private label,'' mortgage-backed securities -- as opposed to those backed by government entities like Ginnie Mae -- has decreased to almost nothing. ''It's a staggering magnitude of difference from 2006 to 2009,'' Mr. Deutsch said.
 UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO, prospectuses for most mortgage-backed securities -- the one pictured runs to 272 pages -- were printed as bound books, costing thousands of dollars, and hours. But it became easier to issue electronic PDF versions under a 2005 overhaul of the Securities Act of 1933. Prospectuses used to be ''these big old clumsy paper documents,'' Mr. Deutsch recalled. ''Junior associates or paralegals would literally have to go down to the printer and make sure every number was correct.''
 THE STANDARD MINIMUM to invest in a mortgage-backed security is $25,000. Generally speaking, 25 to 50 separate investors might buy in, each with varying tastes for risk. A state pension fund, for example, is most likely not as loose with its money as, say, a hedge fund. So mortgage-backed securities are cut into pieces, known as tranches, each carrying a different level of risk and reward. This security has been cut into six riskier pieces called subordinate certificates and 14 less-risky pieces called senior certificates. The risk is determined by factors like the borrowers' income and net assets and the amount of equity they keep in their homes -- essentially, how likely they are to default on their mortgages.
 WHEN THE SYSTEM IS FUNCTIONING correctly, banks benefit from mortgage-backed securities by transforming relatively illiquid assets -- loans to homebuyers -- into products to be traded on the capital markets. These securities allow the banks to make profits that can then be reinvested into more loans. For homeowners, these profits and reinvestments can result in decreased interest rates. But when homeowners default, what would have been a private problem ripples through the economy because of the layers of investment based on their mortgage payments.

HEADLINE: The Future of Global Finance

BYLINE: By LIAQUAT AHAMED. 
Liaquat Ahamed is the author of ''Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World,'' a book about the causes of the Great Depression.nternational finance has always been one of the more elusive areas of economics, in part because the channels through which capital moves around the world are so tortuous that the system looks as if it had been thought up by Rube Goldberg. It's not surprising, therefore, that among all the various forces and factors to be blamed for the current global economic crisis -- deregulation, Alan Greenspan, credit-default swaps, the power of the financial lobby, excessive leverage, securitization, Wall Street greed -- the most difficult to get one's head around is the international monetary system.

 BODY:
International finance has always been one of the more elusive areas of economics, in part because the channels through which capital moves around the world are so tortuous that the system looks as if it had been thought up by Rube Goldberg. It's not surprising, therefore, that among all the various forces and factors to be blamed for the current global economic crisis -- deregulation, Alan Greenspan, credit-default swaps, the power of the financial lobby, excessive leverage, securitization, Wall Street greed -- the most difficult to get one's head around is the international monetary system. 
 It has long been recognized that the global financial structure -- built as it is around the dollar as the world's reserve currency -- has a fundamental design flaw that makes it inherently unstable. The problem was first identified back in the early 1960s by the Belgian-American economist Robert Triffin, in ''Gold and the Dollar Crisis.'' Writing about Europe's accumulation of dollars, he argued that the system carried the seeds of its own destruction. Foreigners could acquire dollars only if the United States ran current account deficits -- that is, spent more than it earned. But lending money to someone who lives beyond his means has obvious dangers, and the same is true of countries. Thus, the American deficits necessary to supply dollars to the world for international transactions simultaneously undermined confidence in the currency. It was only a matter of time, Triffin predicted, before the system would be hit by a crisis -- which it duly was in the early 1970s.
 At the beginning of the current decade a group of commentators, the most articulate being the Financial Times columnist Martin Wolf, updated Triffin's critique and applied it to current arrangements. Whereas Triffin had been primarily concerned about the European accumulation of dollars, the spotlight was now on Asia. In the wake of the 1997 financial crisis there, countries in East Asia set out to build up war chests of dollars as insurance against domestic banking runs or downturns in the global economy. At about the same time, China embarked on a program of export-led growth, engineered by keeping its currency artificially low.
 Interpretations of what happened next differ. Some argue that to absorb these goods from abroad while avoiding unemployment at home, the United States very consciously stimulated consumer demand. The country, in effect, was forced to live beyond its means. Others believe that the Fed misread the fall in prices as a symptom of inadequate demand rather than for what it was -- an astounding, once-in-a-generation expansion in the supply of low-cost goods -- and kept interest rates low for an unusually long time, which provoked the real estate bubble.
 In either case, the result was an enormous accumulation of dollars in the hands of Asian central banks. Those dollars, when invested in the American bond market, drove long-term interest rates even further down and made credit in the United States even more artificially cheap. 
 The build-up of dollars abroad was also the catalyst for a remarkable transformation in the flow of money around the world. The United States found itself literally operating as a gigantic bank, taking short-term liquid deposits from countries with surpluses and investing the money in long-term, risky assets at home and abroad. The numbers involved were staggering. In 1996, the United States had international assets and liabilities of around $5 trillion. By 2007 the figure was more than $20 trillion. Like any bank, it was vulnerable to a run. The main fear was that the United States at some point would be faced with a modern-day replay of Triffin's dilemma and would have to deal with the consequences of a collapse in confidence in the dollar. 
 Instead, what led to the current mess was a somewhat different strain of the same disease. As Wolf traces out so well in his 2008 book ''Fixing Global Finance,'' the United States was able to absorb all the goods coming out of Asia only by letting its consumers go progressively deeper into debt -- a process that had its own limits. Moreover, the flood of money simply overwhelmed the capacity of financial institutions to handle it. A lot, for example, ended up in the most unregulated segments of the global banking system, like off-shore deposits on the books of non-American banks. These banks, now awash with cash and desperate for places to put the money, became easy marks for American investment banks seeking to peddle securitized mortgages. When a large percentage of these loans went bad, instead of a dollar panic we had a global banking crisis.
 Past economic cataclysms have led to dramatic changes in international financial arrangements. The Great Depression knocked the world off the gold standard. The economic turmoil of the late 1960s and early '70s led to the collapse of Bretton Woods. Will the current crisis bring similar changes? 
 So far we have avoided a repeat of the Great Depression. Countries have collectively pursued the right macroeconomic policies -- protecting and recapitalizing their banking systems, cutting interest rates to the bone and letting budget deficits expand. There are no signs as yet of the sort of protectionism that gave us the 1930 Smoot-Hawley tariff. The biggest worry, however, is that in the recent economic downturn the two groups of countries worst hit were those most exposed to the forces of globalization -- the export-driven economies of Asia and countries, notably those of Eastern Europe, most heavily dependent on foreign capital.
 One scenario has the world adjusting smoothly to the new realities. American consumers, tapped out by debt, tighten their belts. The Asian economies reconsider the wisdom of relying so heavily on exports to drive their growth and focus more on domestic consumption. And with less money to recycle, international banks, which had done such a poor job, are cut down to size. 
 But two dangers could make the current bad situation worse. One is that China finds it too difficult or politically costly to restructure its economy and, despite the changes in the global market, keeps its foot on the export accelerator. Since the American consumer cannot afford to keep buying, this would set off a cycle of trade wars among Asian countries competing for ever smaller markets.
 The second is yet another version of Triffin's dilemma: if even a small fraction of foreign holders of dollars were to be spooked by our budgetary problems, we could have a spike in the cost of capital just when the economy is trying to recover. The risk of such a situation is clearly on the minds of Chinese policy makers. Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People's Bank of China, explicitly referred to Triffin's dilemma in a speech this March on the need for reform of the international monetary system.
 Like our current crisis, the Great Depression was brought about by a malfunction of the international financial system. The nations of the world lost confidence in the system's ability to reconcile their conflicting interests and ambitions. The result, as Harold James documents in ''The End of Globalization: Lessons From the Great Depression,'' was a disastrous backlash against globalization. The economies of the world hunkered down behind high tariff barriers, import controls and restrictions on capital flows. 
 Even a liberal like John Maynard Keynes, once a committed proponent of free trade, lost faith in open markets. In 1933, in the depths of the Depression, he wrote, ''I sympathize, therefore, with those who would minimize, rather than with those who would maximize, economic entanglement among nations. Ideas, knowledge, science, hospitality, travel -- these are the things which should of their nature be international. But let goods be homespun whenever it is reasonably and conveniently possible, and, above all, let finance be primarily national.'' 
 Until we can reconcile the export ambitions of the Asian countries, particularly China, with the import capabilities of the rest of the world, and make the volume and value of reserves less dependent on the vagaries of macroeconomic policy in one country, the risk of a similar loss of faith in today's international financial system remains.
 This is the sixth in a series of essays exploring dominant themes and currents of thought in particular areas of American life. The next essay in the series, which will continue in this space over the coming months, is scheduled to appear Oct. 18. An archive can be found at nytimes.com/crossroads.

HEADLINE: 80 Years of Lessons, From Bach to Rock

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON

DATELINE: White Plains 

 BODY:
 THE sounds of a rock band blasted through a downstairs studio on Central Avenue here, while upstairs teenagers rehearsed for a production of ''Guys and Dolls.'' These days, you are as likely to hear jazz or a Broadway tune as an aria at the Music Conservatory of Westchester, but that does not mean the school has forgotten its Bach, Mozart and Beethoven.
 ''Classical music will always be one of our main areas of focus,'' said Carol Shiffman, the conservatory's new executive director, who is grounded in the classical arts. ''The heart of what we do here is private instruction one to three times a week. A knowledge of music theory will help in any field.'' 
 Ms. Shiffman said she was chosen from a pool of 80 applicants to succeed Aaron Flagg, who left in June after five years at the helm to become dean of the Hartt School at the University of Hartford. She arrived at an encouraging time for the conservatory, a nonprofit institution founded in 1929 by a group of musicians including the cellist Pablo Casals.
 Fall enrollment is holding steady at 700 students despite the weak economy, and summer enrollment rose this year. The school's $3 million budget has remained level for three years, and the conservatory provided $110,000 in scholarships to more than 115 students this year, made possible in large part by contributions from the board of directors. 
 To mark its 80th anniversary, the conservatory is planning a series of events, beginning at 1 p.m. on Oct. 3 with a free public celebration featuring proclamations, faculty and student performances and a birthday cake. Other events for the year range from children's concerts to a performance by one of the conservatory's former students, the pianist Garrick Ohlsson, on May 8. 
 In an interview in her office on her third full day in the job, Ms. Shiffman said she loved ''being on the ground'' where people connect with art. A trim and energetic former dancer who founded her own troupe before becoming an arts administrator, she has worked as a senior grants officer for the California Arts Council, as the dean of music at Cornish College of the Arts near Seattle and as the dean of the Conservatory of Dance at Purchase College in Purchase. The move to Purchase in 2007 brought her back to her native New York -- her mother ran a youth arts center in Queens -- and she lives in Rye.
 ''Her background was impeccable,'' said Christine Meyer, the conservatory's development director. ''She has so many connections to different facets of the arts, and we're a building that wants to be an arts center in White Plains.''
 The 36,000-square-foot school, which features 43 soundproof teaching studios and classrooms and a jewel-like recital hall, is already used for weekly rehearsals by groups like the Westchester Choral Society and the Hudson Valley Jazz Band. The Steffi Nossen School of Dance is in the building, as is the conservatory's own Music Therapy Institute. The school also holds programs involving a few thousand children and adults throughout the county. 
 The Renata Scotto Opera Academy, which brought renown to the conservatory a few years ago, is defunct, but a two-week intensive vocal program is still held each summer. Vocal classes -- like acting for singers and sight-singing, along with instrumental classes for young children -- are among the most popular courses this fall, Ms. Shiffman said. She added that the school hopes to make Latin jazz and other ''more ethnically specific music'' available. 
 The school's philosophy is rooted in a ''set-your-own-goals'' approach, rather than a ''you-must-practice'' one, she said. ''There are ways of inspiring beyond fear, that focus on the joy of playing.''
 The Music Conservatory of Westchester's 80th anniversary celebration will begin at 1 p.m. on Oct. 3 at the conservatory, 216 Central Avenue, White Plains. Admission is free. Information: musicconservatory.org or (914) 761-3900.

HEADLINE: Casino America In Play

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN. 
Peter S. Goodman, who writes about the economy for The Times, is the author of the new book, ''Past Due: The End of Easy Money and the Renewal of the American Economy.'' (Times Books).

 BODY:
Throughout the history of American commercial life, one cultural trait has tended to dominate: Americans are optimists, a people prone to seeing the glass as not merely half-full but rapidly expanding, and bearing liquid that might yet be turned into gold.
 This exuberant optimism has proven beneficial, emboldening risk-taking that has achieved innovation and wealth. It has prompted entrepreneurs to invest borrowed money in untested ideas that sometimes yield breakthroughs. It has encouraged ordinary people to accept debt in the name of accelerated gain -- more comfortable homes, higher education, late-model cars. 
 Yet in recent times this eagerness to augment the present by borrowing against a seemingly lucrative future has reached dangerous levels. Excessive optimism and its close relation -- a reckless disregard of risk -- are widely blamed for helping carry the United States into the worst financial panic since the Great Depression. Millions bought homes they could not afford, convinced that something good would happen before the bill came due. Financial institutions bet trillions in borrowed funds while leaving little in reserve, soothed by the collective assumption that real estate prices could never fall. 
 Last week, as President Obama stood near the New York Stock exchange to champion new regulations for the financial system, admonishing bankers not to ''go back to the days of reckless behavior,'' he effectively challenged a deep-seated notion of the American identity: that Americans are resilient enough to operate free of bureaucratic intrusion and niggling rules, unlike Europeans and their supposed Nanny State.
 ''It goes all the way back to George Washington,'' said Robert Shiller, the Yale economist who warned of the Internet and real estate bubbles, and whose book, ''Irrational Exuberance,'' remains a seminal text on Americans' tendency to believe in good times. ''Washington said regulation should be done with a light hand. The word capitalism hadn't been invented yet, but freedom had. Washington said businesses should be free. There's this hatred of kings that we really have in our blood.''
 In a country inclined to celebrate its frontier roots and rugged individualism, how much shock is required before Americans opt to increase the powers of the sheriff? Fear does have a way of inducing change. Eight years ago, when terrorists slammed jets into the World Trade Center, the trauma was so powerful that it appeared to alter cultural norms. Without the spectacle of ordinary people plunging to their deaths, it seems difficult to imagine the United States wiretapping citizens without warrants and waterboarding people in the interest of national security. 
 In the first months of the contemporary financial disaster -- as fear descended on financial markets and economists worried about a repeat of the Depression -- some assumed that the United States was suffering the financial equivalent of 9/11. Life savings were sliced in half, millions of workers lost their jobs, and homeowners confronted foreclosure. Years of anticipating better days gave way to economic anxiety. 
 In some quarters, the sense took hold that household wealth had been looted by Wall Street while the regulators sat mute. Financial institutions had been allowed to operate a casino, using mortgage-backed securities and derivatives as chips, collecting the profits while sticking the taxpayer with the eventual losses. 
 Surely, it seemed, pain and populist anger had altered the balance between trust in the market and the desirability of oversight. Even Alan Greenspan, the long-time Federal Reserve chairman and apostle for laissez-faire, confessed that his faith had been shaken; at one point he suggested that the government might need to nationalize major banks.
 History, too, seemed to indicate that change was on the way. After the Panic of 1873 -- which saw a run of bank failures, the shutdown of the New York Stock Exchange and soaring unemployment -- labor unrest lasted for decades. 
 Three decades later, the Panic of 1907 saw prominent American lenders collapse, leading eventually to the creation of the Federal Reserve, a central bank to watch over all others.
 ''Traditionally, the idea of a central bank had been repulsive,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a Harvard economist and co-author of an international survey of financial crises, ''This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly.''
 The Great Depression so tormented Americans that it delivered the New Deal, a muscular collection of government programs whose hallmarks -- unemployment insurance and Social Security -- remain the primary components of the modern-day social safety net. The banking crises of the 1930s prompted the passage of the Glass-Steagall Act, which divided investment banks from deposit-taking banks to prevent rampant speculation with ordinary people's savings, while instituting government guarantees on deposits. (Many economists believe the final repeal of Glass-Steagall in 1999 played a key role in the reckless investment that triggered the latest crisis.)
 Memories of trauma can last a long time. Nearly a century has passed since Germany suffered the hyperinflation that helped set the stage for Hitler; yet even today, fear of rising prices remains the primary force in contemporary German policy. Earlier this year, governments from Washington to Beijing unleashed government spending to spur economic activity. Not Germany, ever vigilant against triggering an upward spiral of prices.
 The shock that accompanied the end of the American real estate boom once seemed a sentinel event that would bring tighter government scrutiny of the financial realm. Yet as fear of catastrophe fades, the question is how quickly the momentum in Washington for tighter financial rules is diminishing and whether unemployed workers and strapped homeowners will feed a groundswell for change strong enough to offset government turf wars and the influence of financial industry lobbyists. 
 In Washington, on Wall Street and on Main Street, many are aware that the era of lightly supervised markets was fabulously lucrative for those positioned to capture a piece. Financial services and real estate -- nurtured by easy money -- swelled into major sources of employment, while boosting stock portfolios for huge institutions and ordinary people alike. New York cemented itself as the global financial capital.
 Over the last quarter-century, moreover, the traditional faith in unfettered markets deepened, and became entwined with the belief in the abundance of American opportunity, reinforcing a justification for laissez-faire: In a land that subscribes to the Horatio Alger story -- in which anyone can supposedly make it -- the market can be trusted to make the rules. For Milton Friedman, the most influential economic thinker of the last half-century, political and economic freedom were synonymous.
 ''There are a lot of complex emotions at work,'' Mr. Rogoff said. ''Certainly, we're terrified of the crisis. On the other hand, the United States has been a big winner in the global financial arena, and why change the rules when you're winning?''
 Such sentiments carried the day a decade ago, after the near-collapse of the giant hedge fund Long Term Capital Management, which had attracted billions of dollars with the story that its sophisticated computer models had tamed risk. Its failure held the potentialto drag down many of its trading partners. 
 Then, as now, some warned that the near-disaster was a harbinger of worse ahead, if reforms were not put in place that limited how much borrowed money could be employed. But Mr. Greenspan, joined by the Clinton administration Treasury Secretaries Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers, scotched proposals for new rules, arguing that they would stifle American strength.
 Even the mere consideration of regulations for derivatives ran the risk of prompting investors to take their money overseas ''because of a perception that the American regulatory environment is inhospitable,'' warned Mr. Summers, who is now a leading economic adviser to President Obama. 
 Mr. Greenspan delivered the overarching argument for an economy built on optimism, not worry. 
 ''You can have huge amounts of regulation and I will guarantee nothing will go wrong,'' Mr. Greenspan told Congress, ''but nothing will go right either.''
 Mr. Summers, for his part, now likens the impact of the recent crisis to that of the Cuban missile crisis in generating demands for arms control. ''The events of the past two years have raised grave concerns about the soundness of public policy as it regards the financial system,'' he said on Friday, in a speech at Georgetown University McDonough School of Business. ''It is critical to move rapidly while the events of the last two years are clearly in mind.''
 So the question now is how many people have similarly changed their sense of what the American economy needs. Mostly, it is a matter of whether the country is still feeling lucky; whether the recent crisis will come to feel like an unavoidable toll on the highway to fortune, or whether something deeper has shifted in the American psyche, leaving us shaken in a lasting way.

DELIVER US FROM EVIL
 The Slavery Question in the Old South
 By Lacy K. Ford
 673 pp. Oxford University Press. $34.95
 One of the great lessons of 20th-century history is that international conflicts can best be understood as a product of politics within nation-states or communities. Viewed from the end of the cold war, the long struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union was shaped as much by divisions within the Communist world -- Russia and China, most prominently -- as by the confrontation with the United States, and vice versa. Recent events reveal the same principle at work in the hostilities between Iran and the United States, where the internal politics of each nation -- divisions between so-called hard-liners and moderates -- have shaped and reshaped the way the two countries address each other. 
 That lesson seems to be useful as well in understanding the conflict between free and slave states that eventually exploded into the American Civil War. For Lacy K. Ford, the division between the states of the upper South (Virginia along with the border slave states) and those of the lower South (South Carolina and the cotton-producing states to its south and west) best explains how white Southerners ''understood their position with regard to slavery, and how they saw themselves as citizens of the United States right down to secession and Civil War.''
 Ford, a professor of history at the University of South Carolina, is hardly the first to emphasize this internal division, but most historians have focused on the years immediately prior to the Civil War, the secession crisis and the war itself. In ''Deliver Us From Evil,'' however, Ford traces that division back to the period between the founding of the Republic in 1789 and the beginning of the abolitionist assault on slavery in the 1830s. In extraordinarily close detail, he demonstrates how white slave-owning Southerners in the two regions followed sharply different trajectories in addressing the slavery question, and he argues that the development of a Southern nationality and its controversy with the North must be understood from the inside out rather than the outside in.
 From the first years of the 19th century and perhaps earlier, slaveholders in the upper South searched for ways to fulfill the promise of the American Revolution by putting slavery on a slow road to extinction. Slavery, in their view, was a dangerous, morally indefensible, unrepublican and economically retrograde institution. But they never seemed to find the political will to act. As Northern critics observed, that failure called into question their reputed commitment to emancipation, which Ford calls ''a wish and not a plan, a preference but not a priority.'' Eventually all but a few surrendered any emancipatory pretense. Instead, they embraced a policy of ''whitening'' that would rid the region of both slavery and black people, free as well as slave, by prohibiting the importation of slaves, selling other slaves farther south, encouraging manumission and deporting -- or ''colonizing'' -- freed slaves to Africa or elsewhere beyond the borders of the United States. 
 While the upper South's slave masters hoped this ''demographic reconfiguration'' would deliver them from evil, those of the lower South placed their trust in an ''ideological reconfiguration'' of a labor system that they hardly considered an evil. For them, the enormous profits generated by the expansion of cotton production proved that slavery was an asset rather than a liability. If the upper South equivocated about slavery's future, the lower South rushed to welcome it. Shortly after the start of the 19th century, South Carolina reopened the African slave trade. The expansion of slavery assured the region's economic prosperity and fulfilled the promise of the Revolution, providing what John Calhoun called ''the most safe and stable basis for free institutions in the world.''
 Ford painstakingly unravels the divergent perspectives on slavery, making ''Deliver Us From Evil'' required reading for anyone interested in the development of Southern society. Disputes over the efficacy of gradual emancipation, the nature of the slave trade, the purpose of manumission and colonization, and the appropriate defense of slavery roiled white Southerners across the region, so much so that Ford concludes that the only thing they could agree upon was opposition to abolition. 
 Differences over the question of colonization were a case in point. Many upper South slaveholders viewed it as a mechanism to free their region from slavery. Lower South slave owners saw it only as a means to rid themselves of free blacks and strengthen the institution of slavery. The tension grew over time, until slaveholders in the lower South considered upper South colonizationists to be crypto-abolitionists, while upper South colonizationists saw the lower South's intransigence as a more serious obstacle to change than the Northern opponents of slavery. 
 But such tensions manifested themselves most fully over how best to control slaves, a particularly pressing matter in the lower South as its slave population swelled to a majority in many places. Traditionally, Southern slaveholders, like slave masters the world over, believed that slave management rested on coercion and that only constant vigilance, terror and intimidation could keep slaves under control. But in the first years of the 19th century, Ford says, an ''insurgent ideology,'' which held that masters should control their slaves by incorporating them into their households, challenged the conventional wisdom. The master would become less a monarch than a stern but benevolent father, and slaves less dumb beasts than obedient children. 
 In dismissing the stale notions that slaveholder paternalism developed from the ancient habit of noblesse oblige or from the peculiar conditions of Southern slavery, Ford makes his most important contribution to our understanding of the development of Southern society. He demonstrates that paternalism was made, not born, the product of an intense, if often bewildering debate among the slaveholders themselves. 
 While the shift toward paternalism followed different paths in the upper and lower South, it was the clergy that took the lead in both areas, raising questions about how much independence to allow black Christians and whether they should be taught to read (in order to have access to the Bible). The angry contest between traditionalists who warned against paternalist coddling and reformers protesting the barbarism and futility of the old regime drove Southern politics for the first three decades of the century. But by the time the abolitionists began their assault on slavery, the paternalist ideology was in place. Even Calhoun defended the slave plantation as a community. 
 The problem, however, was that paternalism was a fiction. Slaves understood that the plantation was no community and the master no father; the actions of the slaveholders revealed that they did as well. When periodic insurrections and insurrection scares made it clear that paternalism did not create ''hard-working, loyal and well-behaved'' slaves, masters returned to the fist, lash and noose. All of which suggests that whatever the regional differences were among slaveholders, the ownership of slaves did in fact pull them together. Slaveholders in the upper and lower South may have shared only their opposition to abolition, but that was enough. 
 In peering into the internal politics of Southern society, ''Deliver Us From Evil'' tells us a great deal about the developments that would eventually lead slaveholders, first in the lower South and then in the upper South, to break from the North. But the ownership of property-in-man upon which Southern society rested remains the place to start any such discussion.

HEADLINE: Danish Conservative Prepares to Take Reins of Climate Debate

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: COPENHAGEN 

 BODY:
Connie Hedegaard, Denmark's minister of climate and energy, feels little kinship with the green end of the political spectrum -- people who stage sit-ins at power plants or vote for the Green parties in elections.
 ''I've never understood why the environment should be a left-wing issue,'' said Ms. Hedegaard, with an exasperated sigh. ''In my view there is nothing as core to conservative beliefs -- that what you inherit you should pass on to the next generation.''
 Denmark -- and Ms. Hedegaard -- will play host in December to hundreds of nations that will gather in Copenhagen for the United Nation-sponsored global climate treaty negotiations. The meetings are tasked with finalizing a new global plan to tackle climate change. Ms. Hedegaard, who two years ago offered her city as the site for the negotiations, will be the president and the chairwoman of the 12-day event. 
 ''It's a very, very important job,'' said John Hay, a spokesman for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, noting that the president of the climate meeting is the one who ''hammers through the deal.'' 
 Ms. Hedegaard, he said, ''fully appreciates that role and is taking it very seriously.'' The placement of Ms. Hedegaard, a lifelong conservative, at the center of the preparations reflects in large part the shifting of global environmental issues from the fringe into the political mainstream. A movement whose symbols were fuzzy endangered animals is now more concerned with oil futures and budget sheets. 
 Unlike Germany, the Netherlands and France, Denmark has never had a Green party, Ms. Hedegaard points out. In fact, she said, she sees herself as an environmentalist in the model of Theodore Roosevelt, a lifelong hunter who campaigned ardently for protecting natural resources. 
 ''People say environment is a soft issue, but it's not,'' she said recently, sitting in her spartan office in a pink sweater and neatly pressed slacks. ''It's about where we get our energy from, about security, about growing economies. I'm a conservative, I worry about that.'' 
 Blunt and no-nonsense, Ms. Hedegaard, 49, has already emerged as a producer, director, arm-twister, therapist and matchmaker for the Copenhagen meetings -- Time magazine this week named her one of the world's 100 most influential people. 
 In preparation for the December meetings, she is promoting her goals via Twitter and a blog. And though she does not have any official position until the conference opens on Dec. 8, she has spent the last year crisscrossing the globe -- in the last few months alone, she has visited Brazil, India, China, the United States, Mexico and a number of African nations -- urging reluctant countries to pony up and do their share to combat climate change. 
 Ms. Hedegaard arrived in Washington on Wednesday to attend the Major Economies Forum on Climate Change and to meet with officials in preparation for the Group of 20 summit meeting in Pittsburgh this week. She will then travel to New York for a climate summit meeting convened by the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, on Monday. The Danes, who have been hyperkinetically anticipating the December meetings, are holding their own ''pre-summit'' of environmental ministers just outside New York City this weekend.
 Long viewed as something of a wunderkind, Ms Hedegaard was the youngest member of Parliament in Danish history when she was elected in 1984, at age 25. She left politics in 1990 and spent 15 years as a columnist and anchorwoman for Denmark's top news outlets, then returned to government in 2004 as the nation's environment minister. 
 Although the United Nations has held a big climate meeting each year since 1995, December's gathering is extraordinary for many reasons. The emissions reduction commitments that countries made under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol expire in 2012. And while the Bush administration was seen by many countries as an obstacle to achieving a global accord, President Obama has declared that he wants to be a leader in environment issues.
 Ms. Hedegaard views the moment as an opportunity that must be seized.
 ''Our contribution has been to try to get the parties together before it's too late,'' she said.
 Still, hers is a kind of tough-love approach and, like Teddy Roosevelt, she has used her bully pulpit to be extraordinarily blunt about the kinds of concessions she expects, ''putting pressure on all governments to make the political price of being an obstacle so high that no one will pay it,'' she said. 
 For example, Ms. Hedegaard has expressed impatience with the United States, which has focused on reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, the lead heat-trapping gas linked to global warming, by 2050, but has been far less clear about what it intends to do by 2020. 
 ''It's rather crucial that the U.S. can show a credible pathway, and the sooner we get started the more realistic it will be to achieve a goal,'' Ms. Hedegaard said. ''If we postpone, then we'll have such a steep path that it may be hard or impossible to achieve.'' 
 She is quick to point out that the United States emits twice as much carbon dioxide per capita as Denmark, without gaining anything in quality of life.
 Ms. Hedegaard would also like fast-developing countries like India and -- especially -- China to commit in some way to limiting their emissions, noting that by 2020 two-thirds of emissions will come from countries now considered developing nations. 
 ''China and other emerging nations must accept it even if it isn't fair,'' she said, adding, ''I get it. If I were a developing country I would say, 'Why should I do this?' They are feeling the consequences of climate change first and foremost. And they didn't create the situation.''
 But, she said, ''it's just an arithmetic fact that if China and India continue at the current rate they'll use up the whole global carbon space in a very short time.''
 Ms. Hedegaard's no-nonsense style has raised some hackles, and some United Nations officials have said they worry that developing nations might feel strong-armed by her pronouncements, since she is supposed to be a neutral host and is not a negotiator. But some negotiators say they are grateful for the Danish efforts. 
 ''It is entirely appropriate,'' said Todd Stern, lead negotiator for the United States. ''Connie is working hard, as is the prime minister's office.'' 
 Good or bad, any climate agreement that comes out of the December meeting will bear Copenhagen's name. And the tenor of the meetings is likely to reflect Denmark's sober brand of environmentalism. The government has proposed new fines to keep activists in check during the meetings -- $2,000 for breaking through a police cordon or wearing a mask during demonstrations-- and the penalties have angered grass-roots groups. 
 But the conference, in the end, is not about Denmark, Ms. Hedegaard said. 
 ''Of course we're investing a huge amount in hosting this event and we're working hard for a success,'' she said. ''But Denmark doesn't decide that. The major economies will decide whether it works or not.''

HEADLINE: Reinventing TV As Viewers Reinvent Life

BYLINE: By MEGAN ANGELO

 BODY:
DURING a recent evening shoot the wardrobe trailer for ''The Good Wife'' on CBS sat outside a courthouse in Jamaica, Queens. The clothes in it were trial-ready: sober, simple and uniformly dark. ''My biggest challenge on this show is black,'' Daniel Lawson, the show's costume designer, said with a sigh.
 A year ago Mr. Lawson was dressing the leads on ''Lipstick Jungle'' for their stiletto-stomping adventures in the glittering precincts of Manhattan. ''On that show, it was all about the clothes,'' he said. ''They wore sequins at home. Who wears sequins at home?''
Almost no one, especially now. The events of the last year have knocked some sparkle out of most Americans' lives. This year when network executives turned to research to discern what recession-battered viewers wanted, they braced themselves for bitterness. But they discovered something surprising. 
 ''What we found was not a national sense'' of having been cheated or of pointing fingers, said Kevin Reilly, president of Fox Entertainment. ''It was gritty optimism, a sense of, 'We were all living a little out of our bounds; it's time to get real.' '' 
 Mr. Reilly responded by greenlighting ''Brothers,'' a sitcom that stars the former N.F.L. player Michael Strahan as an affable, recently retired football star reconnecting with his family and confronting bankruptcy.
 Mr. Reilly's peers in the industry echo his findings and share his strategy; this season, the major broadcast networks are introducing series with characters who are starting over in strikingly average surroundings.
 ''Right now people are rethinking their careers, their living situations, their family dynamics,'' said Nina Tassler, president of CBS Entertainment. ''The Good Wife'' stars Julianna Margulies as a politician's wife who re-enters the work force after her husband's affair.
 ''There's just a lot of resetting going on,'' Stephen McPherson, president of ABC Entertainment, said. ''Cougar Town,'' that network's most hyped debut, stars Courteney Cox as a recent divorcee wading back into the dating pool. But don't expect the new shows to be too dark or to tackle the recession head-on. The spurt of recession-inspired pilots that cropped up soon after the crash -- like ''Canned,'' about six friends who are fired on the same day, and ''Empire State,'' about blue-collar workers taking on real-estate tycoons -- failed to make the fall lineups. 
 ''We had a ton of pitches about people losing their shirts on Wall Street,'' said Jeff Ingold, executive vice president of comedy programming at NBC & Universal Media Studios. He oversaw development of ''Community,'' in which Joel McHale joins a catchall crew of community-college students. ''Because you're reading about it in the papers every day, it starts feeling cliched. And you don't want to be stuck in a situation where you have a project like that when things turn around. You want the premise to play for six years.''
 So networks settled on something subtler: programming that reflects the reinvention that follows hardship as not just typical, but also inspirational. ''To see someone remake herself, it's not just a way to inform ourselves -- it cheers us up,'' said Tim Brooks, a television historian and former executive at Lifetime Television and USA Network. ''Television is what people realistically want to be, not fantasy want to be.'' 
 Therein lies the tough part. For the last several seasons, aspirational television -- shows like ''Lipstick Jungle,'' ''Cashmere Mafia,'' ''Dirty Sexy Money'' and ''Big Shots'' -- has pressed audiences to connect with characters who lead ultrafabulous lives. The current climate calls for not a ban on aspirational television but a redefining of the term. ''Aspirational means full of hope, and hope needs to be accessible,'' said Zack Van Amburg, co-president of programming at Sony Television, which produced ''Brothers'' and ''Community.'' As a result, the untouchable things have been ruthlessly edited out.
 There are the settings of the shows: Chicago (''The Good Wife''), Colorado (''Community''), Texas (''Brothers'') and Florida (''Cougar Town''). New York is conspicuously -- and deliberately -- absent.
 ''In a time like this people are desperately looking for characters they can identify with,'' said Bill Lawrence, creator of ''Cougar Town'' (and previously, ''Scrubs''). ''The incredibly rich socialite who lives in a fantastic apartment but she's sad because she can't find love -- that's going to be hard to get people to hook into.''
 Mr. Lawrence's loveless Jules Cobb, played by Ms. Cox, lives on a cul-de-sac in the fictional Florida town of Gulfhaven. 
 Mr. Lawrence, who has roots in rural Florida, has made sure her clothing matches her Gulf Coast address, where nothing is so haute couture that it couldn't be bought at a place where most people can afford to shop. ''It's cool to show someone who's middle class, not a magazine editor in Manhattan, how they would look rocking an outfit,'' he said. 
 The ''Good Wife'' team is intent on assigning believability to every shoe and seam on Ms. Margulies's Alicia Florrick, who gives up her mansion when her husband goes to jail. ''There's an intentional affect of the wardrobe,'' said Robert King, who created the show with his wife, Michelle. ''What did she bring from the house in Highland Park to this apartment?'' 
 Mr. Lawson's answers to that question are carefully thought out. There are stud earrings and understated bracelets. (''We're so minimal with the jewelry -- she doesn't have time for it,'' he said.) Ms. Margulies's rack is stocked with mix-and-match suiting from designer-diffusion lines like Arthur S. Levine for Elie Tahari. Every outfit is scrupulously built for pragmatism. Some pieces will make more than one on-screen appearance. ''And all the shows I've done, I've never repeated women's clothes,'' Mr. Lawson said.
 Another nod to realism: when Alicia joins a law firm as a junior associate, she is pitted against a 27-year-old for permanent employment. ''Most shows deal with the person making orders, and she's taking orders,'' Mr. King said. 
 This careful restraint and attention to detail have made for shows that refer to the downturn without dwelling on it. ''Brothers'' was one of the few new shows consciously created with the recession in mind. Don Reo, the show's creator, was trying to build a sitcom around Mr. Strahan as a football player (''It's hard to do a comedy about rich people,'' he explained) when the news of Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme broke. ''I thought, 'What if this guy was a victim of something like that?' '' he said. ''That element put the show firmly into comedyland for me.'' 
 ''Cougar Town'' and ''The Good Wife'' both wrote in the recession during production. In the pilot of ''The Good Wife,'' Alicia and her husband, Peter (Chris Noth), acknowledge that they took a hit on the sale of their house and will have to switch their children to public school. Mr. Lawrence promises that future episodes of ''Cougar Town'' will explore Jules's struggle to pay for her son's college education. 
 ''Community,'' which never mentions the recession outright, is less calculating. ''I happily accept that the zeitgeist is synching up with this,'' Dan Harmon, the show's creator, said. ''But I certainly did not feel out the economic climate and say, 'This is an idea whose time has come.' '' 
 Mr. Harmon finds mining such lives more interesting than writing about superficial, successful societies, which take on the blandness ''of a Xerox of a Xerox,'' he said. ''Even before the Dow Jones started plummeting, we needed to get back to basics. These little catastrophes double as rebirths of things.'' 
 That same conviction keeps Mr. Reo inspired. ''I love the idea that this is the first day of a part of your life,'' he said. ''Everything is new.''

HEADLINE: Meeting to Mingle, Resumes in Tow

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
A species of exclusive club has been sprouting across the New York region, spurred on by the stubborn recession. But it's the kind of group nobody really wants to join.
 They are called job clubs, though a more precise term might be jobless clubs. They provide doses of inspiration, consolation and camaraderie for the unemployed, and a chance to mingle with people in the same leaky boat and to network. That recently downsized lawyer, for example, may know that her former law firm desperately needs an accountant.
 About 80 people with the dubious distinction of being out of work gathered around the coffee urn one recent Wednesday morning at Temple Beth El in Stamford, Conn.: There was Valerie Lucas, 47, who had been laid off three weeks before as a retail manager; Pamela C. Pia, 53, one of 280 people let go six months before at Reader's Digest, where she had been an editorial director; and Norman Eagle, a software salesman in his 60s who had been out of work for nine months.
 ''It's just spreading the word -- and you never know,'' Mr. Eagle said to explain the attraction of his club, the Temple Beth El Networking Group. ''If you talk to 100 people, maybe one will say, 'I know a company that is looking.' '' 
 Ms. Lucas, a single mother, said she was hoping that someone at the meeting might soon land a job and pull her into the enterprise too. ''The hope in making these connections is that as people move into positions, maybe they'll remember you,'' she said. 
 Some job clubs are well established, but their numbers have mushroomed with the recession and a national unemployment rate that reached 9.7 percent last month. Janice Lee Juvrud, an unemployed organizational specialist in West Milford, N.J., has watched the expansion on the regional job-club list that she has maintained for three years on blog.yoursearchlights.org, her Web site. 
 ''In December my document was 15 pages long, and in June it was 39 pages long,'' Ms. Juvrud said. ''The growth is huge.'' Her list focuses mostly on New Jersey, Connecticut and Westchester County, with only bare-bones information about New York City and Long Island. The complete list of job clubs in the region is presumably far larger. 
 The clubs, which have names like Whine and Dine and the New Canaan CATS (for Career Transition Support), meet in diners, churches, libraries, hotels, even in an assisted-living center. Some are exclusively for women, other for executives or human resources workers. There are clubs for Christians and clubs for Jewish professionals (though Temple Beth El's is nondenominational). Most have no age limit, though the range seems to be midlife and above.
 At a typical meeting, club members sip coffee, chat and listen to guest speakers on topics like interviewing or resume writing (many jobless professionals have not written one in decades). At the recent Stamford gathering, Rita Weiss, a career coach, urged members to ''cultivate advocates'' who could help them in good times and bad, and to treat networking as a two-way relationship in which, she said, ''How can I help?'' yields better dividends than ''What can I get?''
 At times, the sessions turn confessional. At the Stamford meeting, Addison Cheng rose to describe how much his life had changed and how he used to arrange financing for billion-dollar port and power projects in Asia. 
 ''I've been told I bring order to chaos,'' Mr. Cheng said.
 At other times, they seem like religious revival meetings with a New Age tinge, as members lay bare their souls and make self-affirming declarations.
 ''I didn't lose my job,'' said a mediator in his 70s who would give his name only as Henry. ''I'm just a victim of not being able to find companies or businesses interested in using my services.''
 Mark Plotsky, a Stamford father of two who lost his job as a marketing analyst in April, said he went to the Temple Beth El group just to escape being home alone.
 ''It's depressing to sit in the house,'' he said. ''It's good to be with people. It's like a support group.''
 Some clubs are started by employment consultants -- sometimes out-of-work ones -- who hope to drum up clients. Others arise spontaneously. The Long Island Breakfast Club began three years ago in a diner in Melville with five middle-aged, out-of-work professionals who had been commiserating over coffee and doughnuts.
 ''Nobody would hire us,'' said one of the five, Valentina Janek, 57, who has worked as a media consultant. ''We were, A, too smart and, B, too old.''
 Soon the diner owner, too, wanted nothing to do with them -- for loungers, they were not ordering enough food. And so, homeless as well as unemployed, the group expanded into a formal organization, charging $15 in annual dues and cadging space for meetings from large restaurants and assisted-living centers.
 The recession has propelled the Breakfast Club's e-mail list to 800 people, and monthly gatherings draw about 100. At meetings, the club advises, members should not just collect business cards but also strive to make genuine connections. And so they end up trading war stories, like Stephanie Carlino's reminiscence about an interviewer's out-of-left-field question: ''Why are manhole covers round?'' 
 ''That can make you leave the interview feeling like a moron,'' said Ms. Carlino, 61, who is also one of the original five and has been out of work since April. 
 Chris Fidis, 50, another founder, got a job at Verizon, but still attends meetings to buck up the others. He tells people that losing a job ''is not your fault.''
 ''The company changed or the business model changed,'' Mr. Fidis said. ''Pick yourself up, dust yourself off and start all over again.''
 At some job clubs, the emphasis is not on emotional bolstering but on the nuts and bolts of securing work.
 ''I don't get into pity-partying,'' said Melanie Szlucha, a career coach who runs a monthly group at the Silver Star Diner in Norwalk, Conn. In part, Ms. Szlucha considers the meetings to be a generator of private sessions, ''a great way for people to test-drive me.''
 The recession is still chugging along, but the clubs do have success stories. At the Long Island club, members tell of a 50-year-old gynecologist who had been downsized from a group practice, and then, after her name was passed on by a club member who was a nurse, got a position at a Bronx hospital clinic.
 Cindy Wagner, 37, a laid-off human resources professional in Darien, Conn., said she had visited three clubs, but could not go to too many meetings because she started to ''feel a negative tone,'' with people ''being bitter and sarcastic.''
 But in general, said Ms. Juvrud, in a disheartening job market the groups have become popular. ''There are people,'' she said, ''who are going to a group every day.''

Economists point to powerhouse countries like India to illustrate the hurdles facing some 100 world leaders due to gather in New York this Tuesday for the highest level summit meeting on climate change ever convened. 
 The Indian government has announced a major commitment to solar power as a renewable means of bringing electricity to more than 400 million people now living without it. Yet the government was pilloried at home last summer for accepting the international goal of preventing a global temperature rise of more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit above present temperatures by limiting emissions. Opposition parties accused it of selling out the country's future development. 
 While virtually all of the largest developed and developing nations have made domestic commitments toward creating more efficient, renewable sources of energy to cut emissions, none want to take the lead in fighting for significant international emissions reduction targets, lest they be accused at home of selling out future jobs and economic growth. 
 The negotiations for a new climate change agreement to be signed in Copenhagen in December are badly stalled. With the agreement running more than 200 pages -- including what negotiators estimate are a couple of thousand brackets denoting points of differences -- diplomats and negotiators fear that the document is too unwieldy to garner a consensus in the coming months. 
 In convening the meeting, the United Nations is hoping that collectively the leaders can summon the will to overcome narrow national interests and give the negotiators the marching orders needed to cut at least the outline of a deal. 
 ''I have been urging them to speak and to act as global leaders; just go beyond their national boundaries,'' Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, said Thursday. 
 On Tuesday, the leaders, including the heads of state or government of most economic powers, are to engage in a series of round-table discussions on outstanding climate change issues that will be less like negotiations than a series of college seminars designed to forge political momentum. 
 ''They won't do it one by one,'' said Robert Orr, the United Nations assistant secretary general for policy planning. ''Politically, they all have to jump together, and this is the essence of this summit. We will see if any governments are ready to say, 'I am stepping through the door now; are you going to come with me?' That would be a huge break.''
 Senior organizers said they had never been involved in such a high-level summit meeting where the outcome was not predetermined. Fundamentally, although limiting the temperature rise to 2 degrees Fahrenheit is an accepted goal, there is no consensus on how to get there.
 This 2-degree Fahrenheit rise is the equivalent of the original goal of 2 degrees Celsius above the planet's temperature just before the Industrial Revolution. 
 The industrialized nations have not agreed on midterm targets. They have made pledges of roughly half the target set by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a 25 percent to 40 percent reduction from 1990 levels by 2020. 
 Developing countries have agreed on the need to mitigate their emissions, but have rejected any mandatory limit, and they demand financial and technical support in exchange. 
 The issue of aid for the poorest countries to adapt to the impact of climate change has been shunted aside. Finally, there is no agreement on what institutions would verify that targets are being met and supervise the finances.
 ''The mood in the negotiations has been that I should do as little as possible as late as possible and let the other person go first,'' said Kim Carstensen, the director of the Global Climate Initiative of the World Wildlife Fund. 
 In recent weeks, sharp divisions have emerged between the United States and the European Union. The Europeans said that they would donate $2 billion to $15 billion a year for the next decade to help less developed nations adapt to climate change. The Obama administration has not offered anything close. 
 The Europeans also want binding, near-term targets for developed nations, a legacy of the last significant global climate accord, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which the Bush administration rejected because it did not set limits on emissions from China and other major developing nations. 
 The European target is a 20 percent reduction of 1990 levels by 2020, still less than the 25 percent recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel, although the Europeans said they would accept 30 percent if everyone agreed. 
 The American position is that any targets be enforced by domestic laws rather than international treaties, that they be verifiable and distributed equally. A House bill approaches the European target, but the Senate is expected to dilute it.
 But the chances of a final bill's clearing Congress by December are increasingly unlikely, so experts are eagerly waiting to hear what President Obama, who made climate change a key issue in his administration, proposes in his speech on Tuesday. 
 A speech by President Hu Jintao of China is also widely anticipated, with experts hoping he will announce a significant commitment to renewable energy and emissions reductions in China's next five-year plan. Mr. Hu is the first Chinese president to attend the annual United Nations General Assembly, where leaders will convene Wednesday. 
 Between them, the United States and China account for about 40 percent of world emissions, split almost evenly, so if the two reach a consensus it will also provide significant impetus for a global agreement. 
 The United States also suffers from the ''after you'' syndrome, with some Congressional leaders demanding that China agree to reductions before the United States agrees to an overall framework, a formula that experts warn will kill progress. 
 ''We don't want to get hung up on trying to say that the U.S. and China will reduce the same percentage or the same amount,'' said Timothy E. Wirth, the president of the United Nations Foundation and a former Colorado senator who has long been involved in climate negotiations. 
 Blocs of smaller, poorer nations have their own agendas. The island countries of the Pacific and the Caribbean will be pushing for an even lower temperature ceiling because they fear that the rising seas caused by even a 2-degree rise would drown or severely damage them. The Africans are threatening to walk out of the negotiations if they are not promised $300 billion in aid. 
 New Zealand objects to the fact that the negotiations have basically ignored agriculture, which accounts for 13 percent to 14 percent of greenhouse gases. Developing nations fear that any regulation of agriculture could deepen the severe problems in feeding their populations. 
 Such issues, while parochial, may be no less important in building an agreement that works across political borders. 
 ''The instinct is a kind of nationalist response that can get it exactly backwards,'' said Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University. ''We should be viewing this as global problem solving, not as global negotiation.''

HEADLINE: The Look Of Autumn

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH A. HARRIS

 BODY:
THE first anniversary last week of the Lehman Brothers collapse was a grim milestone. During the financial meltdown that followed, markets across the globe were roiled. New York real estate did not escape unscathed. 
 Activity was basically frozen through the winter, and the customarily busy spring season was slow. In the summer, when the market usually becomes sluggish, contract signings finally picked up. 
 That left everyone wondering what to expect from the fall. 
 Traditionally, there is a modest bump in the number of apartments listed for sale the week after Labor Day. But professional and amateur market watchers worried: What would it mean if this year was different? Would an avalanche of new listings be the equivalent of a last-ditch effort from sellers? 
 If few were added, would it mean owners had no confidence that they could sell anything? 
 So far, the market appears to be behaving much more normally this fall than it did over the last 12 tumultuous months. A comparison of data from two of the city's largest real estate brokerages and two Web sites that follow the industry shows that the number of listings added in Manhattan after Labor Day was similar to last year's. 
 ''Seasonally, this is the expectation,'' said Jonathan Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. Because the listing level is considered normal, he said, ''we see it as a sign of confidence, that consumers are willing to see this as a market they can sell their property in.'' Although he said it made sense to be happy for the good news, it didn't mean that the boom times had returned, only that the steep decline had abated.
 ''It shows we're going in a better direction,'' Mr. Miller said. ''I think that direction is sideways as opposed to through the floor.'' 
 The stabilizing of inventory does not mean that sellers will be getting the prices they received a year or two ago. New data from StreetEasy.com suggests that asking prices are about 24 percent below levels last year at this time.
 Both NYTimes.com and StreetEasy had more than 450 new listings in Manhattan the week after Labor Day. StreetEasy said the increase of 462 apartment listings was similar to the jump last year after Labor Day of 472. 
 According to Mr. Miller, inventory for August of this year -- which clocked in at 8,423 co-ops, condos and town houses -- was only 2.8 percent higher than for the same month last year. But the ride from August to August was a roller coaster. Inventory started to pile up last fall, and when it peaked in March, there were more than 11,000 units on the market -- 34.7 percent more listings than in August of 2008. 
 ''The second quarter was very bleak,'' said Sofia Kim, the vice president for research at StreetEasy. ''Nothing was moving.''
 ''The three things we're watching for are prices dropping, transaction activity and inventory,'' Ms. Kim said. ''What we saw this summer was transactions going up; inventory looks like it's stabilizing; the only thing of concern right now is prices are still dropping.'' 
 About 40 percent of the new listings in Manhattan after Labor Day were condos and 60 percent were co-ops, according to StreetEasy. One-bedrooms had the largest inventory increase, at 171 new listings, followed closely by two-bedrooms, at 160. There were 65 newly listed studios on the market and 50 three-bedroom apartments. Homes with more than three bedrooms saw the smallest bump, with only 16 new listings the week after Labor Day. 
 Asking prices, meanwhile, were way down from previous years, according to StreetEasy. The median asking price for the week that ended on Sept. 13 was $860,750. The week after Labor Day 2008, the comparable figure was $1,100,000. After Labor Day 2007, it was $1,050,000.
 The week after Labor Day in 2007, studio apartments new to the market were listed at a median price of $525,000. The next year, the median price was $429,000. This year, it was down to $399,000. 
 Over that same period, new one-bedrooms went from $785,000 to $775,000, and are now down to $675,000. 
 Two-bedrooms went from $1,412,500 in 2007, up to $1,599,500 in 2008 and then down to $1,250,000 this year.
 Neither NYTimes.com nor StreetEasy could provide year-over-year data for the boroughs outside Manhattan on prices, inventory or the number of new listings.
 Ramon and Carly Alvarez staged their first open house last Sunday for the two-bedroom Upper West Side co-op they have just put on the market. Even though they moved to New Jersey in early August, they decided not to list their apartment until after Labor Day. 
 ''There is that fear of it getting stale, knowing half the buyers were going to be out of town,'' Mr. Alvarez said. ''When the same apartment's been sitting there for a long time, you're like, 'Well, what's wrong with it?' '' 
 The Alvarezes' agent, Andrea D'Amico, a vice president at Corcoran, advised them to hold off on the listing until after the summer. 
 ''If you list this at the beginning of August, when everyone's away on vacation,'' Ms. D'Amico said, ''then it will sit here with no traffic and suddenly people walk in after Labor Day and it's been on for a month. Then people think, 'It's really time to negotiate.' ''
 A search of Corcoran's database, including exclusive and nonexclusive listings, showed that the Alvarezes had lots of company on the sidelines during the summer. It found 426 new listings for the week ended Sept. 13. That same search showed 518 new listings the week after Labor Day in 2008 and 563 new listings the year before.
 ''In the last year, many people held their apartments off the market,'' said Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of the Corcoran Group. ''I think it's a good sign that we're getting a normal number of apartments on after Labor Day.'' Sellers, she added, have become used to the idea of lower prices.
 When Mary Stone and her husband, Channing Creecy, first put their one-bedroom Upper East Side co-op on the market in March, they were testing the waters. 
 ''There were good options to buy a house or to upgrade,'' Ms. Stone said, ''but there wasn't an urgency to it.'' 
 Now Ms. Stone is pregnant. She and her husband have decided that it's time to move to the suburbs. 
 In the spring, their apartment was listed for $649,000. They took it off the market at the end of July. Using an apartment that recently sold in their building as a guide, they just relisted it, this time for $575,000, with Patty Lehan of Prudential Douglas Elliman's Shemesh Group.
 ''We didn't know exactly what the right price was,'' Ms. Stone said of the earlier figure. ''Now we have more clarity.'' 
 In past years, apartment prices in Manhattan were practically dictated by buyers with huge Wall Street bonuses. But that era is over, at least for now.
 ''With bonuses, the general consensus is that it's never going to be what we had,'' said Dottie Herman, the president of Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''But it was mad money. It was unreal.'' 
 According to Ms. Herman, Prudential experienced a spike of nearly 35 percent the week before Labor Day this year over last. But the next week, listings were down about 30 percent from 2008's numbers. So, she says, things are about the same as last year. 
 ''To be really healthy,'' Ms. Herman said, ''you don't want to be at either extreme. You don't want to be in the market we were in a few years back when there was no inventory, but you also don't want to be at the opposite of that.'' 
 A good job market is essential to a healthy real estate business. After dipping slightly in July, the national unemployment rate inched close to 10 percent in August, hitting a high of 9.7 percent. 
 Movements in the job world, along with events like marriage, divorce, birth and death, also dictate what happens in real estate. 
 Sheri Whitko Desai, a photographer, and her husband, Anar Desai, who works in technology sales, are moving to Chicago for work. Their Brooklyn Heights apartment is on the market. 
 Their real estate agent, Jon Varnedoe, an associate broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman, held the first open house last weekend.
 ''This is a special place to us,'' Ms. Whitko Desai said. 
 The one-bedroom was the first home either of them had ever owned, and Mr. Desai proposed to her on the balcony the day they closed on the apartment three years ago. They paid $530,000.
 ''We're cautiously optimistic,'' Mr. Desai said. ''Everyone knows what's been going on this year in terms of the economy, but it looks like people are getting back in. And people are beginning to look at real estate differently,'' he added. ''It's where you're putting your savings and your nest egg, not necessarily something you'll get a quick hit off of.'' 
 The apartment is listed for $575,000, and Mr. Desai says his hope is to break about even after fees and taxes, rather than make a killing .
 ''In many ways, it's going to be a healthier market,'' said Hall Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens. ''It will be more affordable to more people, which is more sustainable. A lot of money was made during the boom years,'' he said, ''but I don't know if it's such a great world when people with good jobs and a good income can't buy a home. I don't think we're going back there for a while.''

HEADLINE: Monumental Task: Cowboys' Opulent Football Cathedral Welcomes Giants

BYLINE: By MIKE TANIER. 
Mike Tanier of FootballOutsiders.com is a co-author of ''Football Outsiders Almanac 2009'' and a contributor to The Fifth Down.

 BODY:
In Arlington did Jerry Jones
 A stately pleasure-dome decree
 Whether you call it Xanadu, El Dorado, Sloppy Joe's or its true name, Cowboys Stadium is a monument worthy of Charles Foster Kane, if not Kubla Khan. Even the scoreboard can be described by channeling Carl Sagan: it weighs 1.2 mill-yion pounds, consists of 30 mill-yion bulbs and displays images so lifelike that, come December, fans in the (relatively) cheap seats will think Tony Romo is fumbling right into their laps.
 In fairness, Romo played well last Sunday, slinging several deep passes to his maligned receiver corps. The minor ankle injury he sustained against the Buccaneers has not slowed him in practice. The Giants' victory last week, while impressive, was uninformative. The defense and offensive line met expectations, and Eli Manning was efficient. But receiver stocks are still fluctuating: Mario Manningham is up, Domenik Hixon is down, Hakeem Nicks is out.
 Dallas beat the Giants at home last December when Brandon Jacobs was hurt, the Giants' defense was out of gas, and the man who shot Plaxico Burress was still at large. The Giants are the better team on paper, but it is hard to measure the impact of home-palace advantage. 
 8:20 p.m. Line: Cowboys by 3.
 Saints at Eagles
 Saints games are like tee-ball marathons: They take all afternoon to complete, and everybody on each team gets a chance to score. New Orleans still has not fixed its sloppy special teams or leaky defense, but the team caught a break this week when the N.F.L. delayed possible substance-abuse suspensions for defenders Charles Grant and Will Smith. With its talent, troubles and egos, Philadelphia's quarterback triumvirate of Donovan McNabb, Jeff Garcia and Michael Vick resembles Crosby, Stills and Nash, but without the harmony. McNabb is hurt, Vick is suspended and Garcia is still unpacking, so young Kevin Kolb will start. 1 p.m. Line: Even
 Cardinals at Jaguars
 The Jaguars' offense must make a 90-degree turnaround. Its passing game is too horizontal: David Garrard completed just two passes longer than 15 yards last week. The overmatched rookie tackles Eugene Monroe and Eben Britton bear part of the blame for all the sideways passing, but there are ways to protect rookie linemen and still throw deep. Arizona also has offensive problems, with Kurt Warner rickety and Anquan Boldin less than full speed, but the Cardinals are good enough to stay competitive in their conference. In the American Football Conference South, with games against Tennessee and Houston , Jacksonville must improve soon. 1 p.m. Line: Jaguars by 3
 Patriots at Jets
 The Jets' offensive coordinator, Brian Schottenheimer, was the unsung hero of their season-opening victory. A diet of screens, sprint-outs and gimmicks can starve a veteran quarterback, but it was nourishment for Mark Sanchez, who needed to fatten up on easy reads and throws while his defense did the dirty work. New England was fooled several times by the Buffalo Bills' screen-heavy offense on Monday night, and Bill Belichick rarely makes the same mistake twice. He will concoct one of his patented rookie-baffling game plans. Belichick's defenses are not foolproof, but they are far more formidable than what the Texans offered Sanchez last week. 
 1 p.m. Line: Patriots by 3 1/2.
 Steelers at Bears
 A Pluto-size meteor could be hurtling toward earth, and Ben Roethlisberger would still pump-fake. Roethlisberger's disregard for impending peril and the Steelers' E-ZPass offensive line form a dangerous codependency: Roethlisberger has been sacked 143 times since 2006, but Pittsburgh still wins, though often by scores of 11-10, 13-9, 10-6 and last week, 13-10. The Bears will not miss the injured linebacker Brian Urlacher this week; if the backup Hunter Hillenmeyer blitzes, the Steelers' line will wave him through. 
 Jay Cutler could use a dose of Roethlisberger's foolhardy sangfroid. He was driven to distraction by the Packers' defense last week (granted, that is only a $3 cab ride for Cutler). If he cannot handle Steelers Lite, Cutler is doomed when he faces the real thing. Chicago will use running back Matt Forte and tight end Greg Olsen more often as blockers, but when two of your best receivers are trying to protect you, it is hard to complete many passes. Sacks will be plentiful and points scarce on both sides of the ball. 
 4:15 p.m. Line: Steelers by 3. 
 Ravens at Chargers
 When life gives Norv Turner lemonade, he develops a citrus allergy. Never has one coach done so little with so much for so long. San Diego has the talent to dominate the league, but it can barely beat the Raiders. Turner's teams typically dig deep midseason holes before rallying in an 11th-hour playoff push. This season, they may be getting a jump on their underachievement. The Ravens survived a scare last Sunday, overcoming the pesky Chiefs by diverging from their run-run-run-bomb offensive formula. The coordinator Cam Cameron's max-protect philosophy is the ideal counterstrategy for the Chargers' ravenous blitz, but the Chargers have the talent to test a banged-up Ravens defense (stars Ed Reed and Terrell Suggs spent the week shaking off concussions) and shut down their offense. 
 4:15 p.m. Line: Chargers by 3
 Panthers at Falcons
 Jake Delhomme remains the Panthers' quarterback despite nine interceptions and two fumbles in his last 46 attempts. There is no blackmail or hypnosis involved; Delhomme is just the beneficiary of bad planning. Carolina has drafted only one quarterback since 2003 -- the fourth-round legend Stefan LeFors, now with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. They convinced themselves that Delhomme, streaky in his peak years, would stay effective into his mid-30s, offering him a contract extension at a time when most teams would have drafted a successor. Delhomme has one more chance to prove his current funk is temporary; one more interception, and John Fox will stare across the field at Matt Ryan and sigh softly. 
 1 p.m. Line: Falcons by 6 1/2.
 Raiders at Chiefs
 When you have been down as long as Oakland has, you interpret stomach pain as an encouraging life sign. ''I've been a Raider since 2007, and it felt like that was the first time in the locker room after a loss where it really got us in the gut, and that's a good thing,'' Coach Tom Cable said after Monday night's loss. ''That's the way you're supposed to feel about this game.'' 
 The Raiders and the Chiefs have split in the last two seasons, so each team circles the other as a possible victory on a schedule with few circles. Matt Cassel is likely to return from a knee sprain to lead Kansas City; if he cannot, Brodie Croyle will get his 10th chance to win his first N.F.L game. 1 p.m. Line: Chiefs by 3.
 Texans at Titans
 Forget the end zone; the Texans just need to find the red zone. The only time they made it past the Jets' 35 last week was when Dominique Barber returned a fumble for a touchdown. Last week, Houston abandoned the run during the pregame breakfast, held the ball for just 21 minutes and averaged an awful 4.1 yards per pass attempt. The return of receiver Kevin Walter gives Matt Schaub another option, and Coach Gary Kubiak wants to increase the offensive tempo. The Texans are pumping artificial crowd noise into practice to prepare for the Adelphi Stadium crowd; Tennessee is preparing to provide sacks on the downbeat. 1 p.m. Line: Titans by 6 1/2.
 Vikings at Lions
 The Vikings' first three opponents combined for an 11-37 record last year. That makes their first month similar to Led Zeppelin's Scandinavian tour in September 1968. Minnesotais working the supergroup wrinkles out, with Adrian Peterson grinding out blues riffs while Brett Favre learns the set list. They should kill at the Fjordvilla Club this week, but they will not be the New Yardbirds anymore when they face the Packers on Oct. 5.
 1 p.m. Line: Vikings by 10.
 Bengals at Packers
 The new Green Bay defense combines the best elements of the Steelers' defense (linebackers and cornerbacks blitzing from all angles) and the Giants' 2007 system (hybrid linemen shifting all around the formation). Cincinnati's defense also looks much better this year, but facing an opposing quarterback with a broken finger last week helped. The rookie Southern California linebackers Clay Matthews (Packers) and Rey Maualuga (Bengals) had strong debuts. This week, they can commiserate about how their college teammate Mark Sanchez is getting all the love from the news media. 1 p.m. Line: Packers by 9.
 Rams at Redskins
 Washington's offense has met its match. St. Louis produced just 13 first downs and converted 2 of 12 third downs last week. In fairness to Marc Bulger, it is hard to convert on third down when penalties land you in third-and-20 and third-and-23 situations. With the hotheads Richie Incognito (two roughness penalties last week) and DeAngelo Hall (13 penalties in two years) on the same field, personal fouls may outnumber touchdowns in this game. 1 p.m. Line: Redskins by 10
 Buccaneers at Bills
 Leodis McKelvin's fumble (and the vandalism of his lawn by angry teenagers) overshadowed a surprising effort by Buffalo. Three rookie linemen held the Patriots' defense at bay for much of the night, the novice offensive coordinator Alex Van Pelt devised a solid game plan in the time it takes some people to make dinner plans, and the defense held Tom Brady in check until he had one too many opportunities. The Bills still have problems, but they will put up a fight against second-tier opponents like Tampa Bay, which is blitzing more and enjoying it less under its new coach, Raheem Morris. 4:05 p.m. Line: Bills by 5.
 Seahawks at 49ers
 One of these teams will start the season 2-0 with two intradivision wins, earning buzz team status among those who do not examine strength of schedule, statistics or game tape closely. The Seattle offense had more injuries than any team in recent history last season, but their most important players -- starting with quarterback Matt Hasselbeck -- are healthy and playing well. San Francisco's offense relies too heavily on Shaun Hill, who has pluck, spunk, moxie and all those other words that are poor substitutes for ability. 
 4:05 p.m. Line: 49ers by 1 1/2.
 Browns at Broncos
 Scrutinizing the Broncos-Bengals game tape for hidden meaning is as futile as staring at a tortilla until you see the face of Elvis. Denver's defense is not as good, nor its offense as bad, as it looked in last week's sloppy, fluky win. The Broncos' offense will round into shape now that Kyle Orton's injured hand has healed and Brandon Marshall is out of the cooler. Their defense should be dominant. 
 4:15 p.m. Line: Broncos by 3. 
 Colts at Dolphins
 What is next for the new-look Colts? A Wildcat package? A (gasp) fullback? Not likely. Indianapolis scored only 14 points last week and lost receiver Anthony Gonzalez, but it has few offensive worries. Two turnovers marred an otherwise strong performance, and if the rookie Austin Collie cannot fill Gonzalez's shoes, the reality-TV paramour Hank Baskett (or an unemployed Marvin Harrison) could.
 Monday, 8:30 p.m. Line: Colts by 3.

''Good habits formed at youth make all the difference,'' Aristotle said. Maybe the recent financial crisis could have been averted if some of its players had practiced basic principles of money management as children. 
 In an effort to turn future generations into better financial stewards, Naomi Schachter, president of Financially Free, runs Camp Millionaire for children. At a session last month in Allentown, Pa., participants learned about money, work, savings and investments through role playing, games and other activities.
 The hope is that children will ''learn that by having more money coming in than going out, they will eventually amass wealth with which they can do a whole lot of good for themselves, for others and for the world,'' Ms. Schachter says.

HEADLINE: Capitalism's Little Tramp

BYLINE: By BRUCE HEADLAM

DATELINE: TORONTO 

 BODY:
''DO not get out of the car!'' the private security guard barked at the driver from the back seat of a black van carrying Michael Moore and five striking workers from the United Steelworkers union (Local 6500). The event was the screening of Mr. Moore's latest film, ''Capitalism: A Love Story'' at the Toronto International Film Festival and, as with most premieres, the sidewalk was packed with people waiting for the limousine doors to open.
But as the driver pulled the van close enough to the curb to clip the shoulder of a Toronto policeman holding back the surging crowd, it became evident that this crowd wanted more than autographs. There were picketers, homemade protest signs and people dressed as 19th-century robber barons. Even the miners, whom Mr. Moore invited to bring attention to their bitter two-month strike against the mining giant Vale Inco in Sudbury, Ontario, looked wide-eyed at the spectacle last Sunday. 
 ''Uh, oh,'' Mr. Moore said, looking out the front-seat passenger window. ''They've got pitchforks.'' 
 Mr. Moore, a veteran of political action and perhaps the most successful documentary filmmaker in history, had little reason to worry. Getting out of the van, he waded into the crowd and greeted the protesters, whose pitchforks were directed at the bankers and bureaucrats behind last year's huge Wall Street bailout. He then entered the Elgin Theater and introduced the miners (wearing their full work gear) to the news media, the warm mood broken only slightly when a reporter from ''Entertainment Tonight'' asked sarcastically whether Mr. Moore had arrived in a Cadillac. 
 ''I don't notice,'' he said, asking if anyone knew the make.
 ''Jeez, I think it was a Ford,'' one of the miners said, squinting into the paparazzi flashes that lighted up his face. 
 Canada has been friendly territory since 1989, when Mr. Moore came to the festival here to hawk his first film, a 16-millimeter documentary called ''Roger & Me,'' about how General Motors abandoned Flint, Mich. Still living on weekly unemployment checks of $98, Mr. Moore was a surprise winner of the festival's People's Choice Award and his unlikely career rise began. 
 Since then, in films like ''Fahrenheit 9/11,'' ''Bowling for Columbine'' and ''Sicko,'' his hulking figure shambling toward company executives and bewildered security guards has become the postindustrial version of Chaplin's Little Tramp. This year's entry is not a sortie on a particular industry; it is a frontal assault on the very idea of American free enterprise -- a beast, he called it in an address to the Toronto audience, ''and you can't tie it down with a flimsy piece of rope.''
 For this crowd that is a message that goes down as easily as weak American beer. In the United States Mr. Moore's conservative critics may decry his popularity, but his films and best-selling books are far more popular outside the country, especially in Britain, elsewhere in Europe and in Japan. In such places Mr. Moore has become a kind of anti-cultural ambassador -- the prism through which a large part of the world views the United States.
 But a film that flatly concludes that capitalism is evil is certain to put him at odds with most of the left wing in his own country, and even with President Obama, who gave a speech the next day on Wall Street on the need to reregulate, not replace the financial industry. 
 ''I know what I'm facing when I go back across the Blue Water Bridge,'' Mr. Moore told the theater's 1,500 cheering ''socialist Canadians,'' as he called them. After the screening many in the audience looked for ballots to vote again for Mr. Moore's film for the People's Choice Award, which is sponsored by -- who else? -- Cadillac. Your tax dollars at work.
 HYPOCRITE. PROPAGANDIST. Egomaniac. Glutton. Exploiter. Embarrassment. Slob. These are a few of the criticisms that have been lobbed at Mr. Moore since his career began, and these are just the ones from liberals. 
 His arrival with ''Roger & Me'' seemed to crystallize a contradiction in the elite liberal sensibility, one that is still unresolved. Through President Ronald Reagan, both Bushes, Whitewater and Kenneth W. Starr, some liberals have craved their own class warrior, a Rush Limbaugh for the left who would take the fight unapologetically to the Republicans. 
 But faced with Mr. Moore (and later, Keith Olbermann) they recoil, claiming that kind of aggressiveness is somehow at odds with the notion of being a liberal. In a famous attack, Pauline Kael wrote that ''Roger & Me'' was ''gonzo demagoguery that made me feel cheap for laughing.'' Funny -- none of Rush's listeners ever say that about him. 
 ''I don't think they like a guy who is hovering around 300 pounds and walks around in a ball cap who comes from a factory town and talks like where he comes from,'' Mr. Moore said over lunch in Toronto the day before his premiere here. ''People want to have polite conversation at their wine-and-cheese functions.''
 Over lunch Mr. Moore seemed more than polite enough. In private conversation he speaks slowly and softly, broken up by an occasional Fat Albert laugh. Wearing a black Ralph Lauren T-shirt under a dark jacket, his head bowed over his plate of pasta, he could pass for a kindly Jesuit, even while trying to dab at the tomato sauce spilled down his front. 
 And for someone who has often been accused of playing fast and loose with facts, he seems to have an almost pathological precision about dates and specific incidents, framing sentences with, ''The first reports came across the wire on Saturday morning in Traverse City, Michigan'' and ''Dana Milbank wrote about this on Page 10 of The Washington Post ... .'' 
 He decided, long before last year's financial meltdown, that his next project would focus on what he saw as the central thread of his films: how greed and short-term thinking were undermining the middle-class life he knew growing up. And he decided to reverse his usual filmmaking process by making the argument first, then collecting his material.
 ''While I was making 'Sicko' I began to think: 'I've been doing this for 20 years. How many more films can I make when I'm talking about the car industry in this film or Halliburton in that film or the insurance industry in this film?' And I was thinking, 'What if this would be your last documentary?' Well, I wouldn't pull my punches.''
 As much as Mr. Moore sometimes plays a comic-book version of class warrior -- Left-Thing vs. the Republic of Fear! -- his politics are not grounded in class as much as in Roman Catholicism. Growing up in Michigan, he attended parochial school and intended to go into the seminary, inspired by the priests and nuns who, at least until Pope John Paul II, inherited a long tradition of social justice and activism in the American church. 
 ''The nuns always made a point to take us to the Jewish temple for Passover seders,'' he said. ''They wanted to make it clear that the Jews had nothing to do with putting Jesus up on the cross.''
 Along with a moral imperative, Catholicism also gave a method. Mr. Moore idolized the Berrigan brothers, the radical priests who introduced street theater into their activism, for example, mixing their own napalm to burn government draft records. Their actions were a form of political spectacle that, conceptually, is Marxist -- workers seizing means of production and all that -- and it influenced some ofMr. Moore's best-remembered stunts.
 The central conceit in ''Roger & Me'' was his futile pursuit to interview the chief executive of General Motors, Roger Smith. And in ''Sicko,'' he took ailing rescue workers from ground zero to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, because detainees there were receiving excellent health care. ''Although I'm trying to say things I want to say politically, I primarily want to make an entertaining movie,'' he said. ''If the art of the movie doesn't work, the politics won't get through.''
 To make sure the politics do get through, Mr. Moore invokes the privileges of much-better-financed producers and does market research. Jim Czarnecki, a documentary filmmaker who has worked with Mr. Moore for years, remembers screening ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' on eight consecutive Tuesday nights for select audiences, gathering feedback and recutting the film.
 ''We discovered what was clear, not clear, what worked and what didn't,'' he said, adding, ''Michael works hard to craft his movies for a large audience.''
 Mr. Moore's obsessive reworking produces results, but can also exasperate his collaborators. The day before the screening of ''Capitalism'' he went to his sister Anne Moore, who produced the film, with a new idea for cutting a scene. She looked slightly exhausted in telling the story, then added, ''but it was a good idea.''
 David Johnson, who produced ''Michael Moore Live!,'' a one-man London stage show which ran in 2002, said that Mr. Moore would often rewrite the script in the morning, then deliver the new version ''word perfect'' that night. He added: ''There is a frantic element that surrounds him. Obviously, it's something he requires. It is emotional and sometimes spins out of control. But he's also the first to apologize and that's unique.'' 
 Mr. Moore admits that his frenetic work habits -- in addition to the documentaries, he's written three best sellers -- are also therapeutic. In the last few years his personal mood has wavered between what he calls ''passive despair'' and outright anger. The work, especially the humor writing, he said, keeps him ''from finding out what's on the other side of that anger.''
 THERE ARE FEWER of the trademark Moore stunts in ''Capitalism,'' a sprawling 126-minute film that tries to connect data points across the economy, including the bailout, financial deregulation, privatized juvenile detention centers, the collapse of the American auto business (again), ''dead peasant'' insurance policies, Goldman Sachs's influence in Washington, the crash of a commuter jet in Buffalo, the Florida condo market and an old-fashioned sit-in at a Chicago door-and-window factory. 
 In part the stunts are harder to pull off for a famous, rabble-rousing filmmaker. But at the movie's heart is the original footage Mr. Moore's shooters made of workers inside the occupied factory in Chicago (his was the only crew let in during the five-day strike) and of homeowners being evicted. Mr. Moore retains an ear for ordinary speech that is uninflected by the exigencies of morning talk shows or ''SportsCenter'' cliches. 
 In one scene the neighbor of an evicted family in Florida argues with the enforcer sent from the bank, telling him if too many people are locked out, ''the value of everybody else's house goes down.'' That, on a more vast scale, is precisely the rationale offered by the White House for the $700 billion bailout of Wall Street. 
 ''One of my favorite lines in the film, and I hoped it would provoke a reaction,'' Mr. Moore said. ''The bailout in and of itself -- the idea of protecting people's pension funds and hoping that everything doesn't go down a rathole -- that's not a bad thing. It's the way it was done.''
 When it comes to the question of how exactly it should be done, the film gets a little blurred. Although he likes to quote Scripture, saying that the rich man will have a hard time entering into the kingdom of heaven, Mr. Moore doesn't offer a specific marginal tax rate that might at least inch him along. Instead ''Capitalism'' tugs on the familiar autobiographical thread of Mr. Moore, the product of a middle-class upbringing spurned by the corporation and the system his family helped to build. 
 This theme -- class warfare as unrequited love -- runs through almost all his films, starting with ''Roger & Me,'' which can be read as a kind of screwball comedy with Roger Smith in the Irene Dunne role of unattainable idol. As Iggy Pop sings in the ''Capitalism'' theme song, a version of ''Louie, Louie'' that was specifically created for the film, ''the capitalists just break your heart.''
 After the screening in Toronto, Mr. Moore took questions from audience members eager to know exactly what they should do. He offered some broad suggestions, stressing that he worried that Democrats in the United States would begin to abandon Mr. Obama (whom he enthusiastically supports) now that the election is won. 
 Pushed harder on Mr. Obama, a gradualist seemingly out of step with Mr. Moore's radical agenda of scrapping capitalism, Mr. Moore only said that he hoped for the best, but feared the influence of Goldman Sachs on the administration. Finally, he just shrugged. 
 ''You know,'' he said, ''the next movie may be about him.''

HEADLINE: Strange New World

BYLINE: By JEANETTE WINTERSON. 
Jeanette Winterson's latest novel is ''The Stone Gods.''

 BODY:
THE YEAR OF THE FLOOD
 By Margaret Atwood
 434 pp. Nan A. Talese / Doubleday. $26.95
 Fatefulness about the survival of the species is not new. Religious thinking has end-time built in, and for most of our sentient life on the planet humankind has been predominantly religious. That has changed in Westernized countries, but only relatively recently, and alongside advances in scientific knowledge. Our new pessimism no longer depends on a deity to wipe out this wicked world. Since the Manhattan Project, we have learned how to do it ourselves.
 Nuclear, ecological, chemical, economic -- our arsenal of Death by Stupidity is impressive for a species as smart as Homo sapiens. Yet fire or flood may belong to an Armageddon whose awful grandeur may not be our fate. Plague -- unlovely, heroic, unstoppable, might well get us first. That's what happens in Margaret Atwood's new novel, ''The Year of the Flood,'' her latest excursion into what's sometimes called her ''science fiction,'' though she prefers ''speculative fiction.'' If we have to have a label, that's a better one, since part of Atwood's mastery as a writer is to use herself as a creative computer, modeling possible futures projected from the available data -- in human terms, where we are now. 
 Her 1985 novel ''The Handmaid's Tale'' imagines a United States taken over by God-fearing fundamentalists sick of democracy and civil rights, especially women's rights. Atwood is chillingly brilliant in depicting the slick twists a technology of freedom can take, shifting ease of access -- in this case to financial records and personal information -- into theft and surveillance. Overnight, the bank accounts of every woman are transferred to her nearest male relative.
 In ''Oryx and Crake,'' published in 2003, Atwood leads us through a bioengineered world where a new species, the Crakers, has been invented by a Dr. Frankenstein figure -- Crake -- and given a chance at remaking the world, thanks to a near decimation of the human race, also masterminded by Crake. At the end of that novel, we are left in a clearing in the woods with a tribe of bewildered Crakers, a few old-fashioned human beings and Jimmy the Snowman, who's wondering whether he should finish off the last of his own kind and leave the whole rotten and rotting show to the nonviolent, unclothed human herbivores cell-created by his best friend, Crake.
 That end is also the end of ''The Year of the Flood.'' Here Atwood has brilliantly re-told her own tale, through other mouths and focusing on different details, showing us how the kids Jimmy and Glenn become the Snowman and Crake, and how an end -- or the End -- can happen in the name of a new beginning.
 The Waterless Flood has long been predicted by God's Gardeners, a back-to-nature cult founded by Adam One. Its members live simply and organically, sing terrible hymns, have no dress sense and peddle a bolted-together theology, difficult to think about if you think at all. With values diametrically opposed to those of the ruling CorpSEcorps, the Gardeners aren't ''the answer,'' but at least they've asked enough questions to avoid a life of endless shopping and face-lifts.
 The Gardeners sometimes do evangelical work in the mean streets, known as the pleeblands, or picket a fast-food joint like SecretBurgers because it's wrong to eat anything with a face. At SecretBurgers they rescue a young woman named Toby from the murderous clutches of her sex-crazed boss, Blanco the Bloat, and it's Toby who is one of the central characters in the post-plague part of the story. As a Gardener, Toby rises to the position of Eve Six, in charge of bees, herbs and potions, but Blanco never stops pursuing her, and to save herself, and the group, she receives a new identity in the health spa AnooYoo. Recovering from plastic surgery, she avoids the deadly wipeout germ of the plague.
 Less cosmetically, but just as effectively, Ren, a pole dancer at a local sex joint called Scales and Tails, is in an isolation room after a bloody attack by a punter, so she too misses the bio-bug. The women's past and present stories alternate and intertwine, bringing to life the world they must survive in -- a world where pigs have human brain tissue and sheep are bred with human hair in different colors, silver and purple being hot hits for whole-head implants, providing you don't mind smelling of lamb chops when it rains. 
 My favorite Atwood genetic invention is the liobam -- a cross between a lion and a lamb, engineered by a lunatic fringe religious group that's tired of waiting for the prophecy of the lion lying down with the lamb to come true. Their own breed has curly golden hair and long, sharp canines, and will look at you very gently while it rips your throat out -- which is pretty much the metaphor for the world of lethal paternalism created by CorpSEcorps.
 The sensitive CorpSEcorps elite boy Glenn, who becomes Crake, starts out as a teenage sympathizer for the Gardeners but is too seduced by his own brainpower to trust nature. Like his friend Jimmy, Glenn doesn't know how to love, and the awkward devotion he feels for the girl he calls Oryx is not returned. Atwood is very good at showing, without judging, what happens when human beings (usually men) cannot love. In the worst of them, like Blanco the Bloat, brutality and sadism take over. In the better of them, like Crake, a utopian desire for perfectability replaces the lost and lonely self. Crake designs out love and romance because he wants to design out the pain and confusion of emotion.
 In this strangely lonely book, where neither love nor romance changes the narrative, friendship of a real and lasting and risk-taking kind stands against the emotional emptiness of the money/sex/power/consumer world of CorpSEcorps, and as the proper antidote to the plague-mongering of Crake and Jimmy, for whom humankind holds so little promise. As ever with Atwood, it is friendship between women that is noted and celebrated -- friendship not without its jealousies but friendship that survives rivalry and disappointment, and has a generosity that at the end of the novel allows for hope. Atwood believes in human beings, and she likes women. It is Toby and Ren who take the novel forward from the last page, not the genetically engineered new humans.
 Atwood is funny and clever, such a good writer and real thinker that there's hardly any point saying that not everything in the novel works. Why should it? A high level of creativity has to let in some chaos; just as nobody would want the world as engineered by Crake, nobody needs a factory-finished novel. The flaws in ''The Year of the Flood'' are part of the pleasure, as they are with human beings, that species so threatened by its own impending suicide and held up here for us to look at, mourn over, laugh at and hope for. Atwood knows how to show us ourselves, but the mirror she holds up to life does more than reflect -- it's like one of those mirrors made with mercury that gives us both a deepening and a distorting effect, allowing both the depths of human nature and its potential mutations. We don't know how we will evolve, or if we will evolve at all. ''The Year of the Flood'' isn't prophecy, but it is eerily possible.

HEADLINE: Tuna Town In Japan Sees Falloff Of Its Fish

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: OMA, Japan 

 BODY:
Fishermen here call it ''black gold,'' referring to the dark red flesh of the Pacific bluefin tuna that is so prized in this sashimi-loving nation that just one of these sleek fish, which can weigh a half-ton, can earn tens of thousands of dollars.
 The cold waters here once yielded such an abundance of bluefin, with such thick layers of tasty rich fat, that this tiny wind-swept seaport became Japan's answer to California's Napa Valley or the Brie cheese-producing region of France: a geographic location that is nearly synonymous with one of its nation's premier foods. 
 So strong is the allure of Oma's tuna that during the autumn fishing season, tens of thousands of hungry visitors descend on this remote fishing town, located on the northernmost tip of Japan's main island of Honshu. On a recent Sunday, dozens of tourists, filmed by no fewer than three local television crews, crowded into an old refrigerated warehouse on a pier where Oma's mayor presided over a ceremony to slice up a 220-pound bluefin into brick-size blocks for sale. 
 ''This is a pleasure you can only have a few times in your life,'' said Toshiko Maki, 51, a homemaker from suburban Tokyo, as she popped a ruby-red cube of sashimi into her mouth.
 But now the town faces a looming threat, as the number of tuna has begun dropping precipitously in recent years because of overfishing. This has given Oma another, less celebrated distinction, as a community that has stood out by calling for greater regulation of catches in a nation that has adamantly opposed global efforts to save badly depleted tuna populations.
 Just a decade or two ago, each boat here could routinely catch three or four tuna a day, fishermen say. Now, they say Oma's entire fleet of 30 to 40 boats is lucky to bring in a combined total of a half-dozen tuna in a day.
 The problem, they say, is that all the fish are being taken by big trawlers that come from elsewhere in Japan, or farther out to sea from Taiwan or China. Some of these ships even use helicopters to spot schools of tuna, which they scoop up in vast nets or catch en masse with long lines of baited hooks. According to local newspapers, there have been repeated incidents of small fishing boats from Oma and other ports intentionally cutting such trawl lines.
 ''I'm furious at Tokyo's bureaucrats for failing to protect our tuna,'' said Hirofumi Hamahata, 69, the president of the Oma fishermen's co-op, who has worked as a commercial fisherman since age 15. ''They don't lift a finger against the industrial fishing that just sweeps the ocean clean.''
 Such flares of temper are rare in normally reserved Japan, and especially in conservative fishing communities like this one. But this is a town fiercely proud not only of its tuna, but also of how it catches them: in two-man open boats, using hand-held lines and live bait like squid.
 Mr. Hamahata described catching tuna in this traditional way as a battle of wits against a clever predator that he called ''the lion of the sea.'' After hooking one, the contest becomes a battle of strength: he said it typically took one or two hours to pull a big tuna close enough to the boat that it could be stunned with an electric charge. 
 In one Hemingwayesque battle, Mr. Hamahata said he fought for 12 hours with a huge bluefin that finally broke free.
 Despite such difficulties, Oma's fishermen said they preferred their generations-old fishing method because it allowed them to catch just large, adult fish, leaving the smaller young ones to sustain local stocks.
 Fishing experts say the overfishing is a result of a broader failure by the Tokyo authorities to impose effective limits on catches in its waters. Indeed, Japan, which consumes some 80 percent of the 60,000 tons of top-grade tuna caught worldwide, has lobbied hard against efforts to limit tuna catches, such as are now being proposed by European countries for the Atlantic Ocean.
 ''There are too many entrenched interests whose objective is maximizing profit, not sustainable use,'' said Masayuki Komatsu, an expert on the fishing industry at Tokyo's National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies.
 In Oma, catching a big tuna has become rare enough -- and the market price high enough -- to be cause for celebration. On a recent evening, family members rushed to the pier to greet one boat that had caught a 410-pound bluefin, whose tear-shaped body had to be hoisted off the boat's deck with a forklift. 
 Moving quickly to gut and ice the fish to preserve its value, workers from the fishing co-op presented the footlong dorsal fin as a trophy to the captain's wife, who said it was the first catch in 10 days. The workers said the fish would fetch more than $10,000 at Tokyo's Tsukiji Fish Market.
 ''Catching a tuna is like winning the lottery,'' said another fisherman, 23-year-old Takeshi Izumi, who said his boat had yet to catch a tuna this season.
 To maximize prices, Oma has registered its name as a trademark that can be used only with tuna brought ashore here. This has made Oma a brand that is gaining recognition even outside Japan. In March, a sushi chef from Hong Kong paid some $50,000 to buy half of a 280-pound Oma bluefin.
 The prices can be even higher: In 2001, a Japanese buyer paid a record $220,000 for a 444-pound Oma bluefin.
 One unfortunate side effect, said the town's mayor, Mitsuharu Kanazawa, was that few of Oma's 6,200 residents can now afford their own town's tuna. However, he said the fish have been a boon to the town's economy, pumping in some $15 million a year from fishing and tuna-related tourism. 
 After a popular 2000 TV drama featured Oma, the town increased tourism by starting a three-day tuna festival every year in mid-October, which now draws 15,000 visitors a day, as well as hordes from the Japanese media, Mr. Kanazawa said. 
 ''We Japanese have a weakness for brands,'' said Ryuko Nishimura, 43, a homemaker from Kuroishi, a three-hour drive away. ''It makes the tuna taste two or three times more delicious.''
 But with tuna now in danger of perhaps disappearing, the mayor said the town was struggling to find another local product to keep the tourists coming.
 ''We tried kelp and abalone,'' Mr. Kanazawa said, ''but nothing has the appeal of tuna.''

HEADLINE: The Insured, Too, Are Failed by the Health System

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Body Count at Home,'' by Nicholas D. Kristof (column, Sept. 13):
 While the story retold by Mr. Kristof about Nikki White's death from lupus is heartbreaking, his conclusion gives the impression that what's most broken about our failing American health system is the inability of so many to obtain health insurance. 
 Each day there are countless unconscionable incidents involving people with insurance coverage who are denied care when they suddenly need it, or who are unable to get the necessary services or medications to treat their conditions. 
 Being insured delivers false comfort to those whose level of coverage leaves them vulnerable to categorical exclusions of care, unaffordable deductibles and co-payments, and skyrocketing premiums.
 More than half of all personal bankruptcies in the United States are due to medical expenses, and three-quarters of these are experienced by the insured. Mandating that we all buy coverage will not correct the perverse economic incentives that have turned our system into one that views the cost of providing care as a ''medical loss.''
 Ted Herman Vice President, Communications Hudson Health Plan Tarrytown, N.Y., Sept. 15, 2009
 To the Editor: 
 Despite his commendable focus on the American health care situation, Nicholas D. Kristof is off base when he drops the name of my country in the health care context. He has done so twice now, each time with the rhetorical effect of producing a derisory sort of punch line. (''Worse than Slovenia? Time to act!'') 
 In ''The Body Count at Home,'' he wrote, ''No wonder we spend so much on medical care, and yet have some health care statistics that are worse than Slovenia's.'' 
 Those with even a cursory knowledge of Slovenia will recognize how ludicrous it is to position the country as a seeming synonym for backwardness. Allow me to correct such a preconception by pointing out that only six countries in the world have lower under-5 mortality rates than Slovenia. Further, every citizen is medically insured there.
 This is not to say Slovenian health care is perfect, of course, or to deny that there is room for improvement. But in this, I'm sure Mr. Kristof will agree, we are not alone.

HEADLINE: Facts and the Financial Crisis

 BODY:
The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, created by Congress to examine the causes of the crisis, held its first public meeting last week. In his opening remarks, the chairman, Phil Angelides, a former California state treasurer, likened the group's potential impact to that of the Pecora hearings in the 1930s, which examined the stock market crash of 1929 and led to transformational changes in banking, investing and financial regulation. 
 And yet, last week's meeting was oddly inauspicious, feeding doubts about the commission's ability to realize that potential. 
 For starters, the meeting was a long time coming, and thin on substance. It has been four months since Congress passed a law authorizing the commission and two months since lawmakers selected its 10 commissioners -- six chosen by the Democratic leadership and four by the Republican leadership. 
 Just days before the meeting, Mr. Angelides announced the hiring of the commission's executive director, Thomas Greene, a chief assistant attorney general in California. Mr. Greene has performed ably in various cases, including those involving antitrust issues against Microsoft and civil prosecutions of Enron. But he will need to hire tough Wall Street experts to assist him. He may also find himself hobbled by restraints on his subpoena power, because the commission rules, written by Congress, require that Democrats and Republicans on the commission agree before subpoenas can be issued. 
 The meeting itself was mainly prepared statements from commission members, describing the group's mission and expressing their commitment to a full investigation. In their more enlightening moments, some of the commissioners previewed specific concerns to pursue -- like the role in the crisis of derivatives, of Fannie Mae and other too-big-to-fail institutions, and of the Federal Reserve and other regulators. 
 But the real work -- gathering documents and taking testimony from financial executives and government officials -- will not start before November. Public hearings are not expected until December. A final report is due to Congress on Dec. 15, 2010. 
 Is that slow start an early sign of drift? Does it reflect the apparent ambivalence of lawmakers to rein in the banks? 
 To dispel such questions, the commission will have to start now to mount a rigorous inquiry that explains both the underlying and immediate causes of the crisis. Stretching back decades, which beliefs and policies -- especially deregulatory efforts -- allowed for the tremendous growth of finance as a share of the economy, and for the increasing reliance on debt as the engine of economic growth? 
 Providing historical context will be easy compared with investigating more recent events, because near-term events involve people still in power. In the run-up to the crisis, what did regulators, particularly the Federal Reserve, know and do in response to unconstrained lending? What were their thoughts about the way banks and investors worldwide increasingly disregarded risk?
 Publicly, they did not act to curb the excesses. But internally, was there contrary analysis or dissent? Were there chances to take another course that we may learn from now in hindsight?
 Answers to these questions are in files that are not public and in the heads of the people in positions of responsibility at the time. The commission must be aggressive in its pursuit of documents and unflinching in taking testimony at even the highest levels of government and business.
 The commission must also trace the facts and circumstances that connect the implosions of Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Lehman Brothers and the American International Group. What were the terms of the derivatives contracts between A.I.G. and its counterparties, like Goldman Sachs, which received $12.9 billion via the A.I.G. bailout? What was revealed in the meetings that resulted in the A.I.G. bailout and in the subsequent $700 billion taxpayer-provided lifeline for financial firms? Why was Citigroup, a failing institution last year, treated more favorably than A.I.G.? And to what extent have the survivors of the crash, like Goldman and JPMorgan Chase, benefited from cheap financing, loan guarantees and other government interventions? 
 In the months since the inquiry commission was created last May, other significant efforts have been undertaken to get to the bottom of the financial crisis.
 Judge Jed Rakoff of the United States District Court in New York has demanded that Bank of America and the Securities and Exchange Commission be more forthcoming about the identities of bank officials who may have withheld from shareholders important information relating to BofA's purchase of Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial crisis. 
 Bloomberg News has filed a Freedom of Information suit to learn the identities of banks that took emergency funding from the Fed, the amounts and the collateral they offered. The judge in that case has told the Fed to release the names; the Fed has until the end of September to appeal the decision. The Fed should not appeal. The truth will come out, and in the end, the nation will be better for it. 
 The commission can take its cue from those efforts. Probing questions, asked in order to advance the public interest and with a goal of ever greater transparency, are what Americans have a right to expect -- and what the commission, if it so chooses, can deliver.

HEADLINE: How Did Economists Get It So Wrong?

 BODY:
 How Did Economists Get It So Wrong?'' offers a refreshing, critical assessment of the academic profession of economics and how it missed the recent economic collapse. While addressing the standard textbook issues in mainstream economics, Krugman seems oblivious to one area of the field that has warned of deep, cyclical crises in capitalism since its inception: Marxist economics. You do not have to believe in revolution or the proletarian struggle to appreciate the centrality of secular crises for this economic tradition. Marx was wrong about a lot of things, but he seems to have been on target when pointing out at least two problems: the severity and depth of periodic crises and the rise of financial speculation. 
 DIEGO VON VACANO Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences Stanford University, Palo Alto, Calif.
 Paul Krugman cites a concern for mathematical elegance over truth and reliance on efficient market theory as reasons for economists underestimating the instability of markets. But similar arguments could be made about the Keynesianism that Krugman advocates. In its heyday, Keynesianism included elegant mathematical models that demonstrated markets are inherently unstable and had its own version of an efficiency theory, only it was government that was efficient; a wise and good government could fine-tune the economy through appropriate fiscal policy. 
 Krugman doesn't pay enough attention to the approximately 20-year period of good macroeconomic performance known as the ''Great Moderation.'' He also ignores ''bubbles'' that didn't lead to recessions. Something is at work besides irrational financial markets. The market system works well most of the time. Perhaps a key factor affecting whether a shock to the system or even ''irrational exuberance'' leads to a serious recession is the level of buffer stocks held by households and firms. When savings exist and debt levels are not inordinately high, the economy adjusts to a shock. But when debt levels are high and savings low, the bursting of bubbles in houses and equities can turn into a severe recession. The crucial question now is whether taking on huge levels of government debt is the best way back to sustainable growth.
 JOHN LUNN Robert W. Haack Professor of Economics 
 MARTHA LABARGE Assistant Professor of Accountancy Hope College Holland, Mich.
 Paul Krugman's essay comes up short in a subtle but important way. His Keynesian prescription requires a benevolent, efficient and affordable government as our doctor. But public servants are not more high-minded, rational and unselfish than the private actors who supposedly got us into this mess. Our politicians and bureaucrats trade the private sector's profit motive for an incentive to accumulate budget dollars and power. Empire building takes the place of profit generation, without the threat of competition to disrupt it.
 While a well-oiled technocracy might smooth our peaks and valleys in Krugman's Keynesian ideal, the reality is that self-interested capitalists provide the most likely path to prosperity. Despite their flaws, free-market economists understand this best.
 DAN RIFF Denver
 As usual, Paul Krugman is interesting and insightful, but his explanation of how macroeconomists got it so wrong is badly lacking because it ignores one important element of meaningful economic analysis -- the part represented by the work of institutional economists like John Kenneth Galbraith. Behavioral economics has been a step forward by drawing attention to the herdlike potential in human behavior that contradicts one of the key assumptions of ''neoclassical'' economics. But unlike institutional economists like Galbraith, Krugman said nothing in his article about the importance of social structures (e.g., executive-pay incentives based on long-term versus short-term performance, degree of managerial versus investor control of corporations, etc.) that encourage or discourage destabilizing herd behavior.
 I was surprised and disappointed by this: Krugman has shown elsewhere that he is well aware of the importance of these structures; they will have to become a part of economic theory if it is to be of any value in the real world.
 GERHARD LENSKI Emeritus Professor of Sociology University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, N.C.
 Paul Krugman's wonderful analysis of the failure of contemporary economists to heed the lessons of history makes me mindful of a lesson I learned as an operations-research student at the Naval Postgraduate School some years ago. While trying to develop a mathematical model to explain the complexities of naval warfare, I realized that it was simply impossible to develop the perfect model. No amount of mathematical artistry would be sufficient to explain the virtually infinite number of variables in human behavior. The great lesson for all those who use mathematical models as tools to understand the real world is that models provide insights, not answers. I hope our economics community has finally learned that lesson -- at least until they forget it again during the next boom cycle.
 CAPT. THOMAS R. BEALL U.S. Navy, retired Middletown, R.I.
 Paul Krugman's trenchant analysis of our current economic malaise unequivocally demonstrates why the efficient-market theory is the god that failed -- and must never be resurrected. Human beings are not always rational decision-makers. And an unfettered marketplace -- especially one with rampant financial deregulation, trickle-down tax cuts and corporate excess -- cannot adequately respond to insufficient aggregate demand in the short run. Nor can monetary policy alone rectify the ills of a rapidly plummeting economy.
 Unlike Alan Greenspan and Ronald Reagan -- who fell under the ideological spell of Ayn Rand -- John Maynard Keynes was an economic realist.
 Though Keynesianism is far from infallible and must be reconfigured for the 21st century, it points to a brighter and more productive macroeconomic future than the fairy-tale visions espoused by the free-market school.
 ROSARIO A. IACONIS Adjunct Professor of Economics Briarcliffe College Bethpage, N.Y.
 In ''How Did Economists Get It So Wrong?'' Paul Krugman advocates replacing today's economic view, discredited by the recession, with Keynesianism, discredited by a past recession. Instead, Krugman should ask why recessions begin in the first place and if there is an approach capable of addressing that.
 Precisely as Krugman asserts, markets do not always allocate resources smoothly. Today's ''too big to fail'' financial sector is an example. Radical change was in order; however, the cost of an effective solution was too high, and the bank bailout pushed the problem into the future. Instead of trying to replace one discredited economic view with another, let's see if we can find ways to soften recessionary impacts while still allowing them to solve market problems. Hopefully in the process we can eliminate the need for a future recession that is too big to fail.
 GARY WELLS Seneca, S.C.
 Paul Krugman's essay is excellent, as far as it goes. However, it ends at the edge of the salt water. Krugman does not raise the subject of international trade. Yet for years salt-water and fresh-water economists have all written and preached of the benefits of free trade. Larry Summers, for example, has endorsed the view that trillions of dollars of benefits would accrue by opening international markets. I was part of the chorus for more than 10 years as a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
 Here, too, I believe economists got it wrong. The United States' economic situation has been harmed, not helped, by the push for free trade. America's skilled workers and middle class are undoubtedly much worse off thanks to the market-opening measures negotiated over the past three decades at the encouragement of almost all economists. The losses have occurred because the theoretical benefits projected by economists are blocked again and again by our trade partners.
 Unfortunately, few economists are willing to offer the same detailed criticism of trade policies that Krugman has offered of macroeconomics.
 PHILIP K. VERLEGER JR. David Mitchel/EnCana Professor Haskayne School of Business University of Calgary Calgary, Alberta
 In trying to answer the question ''How Did Economists Get It So Wrong?'' Paul Krugman needsto go farther than questioning the concepts of efficient markets and rational economic behavior. Economic theory now needs to recognize that we have entered a different age of global markets and competing economies. In this era, many countries are driven by central planning and collaborative behavior, which is very different than that envisioned in the models of most economic theorists. At this time, traditional free-market economies like that of the United States may be at a severe disadvantage. When currencies are manipulated, companies subsidized and environmental costs ignored, the ''state of macro'' calls for a newer and broader perspective.

HEADLINE: 'Orphans' Home Cycle,' A Horton Foote Feast

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES

 BODY:
IT'S going to be a great season for Horton Foote's many fans.
 When Mr. Foote died in March, he was in the middle of big career developments. ''Dividing the Estate,'' his new play about a battling family, had just won a Tony Award nomination for best play and was returning to Hartford Stage, with its Broadway cast largely intact.
 But behind the scenes, Mr. Foote, 92, was busy wrapping up a masterwork: a three-part, nine-play cycle that would take Horace Robedaux, the character inspired by his father, from the turn of the 20th century to the brink of the Depression, from childhood to maturity. 
 Six months later, that work, ''The Orphans' Home Cycle,'' has arrived at Hartford Stage, all nine hours or so of it. Not that this is completely new material. True, five of the nine plays have never been staged before, but two of those were produced for television and a third was made into a feature film. Only ''Roots in a Parched Ground'' and ''Cousins'' are being presented for the first time. But most of the others are condensed adaptations of the original plays, so in a sense they are new works. Each forms one of the three plays, or acts, that make up each cycle.
 Part 1 of the cycle, ''The Story of a Childhood,'' begins with ''Roots in a Parched Ground,'' in which young Horace loses one parent to economic problems, another to a violent storm. In the second act, ''Convicts'' (made into a 1991 film starring Robert Duvall, James Earl Jones and Lukas Haas), 13-year-old Horace stays on a Gulf Coast plantation worked by cheap convict labor. In ''Lily Dale,'' Horace heads for Houston to bond with his sister. (In the 1986 Off Broadway production of this play, Molly Ringwald played Lily.)
 ''The Story of a Marriage,'' Part 2 of the cycle, begins with ''The Widow Claire.'' Matthew Broderick and Hallie Foote (the playwright's daughter) starred in the New York production of this play, in which Horace moves into a boardinghouse and falls in love with an older woman. In ''Courtship,'' Horace becomes secretly engaged to Elizabeth, a young girl growing up in a repressive home. And in ''Valentine's Day,'' set during World War I, Horace and Elizabeth await the birth of their first child and witness a friend's mental breakdown.
 The cycle ends with ''The Story of a Family.'' In ''1918,'' the first act in this section, the worldwide flu epidemic strikes Horace and Elizabeth's home. In the second, ''Cousins,'' Horace deals with hard times and his mother's illness in the Roaring Twenties. In ''The Death of Papa,'' the final work in the cycle, Grandfather dies. (In the 1999 Hartford Stage production of this play, Horace Jr. was played by Frankie Muniz, then 13.)
 The ensemble cast for ''The Orphans' Home Cycle'' includes Annalee Jefferies, who recently starred in ''The Year of Magical Thinking'' at TheaterWorks; Devon Abner, who played Son in ''Dividing the Estate''; Pamela Payton-Wright, who was in a recent New York production of ''Vieux Carre''; and Lucas Caleb Rooney, who was in ''The Country Girl'' on Broadway last year.
 Bill Heck, making his Hartford Stage debut, stars as the adult Horace Robedaux. Maggie Lacey, who was Son's schoolteacher fiancee in ''Dividing the Estate,'' plays Horace's wife, Elizabeth.
 Of course ''Orphans'' would not be a real Horton Foote event without Hallie Foote. She plays Elizabeth's mother, Mary Vaughn. And James DeMarse plays Ms. Foote's husband, as he did in ''Dividing the Estate.''
 For theatergoers who want to see the cycle in its entirety, all three parts will be performed in all-day marathons on Oct. 17 and 24, beginning at 11 a.m. The three parts will also be presented on successive evenings: Oct. 20, 21 and 22. But each part can stand alone. 
 The production moves to New York on Nov. 5, where it will lead off the Signature Theater Company's 2009-10 season, devoted to Mr. Foote's work. 
 ''The Orphans' Home Cycle,'' by Horton Foote, is at Hartford Stage, 50 Church Street, through Oct. 24. Marathon performances (Parts 1, 2 and 3 in one day) are on Oct. 17 and 24; sequential nightly performances are on Oct. 20, 21 and 22. A single presentation of Part 1 is on Oct. 16; individual Part 2 performances run through Oct. 4; Part 3 performances are Oct. 8 through Oct. 15. Information: (860) 527-5151 or hartfordstage.org.

HEADLINE: Medicare for All? 'Crazy,' 'Socialized' and Unlikely

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
NBC's ''West Wing'' is long defunct, but many of the policy issues it raised rage on. Case in point: health care.
 In one episode in 2005, the Democratic presidential nominee, played by Jimmy Smits, admitted in a debate that he was not especially happy with the health care plan he had proposed. 
 ''It's what I think can get through Congress,'' he said, adding that his ''ideal plan'' would extend Medicare to Americans of all ages. 
 ''That's crazy,'' responded his Republican opponent, played by Alan Alda.
 Talk about reality TV.
 Extending Medicare to all has seemed like a good idea to many -- except to those who call it ''socialized medicine.'' Or crazy. 
 The late Senator Edward M. Kennedyproposed Medicare for all, in 2005. And just last week former Senator George McGovern wrote an op-ed article calling for the same thing.
 ''Let's not waste time trying to reinvent the wheel,'' Mr. McGovern wrote.
 Not in This Congress
 But in the current Congress, beyond a liberal base in the House, there is little support for expanding Medicare. A bill sponsored by Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan, to establish a so-called single-payer system, essentially expanding Medicare to cover everyone, is going nowhere.
 Mr. McGovern argued that expanding Medicare would not pass because the insurance companies, which he says get a ''bonanza'' in premiums now, have too strong a grip on Congress through campaign donations.
 But even experts of diverse ideological views say expanding Medicare would be far more complicated and politically difficult than it might appear.
 For one thing, they say, Medicare reimburses doctors and hospitals at much lower rates than private insurance companies do. So, in general, health care providers oppose extending Medicare because they fear being driven out of business.
 For another, paying for such an expansion would almost certainly mean a big tax increase on the middle class. (Supporters argue that a tax increase would be somewhat neutralized by the elimination of premiums that people pay now to insurance companies.)
 Stuart Altman, a Brandeis economist who specializes in health care and who advised Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, says he is ''ideologically not uncomfortable with the idea of everyone on Medicare.''
 But he said it would be extremely disruptive.
 ''When Bill Clinton wanted to restructure the whole delivery system, what scared people so much was the potential disruption,'' he said. 
 Financing and Delivery
 People who pay private insurance premiums now are effectively subsidizing those on Medicare. Expanding Medicare would mean eliminating those premiums, he said, which would not only require a tax increase but would affect the care that all patients receive. 
 ''The financing system very much dictates the delivery system,'' he said.
 At the other end of the political spectrum, Robert E. Moffit, director of the Center for Health Policy Studies at the Heritage Foundation and a former health official in the Reagan administration, said extending Medicare would mean too much government intrusion.
 ''I don't see popular support for it beyond liberals,'' he said. ''It's a philosophical question: Do you want to give the government that kind of power?''
 As for the Money ...
 Then there is the issue of cost. Even under the current system, Medicare will eventually go broke if there are no changes in underlying medical costs. ''Adopting a single-payer system, financed like Medicare is today, would not save taxpayers money,'' Mr. Moffit said. ''Medicare currently is accumulating large debt.''
 Jonathan S. Skinner, an economics professor at Dartmouth, said there would be both positive and negative effects from expanding Medicare to all.
 ''The best thing about expanding Medicare is we can cover everybody with one sweep of the pen and cut administrative costs substantially,'' he said.
 But, he said, it would probably require a tripling in payroll taxes just to pay hospitals alone. And it would do nothing to control costs, Mr. Skinner said. 
 ''Medicare is dysfunctional,'' he said. ''It provides the wrong incentives to doctors. This would be extending that dysfunctionality to the entire population.''
 Expanding Medicare, he said, is ''the cotton candy solution: it feels really good, but after a while, your stomach starts to go 'ewwww.' ''

HEADLINE: Taking the Fun Out of Popping Pain Pills

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
HOW can you get a faster high from sustained-release pain pills like OxyContin? Let me count some of the ways.
 People have crushed them using bookends, hammers, mortars and pestles, and then snorted the powder, according to doctors who study addiction. They've chewed and swallowed fistfuls of pills. They've minced the pills in blenders, pulverized them in coffee grinders, dissolved them in water and then injected the liquid.
 Even for those of us who don't inhale, the misuse and abuse of prescription painkillers called opioids should matter because, putting moral and ethics aside for the moment, it's costing us billions of dollars. 
 In a 2008 federal survey, an estimated 4.7 million Americans were found to have used prescription pain relievers for nonmedical reasons in the previous month. The abuse of opioids now costs at least $11 billion annually in excess medical care including overdoses by adults and accidental ingestion by children, said Howard G. Birnbaum, a health economist with the Analysis Group in Boston. 
 Corporate America loves a void, and now some pharmaceutical companies are developing innovative opioids intended to deter tampering and meet the market's need.
 Some pills under development are rubberlike and harder to crush. Others contain ingredients that cause unpleasant reactions in the body, like flushing or itching, if the pill is adulterated. Taking a cue from exploding ink packets that can render stolen money unusable, some pills have an outer opioid layer and an inner core that, if tampered with, releases a drug that counters the high of the pain reliever.
 Embeda, made by King Pharmaceuticals in Bristol, Tenn., uses the last of these strategies. Scheduled to arrive in drug stores this weekend, Embeda is the first of the new so-called abuse-deterrent opioids to reach the market. But, the Food and Drug Administration has approved Embeda only as a pain reliever, not as an abuse-deterrent drug, an agency spokeswoman said.
 In a clinical study of Embeda, a majority of volunteers experienced less euphoria when they took a crushed form of the drug compared to immediate-release morphine. But the company has not yet established the real-world significance of the results.
 The hope for abuser-unfriendly pills is that they might eventually decrease abuse. The drawback is that the pills represent (bad pun alert!) a fix for only one part of a very complex problem. 
 In a sense, the new opioids reflect the ups and downs of broader efforts to overhaul health care: addressing cosmetic aspects of the problem without thoroughly grappling with systemic causes. 
 While legislators are diligently trying to figure out how to get medical coverage for millions of uninsured people, the insurance gap is just one symptom of an ailing, inefficient medical system inclined toward reactive rather than preventive care. 
 Likewise, the new pain relievers are intended to deter an important cause of opioid abuse: tampering. But, for people who simply ingest too many whole, intact pills, tamper-resistant opioids still don't reduce overdose risks, said Dr. Nathaniel P. Katz, the chief executive of Analgesic Research, a research and consulting firm in Boston that specializes in the development of pain treatments.
 (Dr. Katz and every other expert quoted here say they have worked as paid consultants for King Pharmaceuticals or conducted research sponsored by the company).
 Drug companies have promoted novel opioids as nonaddictive on other occasions and failed, said Dr. Katz, who is also a neurologist and adjunct faculty member at Tufts University medical school. He cited heroin, introduced by Bayer as a branded drug in 1898, and OxyContin, introduced by Purdue Pharma in 1995. Moreover, according to Steven D. Passik, a clinical psychologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, the advent of so-called abuse-deterrent opioids also doesn't solve another, larger problem: uneven state and physician monitoring of the legal circulation of opioids. 
 ''It does not obviate the need to put together a strategy to teach every prescriber to do Addiction Medicine 101,'' Dr. Passik said. 
 A more complete strategy to combat opioid abuse, he said, would involve asking busy primary care doctors to routinely assess how vulnerable to addiction a patient might be and to closely track patients taking opioids for chronic pain. That, of course, means some health insurers would have to step up and cover more frequent urine tests and doctor visits for those patients. 
 Meanwhile, on a regulatory level, some states should devote greater resources to online prescription monitoring systems, Dr. Katz said. These are databases used by pharmacists and doctors to check whether a patient already has multiple opioid prescriptions, a phenomenon called ''doctor shopping'' that is a red flag for drug abuse.
 On a federal level, the F.D.A. is developing a comprehensive risk management system for sustained-release opioids, an agency spokeswoman said. The program may include a certification requirement for doctors who prescribe and pharmacies that dispense those kinds of painkillers.
 But the F.D.A. could solve another slice of the problem -- people who share legally prescribed opioids with friends and family members -- if it required a patient training program, Dr. Katz said.
 If doctors verbally warned patients, '''Don't share, it's a felony, and you will kill your neighbors, friends and family,' you'd have a lot less sharing,'' he said.
 Finally, opioid abuse might be diminished if there were national standards on how to dispose of unused pills, said Sandra Comer, a professor of clinical neurobiology in the psychiatry department at Columbia University medical school.
 Often, Dr. Comer said, patients are prescribed an opioid for a month or more, but their pain subsides after a week or two. Then they have leftover pills in their medicine cabinets which are open to pilfering by, for example, college-age children or visitors. 
 But nobody knows what to do with unused pills because pharmacies won't take them back. Flushing them down the toilet is a bad idea because the chemicals can pollute the water system. Some experts recommend mixing the pills with used kitty litter or coffee grounds and throwing them in the garbage.
 Perhaps, in addition to patient training, the F.D.A. might institute a give-back program -- akin to government buy-back deals for guns -- for anybody housing an inventory of unused prescription painkillers.

HEADLINE: Wealthy Town Cools on Super-Jumbo Homes

BYLINE: By DEBORAH BALDWIN

 BODY:
NEW CANAAN, the swank little bedroom community that had a major fling with SUVs and McMansions in the go-go years, looks to be downsizing. 
 ''Priuses have become the new car to have,'' said Jeb Walker, the town's first selectman. And the market for supersize homes has all but evaporated.
 ''McMansions? The market for $4 million to $6 million houses is very quiet,'' said Jill K. Wippern, a broker at Brotherhood and Higley Real Estate. ''We have a number of them sitting empty, and as far as I know, there are very few builders that are planning to build big spec homes.''
 While expressing optimism going into the fall, Prudence Parris, a veteran agent in New Canaan, said selling prices at the high end had fallen 28 percent over the last year. As for the decade-old trend of shoe-horning giant mansions into small downtown lots, ''we are on the verge of another change,'' she said. ''The nouveaux riches, the young people who are making enough to buy houses, may now want smaller houses'' -- which here means just four bedrooms and three baths. 
 Nestled in the crook of Connecticut's southwest corner 45 miles from Manhattan, New Canaan has never been a bargain hunter's paradise. Town employees have struggled for decades to find affordable housing, and when Wall Street's readjustments rippled out last year, it was suddenly all right to express nostalgia for a time when Hummers and $2 million homes weren't the norm.
 ''When I found New Canaan, I just couldn't believe the uniqueness of this place,'' said Jack Trifero, 58, who moved here in the mid 1970s. The red-brick storefronts along Main and Elm Streets ''reminded me a bit of Europe,'' he said. ''It was definitely a community.'' 
 Mr. Trifero said he had also been delighted to discover a cache of nearly 100 midcentury modern houses built in the '50s by architects like Marcel Breuer and Philip Johnson, who at one point kept his office in the Ferrara Building, at 88 Main.
 By the '60s, the town was known as a pioneer of the four-acre single-family property zone, slapped on top of a two-acre zone. Big lots -- McProperties, you could call them -- enabled old money and avant-garde architecture to coexist. It's hard to throw rocks at glass houses, after all, when they can't be seen from the road. 
 New Canaan was also known as a haven for book editors and writers, advertising executives and transient corporate families (''I'm with I.B.M.: I've Been Moved''). ''Next station to heaven,'' it was called, but with an edge. Along with good schools and abundant tennis courts, there were more than a dozen liquor stores. Ang Lee's 1997 film ''The Ice Storm'' captured the ennui of the town's teenagers circa 1973. 
 (Disclosure: I grew up in New Canaan, and my mother still lives there.)
 More recently the ''Mad Men'' culture gave way to financial-sector families. In 2007, the population was about 19,400, the median household income $178,650, and the median home sale price $1.685 million.
 While there are fewer liquor stores, not everyone is unwinding with yoga. ''Any type of drug available in any community is present in New Canaan,'' Leon Krolikowski, the police captain, said, ''with alcohol still being the most commonly abused substance.'' 
 McMansions notwithstanding, New Canaan remains ''very quaint,'' said Robert Wyatt, 55, who moved here with his family two and a half years ago and lives within earshot of the commuter train's hourly bleats as it lumbers in. ''Everybody knows you, and the schools are excellent,'' he said. Indicating a church youth group that does volunteer work, he said, ''Of course, it's a very wealthy community, but families really give to that effort and participate.''
 Residents also help to sustain the Waveny Care Network, which has an assisted-living residence and a care center for Alzheimer's patients, with its own evocative indoor version of Elm Street. There's also Staying Put in New Canaan, a membership group that helps elderly residents live on their own, and Silver Hill Hospital, a mental health and addiction treatment center known for its rich and famous patients.
 Children are expected to conform and perform. ''It's a nice place to live,'' said Dawson Allen, 18, a recent high school graduate. But ''one downside is the focus on scores and academics. When you step outside that box, it gets iffy.''
 WHAT YOU'LL FIND
 In this Fairfield County suburb, registered Republicans outnumber Democrats 3,242 to 1,322; 93 percent of residents are white, according to a 2007 survey by the Connecticut Economic Resource Center. Stay-at-home spouses with children in tow are so common they help keep Rosie's, a cafe and carry-out on Elm, in business. ''They don't work; they work out,'' George Nammack, an owner, said fondly. 
 The 22-square-mile town has concentric circles of one-third-, one-half-, one- and two-acre lots, capped by a swath of homes on four acres or more. About 1,200 apartments and condominiums mingle with roughly 6,000 single-family homes. Standing out from the conventional crowd downtown is a brand-new ultracontemporary house at 173 Park Street, which recently went on the market for $4.95 million.
 Boutiques and chain stores line downtown streets east of the Victorian train station. Town planners are contemplating a zoning change that would invite larger businesses and medical practices to move into an area southwest of the station. Opponents of the change, including Mr. Trifero, who owns a video store on Main Street, maintain that it would dilute the village atmosphere and hurt shops like his. ''It's a delicate biosphere,'' he said.
 WHAT YOU'LL PAY
 There are about 265 houses on the market this fall, with asking prices starting at $350,000. Although overall prices are down ''at least 20 percent'' since 2006, says Jaime Sneddon, a broker at William Raveis Real Estate, and although a third of the sales he handled in the first six months of 2009 went for less than $1 million, the average is still $1.6 million.
 Agents are listing about 70 condos, priced at $300,000 to $2.3 million. Ms. Parris, who works for William Pitt Sotheby's International, noted that the sluggish market had made more houses and condos available for rent, with nearly 100 listed at prices ranging up to $25,000 a month. The Avalon complex, about a mile from the train station, has one- to three-bedroom apartments, starting at $2,199 a month. Units in the Ferrara Building downtown rent for $1,950.
 THE COMMUTE
 The rush-hour train to Grand Central Terminal takes 65 minutes; at other times, the trip takes an additional 5 to 10 minutes and requires changing in Stamford. Some commuters drive; the town is just off the Merritt Parkway.
 WHAT TO DO
 The rich assortment of public spaces includes ''God's Acre,'' a patch of green rimmed by graceful old homes and churches; Waveny Park, a 300-acre former estate with vast fields and a new swimming pool; Mead Park, with a pond and playing fields downtown; and the Nature Center, with 40 acres of well-tended paths and buildings on Oenoke Ridge. The town runs a youth center, a senior center, a well-endowed public library and a human services department with a staff of six. 
 There's also the private Silvermine Guild Arts Center, which offers classes and workshops. 
 Day trippers are drawn by the town's pastoral back roads, antiques and clothing shops, lush parks and sophisticated restaurants. Mr. Trifero offers informal driving tours of the Modernist housing stock (modernhouseman.com). Tours of the Philip Johnson Glass House requirereservations (philipjohnsonglasshouse.org). Overnighters with means book at the Roger Sherman Inn and restaurant, opposite the Nature Center and about a 15-minute walk to New Canaan's downtown (rogershermaninn.com).
 THE SCHOOLS
 ''In the last 15 years or so,'' Mr. Walker, the first selectman, said, ''the No. 1 attraction for people who have come to this town would be the school system. We have probably the best school system in the state of Connecticut, certainly one of the best in the entire New York metropolitan region.''
 There are five public schools. Among fourth-graders in 2008, 88.3 percent showed proficiency in reading, 89.6 percent in writing and 88.7 percent in math, versus 55.9, 62.9 and 60.3 percent statewide.
 The high school led the state on the SAT's last year. Averages were 599 for math, 581 for reading and 593 for writing, versus 504, 502 and 503 statewide. 
 THE HISTORY
 Established as Canaan Parish in 1731, the town switched from farming to manufacturing and became known in the early 19th century for its shoemakers. It was incorporated in 1801; 67 years later trains arrived, changing everything.

HEADLINE: In Phoenix, Weekend Users Make Light Rail a Success

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: PHOENIX 

 BODY:
Among the many detractors -- and they were multitudinous -- who thought a light rail line in this sprawling city would be a riderless $1 billion failure was Starlee Rhoades, the spokeswoman for the Goldwater Institute, a vocal critic of the rail's expense. ''I've taken it,'' Ms. Rhoades said, slightly sheepishly. ''It's useful.'' 
 She and her colleagues still think the rail is oversubsidized, but in terms of predictions of failure, she said, ''We don't dwell.'' 
 The light rail here, which opened in December, has been a greater success than its proponents thought it would be, but not quite the way they envisioned. Unlike the rest of the country's public transportation systems, which are used principally by commuters, the 20 miles of light rail here stretching from central Phoenix to Mesa and Tempe is used largely by people going to restaurants, bars, ball games and cultural events downtown. 
 The rail was projected to attract 26,000 riders per day, but the number is closer to 33,000, boosted in large part by weekend riders. Only 27 percent use the train for work, according to its operator, compared with 60 percent of other public transit users on average nationwide. 
 In some part thanks to the new system, downtown Phoenix appears to be one of the few bright spots in an otherwise economically pummeled city, which like the rest of Arizona has suffered under the crushing slide of the state's economy. The state, for years almost totally dependent on growth, has one of the deepest budget deficits in the country. 
 In the first quarter of 2009, downtown Phoenix saw its revenues increase 13 percent, while the rest of the city saw a fall of 16 percent, according to Eric Johnson, a redevelopment program manager for the city's Community and Economic Development Department. (Businesses along the line suffered greatly during the many years of construction, it should be noted.) 
 ''It is bringing us new customers who didn't have time to get in the car and drive out here before,'' said Joel Miller, a co-owner of Maizies Cafe and Bistro, which sits right along the rail line.
 The gaggle of light rail users -- including Arizona State University students, who use a line that connects its Tempe campus with the downtown campus -- have given a small part of the city a new, dense connectivity that was more or less unheard of in the city two years ago. Pub crawls along the light rail have become a weekend staple, and restaurants have seen new customers from outside the neighborhood popping in off the line for brunch on the weekends. 
 ''I think the biggest impact of the light rail is less tangible,'' said Matt Poolin, owner of Matt's Big Breakfast, a busy spot along the line, ''which is that it really improves the image and perception of Phoenix's downtown, which, although experiencing a significant renaissance in recent years, still is undergoing many improvements and changes. The light rail, largely because it is so well run and nicely appointed, is something that I think most people are really proud of and feel positive about. It is rare to hear anyone complain, despite all of the controversy.''
 The controversy was largely attached to the rail line's cost -- $1.4 billion -- and the relatively low ticket price -- $1.75 each way, with all-day passes for $3.50 and discounted rates for longer-term passes. In a city with low density, miles of suburban sprawl to the east and west of downtown and a historical lack of passion for public transportation, the rail line, one of the nation's 36 systems, seemed like a white elephant. 
 But its development over the last decade coincided with the city's expansion of the downtown convention center, the rise of the new A.S.U. campus and the booming commercial and residential real estate market that helped fuel the growth of Phoenix, downtown and elsewhere, earlier in the decade. Since 2001, when the tax for the new rail line was approved, there has been about $5 billion in public and private investment -- $3.5 billion of it private -- around the site of the light rail, the city's development agency spokesman said.
 Valley Metro, the line's operator, hopes to add 37 miles toward Glendale and northeast Phoenix, breaking ground in 2012 and completing the extensions by 2017. 
 ''We would like to see a financial audit before they expand,'' said Ms. Rhoades of the conservative Goldwater Institute, echoing those who have been critical of the expense. ''We are also proponents of paying your own way, and we think the light rail remains too subsidized.''
 The hooting of an oncoming sleek new train is a sound many in Phoenix are still becoming used to, but it has given the city a distinctly modern feel. ''There has been this pent-up demand for downtown Phoenix to grow up,'' said Nick Bastian, a real estate agent in the city who has developed a blog devoted to light rail news. ''And the light rail has given people an excuse to say let's go down there and check it out.''

CORRECTION-DATE: September 29, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the surprising success of a new light rail line in Phoenix misstated the surname of a business owner who said the train has improved the image of Phoenix's downtown. He is Matt Pool, not Poolin.
A picture caption on Sept. 20 with an article about the surprising success of a new light rail line in Phoenix misstated the name of one road shown with a train. It is Washington Street, not Washington Avenue.

HEADLINE: Connecticut: Hopeful For a New Start

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Addison Cheng has been looking for a job since spring, and he reminds one of the wistful out-of-work narrator of the Depression-era tune ''Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?'' who once built a railroad and made it run. 
 Mr. Cheng, too, was a builder of sorts. Until his division, transportation finance, was shut down, he was a vice president for risk management at G.E. Capital, evaluating $24 billion worth of financial transactions related to seaport construction. Before that he worked in Hong Kong for Fieldstone Private Capital Group, as the lead financial adviser for a $1.2 billion project for a new port at Pusan, South Korea, one of the world's busiest.
 Mr. Cheng is a tall, formally dressed middle-aged man with a graduate degree from the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins. These days, despite the frail economy that he blames for his joblessness, he is energetic and hopeful as he checks the want ads on Web sites and in newspapers and heads to his networking club in Stamford, Conn. 
 ''Some of them are quite knowledgeable and have extensive reach,'' he said of his fellow members.
 He is eager for a job, pointing out, for example, his willingness to move almost anywhere. 
 But Mr. Cheng, a onetime master builder, is also sensitive to the precariousness of job searches. He has an invariable answer to questions about his age, the date of his graduation or the age of his daughter: ''Confidential.''
 ''This is a very competitive world, and you never know who is going to read about it,'' Mr. Cheng said.

HEADLINE: Plot Lines for Hard Times

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
THE best new comedy of the season, ''Bored to Death'' on HBO, pivots on a fresh start. Jason Schwartzman plays Jonathan, a Brooklyn writer-stoner who, after his girlfriend leaves him, decides to advertise as a private eye on Craigslist. 
 ''The Good Wife,'' a CBS series inspired by the Eliot Spitzer scandal, may turn out to be the best new drama, and it too is focused on a second act; Julianna Margulies is a Silda-esque spouse who has to forge a new identity after a sex and corruption scandal drives her husband (Chris Noth) from elected office.
 Misfortune -- and renewal -- are themes that vein almost all of the new fall series, from the ABC comedy ''Cougar Town,'' which stars Courteney Cox as a newly divorced mom dating younger men, to ''Trauma,'' an NBC medical drama about paramedics, most of whom are returning to first-response work after surviving the worst rescue disaster in San Francisco history. 
 The nation is on a grimmer track, and the fall season echoes that mood shift. Luckily, bad news seems to inspire good television; this is one of the better fall seasons, particularly for comedy, in years. But while almost all of these new shows reflect the economy, they do so indirectly. Change, mostly unsought, is everywhere, but it's not imposed by a recession that has cost millions of Americans their homes and jobs and plunged the nation into unfathomable debt. The global economic slump is not a catalyst for all these transformations; it's closer to background noise. 
 Put it this way: Jules, Ms. Cox's character on ''Cougar Town'' is a successful real estate agent in Florida, a top breeding ground of the subprime mortgage fiasco. On the show Jules is desperate to find a hunk, not a home buyer. 
 The disconnect is a little odd, but it's not denial so much as deflection. Television has a tendency to absorb feelings faster than it assimilates facts. Some events are too momentous -- and depressing -- to address head-on in a sitcom or a drama. Instead writers filter them through more familiar, reassuring scenarios from the past. 
 The invasion of Iraq began in 2003, but it took almost two years for producers and writers to work up full scripts about the war. The first dramatic series about combat troops in Iraq, Steven Bochco's ''Over There,'' was shown on FX in 2005, and it was skillfully made. It was hard, however, to be entertained by a war that was still being fought, and few people watched. Even now viewers seem to prefer shows that allude to the war without dwelling on the horrors of combat, like ''NCIS'' and ''Army Wives.'' 
 The same has been true of the recession. Villains styled on Bernard L. Madoff popped up on shows like ''Law & Order'' and ''Flashpoint'' last season, and Lehman Brothers investment bankers were mocked on ''30 Rock,'' but the newest series steer away from plot lines and references that are too uncomfortably close to the headlines. 
 Hardship that is too topical is too hard to take.
 The most overt sign of the economy can be found on late-night television. Jay Leno's show at 10 speaks to a new frugality at NBC: Mr. Leno has boasted that five episodes of ''The Jay Leno Show'' cost the same as one episode of the CBS hit drama ''CSI: Miami.'' In this economy, cost cutting is as valuable to shareholders as high ratings.
 Life is not going on as usual however. A few shows posit cataclysmic forces of change, like ''V,'' a series on ABC about aliens who invade the planet by posing as friendly visitors. Mostly personal lives fall apart and careers implode, but not because of a stock market plunge. Joel McHale plays Jeff, a fast-talking lawyer on ''Community'' on NBC, who enrolls in a community college. It's a very funny show, one of the bright spots of the season, and, perhaps not coincidentally, Jeff has to reboot his career not because his practice went belly up, but because the state bar discovered he does not have a legitimate college degree.
 The exceptions are few. ''Hung,'' the HBO series that began this summer, is daring, and not just with sexual content: the story of a male prostitute uses the collapsed economy of Detroit as a backdrop. Newer shows on broadcast networks are less explicit. Patricia Heaton plays Frankie, a Midwestern wife and mother on an ABC sitcom, ''The Middle,'' who works at her town's last surviving car dealership. The state of the auto industry is acknowledged, glancingly. Frankie takes a potential customer on a test drive and brightly asks, ''Did I tell you about our recession deals?'' 
 References to that kind of reality are fleeting and light. 
 On ''Bored to Death'' Jonathan takes the case of a married man who hired a hooker and complains that he cannot afford to pay her blackmail, ''especially not in this economy.'' 
 Ted Danson is hilarious on the show as George, a sybaritic, if spacey, Manhattan magazine publisher who spends most of his time carousing and pressing Jonathan to provide companionship and drugs. George complains about free-falling circulation and advertising revenue, but not often. Mostly he frets about a sharp drop in female readership.
 ''Hank'' on ABC stars Kelsey Grammer as a self-made sporting goods tycoon who loses his fortune and slinks back to his native Virginia to start over, and even that show relies on a 1980s economic scenario. In the pilot Hank complains that the board of directors booted him out after a hostile takeover, a development that sounds more like a setback at the hand of Carl C. Icahn-ish corporate raiders than a disaster spawned by the international credit crisis.
 There is considerably less big city glamour this fall, though CW has ''The Beautiful Life,'' a Jacqueline Susann-ish melodrama about young fashion models, including a male model who bares his chest to help out with the family farm in Iowa. (The plight of the family farmer too is a throwback to a different economic era; nowadays the news focuses on Wall Street bonuses and unemployed autoworkers.)
 Even the lighter sitcoms have a gloomy undertone. ''Brothers,'' on Fox, stars the former N.F.L. player Michael Strahan as Michael, a former N.F.L. player who goes home to his family in Texas. Michael's brother, Chill (Daryl Mitchell), is in a wheelchair, paralyzed in a car accident, and their father, Coach (Carl Weathers), is showing early signs of memory loss associated with Alzheimer's. 
 ''I worry about you,'' the mother, played by C C H Pounder, says to Michael. ''There's some hard times out there in the world.'' 
 She is right to worry, because both brothers are having financial difficulties, but they are not tied to the recession. Chill's restaurant isn't doing well because it lacks pizazz, not because people in their part of Texas have stopped eating out. And though the show's creator said the plight of Mr. Strahan's character was informed by the Madoff scandal, in the pilot the N.F.L. star doesn't lose his money in a multibillion dollar Ponzi scheme. He loses it the old fashioned way: because his manager embezzled his money. 
 Hard times have brought forth a remarkably good season. It's a recession that dare not speak its name, but comes with a silver lining nonetheless.

HEADLINE: The Self-Storage Self

 BODY:
 Many of the storage-unit renters that Jon Mooallem spoke of had a common characteristic: They are, or have been, unreasonably optimistic about their economic circumstances. They expected to soon have a larger home or a second home for their belongings. Perhaps there is something quintessentially American about this sort of unbridled optimism. 
 But if there is, the proliferation of the self-storage industry, not to mention the housing market collapse and the ensuing recession, demonstrates that the definition of the American dream badly needs recalibrating. You cannot help admiring Terry Wallace, who is using his storage unit to put his life back in order, rather than clinging to the unit as a vestige of unreasonable expectations.
 MATTHEW S. MEISEL Somerville, Mass.
 Jon Mooallem's essay presents only a partial portrayal of a diverse and dynamic 45-year-old industry that has become a part of the fabric of every community in this country. It missed the heart and soul of an industry that provides needed space for people of all experiences at times when their immediate needs must be met. Mooallem also misses the role that self-storage plays in communities, when natural disasters rupture areas and facility owners donate space to families and businesses. When self-storage is seen as an extension of the family home and apartment, neighborhood businesses and municipalities, its value and essence as a truly ''American story'' can be appreciated. Unfortunately, the author did not fully explore and accurately describe the core of our industry. We are proud of the role we play in today's society.

HEADLINE: The Truth About Bureaucracy

BYLINE: By MATT BAI. 
Matt Bai writes about national politics for the magazine.

 BODY:
How successful was the recent government giveaway known as ''cash for clunkers''? The answer, I suppose, depends on how you want to look at it. In a sense, the program, which enticed jittery motorists to replace their old cars with more fuel-efficient models, was one of Washington's more obvious triumphs in its effort to defibrillate a fading economy. Thousands of Americans rushed out to buy new cars that were better for the environment; high-polluting vehicles were taken off the road forever; some auto sales surged. The program was such an instantaneous hit with consumers that it exhausted its $1 billion budget in about a week, causing confusion and turmoil until Congress finally stepped in and made another $2 billion available. Even then, Washington had to discontinue the program months ahead of schedule, like some late-night TV offer that's only good ''while supplies last.'' 
 And yet taxpayers who heard about the program in the news, who didn't need a car or who didn't get to the dealer in time, could be forgiven for wondering how the whole thing so quickly became a managerial fiasco. Why didn't lawmakers anticipate that ''cash for clunkers'' would run out of money almost immediately? Why were desperate dealers forced to float rebate checks while waiting for the government to pay the promised money? And if Washington has this much trouble administering what is essentially a $3 billion coupon for car buyers, how do we expect it to handle a nearly $1 trillion overhaul of health care?
 Such is the paradox inherent in our relationship with the state. Much of what government does actually works as it should, sometimes on a staggering scale. But inevitably, even those feats seem to come with unintended consequences and bureaucratic spider webs, and it's the frustrations that stand out. Often in our daily interactions with government, the occasional absurdities that confound or dehumanize us -- the spiteful clerk at the Department of Motor Vehicles, the I.R.S. form that might as well be written in Swahili -- overshadow the larger successes we take for granted. Perhaps that's because they remind us that there is little accountability in the system, no recourse for the wronged. No doubt 30 years of conservative attacks have also conditioned us to seize on any hint of bureaucratic failure in government, even as we let slide the similar ordeals suffered at the hands of banks and airlines whose Bangalore-based customer-service representatives are no less infuriating than any D.M.V. clerk.
 Whatever the reason, our faith in the public sector is frail, and this may well be the underlying problem confronting Democrats as they enter this last, critical phase in the health care debate. At bottom, President Obama is asking us to believe once again that government can do big things really well, and in doing so he is running up against both our shared experience and the accepted wisdom of the age. Asked in a CBS poll last month whether government would do a better or worse job providing coverage than private insurers, only 29 percent of independent voters said they trusted government more.
 Democrats should have anticipated this psychological hurdle. Last year's election, a referendum on incompetence and arrogance, indicated not some sudden urge among the electorate to revive what Bill Clinton eulogized as ''the era of big government'' so much as a desire to have a government that embodied, as Obama himself seemed to, a sense of renewal and sobriety. But in their post-election delirium, a lot of Washington Democrats embraced the idea that a liberal rebirth was under way, taking as their mandate the expansion of government rather than the rethinking of it. Obama himself has lobbied for hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending to stimulate economic growth, but apart from submitting a modest list of programs he wouldn't mind cutting (which drew howls of protest inside his own party), he has been reluctant to acknowledge the blatant bureaucratic failures of an earlier era: crumbling housing projects, misguided farm aid, highways plowed thoughtlessly through neighborhoods. Democrats have been resolute in rejecting the tired conservative mantra of limited government, but they've shown less interest in confronting the lingering image of liberal activism as invasive and chronically mismanaged.
 To this point, Obama's only real challenge to the bureaucratic status quo has been to signal that he intends to scrutinize the military's sprawling budget. When it comes to reform, this is, of course, the path of least internal resistance; Democratic interest groups aren't going to revolt if he takes a red pen to Pentagon spreadsheets. But if Obama is to prevail in the public mind on heath care (and on other expensive initiatives, like the capping and trading of carbon emissions), then he may have to risk more. Ronald Reagan, after all, won support for his antigovernment agenda because he shared the voters' sense of alienation from bureaucracy; Bill Clinton was able to add crucial programs (family leave for workers, expanded tax credits for the working poor) only after establishing that he was willing to reassess the effectiveness of some Great Society programs.
 Before he can win support for his own ambitious vision, Obama, too, may need to explicitly acknowledge the truths of the last era -- that not every program born of compassion ultimately proves ennobling, that just because you don't want to raze big government doesn't mean you shouldn't hold it accountable for its failures. Americans understand all of this already. They're more likely to trust a president who seems to understand it too.

HEADLINE: Is the Recent Rally Irrational Exuberance?

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
THE stock market has been soaring. It may have gone too far, too fast. 
 Gina Martin Adams, an equity strategist at Wells Fargo Securities, certainly thinks so. ''I would definitely tread very lightly in stocks,'' she said. At the moment, there appears to be enough momentum to keep propelling the rally forward until it ''stumbles on some speed bumps,'' she said, but she warned that stocks were no longer cheap, especially with the financial system and the economy still fragile.
 At some point, and probably fairly soon, she said, a host of fundamental problems would pull stocks back down to earth -- but, of course, she could not say when. ''There's a difference between where the market will trade and where it should trade,'' she said. 
 Stocks have certainly come a long way since their March 9 lows, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rising 58 percent in one of the most powerful upturns since the Great Depression. The recent rally, of course, followed the steepest decline in decades. The index stands at 1,068.30, still well below its October 2007 peak of 1,565.15. 
 A rebound of some sort was likely after the battering inflicted on financial markets during last year's panic. In a speech on Wall Street last week, commemorating the anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, President Obama said the most acute phase of the financial crisis was behind us. But he cautioned that the economy remained weak with rising unemployment, and that a variety of emergency government programs would continue to play a significant role in keeping the economy afloat. And Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned in remarks in Washington that while the United States was probably out of recession from a ''technical perspective,'' the economy would still ''feel'' very weak for some time. 
 Despite this grim backdrop, Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates, a stock market research firm in Westport, Conn., believes that we are in the early stages of a classic bull market that has plenty of room to run. 
 ''At any juncture during a bull market over the last 50 years you could point to economic problems,'' he said. ''The obvious problems aren't the ones that I worry about.'' In his view, the economic weakness has been documented so well that the market has already taken it into account. ''The negatives are right in front of your nose,'' he said. ''The market is looking past it.'' 
 Unless there is another shock of some unknown kind, he said, ''I don't think we'll have a correction, not at this point of the cycle. It won't happen while everyone's looking for it.'' In fact, he said he was encouraged that ''there's continuing concern'' -- including articles cautioning that the market would stumble. 
 ''Almost no one seems to accept and use the term 'bull market' '' for the current rally, Mr. Birinyi said. That implies there is plenty of cash still on the sidelines that will enter the market as it rises, he said, pushing stocks up even further.
 Where Mr. Birinyi emphasizes opportunities, however, others are focusing on the dangers. David A. Rosenberg, the former Merrill Lynch economist who is now with Gluskin Sheff and Associates in Toronto, did not expect so robust of a rally, and said that underlying structural weaknesses in the economy implied that the market was due for a big fall.
 ''What happened was that the economy received a heavy dose of medication from Uncle Sam,'' he said. ''The reality is that no one has a clue as to what the economy really looks like because it's been so dramatically sedated by the federal government. 
 ''It's as though we've received a massive tranquilizer,'' he said, ''but eventually, tranquilizers wear off.'' 
 Mr. Rosenberg said we were experiencing ''an impressive bear-market rally'' -- a short-term upturn in a ''secular'' bear market -- that still had perhaps eight or nine years to run. He advised stock investors to take profits now. Energy commodities, he said, appeared to be a better value.
 Mrs. Adams shares this bearish long-term view, even if she believes the market may continue to move upward for a while. Among the many worrisome signs she sees are Treasury yields that remain low, especially considering the enormous supply of bonds the government is auctioning regularly to finance its yawning deficit. This suggests that deflation continues to be a big worry, she said. If we lurch into deflation -- a downward price spiral -- it could devastate the economy and the markets.
 Gold has prospered recently -- it stands at about $1,007 an ounce -- partly because investors cherish it as a hedge against both inflation and deflation, said George Milling-Stanley, a managing director at the World Gold Council, an industry trade group based in London. ''One of the beauties of gold,'' he said, ''is that it just doesn't have any statistical correlation with any other market or asset class.'' There is one possible exception, he said: ''When the world's main reserve currency -- now, the dollar -- weakens, gold tends to strengthen.'' Because the consensus in currency markets is that federal borrowing will weaken the dollar, this, too, has tended to benefit gold.
 THE Federal Reserve is steering a tricky course, attempting to stave off deflation by creating enormous quantities of money and holding its benchmark short-term rate near zero. At the same time, Fed policy makers say they are preparing to reverse themselves to head off inflation. 
 Will they manage a ''Goldilocks'' strategy, just loose enough to keep the economy growing and nimble enough to head off inflation? Watch the 10-year Treasury yield closely, Mrs. Adams said. It's now 3.47 percent. If it stays low, she says, it could be a sign that the economy and stock market are in real trouble. 
 In the meantime, enjoy the rally.

HEADLINE: A Reckoning on Option ARMs

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
OPTION ARMs, a rather obscure category of adjustable-rate mortgages, may soon be plagued with foreclosures as monthly payments are adjusted higher. But homeowners in the greater New York City region, at least, will be less sharply affected by these foreclosures.
 These loans were the ultimate ''affordability'' product during the real estate boom; they permitted borrowers to choose from several optional payments every month. Borrowers often chose the minimum-payment option, which doesn't even cover the loan's monthly interest charge, typically because they hoped to refinance the loan or sell the property for a profit within a few years. 
 Such an approach is a gamble, however, because banks simply add each month's unpaid interest to the loan's principal. Usually, if the principal grows to the point where it exceeds the home's value by 15 percent, the lender shifts the borrower into a set amortization schedule, with fixed payments at a fixed rate. 
 In such cases, borrowers are often ill prepared for the spike in monthly payments. But they cannot repay the bank by selling the home, and refinancing may also be difficult.
 Mortgage industry analysts and executives say that many people who took out such loans several years ago are now experiencing these problems. Borrowers in the greater New York area, though, generally appear to have been less likely to be forced into foreclosure.
 Loan Performance, a San Francisco-based mortgage industry consultant, said that about 469,000 option ARMs issued from 2000 to 2007 nationwide are still outstanding. (Lenders generally stopped making these loans in 2007.)
 In New Jersey, there were 17,525 option ARMs still outstanding at the end of June, and 11.4 percent of the homeowners with those loans are at least 30 days delinquent on their payments. In Connecticut, 4.7 percent of the 7,233 outstanding option ARMs are delinquent. In New York, the delinquency rate is roughly 5 percent of the 29,382 option ARMs.
 Many borrowers have refinanced out of these loans. In February 2006, Connecticut had about 11,550 active option ARMs. New Jersey's peak was about 27,300, in July 2006. And New York's peak was about 38,100, also in July 2006.
 Deborah Killian, the chief executive of the Charter Oak Lending Group in Danbury, Conn., said most of the clients who chose option-ARM loans were small-business owners or workers in seasonal businesses who would make the minimum mortgage payments during slow months, and catch up in busy months with bigger payments. But those who made only the minimum monthly payment, she said, will face long odds of avoiding foreclosure.
 Joseph Mason, a banking professor at Louisiana State University, who has studied these loans, said that about 75 percent of borrowers who took them out fell into that category. Most option ARMs, he said, were designed so that borrowers who made only the minimum payment could do so for five years before the growing size of the loan triggered a new payment schedule.
 For those who took out the loans in late 2004 and early 2005, ''their payment time bomb is about ready to explode,'' he said.
 ''The only ones left in the product now are those who couldn't afford something else when they got the loan,'' Mr. Mason added. ''Now all they can likely afford is the minimum payment, so they're just buying time in a dwelling until their reset date.'' 
 Foreclosure rates in the New York area generally continue to be better than those in the worst-hit areas of the United States, but they are rising.
 The Mortgage Bankers Association said that last month 3.5 percent of the mortgaged homes in New York were in foreclosure, up from 2.4 percent a year ago. In Connecticut, it was 3.2 percent, up from 1.95 percent. New Jersey, meanwhile, had a rate of 5.03 percent, up from 2.7 percent and above the national foreclosure rate of 4.3 percent.

HEADLINE: Even Glenn Beck Is Right Twice a Day

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
IF only it were just about the color of his skin. 
 With all due respect to Jimmy Carter, the racist component of Obama-hatred has been undeniable since the summer of 2008, when Sarah Palin rallied all-white mobs to the defense of the ''real America.'' Joe Wilson may or may not be in that camp, but, either way, that's not the news. As we watched and rewatched the South Carolina congressman's star turn, what grabbed us was the act itself. 
 What made the lone, piercing cry of ''You lie!'' shocking was that it breached a previously secure barrier. It was the first time that the violent rage surging in town-hall meetings all summer blasted into the same room as the president. Wilson's televised shout was tantamount to yelling ''Fire!'' in a crowded theater. When he later explained that his behavior was ''spontaneous'' rather than premeditated, that was even more disturbing. It's not good for the country that a lawmaker can't control his anger at Barack Obama. It gives permission to crazy people. 
 The White House was right not to second Carter's motion and cue another ''national conversation about race.'' No matter how many teachable moments we have, some people won't be taught. (Though how satisfying it would have been for Obama to dismiss Wilson, like the boorish Kanye West, as a ''jackass.'') But there is a national conversation we must have right now -- the one about what, in addition to race, is driving this anger and what can be done about it. We are kidding ourselves if we think it's only about bigotry, or health care, or even Obama. The growing minority that feels disenfranchised by Washington can't be so easily ghettoized and dismissed.
 Many of those Americans may hate Obama, but they don't love the Republican establishment either. Michael Steele, who was declared persona non grata at one of the mad ''tea parties'' in April, was not invited to that right-wing 9/12 March on Washington last weekend. There were no public encomiums for McCain or Bush. No Senate leader spoke to the gathering, and perhaps only Palin and Ron Paul would have been welcome from the ranks of what passes for G.O.P. presidential timber. If there was a real hero to this crowd, it was the protest's most prominent promoter, the radio and TV talker Glenn Beck.
 Time put Beck on its cover this week. Man of the Year may not be far behind. Beck is not, as many liberals assume, merely the latest incarnation of Rush Limbaugh. He is something different. That's why he is gaining on his antecedents -- and gaining traction in the country's angrier precincts. 
 Though Beck's daily Fox News show is in the sleepy slot of 5 p.m., his ratings are increasingly neck and neck with the prime-time tag team of Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity, and he has beatenthem in the prized 25-to-54 demographic. It's not just because he is younger (45). This self-described ''rodeo clown,'' who wells up with tears for dramatic effect, doesn't come across as cranky or pompous, like Limbaugh and O'Reilly. A fervent Mormon convert and proselytizer, he is untainted by association with the old Dobson-Robertson-Reed religious right. Unlike Limbaugh, he bonds with his fallible listeners by openly and repeatedly owning up to his own mistakes, including his history of drug and alcohol abuse. Unlike Hannity, he is not a Republican apparatchik.
 Beck has notoriously defamed Obama as a ''racist,'' but the race card is just one in his deck. His ideology, if it can be called that, mixes idolatrous Ayn Rand libertarianism with bumper-sticker slogans about ''freedom,'' self-help homilies and lunatic conspiracy theories. (He fanned Internet rumors that FEMA was establishing concentration camps before tardily beating a retreat.) It's the same crazy-quilt cosmology that could be found in last weekend's Washington protest, where the marchers variously called Obama a fascist, a communist and a socialist, likening him to Hitler, Stalin, Castro and Pol Pot. They may not know that some of these libels are mutually exclusive. But what they do know is that they need a scapegoat for what ails them, and there is no one handier than a liberal, all-powerful president (who just happens to be black).
 Beck captures this crowd's common emotional denominator -- with appropriately overheated capital letters -- in his best-selling book portraying himself as a latter-day Tom Paine, ''Glenn Beck's Common Sense.'' Americans ''know that SOMETHING JUST DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT,'' he writes, ''but they don't know how to describe it or, more importantly, how to stop it.'' This is right-wing populism in the classic American style, as inchoate and paranoid as that hawked by Father Coughlin during the Great Depression and George Wallace in the late 1960s. Wallace is most remembered for his racism, but he, like Beck, also played on the class and cultural resentment of those sharing his view that there wasn't ''a dime's worth of difference'' between the two parties. 
 Now, as then, a Dixie-oriented movement like this won't remotely capture the White House. Now, unlike then, it is a catastrophe for the Republicans. The old G.O.P. Southern strategy is gone with the wind. The more the party is identified with nasty name-calling, freak-show protestors, immigrant-bashing (the proximate cause of Wilson's outburst at Obama) and, yes, racism, the faster it will commit demographic suicide as America becomes ever younger and more diverse. But Democrats shouldn't be cocky. Over the short term, the real economic grievances lurking beneath the extremism of the Beck brigades can do damage to both parties. A stopped clock is right twice a day. The recession-spawned anger that Beck has tapped into on the right could yet find a more mainstream outlet in a populist revolt from the left and center.
 ''Wall Street owns our government,'' Beck declared in one rant this July. ''Our government and these gigantic corporations have merged.'' He drew a chart to dramatize the revolving door between Washington and Goldman Sachs in both the Hank Paulson and Timothy Geithner Treasury departments. A couple of weeks later, Beck mockingly replaced the stars on the American flag with the logos of corporate giants like G.E., General Motors, Wal-Mart and Citigroup (as well as the right's usual nemesis, the Service Employees International Union). Little of it would be out of place in a Matt Taibbi article in Rolling Stone. Or, we can assume, in Michael Moore's coming film, ''Capitalism: A Love Story,'' which reportedly takes on Goldman and the Obama economic team along with conservative targets.
 Unlike liberal critics of capitalist inequities, of course, Beck and his claque are driven by an over-the-top detestation of government. Washington is always the enemy, stealing their hard-earned money to redistribute it to the undeserving and shiftless poor (some of whom just happen to be immigrants or black). Though there is nothing Obama can do to stop racists from being racist, he could help stanch the economic piece of this by demonstrating how a reformed government can at times actually make Americans' lives better. That's what F.D.R. did, and that's the promise Obama made, swaying some Republicans and even some racists, during the campaign.
 Too many Americans are impatiently waiting for results. It's hard to argue that the stimulus package reviled by big government-loathers is a success when unemployment continues to rise and most Americans feel none of the incipient ''recovery'' spotted by Ben Bernanke. The potential dividends to be gained at the end of the protracted health care debate also remain, for now, an abstraction to many who have lost and are continuing to lose their jobs, their savings and their homes. 
 Nor has Obama succeeded in persuading critics on the left or right that he will do as much for those Americans who are suffering as he has for the corporations his administration and his predecessor's rushed to rescue. To mark the anniversary of Lehman's fall, the president gave a speech on Wall Street last Monday again vowing reform. But everyone's back to business as usual: The Wall Street Journal reported that not a single C.E.O. from a top bank attended. The speech sank with scant notice because there has been so little action to back it up and because its conciliatory stance was tone-deaf to the anger beyond the financial district. 
 That same day a United States District Court judge in New York, Jed S. Rakoff, scathingly condemned the Obama Securities and Exchange Commission for letting Bank of America skate away with what Rakoff called an immoral and unjust wrist tap to settle charges that it covered up $3.6 billion paid out in bonuses when it purchased Merrill Lynch. How is this S.E.C. a change from the Clinton-Bush S.E.C. that ignored all the red flags on Bernie Madoff?
 Beck frequently strikes the pose of an apocalyptic prophet, even insisting that he predicted 9/11. This summer he also started warning of domestic terrorism in the form of a new Timothy McVeigh. On this, one fears he knows whereof he speaks. For all our nation's unfinished business on race, racism is not Obama's biggest challenge during our unfinished Great Recession. He -- and our political system -- are being seriously tested by a rage that is no less real for being shouted by a demagogue from Fox and a backbencher from South Carolina.

HEADLINE: New Initiative Would Focus on Raising Quality of Early Learning Programs

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
Tucked away in an $87 billion higher education bill that passed the House last week was a broad new federal initiative aimed not at benefiting college students, but at raising quality in the early learning and care programs that serve children from birth through age 5.
 The initiative, the Early Learning Challenge Fund, would channel $8 billion over eight years to states with plans to improve standards, training and oversight of programs serving infants, toddlers and preschoolers. 
 The Senate is expected to pass similar legislation this fall, giving President Obama, who proposed the Challenge Fund during the presidential campaign, a bill to sign in December.
 Experts describe the current array of programs serving young children and their families nationwide as a hodgepodge of efforts with little coordination or coherence. Financing comes from a shifting mix of private, local, state and federal money. Programs are run out of storefronts and churches, homes and Head Start centers, public schools and other facilities. Quality is uneven, with some offering stimulating activities, play and instruction but others providing little more than a room and a television. 
 Oversight varies by state, but most lack any early childhood structure analogous to the state and local boards of education that govern public schools. A result is that poor children, even many who have access to government-financed early care or learning programs, tend to enter kindergarten less prepared for school than those with wealthier parents.
 To qualify for grants, states would have to demonstrate that they have established or improved what the bill calls a ''governance structure'' for their networks of child care centers and prekindergarten programs. 
 The structure would include quality standards; a curriculum of sorts, appropriate for young children; a mechanism for reviewing programs and assigning quality ratings; minimum training requirements for providers; a plan for reaching out to parents; and a system for collecting data on children and families. The Departments of Education and Health and Human Services would jointly administer the Challenge Fund. 
 Sharon Lynn Kagan, a professor at Teachers College who has traced the history of American child care programs back to the early 19th century, wrote a paper last year advocating federal aid to states in building a more coherent and robust early-childhood infrastructure.
 ''No one bill can solve everything,'' Professor Kagan said, ''but this will move us more than any other piece of legislation toward higher quality in early education, not just more spaces for children.'' 
 Since the campaign, Mr. Obama has raised expectations among early learning advocates with his endorsements of public investments in the careful nurturing of young children, especially the disadvantaged. In the economic stimulus bill, Congress last spring appropriated more than $4 billion in new financing for child care and education efforts, including Head Start, the federal program that serves about 900,000 preschoolers.
 Still, not all early learning advocates are satisfied that the administration is doing all it could to integrate early learning efforts into the nation's broader public education system.
 The Department of Education is already administering a separate $4.3 billion competition among states to reward and encourage improvements to elementary and secondary schools. In August, scores of early learning groups and advocates wrote letters to the department criticizing proposed rules for that competition, known as Race to the Top, as largely ignoring early childhood education. 
 ''We don't see how our country can race to the top when all kids are not at the same starting line'' when they reach kindergarten, said Marcy Young, project director for the Pre-K Now program at the Pew Center on the States, one group that criticized the rules.
 One reason the administration focused on elementary and secondary schools in the Race to the Top competition and early childhood in the Challenge Fund is that the two are at contrasting levels of development, administration officials said, with the public schools needing initiatives to improve teacher effectiveness, for instance, and early childhood needing basic structures of governance.
 Sara Mead, a senior research fellow at the New America Foundation, said, ''I haven't talked with anybody who isn't excited about the prospects for this Early Learning Challenge Fund.''
 ''But there is disappointment in some parts of the early childhood community that it's not more focused on adding slots,'' Ms. Mead said.
 One reason advocates are especially concerned about slots for children is that after a decade in which states had taken the lead in expanding access nationwide, several with deep budget troubles have recently eliminated or reduced services for tens of thousands of children.
 Illinois, for instance, cut the budget for its Pre-K for All program to $305 million this fiscal year from $338 million last year, eliminating slots for about 9,500 children, according to statistics provided by Albert Wat, a project manager at Pre-K Now.
 In Ohio, lawmakers did away with a program known as the Early Learning Initiative, the budget for which last year was $125 million, Mr. Wat said. The action eliminated access for 12,000 children, he said.
 ''In some states, we're seeing a disaster,'' said Steve Barnett, co-director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University. 
 But despite the tightest budgets in decades, nearly 30 states have chosen to protect or increase financing for early learning programs.

HEADLINE: A Festival of Electrics, Exotics and Everything in Between

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
 IN sports parlance, first-round draft picks are ''blue-chip prospects.'' Few make the big leagues, though; most blue-chippers end up as washouts -- in time, they are selling used cars in Dubuque, insurance policies in Poughkeepsie or cantaloupes in Cucamonga.
 The dynamic is similar in the conga line of international car shows. Dozens of new models take the stage for moments of glory before most move on to short, unremarkable lives spent commuting and fetching groceries, eventually becoming fodder in a ''cash for clunkers'' scrap-a-thon.
 This year at the Frankfurt Motor Show, which got under way last week, a few cars made a bid for posterity. At some future concours d'elegance, straw-hatted judges may fuss over the Ferrari 458 Italia or the Lamborghini Reventon Roadster. And some models presented here were already being treated as punch lines, like the Trabant nT, an electric updating of the infamous East German people's car. But many others were simply eagerly vying for a shot at the big time in the time-honored ''put me in, coach'' tradition. 
 But there is a big difference between collectibility and utility -- not to mention affordability. No more than 20 of the $1.6 million Reventons will be sold. But production may reach into the hundreds of thousands for some vehicles introduced here, like the Ford C-Max and various iterations of Volkswagen Golfs, Polos and Passats.
 The next-generation C-Max is of particular interest to Americans; Ford will bring a seven-seat version of that so-called space wagon to the United States in 2011. Built on the platform of the next Focus compact car, it will be a compact minivan in the vein of the Mazda 5. 
 One wonders, however, about the prospects of vehicles like the Daewoo-based Chevy Spark; the Chevrolet division, not to mention its parent company, General Motors, faces an uncertain post-bankruptcy future, especially in Europe.
 The Spark had an inauspicious and understated debut; it was simply parked, along with two other cars, in a small temporary building on a side street within the Messe convention center complex. Meanwhile, in the surrounding halls, automakers with seemingly bottomless promotional budgets basked in opulent displays.
 Some 85 new vehicles made their world debuts here -- though in truth, some were introduced off-site or had been displayed previously at other events -- and the German automakers used their home field to maximum advantage. German companies accounted for dozens of the new models. Volkswagen alone introduced nine.
 VW went so far as to say that its E-Up electric concept car had the earmarks of a cult vehicle -- though that assessment may be premature, given that the car won't go on sale for another few years.
 One of the show's stars was undoubtedly VW's pygmy-size L1 concept: a miniature land-speed streamliner for two people, one seated behind the other, in a package weighing less than 900 pounds. The L1 appears adorable, economical and affordable.
 Some of the high-end features in Frankfurt seem destined to be objects of desire. The Ferrari 458 Italia, which replaces the aging F430, proved even more compelling close-up than in spy photos. The GranCabrio, Maserati's first four-seat convertible, will be fought over and back-ordered for nearly as many years as the 458. The Bentley Mulsanne, replacing the dated Arnage, will live forever, at least in markets like Britain, Beverly Hills and Bahrain.
 The buzz around the Rolls-Royce Ghost, however, seemed disappointing; the Rolls news conference was lightly attended, to put it charitably. Perhaps that had less to do with the controversial underpinnings of the smaller Rolls -- it is built on the platform of a ''mere'' BMW 7 Series -- and more to do with its unfortunate selection as the final big reveal in the previews to the news media. By then, most of the crowd was experiencing sensory overload.
 Rolls and other luxury sedan makers are finding the genre is becoming crowded, with new contenders from companies that once disdained anything larger than a roadster. Aston Martin unveiled its Rapide sedan, which has enough seats for Agents 008, 009 and 010. It will compete with other six-figure four-seaters like the Porsche Panamera and Maserati Quattroporte.
 The Frankfurt show is organized with the efficiency and order of a military operation. But before the show even started, it turned into something of a food fight as automakers, desperate to get their greener-than-thou messages out first, started leaking information and slipping unofficial photos to reporters. 
 The competition proved to be bruising -- and almost comical.
 Stuck by the show's organizers with a schedule that gave it a news conference late on Tuesday afternoon -- the auto show equivalent of a dead zone -- Toyota jumped the gun. By releasing details on Monday night of its Auris hybrid and plug-in Prius, Toyota managed to upstage BMW, which was scheduled to kick off the show the next morning.
 Bugatti staged the real coup, however, leaking details of a concept model, the Galibier sedan, that wasn't being introduced in Frankfurt. In fact, Bugatti didn't even have a display at the show, much less a news conference.
 Still, it was tough to top BMW's extravagantly choreographed introduction of a fleet of models in its EfficientDynamics line of sporty but economical diesel-powered driving machines. Foremost among these was the Vision diesel-electric hybrid concept car, which featured glowing blue lights and see-through body panels.
 For razzle-dazzle, BMW's pavilion was like nothing at an auto show since the 1999 Detroit event, where Ford spent a reported $30 million on a display that included a sky bridge leading to its cars of tomorrow. BMW's display, which takes up nearly all of Tower 11 in the Messe complex, has an elevated two-story high-banked track, around which a couple of dozen models circulated. 
 Over all, there were so many cars rolling out in such a short time -- news media events were mostly confined to two days -- that many significant models got short shrift in the coverage.
 The Lexus LF-Ch, a sporty hybrid hatchback concept; Jaguar's redone flagship sedan, the XJ; and the gullwing Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG were among the significant models that perhaps deserved more attention than they got.
 But Americans unable to get to Frankfurt in the next two weeks can look forward to seeing many of the design studies -- like the Mercedes Blue Zero and Audi R8 e-tron electric concept cars -- at shows closer to home: Los Angeles in early December, Detroit in January and New York in April.

HEADLINE: Barrels of Good Will for Obama, but Few Foreign Policy Benefits Have Seeped Out

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As President Obama welcomes world leaders to the United States this week, he has gone a long way toward meeting his goal of restoring the country's international standing. Foreign counterparts flock to meet with him, and polls show that people in many countries feel much better about the United States.
 But eight months after his inauguration, all that good will so far has translated into limited tangible policy benefits for Mr. Obama. As much as they may prefer to deal with Mr. Obama instead of his predecessor, George W. Bush, foreign leaders have not gone out of their way to give him what he has sought.
 European allies still refuse to send significantly more troops to Afghanistan. The Saudis basically ignored Mr. Obama's request for concessions to Israel, while Israel rebuffed his demand to stop settlement expansion. North Korea defied him by testing a nuclear weapon. Japan elected a party less friendly to the United States. Cuba has done little to liberalize in response to modest relaxation of sanctions. India and China are resisting a climate change deal. And Russia rejected new sanctions against Iran's nuclear program even as Mr. Obama heads into talks with Tehran. 
 For an administration whose officials regularly boast of having what they call ''the best brand in the world,'' there is what Stephen Sestanovich calls growing ''frustration with what other countries are prepared to contribute to advancing supposedly common interests.'' Personal relations are important, said Mr. Sestanovich, a former Clinton administration ambassador with ties to the current team, but national interests still dominate. ''That's what American presidents generally discover,'' he said.
 James K. Glassman, who served as Mr. Bush's last under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs and now leads the former president's new research institute, said popularity only went so far. ''I wouldn't say it's not important to be well liked. It is important. But there are other factors involved,'' he said. ''What you need to do is find out where you have mutual interests.''
 Whether Mr. Obama can use his international regard to promote those mutual interests remains a major challenge as he hosts world leaders at the opening session of the United Nations and then at an economic summit meeting in Pittsburgh later in the week. Attention has focused on whether Russia will reciprocate for Mr. Obama's decision to replace Mr. Bush's missile defense program in Europe with a version less threatening to Moscow.
 Although the White House denied that its decision was made to curry favor with the Kremlin, it took some satisfaction in comments by Russian leaders suggesting more flexibility. Obama advisers pointed to a few specific areas where they have won concessions from other countries. Russia, for example, has agreed to a framework for nuclear arms cuts and gave permission for American troops to fly to Afghanistan through its airspace.
 Moreover, the Obama advisers said they had gotten strong cooperation in the fight against Al Qaeda, particularly from Pakistan, which has led to a string of successful capture-or-kill missions against what they call high-value targets, like the top Taliban leader in Pakistan and the son of Osama bin Laden.
 ''The fact is that all countries, including our own, are going to act on their own interests,'' said Denis McDonough, the president's deputy national security adviser. Mr. Obama ''will continue over the course of the next week to work with countries to identify common interests to address common threats,'' said Mr. McDonough, who added: ''He never indicated this would be easy. But given the stakes involved, he believes it's worth the effort.''
 Surveys by the Pew Research Center quantify how America's standing in many parts of the world has improved significantly since Mr. Obama's election. In Germany, 64 percent of people interviewed this year expressed favorable views of the United States, up from 31 percent a year ago. In Indonesia, 63 percent approve of America compared with 37 percent last year.
 France, Britain, Spain, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Nigeria and other countries likewise saw double-digit increases, while smaller increases were registered in India, South Korea, Japan and China. But Arab countries saw more modest changes, and countries like Russia, Turkey, Poland and Pakistan were largely unmoved.
 A survey of Europe released by the German Marshall Fund of the United States this month documented that Mr. Obama is even more popular. While just 19 percent of Europeans interviewed in that survey a year ago supported Mr. Bush's handling of international affairs, 77 percent approved of Mr. Obama's foreign policy. More than 90 percent of Germans had a favorable view of Mr. Obama, an 80 percentage point increase over Mr. Bush.
 But Craig Kennedy, the fund's president, said there was an inevitable disconnect because Europeans seemed to view Mr. Obama as more European in his sensibilities than his policies actually are. ''I suspect that, as real political decisions have to be made, we will see ''Obama Euphoria'' fade as the Europeans begin to see him more as an American and less like themselves,'' he wrote last week.
 Mr. Obama's trouble winning support in some areas overseas reflects the disparate views of him and his policies.
 ''The problem is he's asking for roughly the same things President Bush asked for and President Bush didn't get them, not because he was a boorish diplomat or a cowboy,'' said Peter D. Feaver, a former adviser to Mr. Bush now at Duke University. ''If that were the case, bringing in the sophisticated, urbane President Obama would have solved the problem. President Bush didn't get them because these countries had good reasons for not giving them.''
 In other words, Russia's national interests did not change just because Mr. Obama arrived on the scene. India and China still worry about the economic impact of curbing greenhouse gas emissions. Europeans may like Mr. Obama but most of them still oppose the war in Afghanistan.
 Still, Mr. Obama has shown in the past that he can play for the long term. Advisers and supporters see hope that he can eventually bring Israelis and Arabs together, forge a working relationship with Russia even if not a friendship, reach consensus with allies on Iran and North Korea and build a coalition to stem the spread of nuclear weapons. This new atmosphere, they argue, will ultimately pay dividends.
 ''Obama's early foreign policy steps have been good and appropriate for this country, whether or not they enlist the support of others,'' said Robert Hutchings, a former diplomat now at Princeton University. He argued that Mr. Obama's approach had ''laid the groundwork'' for ''real breakthroughs'' in the not-too-distant future.

HEADLINE: The Recession Is Over -- for Now

BYLINE: By PETER BOONE and SIMON JOHNSON. 
Peter Boone is the chairman of Effective Intervention, a British charity, and a research associate at the London School of Economics' Center for Economic Performance. Simon Johnson is a professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

 BODY:
SPEAKING at the Brookings Institution last week, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, remarked that the recession in the United States is ''very likely over.'' He's surely right that a recovery is under way; in fact, the short-term bounce back may actually turn out to be faster than he thinks -- rapid growth is not uncommon right after a severe financial crisis. 
 Mr. Bernanke commands great respect because of his impressive efforts to head off financial collapse, but his speech was deeply worrisome on the bigger questions: what caused the financial crisis, and how can we prevent another such calamity? 
 Mr. Bernanke still refuses to acknowledge the Fed's role in creating financial boom-bust cycles, and therefore his diagnosis and solutions sound overly technocratic and somewhat hollow. He has called for requiring banks to hold more liquid assets and increase their equity cushions, and passing legislation that would permit the Fed to effectively close large financial institutions when they are failing. He also wants the Fed to be responsible for regulation of such large banks. 
 But none of this is enough. Why should we believe that the Federal Reserve could regulate banks and avert financial bubbles when that agency has repeatedly failed to do so over the past 30 years? The greatest failure of all time happened from 2002 to 2007, and for most of that time Mr. Bernanke was on the Fed's board of governors. To make financial regulation workable again, the chairman needs to admit the institution's recent failures and call for deeper reforms in the operation of the Fed to make financial regulation workable again. Otherwise, the United States and the rest of the world are being set up to face another -- much larger -- financial crisis.
 As someone who came to government from academia rather than banking, Mr. Bernanke is not beholden to business, and that puts him in a good position to make the kind of basic changes to the culture of regulation that are most needed -- in particular, changes that would stop so many regulators from moving back and forth into the finance industry. He is also a student of the history of the Fed and knows how, after 1934, his predecessor Marriner Eccles helped lead a redesign of the financial system that served America well for 50 years. So he should also realize that if he truly wishes to end our cycles of boom and bust, he needs to fight for a stronger regulatory system and against the powerful financial interests that encourage policy makers to avoid real reform. 
 In successive financial boom-busts over the past 30 years, the Fed undertook smaller versions of what Ben Bernanke did over the past 12 months. In the Latin American debt crisis of 1982, the savings-and-loan crisis of the late 1980s, the Asian financial crisis and the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998 and during the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2001, you saw the same pattern: First, of course, the financial system grew rapidly, bank profits were large and a bubble emerged. At a certain point, we reached the market peak and stared down the mountain. Bankers frantically called the Fed, and it dutifully stepped in to prevent an economic collapse -- by lowering interest rates and providing credit to ''maintain liquidity.'' 
 In his speech last week, Mr. Bernanke indicated that interest rates are now likely to stay low for a long time. That means that if you are running a major bank, you have good reason now to take on more ''leverage'' (debt). If collapse threatens again, bank executives know the Fed will support them. And lenders know that it is a far better risk to make loans to banks supported by the Fed than to firms that can go bankrupt, like automakers or high-technology companies. 
 All of this facilitates a short-term recovery, of course, and is the cornerstone of Mr. Bernanke's strategy. But it also feeds a new financial frenzy -- making it harder to sustain real growth, and also making it less likely that a broad cross section of society will benefit. 
 There is nothing wrong with having the Federal Reserve in place to deal with financial shocks. This was the original idea that emerged from the 1907 financial crisis, and from the subsequent National Monetary Commission reports -- that the United States needed a central bank to manage downturns. At that time, Democrats were rightly suspicious that the commission, led by Senator Nelson Aldrich, Republican of Rhode Island, was looking for a way to give private banking interests influence over federal money. 
 When it was created in 1913, the Federal Reserve was meant to be a compromise -- a way for private bankers to have a say in the operation of the national bank but also a way for the government to keep private bankers in check. And that is how it worked from 1935 to 1980, when the Fed and other agencies ensured that banks' activities did not put the public purse at risk. 
 Both before 1935 and again after 1980, however, the Fed's financial regulation was and has been weak. At the heart of this weakness are the large profits that can be earned by taking advantage of lax regulation in the financial sector. The phenomenal growth of the derivatives market over the past 30 years, for example, has made all our big banks far more interconnected, and hence systemically risky; if one bank falls the others fall with it. Yet our regulators, many of whom remain in office today, watched as this time bomb grew and then exploded with the collapse of the American International Group. 
 Since our top regulators are political appointees, it should be no surprise that, in the face of heavy lobbying by the financial sector, they often turn out to be regulatory doves. We've permitted our mid- and high-level regulators to revolve between jobs in finance and officialdom. To name just two examples, during the Clinton administration, Robert Rubin left Goldman Sachs to become secretary of the Treasury, then returned to the industry to take an oversight role at Citigroup, while Henry Paulson, the secretary of the Treasury during the last years of the George W. Bush administration, came straight to government from Goldman Sachs. 
 A high-level position at the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, the White House National Economic Council or at a Congressional committee overseeing banking can be a ticket to riches when public service is done. The result is that our main regulatory bodies, including the Fed, are deeply compromised. Rather than act as the tough overseers of the public purse that we need -- and that we had before 1980 -- they have become cheerleaders for the financial sector. 
 These cheerleaders, in turn, generate financial cycles by letting our financial system grow too fast, with far too little capital for the risks it takes. When the Federal Reserve inevitably bails banks out, it receives great applause (particularly from the financial sector). Yet with each cycle of failure and bailout, the financial system grows ever larger and more dangerous. 
 Not all of this, of course, is under Ben Bernanke's control. Like Alan Greenspan before him, when he provides bailouts and facilitates recovery, Mr. Bernanke can say he is only doing his job. But the true and original responsibility of the Fed is much broader that that. The central bank is supposed to prevent crises that threaten to bankrupt the country. 
 In today's nascent global recovery, we are already seeing bubble-like rises in the prices of real estate and assets, from Hong Kong and Singapore to Brazil. And many more emerging markets will likewise soon boom. The details of who makes which crazy loans to whom will no doubt be different from what they were from 2002 to 2007, but the basic structure of incentives in the system is unchanged. The same people are running the American banks, and the same regulators are regulating them, so you can easily get the same outcome here as we have just seen.
 We should prohibit companies and senior managers in regulated financial industries from making donations to political campaigns. We should also restrict public employees involved in regulatory policy from working in those industries for five years after they leave office. And we should prohibit people who move to government from the finance sector from making policy decisions on bailout and regulatory-related matters for a minimum of five years. 
 Our regulators need to be smart people who understand finance, but they don't need to be drawn from the upper echelons of the financial industry. There are many proven, dedicated professionals in our regulatory agencies today, and we should support the development of an even stronger cadre of career regulators. It should be up to the financial sector to make its practices clear and simple enough for these professionals to understand, and any that are too complex should not be approved. 
 Finally, we should significantly raise capital requirements for the financial sector -- and the bigger the bank, the more capital you should need. (Of course, this would discourage banks from growing too large.) The Obama administration should at least triple the current requirements.
 Our financial system provides valuable services to the public, but it also poses serious risks. If we can't re-regulate more strongly to better protect public funds, the next crisis could be worse than the last one.

HEADLINE: Another Soderbergh Puzzle!

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
''I JUST want to make sure you know it's a comedy.'' 
 Those were the words of a Warner Brothers publicist as I made my way this summer into a screening of ''The Informant!,'' the latest movie directed by Steven Soderbergh. It struck me at the time as an odd thing for her to say. If I didn't know that the movie, which stars Matt Damon as an agribusiness executive turned F.B.I. snitch, was meant to be funny, wouldn't that be clear soon enough? And anyway, I pride myself on a certain cinematic savvy. No one had to tell me beforehand that ''District 9'' was science fiction or that ''The Hangover'' was an earnest warning about the perils of binge drinking.
Maybe, though, the studio itself was in some doubt about the intentions behind ''The Informant!,'' which is based on the true, bizarre story of Mark Whitacre, an Archer Daniels Midland executive who in the 1990s exposed a price-fixing scheme that landed several of his bosses and colleagues in prison. The title sports an eccentric exclamation point, as if it were the punch line to a bad joke. (''Who's the nuttiest guy in Decatur, Ill.?'' ''The Informant!'') 
 But ''The Informant!'' itself is less a farce than a comic puzzle. Its protagonist, though ridiculous at times, is also elusive, even enigmatic. And the hilarity is undercut by a curious anxiety that floats free of the character and settles over the audience. What's happening here? What are the stakes? Who is this guy?
 The difficulty of shoehorning ''The Informant!'' into a familiar genre -- an idiosyncrasy I count among its virtues -- certainly presents a marketing challenge for the distributor. The comic-book action blockbuster and the crude sex comedy may be bound by strict, implicit conventions, but so too are the period biopic, the sober-sided literary adaptation and the quirky indie crowd-pleaser, perhaps more than ever in this risk-averse, recession-spooked Hollywood. 
 ''The Informant!'' doesn't conform to these or any other models. It is an intriguing movie, and not an entirely accessible one. Which may just be another way of saying that it's a Steven Soderbergh film.
 Those words, by the way, do not appear on screen in ''The Informant!'' At a time when every hack lays claim to the label of auteur, Mr. Soderbergh, 20 years after winning the Palme d'Or at Cannes on his first try (for ''sex, lies and videotape''), disdains it, along with the ''film by'' credit that adorns so many title sequences like a vanity license plate. Back in the fall of 2000, when I interviewed him shortly before the release of ''Traffic,'' Mr. Soderbergh said that he favored a craftsmanlike approach to filmmaking, one that addressed each new project as a discrete ''job of work.'' 
 In the years since, perhaps no American director has been so industrious or taken on such a variety of jobs. ''Traffic,'' his multistranded narrative of the drug trade, based on a British mini-series, won him an Oscar for best director, while ''Erin Brockovich,'' released earlier in 2000, earned a best actress award for Julia Roberts. ''The Informant!,'' which both echoes and subverts the ''Erin Brockovich'' narrative of a solitary crusader battling corporate wrongdoing, is the 10th feature Mr. Soderbergh has directed since accepting his Academy Award. In those eight years he has also dabbled in television (with ''K Street,'' an interesting and ambitious misfire for HBO), collected executive producer credits (''Michael Clayton,''''I'm Not There,'' among others) and contributed a chapter, along with Wong Kar-wai and Michelangelo Antonioni, to the omnibus film ''Eros.''
 If auteur status is conferred, as its early theorists argued, by a recognizable and consistent set of themes, gestures and motifs, then Mr. Soderbergh's resume can start to look like a deliberate attempt to refute the theory. Apart from George Clooney, what do the three jaunty, impish ''Ocean's'' pictures (11, 12 and 13) have in common with ''Solaris,'' Mr. Soderbergh's melancholy remake of Andrei Tarkovsky's cryptic science fiction allegory? And the glossy and lucrative ''Ocean's'' franchise stands in even more marked contrast to films like ''Full Frontal,'' which corralled a bunch of movie stars into a fractured, elliptical anti-narrative, or ''Bubble,'' which deployed nonprofessional actors in a tight little film noir plot. 
 None of those are much like ''The Good German,'' at once a throwback to the espionage thrillers of the '40s -- shot in black and white in a narrow aspect ratio with lots of hair tonic and cigarette smoke -- and a knowing, profane critique of their hard-boiled idealism. And how to assimilate the four-and-a-half-hour, two part ''Che,'' an exhaustive chronicle of military tactics in the Latin American countryside, and ''The Girlfriend Experience,'' a splintered chronicle of a sex worker's life in the city?
 Mr. Soderbergh has frequently been identified with the ''one for them, one for me'' idea, according to which popular, studio-backed confections alternate with, and enable, more personal and challenging projects. But to divide his films along those lines is to sever some interesting connections and to iron out some of the kinks and contradictions within particular pieces of work. There is a tension within ''Solaris,'' for example, between the austerity and abstraction of the European art-cinema tradition where its roots lie and the Hollywood genres of romantic melodrama and spaceship adventure toward which it is drawn. And there is an even deeper split within ''Che'' -- between procedural rigor and political romanticism, or perhaps between the discipline of guerrilla filmmaking and the demands of the historical biopic. 
 And for all its insouciance ''Ocean's Eleven'' through ''Thirteen'' display an almost fanatical formal control, an immersion in classical cinematic technique and film history as thorough as anything Quentin Tarantino or Martin Scorsese has ever attempted, but with less showing off. Mr. Soderbergh may have zigzagged in and out of the movie-industry mainstream in the course of his career, but he has remained, throughout, to an extent matched by very few of his peers, an experimental filmmaker.
 By this I mean that he seems to approach each film as a problem, a hypothesis to be explored and tested in the course of production. And as an exercise, though that risks sounding dismissive and understating his creative zeal. What if you were going to make a movie about the aftermath of World War II now, with the visual texture of a film from that era but with a more complete retroactive knowledge of where the story might go? What would it take to refight, for the cameras, the slow, victorious march of the Cuban revolutionary forces from the Sierra Maestra to Havana? What if you started shooting the story of a high-priced Manhattan prostitute just as the global economy went into free fall? 
 The answers to these questions may not be, in the strict sense, scientific, but they are always, for Mr. Soderbergh, at least partly technical. Starting with ''Traffic'' he has, under the pseudonym Peter Andrews, served as director of photography on all his films. And in that capacity he has explored the still-emerging aesthetic possibilities of digital video, using the format to very different effect in ''Bubble,'' ''Che'' and ''The Girlfriend Experience,'' aswell as ''The Informant!'' The portability and clarity of focus of the camera he used in ''Che'' made it possible to capture the strain and danger of insurgent combat in a new way. The glossy, gold-tinted chiaroscuro of ''The Girlfriend Experience'' evokes eroticism and emptiness, luxury and sleaze, and the drab, backlighted yellows of ''The Informant!'' tell you more about the ethos of Middle American corporate life than anything the characters do or say. 
 But the characters themselves, especially in the three most recent films, are themselves part of the experiment. ''Che,'' ''The Girlfriend Experience'' and ''The Informant!,'' despite obvious differences of tone and narrative structure, make up a fascinating triptych. Each one is the portrait of a character who is fundamentally unknowable. Benicio Del Toro, behind his beard and his inscrutable eyes, is in the title role of ''Che'' an emblem of ideological commitment and military ruthlessness and yet also something of a cipher, the sum of his brave, bloody and foolish actions. 
 And while Chelsea, the call girl played by the pornographic film star Sasha Grey, and Mr. Damon's Mark Whitacre are continuous, dominant presences in ''The Girlfriend Experience'' and ''The Informant!,'' their motives, feelings and inner lives remain just out of reach. It's as if Mr. Soderbergh is pointedly defying the imperative to make certain characters likable, sympathetic or, in the Hollywood jargon, relatable. 
 And this detachment may be the most radical aspect of Mr. Soderbergh's experimentalism. His films often seem to be less about the people in them than indirectly and allegorically about themselves. This is obvious enough, even explicit, in the ''Ocean's'' franchise, since nearly every heist movie -- predicated on an elaborate and improbable plan that must be executed perfectly in spite of all kinds of accidents and contingencies -- is really about filmmaking. But the long slog of Che Guevera and his armies offers an even more pointed fable of the process, in which the same set of rules and principles is followed twice, once to triumph, and then to catastrophe. And the lover for hire who is abused by critics and whose business transactions are inevitably mistaken for something else --love? art?-- maybe that one's too obvious.
 Which is not to say that Mr. Soderbergh's own art is cynical or solipsistic. Rather it is the self-awareness that makes it interesting, even when the experiments fail. As experiments will, more often than not. I will put my cards on the table and say that I have disliked quite a few, perhaps the majority, of Mr. Soderbergh's movies of the past decade. I've been unmoved, perplexed, frustrated, repelled. But I've wanted to see them all more than once.
 And I always look forward to the next one. Around the time I was being ushered into that screening of ''The Informant!,'' news reports were circulating about ''Moneyball,'' an adaptation of Michael Lewis's best seller about the business of baseball that was to star Brad Pitt. The studio, Sony, rejected Mr. Soderbergh's script and dropped him from the project, and the story became a miniature Hollywood morality tale, either about a studio quashing a filmmaker's bold vision or about a filmmaker's self-indulgence reined in by the hard budgetary realities of the business.
 Mr. Soderbergh, in any case, has moved on to new problems and puzzles. And I find it hard not to root for him or to avoid paying him a compliment that is sure to sound more like criticism to some ears, but is really an acknowledgment of the risk he takes, again and again. He cares more about the movies than he cares about the audience.

HEADLINE: Detroit's Mr. Fix-It Takes On Saturn

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC and NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
 THEY call him The Captain at the racetrack, where his team has won the Indianapolis 500 a record 15 times. But at heart, Roger Penske has always been a consummate repairman, one who excelled at rebuilding used cars as a teenager and later deftly overhauled troubled businesses as an automotive entrepreneur.
 Over the last 30 years, he's also succeeded where corporate giants have failed. He turned around truck leasing for Hertz, revived General Motors' diesel-engine operations, and gave new life to Daimler's micro-car franchise, Smart. And when his struggling hometown, Detroit, had to make sure that Super Bowl XL went off without a hitch in 2006, the city turned to Mr. Penske to run it.
 Now, at age 72, the silver-haired former race car driver is about to take on the ultimate problem child of the auto industry -- G.M.'s Saturn division. 
 Since its creation in 1985 as what G.M. anointed ''a different kind of car company,'' Saturn has been one of Detroit's biggest disappointments. Instead of a shining example of G.M.'s foresight, it ended up epitomizing the slow, downward spiral of what was once the world's dominant automaker.
 Its early promise faded amid weak sales, years of bland cars and a marketing message that was lost in G.M.'s overstocked inventory of brands. G.M. threw money at Saturn, but never made a profit even during its best times. Analysts estimate that Saturn has lost as much as $20 billion over the last 24 years.
 ''It may well be the biggest fiasco in automotive history since Ford brought out the Edsel,'' said Jerome York, a former G.M. director and an aide to Kirk Kerkorian, the investor who has made and lost hefty sums investing in G.M., Chrysler and Ford. ''Saturn has been a huge money loser for G.M. for a long, long time.''
 In Mr. Penske's view, however, Saturn is a potential jewel to be plucked from the scrap heap of G.M.'s bankruptcy.
 By early next month, his company, the Penske Automotive Group, is expected to complete its acquisition of Saturn from G.M. After that, it plans to try to reinvent the brand as an independent chain of dealerships. That experiment hinges on attracting a foreign car manufacturer that will supply Saturn with vehicles after G.M. stops producing its current line of Saturns in 2011.
 The foray sets the stage for a classic business drama involving a self-made perfectionist who seldom tastes defeat and a tarnished brand that struggled to meet expectations under the heavy hand of a slow-moving and entrenched corporate behemoth. All of which has analysts, competitors and auto buffs placing bets on whether or not Mr. Penske met his match in Saturn.
 His efforts to restore Saturn's credibility and improve its sales mirror, in a much smaller way, G.M.'s own uphill battle to come back -- as a 60-percent-owned government entity backed by $50 billion in federal loans.
 ''My guess is that Penske has a shot at it,'' says David E. Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. ''But I'm not sure I could say that about anyone else except Roger.''
 MR. Penske, citing the pending deal with G.M., declined to comment on his plans for Saturn. People inside G.M. who have knowledge of the transaction -- but who requested anonymity because the negotiations are confidential -- say that the acquisition should close early next month and that G.M.'s new board of directors wants to move forward with the Saturn divestiture. Penske Automotive has already sent Saturn dealers two-year agreements to review and sign.
 A G.M. spokesman, Thomas J. Pyden, says the automaker is eager for the deal to close. ''We certainly remain hopeful that the sale will proceed,'' he says. ''In terms of Penske, we don't think you could find a better buyer for the brand.''
 Indeed, G.M. has few other options for Saturn. The company has been forced to jettison huge chunks of its global organization to meet government conditions to become a smaller, more nimble competitor so it can ensure its longevity and earn enough money to repay the federal loans that have kept it afloat.
 Members of G.M.'s sprawling corporate family like Saab, Hummer and Opel are slated to be sold to foreign buyers, and the venerable Pontiac division will shut down completely. Saturn too looked to become extinct until Mr. Penske surprised the auto industry by making his bid in early June, just two weeks after his race team took home the championship at the Indy 500.
 Mr. Penske controls 40 percent of Penske Automotive's stock, giving him a stake worth about $600 million. The company lost $403 million last year, on revenue of $11.6 billion, during a seismic downturn that slammed all sectors of the auto industry. 
 In earlier years, Penske Automotive was reliably profitable as it became one of the largest car dealers in the world, with 150 franchises in the United States and an additional 160 in international markets. Mr. Penske's holdings also include several Toyota dealerships in California.
 When G.M. put Saturn up for sale this past spring, there were few suitors. The idea, at the time, was that a foreign automaker without a presence here would snap up Saturn as a turn-key distribution channel. But with the American market in its worst sales slump in 25 years, there were no takers, especially for an already troubled enterprise. Saturn is on track to sell fewer than 100,000 cars this year, down from 286,000 in 1994.
 The core of the Saturn lineup consists of three vehicles -- the midsize Aura sedan and two S.U.V.-like crossovers, the Outlook and the Vue. None have captured the fancy of skittish car buyers. Through the first eight months of this year, overall sales for the division have dropped 58 percent.
 It appeared that G.M. might be forced to shut down the division entirely. But Mr. Penske is intrigued by the potential of Saturn's 350 dealerships, regardless of whether G.M. could supply them with cars indefinitely.
 He envisioned Saturn as a larger version of the business model he first set up last year for Smart, the little, egg-shaped commuter car that Daimler, the German automaker, manufactures. With Smart, Mr. Penske assumed control of all aspects of sales, marketing and service, and contracted with Daimler only for production of the cars. 
 Saturn will theoretically work the same way, with G.M. supplying vehicles for a brief interlude while Mr. Penske acts as the middle man between the factory and the independently owned Saturn stores. 
 ''This is a distribution business, not a manufacturing business,'' Mr. Penske told auto analysts in a conference call in late July. ''So, it's similar to what we have at Smart.'' 
 Analysts believe Mr. Penske can make money primarily by selling parts to service the more than three million Saturn cars already on the road. ''The economics for dealers are more on the service side of the business,'' says Scott Tuhy, an analyst with Moody's. ''It's not so much selling new cars as servicing the base of the vehicles that's already out there.''
 Mr. Penske also hopes to capitalize on the essential ingredients that once set Saturn apart from G.M.'s other divisions.
 The promise of Saturn, from its inception, was how it conducted business rather than the specific models it sold. Its dealers covered large geographic areas with minimal overlap. Customers received personal attention usually found only in luxury showrooms. A no-haggle, one-price policy took the strain out of negotiating deals, and new buyers were treated like royalty. As a matter of policy, employees would drop what they were doing and cheer in the showroom when a customer received the keys to a new Saturn.
 That friendly vibe was Saturn's hallmark. New buyers received photos of them picking up their cars (''Welcome to the family!'' read the captions), and attended workshops on how to do everything from program the stereo to change a tire. In 1994 and 1999, thousands of owners traveled to the Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., for a ''homecoming'' party that celebrated the bond with their cars.
 Saturn's owner-loyalty rate exceeded other G.M. divisions'. ''I never thought of getting another type of car than a Saturn,'' says Richard Ludwig of Des Plaines, Ill., whose family has owned a dozen Saturn models since 1993. His wife, Gloria, says the relationship with their dealer was so positive they never shopped elsewhere.
 ''We just kept going back to Saturn,'' she says. ''We had a terrific saleslady. If you went in thinking you're not going to walk out with a car, within a few hours you walk out with a car.''
 When G.M. announced it might sell Saturn to a foreign manufacturer, dealers worried that the brand would lose its unique connection with its devotees. 
 ''I didn't want that to happen,'' says Mary McHugh, an executive with a dealership group that once had four Saturn stores in the Chicago area. Two of the showrooms closed this year, but Ms. McHugh says the sale to Mr. Penske offers hope for the remaining outlets.
 ''There's trepidation on the one hand, but there's excitement on the other,'' she says. ''It's sort of a renaissance, going back to our original ideas. That's the part that got watered down with G.M.''
 HOWEVER much it inspired brand loyalty with Saturn, G.M. still managed to seriously lose its way when it came to developing and constantly refreshing cars that carried the Saturn logo. 
 Originally, Saturn's mission was to specialize in small, affordable, high-quality autos assembled in a single, dedicated factory. Much was made of the flexible labor agreement signed with the United Automobile Workers that set Saturn's Spring Hill plant apart from other G.M. factories.
 But jockeying for financial and creative resources within the G.M. mothership put Saturn in competition with the parent company's other divisions, particularly Chevrolet. The first Saturn cars, called the S-series, were produced for more than a decade before being replaced. Subsequent models, notably the Ion subcompact, fell far short of the refinement and reliability of competing cars from Asian manufacturers.
 ''Saturn never had what I call an irresistible product,'' says John Wolkonowicz, an analyst with the research firm IHS Global Insight. ''And when G.M. tried to expand the brand into minivans and sport utility vehicles, it was too little and too late.''
 Still, G.M. executives were loath to part with Saturn when the company's finances collapsed late last year. The brand reached a younger demographic than its other divisions, and was moderately successful in luring buyers who traditionally bought Toyotas, Hondas and other foreign nameplates.
 ''Saturn's focus has never been to take sales from General Motors,'' says Todd Ingersoll, who owns two Saturn dealerships in Connecticut. ''Our customers, the majority of them, would not have purchased another domestic automobile had Saturn not been around.''
 The proposed deal with Mr. Penske won't change Saturn's lineup for now. G.M. has agreed to supply Saturn with the Aura, the Vue and the Outlook for two years while Mr. Penske courts other manufacturers to stock his new flock of dealerships. Yet so far, Mr. Penske hasn't found that partner.
 ''We're going to have G.M. to start with in this business, and then we're going to move on to another manufacturer in the future,'' he said in his call with analysts.
 Speculation in the industry has centered on the French carmaker Renault, which has ties to both Nissan in Japan and Samsung in South Korea, and several Chinese auto companies as possible partners for Mr. Penske in the venture. But would Saturn loyalists consider a Chinese-made car a Saturn? 
 ''That's a tall order,'' Mr. Wolkonowicz says. ''If it was as good as a Honda Civic, they might.''
 Until a new manufacturer steps up, Saturn will have to survive on a diet of G.M. models that are neither new nor noteworthy. 
 Even so, with Mr. Penske in the mix there will unquestionably be other significant and interesting changes afoot. His racing team is known for its meticulous planning, its spit-and-polish appearance and, above all, its discipline. He has applied the same principles in other parts of his automotive empire, and gotten sterling results.
 ''Roger does his homework and always has,'' says Mr. Cole, who has known Mr. Penske since he was a champion driver in the 1960s. ''He runs his businesses like he prepares for a race. It's in his DNA to sweat all the details.''
 In 1988, Mr. Penske formed a joint venture with G.M., called Detroit Diesel, to run the automaker's diesel engine operations. He smoothed what were tense relations with its unionized work force by settling outstanding grievances, updating the cafeteria, building a fitness center at the main plant in Detroit, and inviting employees to racing events at his Michigan International Speedway.
 After years of labor squabbles with G.M., workers warmed to Mr. Penske's team-first approach. Productivity improved, and Detroit Diesel became profitable within two years. The company eventually went public and later was sold to Daimler.
 The positive outcome of the diesel-engine venture laid a foundation with G.M. executives that Mr. Penske has said helped cement the Saturn deal.
 ''Our relationship with G.M. has never been better,'' he told analysts in July. ''Twenty years ago, we had the opportunity to do the Detroit Diesel deal with them, which went well. And I think that some of the benefit is getting us to do this transaction.''
 Still, the future of Saturn won't necessarily be determined by how well Mr. Penske improves productivity in its dealerships, or whether he can entice a low-cost foreign manufacturer to sell its cars as Saturns. 
 The domestic market for new cars isn't expected to recover any time soon, and most analysts predict it will be years before the industry can achieve 16 million annual vehicle sales, which it averaged before the market crashed last year.
 Where Saturn fits into that landscape is anyone's guess. Other, newer brands like Hyundai are capturing buyers who once gravitated to Saturn, and G.M. itself is pushing hard to lure Saturn owners into its Chevrolet showrooms. The novelty of the Saturn sales experience may have worn thin, and there's little to distinguish the products from models in other G.M. dealerships.
 The Spring Hill plant now makes Chevrolets, while the current Saturn lineup is built in Kansas, Michigan and Mexico.
 Mr. York, the former G.M. director, says he pushed the automaker to unload Saturn three years ago but the company resisted selling off any brands for fear of losing more market share. 
 Now Saturn has even less value in an increasingly crowded marketplace, Mr. York notes.
 ''It's like you go to the grocery store and you have 40 brands of toothpaste,'' he says. ''Well, the world doesn't need 40 brands of toothpaste. I think Saturn falls into the same category. The world doesn't need it.''
 MR. PENSKE may beg to differ. He's expected to pay a minimal purchase price for the Saturn brand, according to people inside G.M., and he has a two-year window to find another auto company to work with before the G.M. spigot gets turned off. 
 The biggest risk, should Mr. Penske fail, will probably be to his reputation rather than his bank account. Saturn dealers, most of which have been with the division since its inception, see Mr. Penske as nothing less than their savior. Unlike the proposed buyers for Hummer and Saab, Mr. Penske is a known quantity and a successful megadealer on his own.
 Above all, Mr. Penske wants Saturn when it appears that no one else does.
 ''Of all the possibilities that could have happened for Saturn, and what is happening to other brands, I think we're the luckiest of them all,'' says Mr. Ingersoll, the Saturn dealer. ''We're rewriting the story of automotive retailing.''

HEADLINE: Is It Racism, or Populism, or Both?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''No, It's Not About Race,'' by David Brooks (column, Sept. 18):
 After reading Mr. Brooks's argument that the incivility in the capital is driven by populism and not racism, I can only come to the conclusion that he is turning a blind eye -- in this instance, a color-blind eye -- to the situation.
 In denying the role of racism in fomenting the rash of anti-big-government and anti-Obama protests, he cites our long history of populism, as well as Jeffersonian limited-government policies and the Jacksonian movement of ''plain people against the cosmopolitan elites.'' 
 Ironically, by invoking the names of Jefferson and Jackson, he calls attention to two of our nation's leaders most identified with racism -- one who benefited directly from slavery and one whose purge of native people from their lands opened the doors to unchecked American expansionism in the West.
 Moreover, in his outline and glorification of populist movements throughout our country's history, Mr. Brooks doesn't mention the connection between racism and populism. The two do not stand in isolation.
 Historically, racism has served as the underlying thread that has sown our populist movements -- and it continues to do so today.
 Angela West Blank Middleton, Wis., Sept. 18, 2009
 To the Editor:
 The manipulation of racial tensions has always been at least one part of conservative-led ''populism.'' It was used by Southern planters to get poor whites to support the slavery on which the planter aristocracy rested. It was used by these same planters to turn an agrarian populist movement into support for Jim Crow to break up the incipient Reconstruction-era alliance between newly emancipated blacks and poor whites. Most recently it was the centerpiece of the ''Southern strategy'' exploited by Ronald Reagan and the Republicans to usher in an era in which the wealthy profited spectacularly while middle- and low-income workers saw wages stagnate or decline.
 The educated elite that Mr. Brooks says is the object of this populist outrage has brought working-class Americans Social Security, Medicare, the minimum wage, the right to collectively bargain and other policies -- all opposed by Republican economic elites who have manipulated wedge issues including race to incite populist outrage.
 The fact that white ''teabaggers'' happily buy food from blacks and listen to their rap concert is hardly sufficient to dismiss the likelihood that once again racial anxieties are being exploited by those who stand to benefit economically.
 Sidney S. Rosdeitcher New York, Sept. 18, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Though I would not so lightly dismiss race as a tea-party motivator, I agree with David Brooks about the demonstrators' place in the history of American populism. It is politically convenient for elected and media cheerleaders to blame the usual liberal scapegoats (''urban politicians, academics, Hollywood donors''), but the teabaggers' legitimate complaints should more properly be aimed at the largely invisible people who control multinational corporations, and the politicians who empower them.
 President Obama was forced by their greed and irresponsibility to empty the Treasury to underwrite the financial services industry, and to a lesser extent the auto industry. 
 The demonstrators would be surprised to learn that many, if not most, of us on the left share their outrage. It's on where to place the blame that we differ.
 Cheryl Krauss Brooklyn, Sept. 18, 2009
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks appears to imply that there is a fine line between racism and populism, but all too often in American politics that line is indistinguishable. As he suggests, populism tends to take right-wing or left-wing forms; even so, racism is inextricably a part of these tendencies. 
 Examples of these swings can be found in the careers of the Southerners Tom Watson and George Wallace. Mr. Watson began his political ascendancy as a populist in the early 1900s only to succumb to racism and white supremacy. To a degree, Mr. Wallace went the opposite way, shifting from an arch-segregationist to populist.
 Racism was either at the beginning or the end of the populist tendency, and it was always difficult to discern which was primary.

HEADLINE: Hybrid Internet-TV Makes Progress in Europe

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Internet television has become so popular that some European broadcasters want to put it on TV -- the one in the living room.
 Within several months, viewers in Germany with specially equipped televisions may be able to watch public broadcasters' Internet television services, which let users catch up on the shows of the previous week, whenever they choose, via their computers.
 In Britain, the BBC and several partners are working on a more ambitious project to bring what is called catch-up TV and a variety of other programming and interactive services to television sets as soon as next year. 
 Why would viewers, who can already get dozens of channels over the air, via cable or satellite or through their telephone lines, need yet another way to watch television?
 Catch-up services, like the iPlayer of the BBC in Britain and Hulu in the United States, have attracted millions of users on the Internet, allowing them to fit TV viewing into busy schedules. But they have been available only on computers. 
 The new technology, called hybrid television because it uses over-the-air transmission as well as broadband connections, would do more. 
 Supporters of the technology say it will open up possibilities like those enabled by the iPhone from Apple, which allows independent developers to create customized applications. Imagine watching a cooking program that ended with a page of links to similar, archived ones, for example, or to the Web sites of online retailers selling the ingredients.
 ''This crosses the Rubicon,'' said Gavin Patterson, chief executive of the retail division of BT, the British telecommunications company, which has joined the BBC and two other broadcasters, ITV and Five, in the hybrid TV enterprise called Project Canvas. ''It is truly the moment when the Internet and the television come together.''
 There are already plenty of ways to watch television shows on a computer, and rudimentary Internet-enabled televisions have been on the market for several years. But generally, these options allow only separate Web surfing or television viewing.
 Many broadcasters have been wary of embracing the Internet for fear of cannibalizing their audiences and undermining more lucrative television advertising. But now, with TV ad revenue plunging anyway during the recession, some broadcasters are reconsidering. And even European public television providers, which are less reliant on advertising -- or, in the case of the BBC, entirely free of it -- worry about how they will maintain audiences when other media options are proliferating.
 Richard Halton, who leads the BBC's work on so-called Internet protocol television, said Project Canvas, as the hybrid TV partnership is called, was a natural outgrowth of Freeview, a digital, over-the-air TV system that beams out dozens of channels, much like cable and satellite services, but for no charge. It is the main TV system in 10 million of the 25 million British homes with televisions.
 Indeed, Canvas is called a hybrid technology because it would use the Freeview system to provide regularly scheduled programming, while a broadband connection would deliver Internet services as well as on-demand content. While some of these programs might require payment, nobody would have to subscribe. 
 Before Canvas supplants Freeview, though, it faces regulatory scrutiny. The BBC's involvement in the project could face opposition from British Sky Broadcasting, the leading pay-TV provider in Britain, which resents the BBC's expansion into new areas. The BBC Trust, which oversees the BBC, is set to rule this autumn on whether Project Canvas will proceed.
 Unlike existing pay-TV services, Project Canvas would be open to rival providers, each of which could offer its own package of movies, sports or other programming. All of this would be organized in a single electronic program guide, controlled by one remote device and accessible via a search engine. To use these services, viewers would need new set-top boxes, which the partners aim to have on the market next year.
 The German-led hybrid TV project, which has lined up support from several French broadcasters and a range of technology companies, is less far-reaching, seeking simply to create a set of hybrid TV standards for broadcasters and makers of TVs and set-top boxes. Broadcasters could then create and market their own hybrid services.
 Klaus Merkel, project manager for Hybrid Broadcast Broadband Television, or HbbTV, at the German Institute for Broadcast Technology, a partner in the project, said it would be easier to bring new services to market if no ''gatekeeper'' were involved.
 Some televisions soon to be introduced in Germany will be able to connect directly to the hybrid services, he said. 
 Mr. Halton at the BBC says he hopes that Canvas will be in use for the 2012 Olympic Games. 
 ''You open up this huge world of potential content and services,'' Mr. Halton said. ''It's about democratizing the living room.''

HEADLINE: Cash Incentive Program for Poor Families Is Renewed

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
An experimental antipoverty program that pays poor families up to $5,000 a year for going to regular medical checkups, attending school and keeping jobs has been extended for a third year. 
 Linda I. Gibbs, the deputy mayor for health and human services, said she was encouraged by some early results in the education component of the program that showed students improved their attendance and passed more exams when they were rewarded with cash. 
 ''I would say that these are modest and significant,'' Ms. Gibbs said of the findings. ''And in some senses surprising, for the first few months of a new program.'' 
 It is still too early to tell if the program will be successful. Results are not yet available in the work and health categories of the program, said James Riccio, a research director for M.D.R.C., a nonprofit policy research organization that helped with the initial design and conducted the analysis of the early results. 
 ''All we have is the tip of the iceberg,'' Mr. Riccio said. ''It's an extremely partial picture. It's also a limited picture because the first-year data really represent what we consider a startup year.''
 Conditional cash transfer programs, as they are known, have gained some popular support but there are only a few signs that they are working. The World Bank said in a policy report in February that there was ''good evidence'' that the programs ''have improved the lives of poor people.'' On Tuesday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg will talk about the city's experience at a conference in Manhattan that will kick off a new antipoverty program of the Organization of American States.
 His administration released a 12-page preliminary report analyzing the first findings from its program, which began in 2007 with $50 million in private financing, including money from the mayor's foundation. The report covers the first school year of the program, from fall 2007 to spring 2008. 
 High school students in the program improved their attendance, a 12 percent gain over the control group, which did not receive cash rewards for attendance. Compared with the control group, 9 percent more students in the program passed at least one Regents exam.
 Students who attended class 95 percent of the time received $50 every two months. They received $600 for passing a Regents exam. 
 Families chosen to participate in the program lived in high-poverty neighborhoods in the Bronx, Brooklyn or Manhattan. 
 More than $11 million has been distributed so far to the 2,400 low-income families participating in the program, formally called Opportunity NYC Family Rewards, which has a $42 million annual budget. It is modeled on Oportunidades, a popular program in Mexico. A separate program pays high school students in poor neighborhoods who pass Advanced Placement exams.
 Although cash-reward programs have gained fans, they also have been a target for criticism, from liberals who consider it patronizing to treat poverty as a behavioral problem and conservatives who say that rewards will condition people to perform fundamental tasks only when they are being paid. 
 Families are paid $150 a month for keeping a full-time job, for example, and $100 every six months for each family member older than 5 who goes for a dental checkup and cleaning. 
 The typical family in Opportunity NYC has increased its annual income by nearly $3,000 in the last two years, city officials said. Four percent of the enrolled families have not fulfilled any of the incentives and therefore have received no cash. 
 While high school students showed gains in attendance and test performance, elementary and middle school students did not show the same improvements.
 Those findings mirrored the experience of the Grant family in Harlem, which has been participating in the program for two years. Lucille Grant, 41, who has six children in the program, said it had been more effective for her teenage children. 
 ''It gives them an incentive to try harder,'' said Ms. Grant, who declined to say how much money her family had received. ''Who's going to get an A this time, who's going to pass such-and-such test, who's going to get high attendance this time. Things like that.'' 
 ''It's made them a little bit more committed to their schoolwork,'' she added. 
 Money for the program's third year came from the Rockefeller Foundation and Bloomberg Philanthropies, but not the Robin Hood Foundation, which helped with initial financing. 
 David Saltzman, the executive director of the Robin Hood Foundation, said the board will not vote until late September on whether the foundation will renew its support. 
 ''We're thrilled with our partnership with the city and the results are very, very promising,'' he said. 
 Mr. Bloomberg first announced the program in March 2007 as part of his plan to reduce poverty during his second term as mayor. 
 A comprehensive report of the program will be completed by the end of the year.

HEADLINE: Now, an Invention Inventors Will Like

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The world can be a rough place for independent inventors. They can often find themselves in court, battling big corporations, spending piles of money on lawyers and leaving it up to judges and juries to determine the value of their hard-won patents.
 That could be changing. Wrangling over patents is beginning to move out of the courtroom and into the marketplace. A flurry of new companies and investment groups has sprung up to buy, sell, broker, license and auction patents. And venture capital and private equity is starting to pour into the field.
 The arrival of these new business-minded players, according to patent experts and economists, could lead to a robust marketplace for patents, where value is determined not so much by court judgments but by buyers and sellers, perhaps, someday, like eBay.
 And patents, after all, are ideas. Any market mechanisms that speed up the process of figuring out what a patent is worth should hasten the flow of ideas into the economy, accelerating the pace of innovation, policy experts say. 
 ''What you want is a market that can promote innovation and reduce the huge costs of litigation,'' said Robert P. Merges, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley and a director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology. ''And that market is starting to take shape.''
 A classic small-inventor firm, Zoltar Satellite Alarm Systems, is planning to sample that market by auctioning off its patents next month. Professor Merges and other patent experts point to it as an intriguing case to watch.
 To date, the Zoltar story has been one of innovation, persistence and litigation. One founder of the company, Dr. Daniel Schlager, got his inspiration nearly two decades ago, crouched in medevac helicopters flying over Northern California. Locating people in distress was often difficult and costly, in time and lives. What was needed, he figured, was some sort of personal alarm device that transmitted a person's location.
 He sought out an old high-school classmate, William Baringer, a computer scientist and telecommunications expert. Using global positioning technology seemed promising, even though it was clunky and expensive at the time. They came up with a solution, and filed their first patent application in 1994 for a ''personal alarm'' device that used GPS technology. A year later, Zoltar was founded, and it filed for a patent on personal alarms with navigational receivers in cellphones that was granted in 1997.
 Zoltar's prospects got a lift after the Federal Communications Commission in 1996 required most wireless phones to be able to identify their location during 911 calls by 2001. The move opened a large potential market for Zoltar.
 The two men designed and built prototypes, hired a patent licensing expert and showed their technology to cellphone equipment makers in the late 1990s in the hopes of licensing it. ''It's an industry with huge companies who crosslicense patents with each other and tell little guys to take a hike,'' said Robert Megantz, a former general manager of licensing for Dolby and the consultant who worked with Zoltar in the late 1990s.
 Eventually, Zoltar's founders say, their ideas and designs started to turn up in big companies' products. They raised money, mostly from friends and family, hired lawyers and went to court. 
 In 2001, Zoltar sued Qualcomm, the cellphone chip-set maker. After three years, a jury found that Zoltar's patents were valid, but that Qualcomm was not infringing on them. The two sides settled in 2006.
 In 2005, Zoltar sued several handset makers including Motorola, LG and Samsung, and settlements were reached with all of them by 2007.
 By now, Zoltar has spent millions in legal fees, and collected millions in settlements. The company is ahead financially, Dr. Schlager said, but some of its 60 investors have not been paid back. Mr. Baringer remains a full-time consultant engineer, and Dr. Schlager is still an emergency-room physician, though he does not practice full time. 
 Today, the fast-growing makers of smartphones like Research in Motion, Apple, HTC and Nokia have no agreements with Zoltar. Dr. Schlager said he did not plan to sue them. Instead Zoltar will sell its patents in an auction, hoping for a faster, simpler and less risky payoff. 
 ''We felt this was the way to go,'' Dr. Schlager said. ''It's an option that wasn't available a few years ago.''
 The auction will be run by Pluritas, a patent broker based in San Francisco. Robert Aronoff, its managing director, says Zoltar has strong, court-tested patents that apply to a huge industry, at a time when there is an increasingly brisk market for intellectual property. ''They are entering into this vastly changed marketplace with a hot property,'' he said.
 Whether the patents will prove to be a hot property is not clear. ''They were certainly innovative over the years, but I do think there is a question here if the industry and technology has passed them by,'' said Professor Merges of Berkeley. 
 Mr. Baringer insists this is not the case. ''We continue to see our designs and concepts implemented every day'' in smartphones, he said.
 In an auction, of course, the patents' value will be judged by bidders, which could be handset makers, but also patent-buying groups like Intellectual Ventures and Rational Patent Exchange and Allied Security Trust, a nonprofit organization. 
 Other players in the emerging patent marketplace are specialized investment banks, brokers and licensing companies including Acacia Technologies, Altitude Capital Partners, Intertrust, IPotential, Ocean Tomo, Rembrandt IP Management and Thinkfire. Venture capitalists are also interested in this field -- Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, for example, is backing Rational Patent Exchange, a company that buys reservoirs of patents in crucial fields and charges fees to corporate ''members,'' who participate as a defensive tactic to limit potential patent litigation costs. 
 The long-term vision at Rational, said Randy Komisar, a partner at Kleiner, is to become a marketplace or clearinghouse, perhaps the way Ascap is for copyrighted music, collecting fees and distributing payments to artists.
 ''The goal is to be a place where the patentholder is fairly compensated, but the corporate users have access to technology with minimal transaction costs,'' Mr. Komisar said. ''It has the potential to make innovation more efficient and less risky for both sides.''
 But some patent experts question how far the marketplace model can be extended to patents. They note that patents are typically trickier to value than financial investments like stocks or bonds.
 ''Yes, you can move in the direction of trading markets for patents, but these are complicated assets that are individualized and hard to value,'' said Josh Lerner, an economist at the Harvard business school. ''They are more like works of art than stocks.''

HEADLINE: Europeans Say U.S. Lacks Will On Climate

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and JAMES KANTER; John M. Broder reported from Washington, and James Kanter from Brussels.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As world leaders gather in New York for the highest-level conference yet on climate change, European leaders are expressing growing unease about the United States' stance in international talks aimed at reaching a global agreement in Copenhagen in December.
 Officials of several European countries have cited what they see as a lack of political will on the part of the United States to adequately address climate change. The American reluctance to accept any agreement that would require legally binding and internationally enforceable targets for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could doom the Copenhagen session, they said. 
 Ahead of this week's climate talks at the United Nations, the Europeans also expressed little hope that the United States Senate would act on a climate bill before the Copenhagen talks begin. They said the lack of domestic consensus sows doubt about whether the United States can keep any pledges it makes at Copenhagen, either on the level of reductions in global warming emissions or on financial commitments to help developing nations adapt to a changing climate. 
 Inaction in the Senate also limits the flexibility of America's chief climate negotiator, Todd Stern. 
 The Obama administration is trying to satisfy European demands for firm targets and timetables, while reassuring a wary Senate that it is not signing on to a system that would impose steep economic costs on the United States that are not shared by developing countries like China and India. 
 Although the administration and its allies in Congress say they are deeply committed to meaningful action on climate change, they do not want to repeat the experience of Kyoto, Japan, in 1997, when the Clinton administration signed an international agreement that was repudiated by the Senate because it made few demands on the developing world. The United States never ratified the agreement, called the Kyoto Protocol. 
 John Ashton, the British foreign secretary's special representative for climate change, said several large gaps need to be closed among the major industrialized countries before there could be any hope of success in Copenhagen.
 Chief among them, he said, is the ''ambition gap'' between the United States and the nations of the European Union. While the United States discusses the broad outlines of climate policy, the Europeans have already pledged to cut their emissions by 20 percent by 2020, and more deeply if there is an international agreement. 
 The Europeans say a bill passed by the House in June showed American goodwill but still fell short of the European target and what scientists say is necessary to limit global temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius over the planet's temperature early in the Industrial Revolution, which means limiting future changes to about 2 degrees Fahrenheit above current temperatures. This limit is the internationally accepted goal.
 The Senate has yet to act, but its targets are likely to be less ambitious.
 Mr. Ashton said that the path forward is clear, but that politics are hampering movement in the United States and several other large countries. ''There is no technological obstacle. There is no macroeconomic obstacle,'' said Mr. Ashton, in Washington late last week for a meeting of major industrial countries on climate change. ''The barriers are political.''
 John Bruton, the European Commission ambassador to the United States, was less diplomatic in a statement on Thursday.
 ''The United States is just one of the 190 countries coming to this conference,'' Mr. Bruton said, referring to the Copenhagen meeting in December. ''But the United States emits 25 percent of all the greenhouse gases that the conference is trying to reduce. Is the U.S. Senate really expecting all the other countries to make a serious effort on climate change at the Copenhagen conference in the absence of a clear commitment from the United States?''
 Mr. Stern sharply denied an ''ambitions gap'' with the Europeans, but he acknowledged that his bargaining position was limited by what the Senate was willing to accept. He said he would not repeat the mistakes of Kyoto. 
 ''The Europeans have a particularly warm affection for Kyoto, but we don't,'' Mr. Stern said. ''It has been my view from the beginning that unlike what happened in Kyoto we need to have our international and domestic postures in sync, so there is domestic and political support for whatever it is we do. We don't want the cart before the horse this time.''
 Mr. Stern added that the Senate was embroiled in a difficult debate on health care and that the administration was moving ahead on its own on a number of climate-related policies, including major new auto efficiency standards.
 ''It may be that some people on the other side of the pond don't understand the system that well,'' Mr. Stern said with a note of exasperation, ''but that's -- that is the way our system works, and we're pushing ahead.''
 Fundamentally dividing the United States and the European Union are questions on how any global climate agreement would be monitored and enforced. The Europeans are committed to a system, similar to that in the Kyoto agreement, under which nations set numerical targets and timetables for emissions reductions, bound together in a global trading scheme and enforced by the United Nations climate change directorate. 
 The United States instead is now exploring a ''pledge and review'' system, under which individual nations would set their own targets that are, in the jargon, ''measurable, reportable and verifiable'' but enforced by domestic -- not international -- law.
 Even as Europeans publicly press the United States to produce firm commitments, they also do not want to be blamed for undermining chances of an agreement by taking an unrealistic stance with the United States.
 In recent days, some leaders signaled they could soften their demands. 
 Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, said that he ''could imagine other ways of binding'' nations to their pledges besides a full-blown treaty.
 Stavros Dimas, the European Union commissioner for the environment, said he was prepared to use an alternative form of agreement to the Kyoto accord to give the United States the broadest opportunity to join a new agreement in Copenhagen. 
 ''In the United States, you know, Kyoto is a dirty word,'' Mr. Dimas said in an interview on Friday.
 Mr. Dimas said those alternatives included amending the Kyoto Protocol, abolishing it or adopting new treaties or protocols tailored to suit different countries.
 Mr. Stern said that Australia and South Korea have put forward proposals in recent days that could narrow the gaps between the United States and Europe and also between the industrialized and the developing nations. 
 The Australian plan sets out a schedule of commitments by all nations to reduce their emissions below a certain baseline level and regularly report progress toward those goals. The South Koreans proposed a registry that would provide a blueprint against which developing countries could track their reductions against a business-as-usual scenario.
 All countries, Mr. Stern said, are taking steps now to reduce their emissions. 
 ''It is clearly the case that countries, including the developing countries, are doing a lot at home,'' he said. ''The question is how to capture that in an international agreement.''

HEADLINE: Film Finds Hope Living Amid Newark's Troubles

BYLINE: By RICHARD G. JONES

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
By the time Cory A. Booker was sworn in as this embattled city's mayor in 2006, the mythologizing was already well under way.
 There was Mr. Booker's Ivy League pedigree. There was the support of celebrities like Brad Pitt. And, to the chagrin of Mr. Booker's detractors, even his defeats were celebrated: ''Street Fight,'' the 2005 documentary that chronicled his first run for major office -- ending with a loss to the five-term mayor Sharpe James -- was nominated for an Academy Award.
 ''Brick City,'' a five-part documentary about Newark that begins Monday night on the Sundance Channel, strives to avoid hagiography or merely re-exploring ground that has already been well covered about Mr. Booker and his ambitious -- some might say quixotic -- plans to revitalize Newark.
 With the actor Forest Whitaker as executive producer and the veteran documentary filmmakers Marc Levin and Mark Benjamin as creators and directors, ''Brick City'' was filmed over the last half of 2008, when Newark, using new crime-fighting strategies, had begun to make significant progress in reducing the city's murders. Newark ended 2008 with its lowest murder rate in five years. 
 Mr. Whitaker said in an interview last week that he was drawn to the project largely because of the dynamism of Mr. Booker, who is part of a wave of young African-American political leaders.
 ''What we have here is what the journey entails,'' Mr. Whitaker said of Mr. Booker's efforts to reclaim Newark, which has been in decline at least since its 1967 riots. ''It'' -- the documentary -- ''stands, hopefully, as a testament of the ability to change your environment.''
 ''Brick City,'' nimbly shot in a fly-on-the-wall style, is bound to be compared to the HBO drama ''The Wire,'' about the urban challenges facing Baltimore. Each has multiple, contrapuntal story lines focusing on City Hall, the police and the streets.
 But, as Mr. Booker said in an interview last week, ''The power of this film is that it deals with real people.''
 And some of the most compelling characters in ''Brick City'' are those whom few outside of this city know: the Street Doctor, a former felon who ministers to troubled youth with his group, the Street Warriors; Ali Muslim, another ex-convict who has used a job with the Newark sanitation division to turn his life around; King Sau, leader of a support group for the relatives of murder victims; and Dashaun (Jiwe) Morris, a young member of the Bloods gang who is balancing his sudden success as an author with maintaining his credibility with other gang members.
 The emotional and narrative fulcrum of the documentary are Jayda and Creep, star-crossed lovers in the tradition of Shakespeare with a South Ward twist; she is a Blood and he is a Crip.
 During the documentary the young couple deal with an unplanned pregnancy, Creep's uncertainty about being in a committed relationship and an unresolved assault charge that threatens to subvert Jayda's attempts to turn her life around as a mentor for girls. 
 ''We just wanted to show the young kids that there's a better way,'' said Creep, whose real name is Darel Evans, when asked about participating in the project. ''I'm still a Crip. But I want to change the way people are thinking.''
 The couple's often stormy relationship -- one onscreen moment capturing an argument about Creep's apparent infidelity ends with Jayda threatening to go to an abortion clinic -- serves as a metaphor for the challenges faced by many young Newark residents who try to leave their troubled pasts behind.
 ''Where you live, all of that, it doesn't determine how far you can go in life,'' Creep said, adding of the documentary: ''It showed change, it showed growth in our relationship and in Newark, period.''
 At the documentary's screening at the National Cable and Television Association's headquarters in Washington last week, some of the changes in Creep's and Jayda's life were apparent as the couple mingled with officials from the Sundance Channel and other well-wishers.
 In another part of the room Mr. Booker posed for photographs with Mr. Whitaker, Mr. Benjamin and Mr. Levin in front of a life-size poster advertising the series while Garry F. McCarthy, Newark police director, hobnobbed and munched on hors d'oeuvres.
 Mr. Benjamin said that the project began as an exploration of gang life in Newark and the city's stunningly high murder rate -- the city, with a population of 281,400, averaged 90 murders a year from 1985 to 2005 -- and, particularly, how the killings have torn a hole in the city's population of young African-American men.
 ''What's going on in Newark is a war at home,'' said Mr. Benjamin, who has also collaborated with Mr. Levin on other projects, including ''Gang War: Bangin' in Little Rock.'' ''If you had Caucasians being killed at the rate black men are being killed, you'd have a peacekeeping force come in. In Newark you get five one-hour documentaries.''
 ''Brick City'' -- the title is drawn from Newark's nickname and a nod to its toughness -- may not be as Panglossian as other news media outlets have been in covering Mr. Booker. But critics say it could have taken an even a harder look. ''Mayor Booker being perceived as the savior of Newark -- that in the minds of many people is off-putting,'' said Clement A. Price, a history professor at Rutgers University-Newark. ''Newark has many people who have for many, many years been trying to enrich the life and the culture of the city.''
 Since taking office Mr. Booker has made uneven progress at addressing issues like joblessness (the city's unemployment rate is more than 14 percent), property crimes remain intractable (robberies were up by 17 percent for the year as of last month), and most Newark public schools are so dysfunctional that they remain under state control.
 If nothing else, the documentary may bring Newark a level of attention that goes beyond its longtime role as a punch line for what Mr. Booker called ''the Jay Lenos of the world.''
 Nevertheless, Mr. Price added, some Newark residents are concerned about whether the documentary will do justice to the sense of momentum -- however tentative -- that many believe is taking hold here.
 ''My generation has been about reintroducing Newark to the nation,'' Mr. Price said. ''The question is: Is this the reintroduction we wanted?''

HEADLINE: Investment In a City Of Struggles

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
 When Leon Panetta, the director of the C.I.A., showed up in Dearborn, Mich., to build bridges and do some recruiting for the agency in a suburb of Detroit that has a huge population of Arab Americans, it was big news. Big enough that Bobby Ghosh, one of Time magazine's experienced correspondents, showed up at the traditional evening feast that breaks the fast every day of the month of Ramadan.
 But instead of hot-footing it back to Washington with Mr. Panetta, Mr. Ghosh headed out for coffee with Fay Beydoun, the executive director of the American Arab Chamber of Commerce in Dearborn, and Baha Saad, an influential restaurateur in Detroit and Dearborn. He asked them not just about the evening's events but about Detroit, the nearby urban math problem no one seems to be able to solve. At the end of the conversation, Mr. Ghosh got up and said, ''I'll be back soon.''
 After meeting with them, he didn't go to a hotel but to a house where Steven Gray, a correspondent for Time magazine and Time.com, and Rick Tetzeli, a senior editorial executive at Time Inc., were chatting with Lisa Gibbs, a senior writer at Money magazine who ran a forum that night with local real estate agents about Detroit's huge number of foreclosures and freakishly depressed real estate market. 
 It is not an academic issue for Time Inc. As part of a companywide decision to spend a year in Detroit, Time Inc. bought the house where the forum was held and where its reporters will stay while they do stories here. The house is on a grand street flanked by huge trees in the West Village neighborhood, with six bedrooms and four bathrooms. In any other city in America, it would be worth well over half a million dollars. Mr. Tetzeli, the former managing editor at Entertainment Weekly who is leading the project, led the search, and Time Inc. bought the house for $99,000, or more than $85,000 over the current average home price in Detroit because most of the houses being sold have been foreclosed. 
 There are a few reasons for that. Detroit has room for two million people, but there are only about 900,000 left. Nature and entropy are having their way with vast stretches of Detroit, a city that has been punished by the implosion of the auto industry but that began failing in fundamental ways many years before that. Thousands of homes have fallen down and been hauled away, leaving behind a patchwork of empty lots.
 The biggest vibe in many of these neighborhoods is not one of fear, but for a visitor, loneliness. Even in the downtown area, it's as if a directive has gone out to flee, and the ones who remain missed the memo. Big-city worries over congestion, parking and crowding seem very far away in Detroit.
 Time Inc.'s editor in chief, John Huey, authorized the purchase of the house and asked the various editors of his magazines and Web sites to think about Detroit stories. For the next year, reporters from Time, Fortune, Money, Essence and Sports Illustrated, along with their Web sites and CNNmoney, will be doing stories out of this city as part of ''Assignment Detroit.''
 A video that begins playing Monday on the CNNmoney site describes a city where people pay $4 for a latte on one corner -- if they can find it -- and $10 for a rock of cocaine on the other. An article in Sports Illustrated by Lee Jenkins describes the division-leading Tigers as a kind of a hopeful beacon amid the murk. 
 Given the economic challenges that Time Inc. and the rest of publishing face back in New York, the one-year project in Detroit seems all at once ambitious, oddly timed and ironic.
 ''It is all of those things, and more,'' said Mr. Huey, who went to the house last week for a welcome party that included not only David Bing, the mayor of Detroit, but also the Detroit rocker and rapper Kid Rock, who brought a keg of local beer and a big ''D'' to hang over the fireplace.
 ''If you are asking me whether, because of the stuff we are all going through in publishing, I might have a little more empathy toward the troubles of others, the answer is yes, but that's not really why we are there,'' Mr. Huey said.
 ''It sounds grandiose, but it is one of the great stories of our time,'' he said. ''Detroit is like a prism on any story you want -- social, economic, health care, race, education -- it is all there. And it is all there in extremis.''
 According to a piece on CNNmoney, not a single national grocery store operates here within the city limits, and a year ago this month, the mayor, Kwame M. Kilpatrick, resigned after pleading guilty to obstruction of justice. It has as many murders as cities more than four times its size, the majority of which go unsolved, and half of the people in the city are estimated to be functionally illiterate. Unemployment is above 25 percent, and the real number of people who are not working may be twice that. Torn asunder by riots in 1967, Detroit was never a pretty picture after that, but as a reporter, I haven't seen anything like modern Detroit since covering Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.
 ''Yes, but Katrina happened over the course of a few days, and it's been going on in Detroit for 40 years,'' said Daniel Okrent, a Detroit native, a former editor and writer for Time Inc., and a former public editor for The New York Times. He is writing a cover article on the city for Time magazine that will be out later this week. But is a magazine company that has its own troubles merely changing the subject by putting on a safari helmet and buying a house in the most dysfunctional city in America?
 ''Whenever you show initiative and enterprise in journalism besides covering a press conference or other preordained events, what isn't a stunt?'' Mr. Okrent said. ''I think it's great that we are trying something big, something significant, when the rest of the business is pulling in its horns.''
 Mr. Gray is anchoring the coverage and the house in Detroit, blogging about the city for the next year and doing stories as they occur.
 ''I grew up in New Orleans, and I can tell you that the fight for very basic things like decent food is a daily battle,'' Mr. Gray said. 
 Mr. Ghosh described Detroit as a ''cautionary tale for urban planners, for social workers, for the rest of us. Everything that is happening elsewhere because of the economy started here a long time ago. It's like a petri dish of all the things that have gone wrong.''
 But big stories have to have texture, and there has to be the possibility of uplift.
 ''There are individual efforts, amazing stories, and there is a feeling here that things might get better,'' said Mr. Tetzeli, who once taught school in the city. ''The mayor is a very serious person, the opposite of the one who came before him, and we are coming across people and stories all the time that suggest that things will get better here.''
 Much of this story has already been told, and told well, by The Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News, daily newspapers that have reduced home delivery to three times a week, relying on the Web to deliver news the rest of the week.
 ''We're not here to fill some gap in coverage,'' Mr. Tetzeli said. ''The Free Press and The Detroit News have done some great work under difficult circumstances, including winning a Pulitzer this year,'' he said, sitting at Slows, a barbecue restaurant. ''We are here because we think Detroit stories, about recovery and the failure to recover, have resonance nationally because of the recession.''
 Mr. Huey said there were plenty of risks in the investment, including the possibility that people may not want to read a bunch of stories about a city on a big, long losing streak.
 ''How many games have the Detroit Lions lost in a row?'' Nineteen, as of Sunday. ''One of these days, the Lions are going to win a game. It's going to happen,'' he said. ''And when they do, it's going to be a pretty good day for us to be in Detroit.''

HEADLINE: In Lean Times, Miami Pays Most of Cost for New Ballpark

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
The push for a new baseball stadium here began the day the Florida Marlins first took the field in 1993. While city after city worked with major league teams around the country to help build nearly two dozen stadiums, the Marlins were left to play -- and endure countless rain delays -- in a cavernous football stadium in front of thousands of empty orange seats.
 Then the recession came along, and the team got what it wanted.
 Miami and Miami-Dade County have agreed to cover three-quarters of the projected $645 million cost to build the Marlins a home with a retractable roof and four huge parking garages. In return, the city and the county will receive no new revenue from the park, and the team can keep all the money from the 50 luxury suites, concessions and advertising, as well as from naming rights, which alone could generate more than $100 million. 
 Such generous terms were not uncommon during good times, before city and county officials faced yawning budget gaps, potential layoffs and cuts in social services. Yet they forged ahead, anyway, largely dismissing voter opposition and the lessons learned elsewhere that new stadiums sometimes fail to deliver the economic punch promised in forecasts and that the public financing for them can handcuff future generations.
 The deal was a fresh reminder that even during a recession, sports hold sway over communities regardless of the potential costs.
 ''Outside of Fidel becoming part owner of the team, nothing would have stopped the deal,'' said Carlos A. Gimenez, one of the three Miami-Dade County commissioners who voted against the agreement earlier this year. ''I'm not anti-baseball, but I'm anti-bad deal. Anyone with any sense can see this is cockeyed.''
 Backers of the stadium, which is expected to open in 2012, say building it makes sense because it could create more than 2,700 jobs and $300 million in economic output without adding new taxes. Instead, existing hotel bed taxes that are earmarked for tourism-related projects and are often paid by out-of-town visitors are supposed to cover much of the debt for the 37,000-seat stadium and the parking garages. Lawmakers dismiss concerns that the general fund, which pays for public services like the police and schools, will have to be tapped if hotel taxes come up short. 
 ''We contemplated a downturn in the economy over the next several years and slow growth after that,'' said George Burgess, the manager of Miami-Dade County. ''The timing of the payments was to allow for significant time for the tourist economy to rebound.''
 Tourism, however, is no sure bet. The number of visitors in South Florida dropped after Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and again after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. And in the first seven months this year, hotel tax receipts in metropolitan Miami fell 18.5 percent from the same period in 2008, according to government figures.
 The economic benefits could also prove illusory, analysts say, because spending at new stadiums often replaces money spent at old ones or comes at the expense of spending at theaters, restaurants and other entertainment sites.
 Eager to get the project rolling, Miami-Dade issued its bonds over the summer, when the municipal bond market was in flux. The county paid nearly a full percentage point more in interest to issue its bonds than if it had waited a few months. The Marlins agreed to buy the last $7 million of bonds that the county was unable to sell to the market.
 As the recession has revealed, some conservative forecasts elsewhere proved too optimistic. In 1996, officials in Hamilton County, Ohio, expected their local sales tax revenue to grow 3 percent a year when they agreed to add a half-penny to pay for stadiums for the Cincinnati Reds and the Bengals. Instead, it has since grown 1.6 percent per year on average and fallen nearly 10 percent this year, forcing lawmakers to consider cutting the schools budget.
 ''Cincinnati is a smaller market, but it underscores that all these projects have risks, and Miami has to understand in the depths of this recession it may take longer to recover than people think,'' said Mark Rosentraub, the author of ''Major League Losers,'' which examined stadium deals nationwide. Rosentraub called Miami's agreement ''reckless.''
 A poll in 2008 commissioned by a prominent critic of the Miami plan showed that a majority of voters opposed a stadium financed by hotel taxes. Some business leaders wanted to use the taxes to improve the city's convention center, which they said would attract more out-of-town visitors and create long-term jobs. But Miami's mayor, Manny Diaz, has made the stadium one piece of his campaign to revitalize the city. 
 A deal was signed in early 2008, before the housing bubble burst. Lawsuits slowed the approval process, and the economy eventually tanked. Yet Diaz and the mayor of Miami-Dade, Carlos Alvarez, both in their last terms in office, refused to turn back. 
 ''Even as the numbers got worse, the mayors viewed it as an unacceptable political defeat, so they continued,'' said Dario Moreno, the director of the Metropolitan Center, a public-policy research group that was hired to do the poll by Norman Braman, a wealthy auto dealer who unsuccessfully sued to force a referendum on the matter. ''It was almost pure stubbornness and ego that made them press ahead even when all the numbers were turning sour.''
 The mayors declined to be interviewed for this article. But Helena Poleo, a spokeswoman for Diaz, said: ''We don't see it as a political issue; we see it as a community issue. For us, it's about creating jobs and improving the community and investing in that neighborhood.''
 Moreno and others do not begrudge the Marlins for seeking the best possible deal, although the team's owner, Jeffrey Loria, was criticized for dismantling the 2003 World Series championship team.
 The Marlins play in one of the nation's largest metropolitan areas but have among the smallest crowds despite two World Series titles in 17 seasons. The team blames the weather, including high humidity and persistent rain, for discouraging fans. 
 David Samson, the Marlins' president, said his team had the 11th-highest television ratings in baseball. Fans are out there, he said, but they will attend games in earnest only if they are played indoors. 
 ''We've battled fan anger and apathy,'' he said, walking past cranes, earthmovers and 110-foot columns rising out of the soil for the new stadium in Miami's Little Havana neighborhood. ''We said to our fans, if any money could be used for police or teachers, we won't use it.''
 Because the stadium is being built on the site of the old Orange Bowl, which lacked a tenant, no new land had to be acquired. The Marlins also agreed to cover cost overruns, to make Miami part of the team name and to give the city and the county a share of any profits if the franchise is sold within 10 years. 
 Construction costs are 10 percent to 20 percent lower than a few years ago, Samson said, and the team has not had to worry about crews leaving the job because of higher bids from competing developers, which happened during the housing bubble. The team received 6,000 job applications since work began in July.
 ''It's not the best time to open a stadium,'' he said. ''But it's a great time to build one.''

NEW YORK ON LESS:
 A Cheap Date
In Tough Times
 Dating is a complicated dance, even during the best of economic times. So now with the recession hitting many a pocket (or pocketbook, for the Sadie Hawkins set), daters across the city are finding creative ways to court.
 They've taken advantage of the city's free spaces like parks and pedestrian malls. They've traded expensive nights on the town for evenings at home with Netflix or streaming video on their laptop computers. They've swapped fancy dinners for home-cooked meals or a quiet spot in the park with a picnic and a favorite board game. 
 ''As the economy has tanked, our relationship has gotten better,'' said Maurice Watkins, 35, whose companion, Terry Glanville, 32, was beating him in a game of Trivial Pursuit on a recent afternoon in Central Park.
 ''We don't go out as much,'' said Ms. Glanville, who was recently laid off from a job in real estate. ''We do a lot of home cooking, things like this, taking advantage of the park and sites around New York, and bringing our own food and our games, and we have fun.''
 In the past, the couple said, they would routinely spend lots of time and money meeting friends for drinks after work and socializing. At the height of their spending, they would go out to eat three to four times a week.
 The recession has slowed them considerably. 
 ''I think we're probably saving like $500 a month,'' Mr. Watkins said.
 But the rough financial times have brought the couple closer together, they said.
 ''We have talked about our future and talked about marriage,'' Mr. Watkins said. ''This time actually builds a foundation for the mentality necessary to get married.''
 On the pedestrian mall on Broadway in Times Square on a busy evening , E. J. Bonilla and Melissa Oyola found an empty table and chairs, content among the waves of chaos surrounding them.
 This is date night.
 ''Ever since they hooked this place up, it's like a lifesaver,'' said Mr. Bonilla, 21. ''If you're with somebody, you're with them because you like each other. You shouldn't necessarily need something else to help you guys along.''
 The couple has cut back on their date-night spending.
 ''It wouldn't just be the movies,'' Ms. Oyola said. ''It'd be going out to eat, then desserts, then I'm thirsty. Then it'd be like. ...'' The list went on and the cash spent would add up, she said.
 At one point they had a conversation about money.
 ''I was like, 'Listen, I checked my bank account a couple times recently, and that's not cool,' '' Mr. Bonilla said. ''That little receipt that comes out of the A.T.M. -- it's not lying.'' TRYMAINE LEE VIDEO: Online: A video of couples taking advantage of free spaces.

HEADLINE: Brooklyn's Tide of Chains, Decidedly Local

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
The mandala logos appear every few blocks or so, each heralding another establishment tucked into a brownstone storefront, all bearing the generic name Area. Over here, it is a day spa. Over there, a children's clothing shop. Down a ways, a toy store.
 The brainchild of Loretta Gendville, a masseuse turned entrepreneur who lives in the neighborhood, the Area chain, which includes a yoga studio, has become a lifestyle institution along Smith and Court Streets in Brooklyn, the commercial arteries linking Boerum Hill, Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens.
 And it is far from the only one of its kind.
 While New Yorkers have been nervously eyeing the encroaching tide of national chains, fearing the stores will wash away all things small and charming, a different retail species has taken root in this still-gentrifying quarter: the chain that is distinctly, even aggressively, local. 
 Little empires of restaurants, bars, clothing stores and other establishments started by homegrown entrepreneurs have multiplied in this patch of brownstone Brooklyn, sending up new sprouts every few blocks. Within about a square mile, more than a dozen of these clusters have emerged since the late 1990s, mainly along a mile-long stretch of Smith Street connecting Atlantic Avenue to Hamilton Avenue. 
 And even in the dumps of a recession, as storefronts go dark in other parts of New York, the Smith Street boomlet churns on, drawing attention as a business model that might be replicated elsewhere.
 ''The cluster retail model really works,'' said the Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer, who has been looking to spur similar kinds of economic development in his borough because, he said, money spent in locally owned stores has a far greater economic benefit for the surrounding neighborhood than money spent in national chains.
 Robert W. Walsh, the city's commissioner of small business services, said that he had not seen as high a concentration of local chains anywhere in the city outside the Smith Street area, and that development advocates in other neighborhoods were courting the Brooklyn businesses to seed their revitalization efforts. ''I think this is a unique thing,'' Mr. Walsh said.
 A more common pattern is for a successful business to replicate itself in a new area, said Raymond J. Keating, the chief economist at the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, an advocacy and research group. 
 But along Smith Street, Mr. Keating said, opening related but slightly different outposts in close proximity has allowed owners to diversify and ''tap into these customers in a variety of different ways'' without necessarily cannibalizing their existing trade. In addition, he said, diversification can help business owners survive in tough times, as gains at one shop offset declines at another.
 The trend may have started with Alan Harding and Jim Mamary, who opened Patois, a bistro, on Smith Street in 1997 and soon peppered the area with a quirky mix of hangouts. As the real estate boom in Manhattan increasingly pushed pioneers a few subway stops into Brooklyn, a flood of other would-be mini-moguls rushed in.
 There are now the Franks -- as in Frank Falcinelli and Frank Castronovo -- who own two restaurants in Carroll Gardens, Frankies Spuntino and Prime Meats, and a coffeehouse, Cafe Pedlar, in Cobble Hill.
 There are the Stinky people -- Patrick Watson and Michele Pravda -- known for their cheekily named cheese-and-charcuterie store Stinky Bklyn, a wine bar, the JakeWalk, and a wine shop, Smith & Vine, all within two blocks of one another. 
 Loren Sosna of the home furnishings shop Environment 337 is opening a boutique, Retrospect, a few doors down. And Leslie and Jean-Jacques Bernat, the husband-and-wife team who run the bistro Provence en Boite and a nearby bed-and-breakfast, Les Sudistes, are starting another restaurant, La Petite Provence, in part of the old Patois space. 
 The expansions are in some ways natural outgrowths of establishing a loyal following, shopkeepers say. ''If they like the product, then they trust another store by the same people,'' said Melissa Murphy, who started her collection of Sweet Melissa bakery-restaurants in Cobble Hill in 1998.
 Some say the phenomenon is closely tied to the particular village rhythms of brownstone Brooklyn, where residents seek niche establishments for goods, services and entertainment within walking distance. 
 ''In Brooklyn, people stay in their neighborhood -- you have your one or two parks you go to and your coffee shops,'' said Ms. Gendville, the Area owner. ''I wanted to create little stores so that people didn't necessarily have to travel.''
 But the chains have proved so stable that many have expanded beyond Smith Street. Ms. Gendville now has children's clothing shops in Brooklyn Heights, Park Slope and Williamsburg, although she said she would consider consolidating some of the shops as the leases came up for renewal. 
 The Franks recently opened another Cafe Pedlar near their Frankies Spuntino on Clinton Street in Manhattan and plan to open a restaurant called Delightful Coffee Shop in Red Hook, Brooklyn, later this year. Ben and Michael Wiley, the brothers behind the Smith Street brewpub Bar Great Harry, are busy making a beer garden, Mission Dolores, out of an automotive shop on Fourth Avenue in Gowanus, Brooklyn. It is due to open in October.
 Certainly, this corner of Brooklyn did not invent the local restaurant-retail chain. In Manhattan, Danny Meyer anchored his empire of new American cooking around Union Square; the designer Marc Jacobs is still colonizing Bleecker Street in the West Village; and Bruce and Eric Bromberg rooted their Blue Ribbon restaurant franchise on Sullivan Street in SoHo.
 ''Management-wise, it's great to have restaurants near each other,'' Bruce Bromberg said. ''It creates a certain continuity because you see what's being made here, and a half an hour later you're in the other kitchen making sure things are being made correctly.'' 
 But the Boerum-Cobble-Carroll corridor seems even more concentrated, and has attracted people who got their starts in the food business with Manhattan empire builders like Mario Batali and David Bouley. The area encourages this sort of development, local businesspeople say, because its collection of storefronts provides small spaces at affordable prices and runs through several affluent neighborhoods. 
 ''You have a density of population that is for the most part pretty well educated, employed and, obviously, through basic aesthetics, is used to a certain quality of life,'' Mr. Falcinelli said. ''It's maybe not the top finance guy at Goldman Sachs -- it's the back office of Conde Nast, the writers, the producers.''
 Some Smith Street entrepreneurs had plans to expand from the beginning; for others, opening a new business has been a way to keep things fresh. As Ben Wiley put it, opening a new bar is less an expansion than an insurance policy. ''I was never like, 'Dude, let's have five or six bars -- live large,' '' he said, laughing. ''Four would be enough.''

HEADLINE: Idea for Badlands Raises Land-Use Fears

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: BISMARCK, N.D. 

 BODY:
Federal and state officials are at odds over listing about 12,000 acres of North Dakota Badlands on the National Register of Historic Places to recognize an area that inspired Theodore Roosevelt.
 The federal Forest Service and National Park Service are pushing for the designation to highlight the significance of the region, where Roosevelt ran his cattle more than a century ago. But ranchers and state officials fear it would hinder development and say local residents were not consulted.
 ''Our view is that it's benign,'' said Dave Pieper, the supervisor for the Forest Service's Dakota Prairie Grasslands. ''It's just an acknowledgment.'' 
 The National Register of Historic Places is the federal government's list of properties it considers worthy of preservation and recognition. The proposal for the historic designation includes land around the Theodore Roosevelt National Park Elkhorn Ranch and the Elkhorn Ranchlands, a private ranch that the Forest Service bought two years ago.
 ''It doesn't pose any restrictions,'' said Valerie Naylor, the superintendent of Theodore Roosevelt National Park in southwestern North Dakota. ''It's a nice recognition of its historical significance.''
 Jim Arthaud, a Billings County commissioner countered, ''If it's just a title, then why do we need it?'' He added: ''This is about locking the land up. So for them to say it will not do anything is completely bogus. The people in this county are nervous.''
 Mr. Arthaud said the historic designation could prevent oil and gas development in the area and lessen the amount of land open for grazing. He said it could also hinder plans for a bridge over the Little Missouri River, which local residents say is central to travel.
 Billings County officials want a crossing over the river to connect state Highways 16 and 85 in the Badlands. It would cut as much as 100 miles off commutes in the area, they say, as well as encourage economic development and reduce the response times of fire trucks and ambulances.
 An environmental review of the bridge project, required under federal law, began this year, said Doug Hecox, a spokesman for the Federal Highway Administration. Analyses for similar projects have taken up to five years, he said. But a listing on the national register ''wouldn't add any time or additional requirements'' for the bridge project, Mr. Hecox said.
 The federal government paid $4.8 million for the private ranch two years ago, and conservation groups contributed $500,000. 
 The Forest Service promised to keep allowing grazing and other activities, including oil and gas development, on the land.
 A historic designation would restrict land use as outlined in that agreement, said Gov. John Hoeven's staff lawyer, Ryan Bernstein.
 ''We believe the status change would add different layers of bureaucracy,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''We feel this is contrary to the original agreement.''
 The State Historic Preservation Review Board postponed action on the federal proposal last month. 
 ''Right now, it's been postponed indefinitely,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''It is a federal decision but we are very concerned that if it's done, they at least listen to locals and stakeholders in making the decision,'' he said. 
 Mr. Pieper, of the Forest Service, said federal officials now plan to have meetings with state and local officials on the nomination, though none are yet scheduled. He said there are nearly 13,600 historic designations nationwide, including 36 in North Dakota.

HEADLINE: Newspapers Have Not Hit Bottom, Analysts Say

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Despite some tentative optimism from Washington, Wall Street and Madison Avenue, people who monitor the newspaper business for a living say it has not yet hit bottom. But in what passes for good news these days, the free fall in newspaper advertising may be slowing, and specialists predict it will ease through 2009 and into 2010.
 With 10 days left in the third quarter, analysts, publishers and ad buyers say that ad revenue will be down about 25 percent industrywide from the third quarter last year, possibly a little less. They predict that the decline will be smaller in the fourth quarter. Several of them say the usual back-to-school uptick in newspaper advertising seems to have been a little better than in most years, if only because July and August were so weak. 
 Ordinarily, such numbers would be seen as catastrophic, but these times are not ordinary. The drop in combined print and digital ad revenue last year, 16.6 percent, according to the Newspaper Association of America, was the worst since the Depression. But it looks rosy next to 2009, when revenue fell 28.3 percent in the first quarter and 29 percent in the second.
 In the last few days, signs of life have been seen from struggling retailers, and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and others have speculated that the recession has ended. Media executives, including Rupert Murdoch, have talked about advertising starting to rebound. Last week, shares in several newspaper companies, including Gannett, McClatchy and The New York Times Company, jumped 10 percent or more, to their highest prices this year.
 Alexia Quadrani, an analyst at J. P. Morgan, said newspaper stocks had benefited from a trickle-down effect, as investors, hearing positive news about advertising, asked, ''What stocks are still looking relatively inexpensive among media stocks?'' She said ad revenue would show a percentage decline in the mid-20s for the third quarter, about 20 in the fourth quarter, and next year, ''more modestly negative, but still negative.''
 Several publishing executives said those numbers seemed about right. The executives, who insisted on anonymity because they are prohibited from discussing financial information until it is made public, also said they saw no particular justification for the recent spike in stock prices.
 If the rate of decline in advertising slows, it will largely be because 2008 grew steadily worse as the year wore on and the recession deepened, making year-to-year comparisons less stark. The figures for the fourth quarter of 2009 will be compared with the final quarter of 2008, when the financial markets were in crisis and newspaper advertising fell almost 20 percent, at that time the worst performance in generations.
 Roberta Garfinkle, director of print strategy at TargetCast TCM, was skeptical about any improvement in the third quarter, but said signs of recovery could appear in the fourth quarter.
 ''Newspapers will be the last media to get any ad comeback,'' Ms. Garfinkle said. ''But we're seeing more people wanting to have the conversation about doing some print advertising, where earlier we weren't even having the conversation.''
 Edward Atorino, with the Benchmark Company, a broker dealer, is one of the more optimistic analysts, predicting a decline in ad revenue of about 20 percent in both the third and fourth quarters.
 ''You've had Bernanke saying the economy is better, Murdoch saying advertising is getting better, broadcasting looks like it's in a recovery stage, even magazines may be picking up a bit,'' Mr. Atorino said. ''But for newspapers, I don't think I see much to cheer about yet.''
 Holiday advertising makes the fourth quarter the most crucial period for most media, but it is more so this year for publishers because they need to see signs that the numbers are leveling off. Analysts and publishers note that a slower decline is still a decline, and while display advertising may come back, the loss of classified ads to Web sites like Craigslist.org is generally seen as permanent.
 Publishers have been shedding expenses, eliminating jobs and raising subscription and newsstand prices, and many have also explored charging readers for access online.
 Still, advertising remains the main revenue source, and ''we have to see the bottom if these companies are going to survive,'' Ms. Quadrani said. ''They're doing an impressive job cutting costs, but there's only so much you can cut.''

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Bristling at Health Plan to Cover Early Retirees'' (''The Work-Up'' series, news article, Sept. 9) pegs health care coverage for early retirees as exclusively a labor issue. In fact, this is an issue for all Americans. 
 Small Business Majority, a national nonprofit, is working for America's 27 million small businesses and small-business owners.
 Today, small businesses provide 75 percent of all net new jobs and employ 52 percent of the private-sector work force. What hurts small businesses hurts America's economy. Not only are the majority of small-business owners between 55 and 64 years old -- a precarious window for personal health care coverage -- but they also face skyrocketing health care costs, which is hindering their ability to provide high-quality coverage to their employees.
 Our research has shown that an average of 86 percent of small-business owners cite affordability as the reason they do not offer health care to their employees, while an average of 68 percent of small-business owners believe that health care reform is needed to help fix the economy.
 The biggest problem facing America's small businesses and America's economy is unavailable, unaffordable health care. Emphasis on health care coverage for people between 55 and 64 is not just good for labor, it's good for the economy.

HEADLINE: Pointed Political Debate, Minus All the Shouting

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH JENSEN

 BODY:
POLARIZING political talk, overwrought in the extreme, is making for big headlines these days, so it is somewhat counterintuitive (or maybe just smart counterprogramming) that a program based on civilized, formal debate has chosen this moment to try to raise its profile. 
 The producers of the program of debates, begun three years ago and bearing the ungainly name of Intelligence Squared U.S., are teaming with a national magazine and a cable television network to expand their audience. 
 A new branding campaign, with ads of bright red and blue on a black background, carries the simple tag line ''Think twice.'' The ads have been appearing in Newsweek, and online in a small campaign that began last week on Observer.com, NYTimes.com and on some social media networks. A revamped Web site, intelligencesquaredus.org, made its debut on Thursday. 
 ''We wanted our brand to stand for: you can talk about a heated topic and look at it from two perspectives, instead of just looking at it with blinders on,'' said Dana Wolfe, the executive producer of the debates.
 IQ2US, as it sometimes calls itself, is a nonprofit initiative of the Rosenkranz Foundation, and its debates have been carried on NPR since they began in 2006. Working with its two new media partners, Newsweek magazine and Bloomberg Television, it will be greatly expanding exposure for the debates.
 The ads were created by the Treehouse Collective, an agency made up of moonlighting agency executives. ''We needed to make it a little more cosmopolitan and appeal to a slightly younger crowd,'' so the black was added to the red, white and blue, said the founder of Treehouse, who asked to remain anonymous so as not to jeopardize his full-time job. Treehouse, he said, also came up with the tag line ''so people understand what it is they do.''
 As in Britain, where the program originated, the centerpiece of Intelligence Squared U.S. is live ''Oxford style'' debates. They are to be held this year at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University, on topics like the United States policy toward Afghanistan and Pakistan and whether President Obama's economic policies are working.
 The premise, said Robert Rosenkranz, the foundation's founder, is to present an evening where the audience ''is not exposed to pure punditry and sound bites, where they can hear the flesh of an argument in an interesting venue with a good moderator and make their own decisions.'' 
 The debates, five each in the fall and spring, pit teams held to strict rules of engagement for nearly two hours. John Donvan of ABC News moderates, and the audience, which can ask questions, votes before and after. But it is the side which changes the most opinions that wins, not the one with the most votes. The audiences appear open to persuasion: in March 2007, when the premise was ''Global warming is not a crisis,'' 30 percent of the audience agreed going in and 46 percent agreed after it was over. 
 Debaters last season included Karl Rove, former adviser to President George W. Bush; the historian Niall Ferguson; and the painter Chuck Close. Former Vice President Dick Cheney was in the audience at the May 12 discussion of diplomacy with Iran, where his daughter Liz was a panelist. 
 For its first three years, the series grew on its own, starting out in a 300-seat auditorium; it moved to a 450-seat space last autumn. Ms. Wolfe said that with the move on Monday to the much larger site at N.Y.U., ''we felt now was the right time to raise our profile.'' Seats are $45 and include a cocktail reception. 
 Among this autumn's topics: ''Buy American/Hire American policies will fail,'' and ''Good riddance to mainstream media.'' 
 The taped versions distributed by NPR were carried by 185 stations last spring, and the podcasts ''do exceptionally well, too,'' said Eric Nuzum, NPR director of programming and acquisitions. 
 ''When you first hear it, it sounds very formal; then as you listen to it, it's actually quite interesting,'' Mr. Nuzum said. ''With all the opinion and debate in America today, having a space like that is actually precious and nice, where ideas can really be shared and people sit and listen.''
 Now the distribution is about to get much wider. Newsweek plans to devote a two-page editorial spread to each debate, and is running ads to encourage attendance and promote its involvement. Newsweek editors may participate as debaters, said Angela Leaney, Newsweek's chief marketing officer.
 ''It's all about better solutions that can come to problems and knotty issues if you debate them out,'' she said. ''We actually think it's an important mission.'' Ms. Leaney said that Newsweek and the series reach similar audiences and focus on similar issues. She declined to discuss the business arrangement.
 Bloomberg, which is revamping its evening programming, said it was not paying to use the debates but would cover the costs to produce hourlong edited versions of each one. 
 David Rhodes, who oversees Bloomberg Television U.S., said that in the week of each debate, the edited version would be broadcast on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday at 9 p.m. Eastern, between rebroadcasts of ''Charlie Rose,'' the PBS talk program to which the network recently acquired rights.
 ''We thought it was the kind of smart and insightful programming that we want to have on here,'' Mr. Rhodes said, adding that his network regularly covered issues like the debate over ''Buy American'' policies. 
 Peter Cook, who will introduce the edited versions of the debates for Bloomberg, said, ''It was Edward R. Murrow who said the box can shed light as well as heat, and I still firmly believe that.''

HEADLINE: W. Horace Carter, 88, a Publisher Whose Paper Challenged the Klan, Dies

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

 BODY:
W. Horace Carter, the editor and publisher of a small-town North Carolina newspaper whose stubborn, angry opposition to local activities of the Ku Klux Klan helped quell the expansion of the Klan in the Carolinas and won a Pulitzer Prize in 1953, died Wednesday while being transported from a hospital in Wilmington, N.C., to his home in nearby Tabor City. He was 88.
 The cause was a heart attack, the second one Mr. Carter had suffered within 10 days, his son, Russell, said. 
 On July 22, 1950, a Saturday, the Ku Klux Klan staged a parade, cars full of armed and hooded men, through Tabor City, on the border between North and South Carolina. Though without violence, the event was ominous, heralding a Klan recruiting drive in the area. Mr. Carter, the editor of The Tabor City Tribune, a weekly paper he had founded four years earlier, responded immediately. For the next issue, dated July 26, he composed a stern column of opinion under the headline: ''An Editorial: No Excuse for KKK.'' 
 ''The Klan, despite its Americanism plea, is the personification of Fascism and Nazism,'' he wrote. ''It is just such outside-the-law operations that lead to dictatorships through fear and insecurity.''
 Thus began Mr. Carter's campaign against the Klan, a fiercely antagonistic opposition to the organization's policies and methods and its very presence in Columbus County, N.C., and Horry County, S.C. Over three years, his paper ran more than 100 Klan-related stories and editorials that he wrote. They reported and commented on rallies, shootings, beatings and a series of floggings that eventually brought the Federal Bureau of Investigation to the region and ended with federal and state prosecutions of more than 100 Klansmen, including Thomas Hamilton, who was known as the Grand Dragon of the Association of Carolina Klans.
 Mr. Carter stood up to numerous personal threats against himself and his family. He was twice visited in his office by Hamilton, who promised retribution against The Tabor City Tribune and its advertisers. And though he more than once published letters defending the Klan in his paper, he found himself somewhat isolated by his community, where many people shared the Klan's pro-Christian, anti-Communist outlook and were roused as well by its white-supremacist exhortations. 
 ''He was a God-and-country kind of guy,'' Russell Carter said about his father. ''But he was committed to social justice, and he was not prepared for the fact that other people didn't see it that way. He had very meager support, especially early on.''
 The Tabor City Tribune was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for public service, which it shared with another local paper nearby, The Whiteville News Reporter, whose editor, Willard Cole, was a Carter ally. The citation read: ''For their successful campaign against the Ku Klux Klan, waged on their own doorstep at the risk of economic loss and personal danger, culminating in the conviction of over one hundred Klansmen and an end to terrorism in their communities.''
 Walter Horace Carter was born in Albemarle, N.C., near Charlotte, on Jan. 20, 1921. He was the first in his family to graduate from high school, and he attended the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, where he was editor of the student newspaper, The Tar Heel. He served in the Navy, in both the North Atlantic and the Pacific, during World War II. When he returned, he took a job as executive secretary of the Tabor City merchants association, and on the strength of that affiliation, he founded The Tribune. It is now called The Tabor-Loris Tribune, also covering Loris, S.C.
 Mr. Carter's first wife, Lucile, died in 1982. A second marriage ended in divorce. In addition to his son, who lives in Wilmington and now owns The Tribune, he is survived by his third wife, Linda Duncan Carter, whom he married in 1995; a brother, Mitchell, of Albemarle, N.C.; two daughters, Linda Carter Metzger of Lumberton, N.C., and Velda Carter Hughes of Greenville, S.C., 10 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
 Mr. Carter left newspapering in the 1970s, moving to Cross Creek, Fla., where he fished and wrote books and articles about the outdoors. But in the early 1990s, he returned to Tabor City and went back to The Tribune, continuing to write and edit the paper until just before his death. He often talked about the Klan battle, his son said, how the family had to move from place to place to stay safe, and how his wife, Lucile, supported him. 
 ''He acknowledged being scared, especially for his family,'' Russell Carter said. ''But he was a newspaperman.''

HEADLINE: Texas' Taj Mahal: Stadium Gets Cheers Long Before Kickoff

BYLINE: By THAYER EVANS

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Tex. 

 BODY:
Before Sunday's first regular-season N.F.L. game at the new Cowboys Stadium, a video tried to put the building's magnitude into perspective.
 The video displayed the Taj Mahal, the Great Wall of China and the Roman Colosseum before showing the football team's sleek $1.15 billion stadium. The crowd roared. The moment was exactly what Jerry Jones, the Cowboys' owner, had long envisioned as he sought to replace the team's old stadium in nearby Irving.
 Before Sunday's game, a 33-31 loss to the Giants, Jones proudly walked around the field and used a napkin to dab sweat from his brows as he peered at his stadium, which has been nicknamed Jerryworld. 
 ''I've got to have three Super Bowl days,'' Jones said. ''This is on a par with that feeling.''
 Among those in attendance at Sunday's game were former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura; Rudolph W. Giuliani, New York's former mayor; and former Cowboys greats like Roger Staubach, Tony Dorsett, Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith.
 ''The stadium is obviously a beautiful place to play,'' Giants Coach Tom Coughlin said. ''The crowd was in to it.''
 From a field-level suite near the southeast end zone, Skip Bird and Len Allen marveled at the stadium while drinking beers before kickoff.
 ''It's everything it's supposed to be,'' said Bird, 53, a developer who lives in Dallas. ''It's unbelievable, don't you think?''
 At the old Texas Stadium, Bird had four seats in a suite that he paid $13,000 for annually. 
 But he was a guest Sunday in the suite that Allen and a group of five families paid $2 million to have for the next 20 years. Allen described it as a ''makes no sense, you have more money than you should'' purchase. 
 The suite can accommodate 21 people. It also came with 14 tickets in the seventh row of stands between the 5- and 10-yard lines. The catering for the suites costs about $1,000 a game, Allen said.
 ''Just look at this place,'' said Allen, 45, an investor who lives in Dallas. ''It's amazing.''
 But Allen acknowledged feeling a tinge of guilt about the suite, given the nation's economic problems.
 ''I feel fortunate,'' he said.
 Outside the stadium, tailgaters reveled in anticipation in parking lots where some spaces cost $75. They grilled briskets, played a game called washers, drank plenty of beer and taunted Giants fans.
 The party continued inside, where Cowboys dancers with shiny silver go-go boots performed before a crowd of 105,121, the largest for a regular-season N.F.L. game. The record had been 103,467 for a 2005 game between San Francisco and Arizona at Azteca Stadium in Mexico City.
 The airy stadium covers 73 acres and has 3 million square feet. Its length is 900 feet from end-zone-retractable wall to end-zone-retractable wall. The four-sided, high-definition video board is 72 feet high and 160 feet wide. It would take 4,920 52-inch flat-panel televisions to equal its size.
 ''Only a small percent of our fans will ever be here,'' Jones said. ''They'll live vicariously through this.''
 For the last several weeks, Jones said he slept only two to three hours a night because of his excitement about the opening.
 ''I'm just ready,'' Jones said. ''I feel like this is what I've gotten ready for all these years is to be able to stand here.''
 N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell chatted with Jones before the game. During the conversation, the two men stared in awe at the stadium's enormous video board, which was the subject of controversy when it was hit by a punt during a preseason game.
 Goodell described the stadium as ''awesome.''
 ''It's terrific,'' he added. ''It's such a great thing for the fans. That's what's so remarkable. It's adding a whole new dimension for our fans to be able to experience N.F.L. football.''
 About 90 minutes before kickoff, Linda Sturdevant and her husband lined up in the club area that players go through from the locker room to the field to see the Giants.
 ''It's awesome,'' said Sturdevant, a 55-year-old homemaker. ''You know we do everything big in Texas. Leave it to Jerry.''
 Up in Section 414, Row 30, the last row in the stadium, Mike Allen eagerly awaited kickoff. This is his first year as a Cowboys season-ticket holder.
 Allen hardly seemed to mind that his line of vision stared directly at the video board and he had to look down to see the field. 
 ''They put the cheerleaders up there,'' Allen said of the video board. ''That's very entertaining.''
 Allen said he paid a one-time fee of $2,000 for his personal seat license, and $700 to $800 for his tickets this season. He flashed his ticket stub and planned to save it as a keepsake.
 ''You've got to be at something like this,'' said Allen, 43, a medical equipment salesman. ''You can't miss it.''
 Especially a new stadium that is being billed as the newest wonder of the world.

HEADLINE: The Best Things in Life Are Free -- for a Day, Anyway

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
When times are tough, consumers appreciate the types of marketing offers known as bogos, as in ''buy one, get one.'' Smithsonian magazine is about to go the bogo one better, as in ''buy none, get one.''
 The magazine, part of Smithsonian Media, is running a campaign to promote its fifth annual Museum Day, which is to take place on Saturday. For the event, museums and cultural institutions around the country borrow a page from the playbook of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and let in visitors free of charge. 
 The campaign has a budget in the high six figures, being spent by Smithsonian Media and the two supporting sponsors of Museum Day: Citgo and Gozaic.com, an online community being introduced by Heritage Travel, part of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.
 The campaign, created internally at Smithsonian Media, is composed of print and Internet ads, materials at the participating museums and social media like Twitter. There is also a public relations effort by the Rosen Group in New York.
 The goal of the campaign is to generate visits to a section of Smithsonian magazine's Web site where admission cards needed for the free museum entry can be found. Cards are also available in the September issue of the magazine.
 Each card provides museum entry for two people and there is a limit of one card a household.
 This year, Museum Day is shaping up as the largest so far, Smithsonian Media says, with more than 1,200 museums registering to offer free admissions. Last year, more than 900 took part, drawing more than 200,000 attendees. (For the first event, in 2005, about 100 museums were involved.)
 Each year, the number of participating museums ''has gone up,'' says Kerry Bianchi, group publisher at Smithsonian Media in Washington, but this time there has been ''a huge leap.''
 One big change between September 2008 and September 2009 is, of course, the state of the economy. These days, not having to pay the admission charge at a museum could mean the difference between going and staying home.
 ''Right now, people are looking for economical ways to still do the things they love,'' Ms. Bianchi says. ''For someone weighing out what's in the discretionary spending pile, this is wonderful.''
 As a result, the event ''takes on more relevance this year,'' she adds, ''and we expect that to raise the interest and the profile.''
 The event was originally ''a customized program we did for an advertiser,'' Ms. Bianchi says, which was the TIAA-CREF family of mutual funds. TIAA-CREF came back as a sponsor in 2006 and 2007.
 The idea behind Museum Day was that ''we have these great museums in D.C.,'' Ms. Bianchi says, referring to the Smithsonian Institution and its 16 offspring, ''but what if you can't get there?''
 ''You go back to the vision of the Institution, 'the increase and diffusion of knowledge,' '' she adds, quoting from James Smithson, ''and you take a little bit of that D.N.A.,'' centered on the fact that ''the museums in D.C. are free to the public.''
 This will be the third year that Citgo is sponsoring Museum Day. For Gozaic.com, a new venture of Heritage Travel, its sponsorship is serving as a sort of marketing kick-off.
 ''We were attracted to advertising with Smithsonian and supporting Museum Day because of the mission, and the timing with the launch of Gozaic,'' says John Williams, president and chief executive at Heritage Travel in Washington.
 ''The timing couldn't be better,'' he adds, as Heritage Travel presents Gozaic (rhymes with mosaic) as ''a new community for people with a passion for heritage and cultural experiences, looking for lifelong learning through travel, going to places that matter to them and enrich their lives.''
 The supporting sponsorship of Museum Day is part of an introductory campaign for Goziac.com that also includes banners on Web sites like history.com and npr.org; ads in magazines like Audubon, Architectural Digest and Wine Spectator; and television commercials.
 Gozaic.com is also a sponsor of the new Ken Burns documentary on PBS, ''The National Parks: America's Best Idea,'' which is to begin on Sunday and run through Oct. 2.
 The creative agency for Gozaic.com is the Pappas Group in McLean, Va., and the media agency is Ypartnership in Orlando, Fla.
 The fact that Museum Day has marketers for sponsors may raise eyebrows among some who prefer a more distinct line to be drawn between for-profit enterprises and nonprofit organizations. But others are unperturbed.
 ''The sponsorships are absolutely fine with us,'' says Jennifer Weissman, director for marketing at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, which is taking part in Museum Day for the third year.
 The event is ''an extra opportunity to drive home the message that we want to make the museum accessible, and make our treasures available, to all,'' she adds.
 Among the home-grown promotions at the Museum of Fine Arts, Ms. Weissman lists free admission for adults on Wednesday night; free admission for kids under 17; free admission for students at 46 local colleges and universities; and an annual College Night party for area students at the start of the academic year. (This year's is scheduled for Thursday; Ms. Weissman expects 4,000 students to attend.)
 Regular admission at the Museum of Fine Arts is $17 for adults, she says, and $15 for senior citizens and students who do not qualify for free admission.
 The parlous state of the economy has brought an event called ''Nine in '09,'' Ms. Weissman says, which started in the spring and offers ''nine free community days'' on weekends and Monday holidays.
 Malcolm Rogers, the director of the Museum of Fine Arts, ''felt strongly there should be more opportunities to let people in'' as a result of the recession, she adds. 
 Correction: The Campaign Spotlight last week, about new advertising for Cloudveil, misstated the location of an agency that is working on the campaign. The agency, Backbone Media, is based in Carbondale, Colo., not Waltham, Mass.
 If you like In Advertising, be sure to read the Advertising column that runs Monday through Friday in the Business Day section of The New York Times print edition and on nytimes.com.

HEADLINE: Television Thanks You For Watching

BYLINE: By MIKE HALE

 BODY:
You could see the television industry hunkering down on Sunday night, sealing the cracks and nailing boards over the windows. The wolves -- the Internet, the financial crisis, the DVR -- were at the door, and at the 61st annual Primetime Emmy Awards on CBS, everyone agreed that it was time to focus.
 Entertainment industry awards shows are always self-referential, but this one may have set a new negative standard. Neil Patrick Harris, the host, established the tone with an opening Broadway-Rat Pack-style musical number (it felt as if he was still at the Tony Awards) that implored viewers to stay tuned -- put down the remote, don't go to the bathroom, and for God's sake don't watch later on TiVo and skip the commercials. 
 The siege mentality continued in the presentations. ''Good evening and thank you for looking at us,'' Jon Hamm said. Julia Louis-Dreyfus, standing at the microphone with Amy Poehler, said, ''Amy and I are honored to be presenting on the last official year of network broadcast television.'' With all the possibilities for scripted patter that Rob Lowe's checkered past presents, the writers chose a television in-joke, having him mock his decision to star in ''Dr. Vegas'' rather than ''Grey's Anatomy.''
 Even the acceptance speeches and entertainment segments, normally fertile ground for topicality, largely ignored anything not directly related to the television industry and its woes. Politics and the overall state of the economy barely surfaced, save for the montage of nominees for best variety show (which included Tina Fey's Sarah Palin impersonation and the Obama inauguration) and a passing reference by a comedy writer to missing President George W. Bush. ''The Daily Show's'' Jon Stewart, accepting the award for variety show (snatched from the more deserving ''Colbert Report''), merely made a joke about watching the football game on NBC.
 Instead we got Ms. Fey and Alec Baldwin, in separate acceptances, taking the time to effusively praise Lorne Michaels, the maestro of ''Saturday Night Live'' and ''30 Rock.'' Later Ms. Fey, accepting the award for best comedy for ''30 Rock,'' thanked NBC for keeping her series on the air even though it was more expensive than a talk show. Glenn Close, the winner for lead actress in a drama, saluted ''this community we love.'' 
 Several comic set pieces took on the enemy directly. The ritual presentation of the accountants responsible for tallying the votes was interrupted by Mr. Harris as Dr. Horrible, his character from the popular Joss Whedon Web serial ''Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog.'' He was here to tell us that the future of home entertainment is the Internet, despite its tiny, frozen screens. It was supposed to be a joke, but it didn't sound like one. 
 Not everyone was willing to toe the party line. Matthew Weiner of ''Mad Men,'' accepting the award for best drama, said: ''I know that everything is changing, but I'm not afraid of it, because I feel like all these different media, it's just more choices and more entertainment, and it's better for the viewers in the end.''
 On the flip side, the Emmys were a fast-moving, streamlined show, which made sense: the television academy was not leaving anything to chance. Mr. Harris was genial and efficient as host, making fun of his own loss to Jon Cryer for supporting actor in a comedy. Several presenters and winners made a point of praising him, as if he were a rookie point guard in the big game.
 There were many changes in the nomination and voting procedures this year, but they didn't appear to achieve their desired effect of evening the field for the broadcast networks. (Exhibits A through C: ''Mad Men,'' Glenn Close of ''Damages'' and Bryan Cranston of ''Breaking Bad'' sweeping the top three drama awards.) But on-screen the show couldn't have been more traditional and noncontroversial. There were no disruptions of the proceedings, despite the Kanye West jokes. 
 And the show was funnier than usual, despite its overall antiseptic feeling. You just had to wait for the good bits. The jokey montages of writing and directing nominees were amusing. The nominees for writing of a variety show, each involving multiple names, received special treatment: sung by Billy Crystal (for ''The Late Show With David Letterman''), ignored on Facebook by Conan O'Brien (''Late Night With Conan O'Brien''), represented by clunker cars (''The Daily Show With Jon Stewart'').
 Ricky Gervais, reliably hilarious, talked about the syndication rights for ''The Office'' (he owns a slice), and then apologized for making a joke ''just for the 5,000 people in this room.'' He must not have noticed that that was true of all the jokes.

HEADLINE: The President's Best Hope in the G.O.P.

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
President Obama intends to keep wooing the public to support for his health care goals in a scheduled Monday night appearance on the ''Late Show with David Letterman.'' Polls suggest he has had mixed results so far.
 Most critical, however, is his private effort to persuade one person: Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine. 
 And that effort appears to be going very well.
 Ms. Snowe has not endorsed either Democratic health care bill in the Senate. No Republican has. 
 But in an interview, she offered a surprisingly robust endorsement of Mr. Obama's skepticism about expanding government too much, his willingness to accommodate different views and his assertion that Washington must act now after decades of failure. 
 Those views directly contradict the assertions of Republican leaders, who accuse Mr. Obama of pursuing a radical expansion of government, spurning dialogue and unduly rushing to enact his agenda. Ms. Snowe's analysis of the discrepancy: she has maintained traditional Republican principles over 30 years in Washington, while her party has moved past them to the right.
 ''I haven't changed as a Republican,'' she said. ''I think more that my party has changed.''
 The significance of the Obama-Snowe relationship lies not in the prospect that the president will replicate it with many, or even any, other Republicans. To achieve his objectives, Ms. Snowe may be the only Republican he needs.
 'Budget Neutral'
 In talking across the ideological divide, Mr. Obama's greatest challenge is persuading Republicans that his quest to extend insurance to an additional 30 million Americans will not add ''a dime to the deficit,'' as he recently promised Congress.
 ''Two-thirds of the costs for covering new people will be paid for by taking waste out of the system,'' Mr. Obama said in an interview at the White House. The bill proposed by Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, would finance most of the rest with a tax on high-cost insurance plans -- which economists say may also ''bend the cost curve'' down by discouraging heavy health care spending.
 Republican leaders scoff. But Ms. Snowe believes the Baucus bill meets Mr. Obama's goal.
 ''It is budget neutral,'' Ms. Snowe said, citing a Congressional Budget Office analysis that the proposal would save $49 billion over 10 years. ''It does reduce the deficit.''
 More starkly, Ms. Snowe dismisses the Republican characterization of Mr. Obama as a big-government liberal moving heedlessly to expand Washington's role. ''I almost sense the opposite,'' Ms. Snowe said. ''He's been very realistic in his views on health care.
 ''I've gotten an impression that he would, you know, probably do less than more,'' she added. His place on the ideological spectrum, she said, is ''more moderate than liberal on this question.''
 She uses her running conversation with the president over a government-run health insurance ''public option'' to illustrate the point. Her portrait of a politically supple new president diverges drastically from the dogmatic leftist described by other Republicans. 
 ''I sensed at the outset that he might be far more flexible on that question many months ago when I had an initial discussion with him,'' said Ms. Snowe, who backs a public option as a backup that would be ''triggered'' only if the private insurance market fails. 
 An Early Courtship
 Mr. Obama and his team began cultivating Ms. Snowe even before he took office in January. ''He's always eliciting my views,'' she said, ''wondering, you know, what my concerns are.''
 It paid off on economic stimulus legislation when she provided one of three Republican votes clearing the way for the $787 billion package. Independence like that helps her popularity in Obama-friendly Maine, just as bucking Mr. Obama helps conservative Democrats like Senator Ben Nelson back in Nebraska.
 Ms. Snowe will get a chance in the Finance Committee this week to tailor the bill further to her specifications, which include higher premium subsidies benefiting low- and moderate-income constituents, as well as the triggered public option.
 That will not make it easy for her to do what Democrats wish: to defy her party, join 59 Democrats and provide the 60th vote necessary to surmount a potential Republican filibuster.
 Not only is Ms. Snowe a lifelong Republican, but her husband, John McKernan, is a former Republican governor of Maine. In the interview, she made no commitment on the health care overhaul. Yet she offered a rationale for joining Democrats this year, observing that ''the time has come'' to act.
 ''I'd like to have more Republicans on board,'' she said. Does she have to have them?
 ''Well, no -- I'm going to support the right policy,'' she concluded. ''People really want to get something done.''

HEADLINE: Obama Won't Say if More Troops to Be Sent to Afghanistan

BYLINE: By BRIAN KNOWLTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
With the administration intensively reviewing its military strategy, President Obama on Sunday would not tip his hand on whether he would approve sending more troops to Afghanistan.
 In an interview on CNN's ''State of the Union,'' one of five that Mr. Obama taped for the Sunday morning talk shows, the president was asked about a report that said General Stanley A. McChrystal, the commander in Afghanistan, had been told to delay any specific troop request.
 ''No, no, no, no,'' Mr. Obama replied. He said that he had inherited a strategy on Afghanistan that was ''somewhat adrift,'' and wanted to restore a sharp focus on defeating the al-Qaeda threat. 
 ''We lost that focus for a while and you started seeing a classic case of mission creep,'' he said.
 He added: ''I don't want to put the resource question before the strategy question.'' But at a time of waning public support for the war -- but a sense of urgency among some commanders in Afghanistan -- he made clear in his interviews that there was no presumption that more troops would be the best answer.
 ''I am now going to take all this information,'' he said on ABC's ''This Week,'' ''and we're going to test whatever resources we have against our strategy, which is if by sending young men and women into harm's way, we are defeating Al Qaeda and, and that can be shown to a skeptical audience, namely me -- somebody who is always asking hard questions about deploying troops, then we will do what's required to keep the American people safe.'' 
 On CBS's ''Face the Nation,'' he put it this way: ''We're not going to put the cart before the horse and just think by sending more troops we're automatically going to make Americans safe.''
 Mr. Obama also appeared on Univision's ''Al Punto'' and NBC's ''Meet the Press,'' skipping only ''Fox News Sunday,'' the program produced by the conservative network that is home to some of the president's most vocal and fiercest critics.
 Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader, said that many of his Republican colleagues would support an increased troop deployment in Afghanistan.
 ''If we need to change strategy, if we need to increase troop strength there, I think the president will enjoy a lot of support among Senate Republicans,'' he said on CNN.
 Mr. Obama acknowledged what he called ''pretty serious'' complaints of fraud in the recent Afghan election but urged a ''wait-and-see'' approach as the results are being re-examined. He had sent an additional 21,000 troops there in part to ensure election security.
 On the Justice Department review of detainee interrogation techniques, the president expressed his ''utmost respect for the C.I.A,'' and for the former agency heads who on Sunday asked him to drop the investigation. But it was important to demonstrate, he said on CBS, that ''nobody's above the law.''
 Mr. Obama's five network appearances -- an unprecedented single-day showing for an American president -- were aimed largely at bolstering his case for sweeping change on health care.
 But the interviews also came as Obama begins a high-profile week on the global stage. He starts Tuesday with a United Nations meeting on climate change, then addresses the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday, and continues the week by playing host to the Group of Twenty economic conference in Pittsburgh on Thursday.
 During the week he will discuss the Iranian nuclear program with the Chinese, Russian and other leaders; bring together Israeli and Palestinians leaders to urge them to move forward on peace talks; and chair a U.N. Security Council meeting on nuclear nonproliferation.
 He will spend Thursday and Friday in Pittsburgh, continuing the discussion on those global issues while also taking up the need to reshape financial rules to prevent future financial meltdowns.
 Making his first remarks on Russia since he announced last week that he was dropping plans for missile-defense facilities in Poland and the Czech Republic, Mr. Obama said on Sunday that the Russian government does not determine the defense policy of the United States.
 ''The Russians don't make determinations about what our defense posture is,'' said Mr. Obama, shrugging off Republican criticism of the move as an unmerited concession to Moscow. ''We have made a decision about what will be best to protect the American people as well as our troops in Europe and our allies.''
 But the president said that if the shift helped make Moscow ''a little less paranoid,'' then it was a useful byproduct.
 ''Russia had always been paranoid about this, but George Bush was right,'' he said on CBS. ''This wasn't a threat to them, and this program will not be a threat to them.''
 Mr. Obama insisted that he was not ending the program but ''putting a system in that's more timely, more cost-effective, and that meets the actual threats that we perceive coming from Iran.'' But he also acknowledged, if indirectly, the advantage of cooperative relations with Russia.
 ''If the byproduct of it is that the Russians feel a little less paranoid and are now willing to work more effectively with us to deal with threats like ballistic missiles from Iran or nuclear development in Iran, you know, then that's a bonus,'' he said.
 Conservatives have assailed Mr. Obama's shift as a blow both to Western security and East European confidence.
 Directing his comment toward Mr. Obama, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said on NBC's ''Meet the Press'' that ''at the end of the day you empowered the Russians, you made Iran happy and you made the people in Eastern Europe wonder who we are as Americans.''
 But Defense Secretary Robert Gates wrote Sunday that ''Russia's attitude and possible reaction played no part in my recommendation to the president on this issue.''
 The old approach had already become obsolete, and fresh intelligence pointed to a different defensive system, Mr. Gates wrote in a New York Times op-ed piece. He said Russia was unlikely to like the new American scheme much better.

HEADLINE: The Self-Correcting Presidency

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
Last week, the Census Bureau released a statistical report on the last year of George W. Bush's presidency. The numbers were brutal. On every indicator, Americans lost ground during the Bush era. The median income slumped. The poverty rate increased. The percentage of Americans without health insurance rose.
 Adding insult to injury, the umpteenth insider look at Bush administration's dysfunction was unveiled last week as well, courtesy of an obscure second-term speechwriter named Matt Latimer. (Next up: Bush's White House chef tells all!) Latimer's memoir, excerpted in GQ, offers grist for Bush-whackers of both parties. For liberals, there's Dubya the incurious frat boy, flubbing policy details and cracking wise about Hillary Clinton's posterior. For conservatives eager to prove that the most unpopular president in 50 years was never really one of them, there's Bush the crypto-liberal, who dismisses the conservative movement and boasts that he personally ''redefined the Republican Party.'' 
 The census report is yet another nail in the coffin of Bush's reputation; Latimer's tell-all seems more like a thumbtack. Both are reminders that it's hard to imagine his presidency being remembered as anything but a failure, by liberals and conservatives alike. 
 But if Bush is destined to go down as a failed president, come what may, he looks increasingly like an unusual sort of failure. 
 America has had its share of disastrous chief executives. But few have gone as far as Bush did in trying to repair their worst mistakes. Those mistakes were the Iraq war -- both the decision to invade and the conduct of the occupation -- and the irrational exuberance that stoked the housing bubble. The repairs were the surge, undertaken at a time when the political class was ready to abandon Iraq to the furies, and last fall's unprecedented economic bailout. 
 Both fixes remain controversial. But for the moment, both look like the sort of disaster-averting interventions for which presidents get canonized. It's just that in Bush's case, the disasters he averted were created on his watch.
 This leaves him in an unusual position where the judgments of future generations are concerned. On foreign policy, Bush looks a lot like Lyndon Johnson -- but only if Johnson, after years of unsuccessful escalation, had bequeathed Richard Nixon a new strategy that enabled U.S. troops to withdraw from Vietnam with their honor largely intact. On economic matters, he resembles Herbert Hoover -- but only if Hoover, after presiding over the stock market crash of 1929, had engineered an economic response that nipped the Great Depression in the bud.
 It's true that Bush didn't personally formulate the surge, or craft the bailout. But he was, well, the decider, and if he takes the blame -- rightly -- for what Donald Rumsfeld wrought, then he should get credit for Gen. David Petraeus's successes in Iraq, and for blessing the sweeping decisions that Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke made in last September's desperate weeks. 
 And if we give Bush credit on these fronts, it's worth reassessing one of the major critiques of his presidency -- that it was fatally insulated, by ideology and personality, from both the wisdom of the Washington elite and the desires of the broader public.
 In reality, many of the Bush-era ventures that look worst in hindsight were either popular with the public at the time or blessed by the elite consensus. Voters liked the budget-busting tax cuts and entitlement expansions. The Iraq war's cheering section included prominent Democrats and scores of liberal pundits. And save for a few prescient souls, everybody -- right and left, on Wall Street and Main Street -- was happy to board the real-estate express and ride it off an economic cliff.
 Bush-era bipartisanship did produce some defensible legislation (No Child Left Behind, for instance). But more often, it produced travesties like the failed attempt at ''comprehensive'' immigration reform, lobbyist feeding frenzies like the 2005 energy bill, and boondoggles like the Department of Homeland Security.
 By contrast, Bush's best initiatives often lacked a constituency outside the White House: His AIDS-in-Africa program; his insistence, vindicated by subsequent scientific breakthroughs, on seeking alternatives to embryo-destroying research; his failed second-term proposals for Social Security and tax reform.
 And perhaps his best decisions, on the surge and the bailout, were made from the bunker of a seemingly-ruined presidency -- when his approval ratings had bottomed out, his credibility was exhausted and his allies had abandoned him. 
 This is not a blueprint that future presidents will want to follow. But the next time an Oval Office occupant sees his popularity dissolve and his ambitions turn to dust, he can take comfort from Bush's example. It suggests that it's possible to become a good president even -- or especially -- when you can no longer hope to be a great one.

HEADLINE: Reform or Bust

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
In the grim period that followed Lehman's failure, it seemed inconceivable that bankers would, just a few months later, be going right back to the practices that brought the world's financial system to the edge of collapse. At the very least, one might have thought, they would show some restraint for fear of creating a public backlash.
 But now that we've stepped back a few paces from the brink -- thanks, let's not forget, to immense, taxpayer-financed rescue packages -- the financial sector is rapidly returning to business as usual. Even as the rest of the nation continues to suffer from rising unemployment and severe hardship, Wall Street paychecks are heading back to pre-crisis levels. And the industry is deploying its political clout to block even the most minimal reforms. 
The good news is that senior officials in the Obama administration and at the Federal Reserve seem to be losing patience with the industry's selfishness. The bad news is that it's not clear whether President Obama himself is ready, even now, to take on the bankers.
 Credit where credit is due: I was delighted when Lawrence Summers, the administration's ranking economist, lashed out at the campaign the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, in cooperation with financial-industry lobbyists, is running against the proposed creation of an agency to protect consumers against financial abuses, such as loans whose terms they don't understand. The chamber's ads, declared Mr. Summers, are ''the financial-regulatory equivalent of the death-panel ads that are being run with respect to health care.''
 Yet protecting consumers from financial abuse should be only the beginning of reform. If we really want to stop Wall Street from creating another bubble, followed by another bust, we need to change the industry's incentives -- which means, in particular, changing the way bankers are paid.
 What's wrong with financial-industry compensation? In a nutshell, bank executives are lavishly rewarded if they deliver big short-term profits -- but aren't correspondingly punished if they later suffer even bigger losses. This encourages excessive risk-taking: some of the men most responsible for the current crisis walked away immensely rich from the bonuses they earned in the good years, even though the high-risk strategies that led to those bonuses eventually decimated their companies, taking down a large part of the financial system in the process. 
 The Federal Reserve, now awakened from its Greenspan-era slumber, understands this problem -- and proposes doing something about it. According to recent reports, the Fed's board is considering imposing new rules on financial-firm compensation, requiring that banks ''claw back'' bonuses in the face of losses and link pay to long-term rather than short-term performance. The Fed argues that it has the authority to do this as part of its general mandate to oversee banks' soundness. 
 But the industry -- supported by nearly all Republicans and some Democrats -- will fight bitterly against these changes. And while the administration will support some kind of compensation reform, it's not clear whether it will fully support the Fed's efforts. 
 I was startled last week when Mr. Obama, in an interview with Bloomberg News, questioned the case for limiting financial-sector pay: ''Why is it,'' he asked, ''that we're going to cap executive compensation for Wall Street bankers but not Silicon Valley entrepreneurs or N.F.L. football players?'' 
 That's an astonishing remark -- and not just because the National Football League does, in fact, have pay caps. Tech firms don't crash the whole world's operating system when they go bankrupt; quarterbacks who make too many risky passes don't have to be rescued with hundred-billion-dollar bailouts. Banking is a special case -- and the president is surely smart enough to know that.
 All I can think is that this was another example of something we've seen before: Mr. Obama's visceral reluctance to engage in anything that resembles populist rhetoric. And that's something he needs to get over. 
 It's not just that taking a populist stance on bankers' pay is good politics -- although it is: the administration has suffered more than it seems to realize from the perception that it's giving taxpayers' hard-earned money away to Wall Street, and it should welcome the chance to portray the G.O.P. as the party of obscene bonuses.
 Equally important, in this case populism is good economics. Indeed, you can make the case that reforming bankers' compensation is the single best thing we can do to prevent another financial crisis a few years down the road.
 It's time for the president to realize that sometimes populism, especially populism that makes bankers angry, is exactly what the economy needs.

HEADLINE: Present at The Trade Wars

BYLINE: By DAVID ROCKEFELLER. 
David Rockefeller is the former chairman and chief executive of Chase Manhattan Bank.

 BODY:
AS if he needed another policy concern to distract him from the health care debate, President Obama now finds himself embroiled in a quarrel with China over his imposition of a steep tariff on automobile tires from that country that is to take effect this week. The Chinese have responded by threatening to impose higher tariffs on American chicken. This may seem like a petty dispute, but the controversy could endanger the global economic recovery if the underlying issue -- the rise in protectionism --is not resolved quickly and forcefully. Perhaps Washington has justification for increasing tariffs in this particular case, but in general it sets a bad precedent.
 President Obama should resist the desire to accommodate the forces of protectionism from unions, environmentalists and cable television pundits alike. Giving in to their demands may be politically astute, but it would send the wrong message to our trading partners and, more important, inflict damage on the already weakened American economy. Despite the recent rally in the stock market, the next two or three years could still be very painful. 
 I lived through the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed it, and I saw that there was no direct cause and effect relationship. Rather, there were specific governmental actions and equally important failures to act, often driven by political expediency, that brought on the Depression and determined its severity and longevity.
 One critical mistake was America's retreat from international trade. This not only helped to turn the 1929 stock market decline into a depression, it also chipped away at trust between nations, paving the way for World War II. 
 In late 1929, intense protectionist pressure from farm, labor and business groups prodded the Republican-dominated Congress to pass the disastrous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which increased rates on imported goods to historically high levels. President Herbert Hoover signed it into law in June 1930, and in doing so raised the prices of more than 20,000 items produced abroad. 
 The results were devastating. Our trading partners retaliated by raising their own tariffs on American goods. From 1929 to 1933, imports from Europe into the United States declined by almost two-thirds and our exports were more than halved. From 1929 to 1934, overall world trade declined by some 66 percent. The tariffs took a toll on the domestic economy as well. When trading partners reciprocated with tariffs of their own, American importers found their goods priced too high to sell, while exporters experienced depressed demand. In both cases, American workers lost jobs. The unemployment rate rose from around 9 percent in 1930 (a bit lower than it is today) to close to 16 percent a year later and a staggering 25 percent in 1933, when Franklin D. Roosevelt took office. We could be at a similar crossroad today. 
 The high level of economic anxiety is, quite understandably, fueling protectionist sentiment and economic nationalism both here and abroad. Quite a few Americans believe that defeating new trade agreements and gutting existing ones would protect American jobs and stabilize our economy. In reality, those actions would be damaging and counterproductive, and repeat the mistakes of the 1930s.
 It's not too late to get back on the right path. President Obama should use the meeting of the Group of 20 this week in Pittsburgh to argue the case for the expansion of world trade. He should also condemn the subtle protectionist measures -- subsidies and domestic content legislation, for example -- already used by the United States and many of our trading partners. President Obama should also urge Congress to pass free-trade agreements with Panama, South Korea and Colombia that would truly open those markets to our products. He should also ask Congress to renew ''fast track'' authority for Ron Kirk, the United States trade representative. This would signal our strong commitment to fair and equitable international trade, as well as our willingness to act quickly on future agreements. 
 Some will ask why the president should stress trade expansion at a time when our domestic economy is in the doldrums. The reason is that our economy is richer as a result of globalization. At a time when economic growth is flat at best and unemployment is approaching 10 percent, we need every instrument available to stimulate job growth. 
 President Obama should recognize the critical need for a free flow of trade and finance across the world's borders, especially our own. He must help Americans understand that the fate of workers in Chinese tire factories, and that of poultry farmers in Arkansas, is inextricably intertwined with their own.

HEADLINE: Obama Insists That Insurance Will Be Affordable

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama on Sunday pushed back against the argument from liberal Democrats that the leading health care bill in the Senate would place a new financial burden on the middle class, saying in a series of television appearances that insurance would be made affordable through a competitive exchange and subsidies.
 As the Senate Finance Committee prepares to take up the legislation this week, the White House is trying to hold together fractious Democrats, particularly those who believe that the plan is not generous enough for people required to buy insurance. Mr. Obama argued that the proposal was not a bad deal for the middle class and that it could not be called a tax hike. 
 ''Right now, everybody in America, just about, has to get auto insurance,'' Mr. Obama said on ''This Week with George Stephanopoulos'' on ABC. ''Nobody considers that a tax increase.'' 
 The interviews, conducted Friday in the Roosevelt Room of the White House and broadcast on news programs, represented the first saturation of the Sunday morning airwaves to that extent by a president. Mr. Obama said the health care fight was tougher than he had expected and conceded that he had struggled in ''breaking through.'' He said he remained confident that he would sign a bill and welcomed Republicans to the effort, but added, ''I don't count on them.''
 The argument over the affordability of insurance is one of the most pressing points of contention in imposing a mandate for people to obtain coverage. Since the presidential race last year, many Democrats have braced for this treacherous debate, which goes beyond whether the insurance mandate should be called a tax increase to whether people might actually have to pay more for their coverage.
 The president did not fully endorse a proposal by Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and the chairman of the Finance Committee, but called it ''a serious, strong effort to move an agenda forward.'' Under the measure, the government would provide subsidies -- in the form of tax credits -- to help people buy coverage through new insurance exchanges. 
 The Baucus plan, like the other health care bills in Congress, offers subsidies to help low- and middle-income Americans. But eligibility is more limited, and the subsidies appear to be less generous than in the other proposals, leading some Democrats to question whether some people would be able to afford insurance.
 The subsidies are the biggest single cost in the health care proposals. In the Baucus bill, it is $463 billion over 10 years; the cost is $773 billion in the House bill. The House plan costs more, in part, because it provides more generous subsidies. 
 One question stands out above most others in the debate: What is affordable?
 People with incomes from 300 percent to 400 percent of the federal poverty line -- $66,150 to $88,200 for a family of four -- might be expected to pay 11 percent to 13 percent of their income on insurance premiums, the legislation in Congress suggests. 
 The Baucus plan would also require people to have insurance, with penalties as high as $3,800 for a family that goes without coverage. Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York and other Democrats have proposed waiving penalties for people who cannot find plans that cost less than 7 percent of their income.
 As the administration is seeking to reconcile competing versions of the health care bills, Mr. Obama avoided specific figures and did not tip his hand about what he believed was an appropriate level for subsidies. But he said rising health care costs already amounted to a tax increase on families. 
 As he did in his health care speech to Congress on Sept. 9, the president spoke favorably on Sunday about a public insurance option to inject competition into the market, but he did not call it essential. He urged ''folks in my own party'' to move beyond that debate and focus on broader aspects of the effort.
 ''Everybody's going to have to give some in order to get something done,'' Mr. Obama said on the NBC program ''Meet the Press.'' He added, ''We've got to get past some of these ideological arguments to actually make something happen.''
 Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, predicted that there would be consequences for the Democrats if they pushed a measure through Congress without bipartisan support. He said the current plan would raise taxes on small businesses and individuals and would affect Medicare coverage.
 ''If they try to use this legislative loophole called reconciliation, what they'll be doing, in effect, is jamming through a proposal to rewrite the economy with about 24 hours of debate,'' Mr. McConnell said on ''State of the Union'' on CNN. ''I think that will produce a very severe reaction among the American people.'' 
 Yet Mr. Obama's television appearances across the spectrum of channels on Sunday underscored his decision to move forward on health care with -- or, more likely, without -- Republicans.
 ''What I'm trying to do is explain the facts, which are if we don't do anything, a lot of Americans are going to be much worse off,'' Mr. Obama said on ''Face the Nation'' on CBS.
 The only major news program that he did not appear on was ''Fox News Sunday,'' a decision that administration officials said was made because the network did not broadcast his speech to Congress this month. 
 Instead, Mr. Obama spoke to Univision, a Spanish-language channel. He reaffirmed the administration's position that illegal immigrants should not have access to the proposed insurance exchanges. He said he was sensitive to the problems of ''mixed families,'' in which the parents are illegal immigrants but the children are American citizens born in this country. 
 ''We're going to make sure that those children are covered,'' Mr. Obama said.
 In his interview on ABC, Mr. Obama was asked whether he had a moment in the early months of his presidency when he realized that he needed to do better. ''I think there have been times where I have said, 'I've got to step up my game in terms of talking to the American people about issues like health care,' '' Mr. Obama said. 
 Mr. Stephanopoulos, the interviewer, said: ''You lost control?''
 ''Well, not so much lost control, but where I've said to myself, 'somehow I'm not breaking through,' '' Mr. Obama said. He added: ''It's very hard for people to get their whole arms around it. And that's been a case where I have been humbled.''

HEADLINE: A Proposed Tax on the Cadillac Health Insurance Plans May Also Hit the Chevys

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON; Geraldine Fabrikant contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Although cast as a tax on gold-plated insurance policies for the well-heeled, it has prompted anxiety among the middle class. 
 The idea, proposed last Wednesday by Senator Max Baucus, is to help raise money for the nation's health care overhaul by placing a new excise tax on the most expensive health insurance policies, like the ones offered to partners at Goldman Sachs and other affluent professionals. 
 The tax is meant to raise more than a quarter of the $774 billion needed to pay for the Baucus plan. But just as much, the tax is intended to discourage the overly generous coverage that many experts say has helped propel the country's reckless spending on medical care. 
 As it turns out, though, many smaller fish would get caught in Mr. Baucus's tax net. The supposedly Cadillac insurance policies include ones that cover many of the nation's firefighters and coal miners, older employees at small businesses -- a whole gamut that runs from union shops to Main Street entrepreneurs. 
 Under the Baucus plan, insurers selling a plan costing more than $8,000 for an individual and $21,000 for a family would have to pay a 35 percent excise tax on the excess amount. 
 Although the national average premium is currently $13,375 for a family policy, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, many are much higher than that -- particularly in high-cost parts of the country. 
 Nationwide, about one in 10 family insurance plans would be subject to the new excise tax, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning policy and research group.
 The tax would be levied on insurers -- or on employers that act as their own insurers. Either way, the tax would very likely be passed along to workers in even higher premiums than they pay now. But if insurance premiums continue to rise faster than inflation, as they have for years, many more people's policies could end up setting off the luxury tax in coming years.
 ''It puts a bigger tax on middle-income Americans who are already paying enough,'' said Harold A. Schaitberger, the general president of the International Association of Fire Fighters. The union says some of its members around the country are in plans that would be subject to the tax. 
 People who live in high-cost areas, like the Northeast or California, would also have a greater risk that their insurance plans would set off the excise tax -- not because the coverage is particularly generous, but because the price of their policies reflects the higher medical costs where they live. Massachusetts residents, for example, tend to pay more than a quarter more in premiums, on average, than people living in Idaho.
 Bruce Hodson is a state employee in Maine and the president of Local 1989 of the Service Employees International Union, where the cost of a family plan is now running at about $20,500 a year. At the typical pace of health premium inflation, his policy could very likely set off the tax if it goes into effect in 2013, as the Baucus plan proposes. 
 The plan has a $400 annual deductible per family, and Mr. Hodson has a co-payment whenever he goes to the doctor. 
 ''We really worked hard to keep the cost down,'' Mr. Hodson said of the union plan. And that coverage came at the expense of higher salaries, he said. ''We've given up pay raises for this.'' 
 The tax proposal has also drawn fire from some of Mr. Baucus's Democratic colleagues, including John D. Rockefeller IV, who been an outspoken critic of the overall Baucus plan. Mr. Rockefeller says he is particularly worried about the effect of the tax on coverage for workers like coal miners, including those in his home state of West Virginia, and firefighters. 
 ''I am concerned that the current excise tax proposal could prevent workers in high-risk professions from getting the health benefits they need,'' he said. 
 Mr. Baucus acknowledges some of the concerns and plans to work with the other members of the Finance Committee to address them, said Erin Shields, a spokeswoman for the senator. The proposal, she said, already sets the thresholds somewhat higher in those states where coverage is the most expensive. 
 But Ms. Shields defined the tax as vital to discouraging insurance coverage that is overly generous. ''High-cost health plans are a major contributor to skyrocketing health care costs,'' she said. Employers, she said, would still be able to find meaningful coverage below the threshold. 
 On Sunday, President Obama said he saw the need to protect union members, but he also defended the tax. ''I do think that giving a disincentive to insurance companies to offer Cadillac plans that don't make people healthier is part of the way that we're going to bring down health care costs for everybody over the long term.''
 Proponents say the tax is squarely aimed at the very richest plans -- like the family coverage offered to the 400 or so managing directors at Goldman Sachs and its top executive officers. It carries a premium of around $40,000 a year. The Goldman plan would be subject to nearly $7,000 in taxes. Goldman Sachs declined to comment. 
 Even if most employees around the nation might initially escape, experts say more people's insurance plans would cross into the taxable range in future years. If the inflation rate in premiums continues its pace of the last 10 years, even the average cost of family coverage would probably cross the threshold within a few years of the tax's going into effect. 
 ''That number is going to grow and grow and grow,'' said Marissa Milton, a health care policy analyst for the HR Policy Association, which represents large employers' benefit managers.
 Ms. Milton drew a comparison to the alternative minimum tax -- a tax modified in 1986, supposedly as a way to keep affluent people from using deductions to avoid paying taxes. In reality, it has ended up capturing more and more middle-class taxpayers, Ms. Milton said. Likewise, the insurance excise tax ''is going to affect a lot of families,'' she said.
 By his own calculation, Robert G. Hansen, a business professor at Dartmouth, is one of the Americans who might be considered to have luxurious coverage, because the cost of his benefits could easily top $25,000. 
 But that supposedly ''gold-plated coverage,'' he said, includes the cost of related benefits, like dental coverage and the money in his flexible spending account -- all of which would be subject to the excise tax. 
 And who will pay the $1,450 in additional taxes Mr. Hansen would incur? ''In the end, look in the mirror,'' he said.
 ''It's the worst kind of economic engineering,'' he said. ''You end up with something that looks like the I.R.S. code.'' 
 Small employers would also probably be hit by the taxes -- and, again, not because they offer overly generous coverage. Instead, small businesses tend to pay more for their insurance than bigger employers that can negotiate better premiums. And because they do not have large pools of workers to help spread the risk, small employers tend to pay even higher amounts if they have older or sicker workers. 
 About 14 percent of small employers, counted as those with fewer than 500 workers, now offer policies that would be subject to the excise tax, said Beth Umland, director of research for Mercer, a consulting firm that conducts an annual survey of employee benefits. That compares with just 5 percent of large employers with 500 or more workers. 
 ''That is a very heavy hammer on the cost of your premiums,'' said Donna Marshall, the executive director of theColorado Business Group on Health, which represents employers of all sizes in that state. ''You don't want to cause a chilling effect on the employers who are trying to do the right thing.''
 Even union plans, which tend to offer the most generous coverage, are expensive because they frequently cover a number of older workers or some who retired early and have not yet reached Medicare age. Jim Hoffa, president of the Teamsters union, warned that the middle class, not the rich, would bear the brunt. ''It taxes the wrong people.''

HEADLINE: Shepherding a Bill With 564 Amendments

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Robert Pear contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senator Max Baucus hails from a long line of ranchers -- his great-grandfather is in the Cowboy Hall of Fame -- and this week the Montana Democrat will need all his herding skills. 
 After months of closed-door negotiations with a handful of senators on the Finance Committee, which Mr. Baucus leads, the full panel now gets to put its imprint on what could be landmark legislation to overhaul the health system. 
 Senators have offered 564 amendments, all posted on the committee Web site, and the Republican proposals generally reveal seemingly irreconcilable differences. While they would gut the bill, one Republican, Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, wants important changes but appears ready to get behind it, provided Mr. Baucus can keep his fellow Democrats in line. 
 For Mr. Baucus, the challenge will be to stop his fellow Democrats -- they outnumber Republicans 13 to 10 -- from shifting the bill so hard to the left that they chase away Ms. Snowe, who could provide the crucial 60th vote needed to get the measure through the Senate.
 Consider Ms. Snowe's most important amendment: to trigger the creation of a government-sponsored insurance plan in any state that fails to provide affordable insurance to 95 percent of residents. Mr. Baucus will have to fend off powerful Democrats, including Senators John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia and Charles E. Schumer of New York, who want to create the public plan from the outset. 
 The proceedings promise to be a wild ride for other reasons. Senator John Ensign, Republican of Nevada, wants to delete the word ''fee'' everywhere it appears in the bill and replace it with the word ''tax,'' a signal that Republicans intend to oppose the bill by framing it as a huge tax increase.
 Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who along with Ms. Snowe engaged in months of intense negotiations with Mr. Baucus, would do away with a core component of the proposal -- a requirement that virtually all Americans obtain health insurance or pay a penalty if they fail to do so. 
 And Mr. Grassley would eliminate proposed fees on the health industry, including insurers, drug companies and device manufacturers. Instead, he would pay for a large chunk of the bill with economic stimulus money that has not yet been spent. 
 Other Republicans are proposing even more drastic changes. Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah would block a proposed expansion of Medicaid to all Americans earning less than 133 percent of the federal poverty line, an initiative seen as crucial to reducing the number of uninsured. 
 Democrats have an array of amendments that would make similarly radical changes, and that could potentially make it difficult for Ms. Snowe, or even some centrist Democrats, to support the bill. 
 Mr. Rockefeller, for instance, would strike out the proposed creation of private, nonprofit health insurance cooperatives, which are an alternative to the public option. He would alter the proposal to create state-based insurance marketplaces and instead form a single, national insurance exchange. In stark contrast with partisans on both sides, Ms. Snowe's amendments seek to keep the core proposal intact, while making various adjustments aimed at making sure people can afford the health coverage they would be compelled to buy and also making it easier for people who are offered coverage through their employers to seek alternatives. 
 In all, Ms. Snowe filed 21 amendments on her own, four more with Democrats, and one other with a Democrat and a Republican -- further evidence that she seems closer to Democrats than her own party on the health care proposal. 
 For those watching the Finance Committee proceedings, which are scheduled to begin Tuesday, keep an eye out for amendments in these key areas:
 AFFORDABILITY Mr. Baucus, pressed by Democrats and Ms. Snowe, is expected to increase the government subsidies to help moderate-income individuals and families buy insurance, and make subsidies easier to obtain. 
 TAXES Several Democrats will push to expand the bill in part by capping tax deductions for high-income Americans at the 35 percent tax bracket, an idea that many Republicans oppose. Republicans, meanwhile, will be pushing to eliminate new taxes on various sectors of the health industry. And there will be all sorts of wrangling over the proposed new tax on the most expensive insurance plans, those costing more than $8,000 for individuals and $21,000 for families. 
 MEDICARE AND MEDICAID Republicans will fight proposed reductions in government spending on Medicare; Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, will push to insulate some participants in plans, called Medicare Advantage, that are sold by private insurers to the elderly. Some Republicans will try to block a proposed expansion of Medicaid, the state-federal insurance program for the poor; while in other cases there will be fights over the potential added costs to states.

HEADLINE: In an Effort to Restart Peace Talks, Obama Will Meet With Middle East Leaders

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER; Mark Landler contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: JERUSALEM 

 BODY:
After a frustrating week of shuttle diplomacy here in which the Obama administration failed to persuade Israelis and Palestinians to renew peace talks, leaders of the two sides are heading to the United States to make their cases again that the administration should push the other harder. 
 President Obama will meet in New York on Tuesday with Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, and Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president. The Palestinian prime minister, Salam Fayyad, will also be in New York. On Monday, Israel's defense minister, Ehud Barak, will meet in Washington with Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and other officials.
 The White House said it did not expect to achieve any breakthroughs, but senior administration officials said Mr. Obama decided to go ahead with a meeting on the sidelines of the United NationsGeneral Assembly to show his determination to get the process moving again.
 ''This is the next step in a determined diplomatic process that started on Day 1 of this administration,'' said Tommy Vietor, a White House spokesman. 
 Palestinian leaders say the sources of the frustration could not be clearer: Israel's refusal to freeze settlement building in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in keeping with earlier commitments, and its insistence on holding peace talks without agreeing to deal with the key issues of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees.
 ''Without a settlement freeze or an agreement to talk about the core issues, there is no point in starting the negotiations,'' Saeb Erekat, the top Palestinian negotiator, who is also going to New York, said by telephone. ''Ask Mr. Netanyahu if he is willing to negotiate on Jerusalem and on refugees. He refuses. And we all know that if he ever accepted, he would lose his governing coalition.''
 Mr. Netanyahu's coalition is largely right wing and pro-settlement.
 Israeli officials say they will seek to focus American attention away from settlements and on what they consider the real issues: Iran's nuclear ambition and Palestinian intransigence. 
 ''I fear the Palestinians are going to miss a huge opportunity,'' Mr. Barak said by telephone. ''There is a president who says determinedly, 'I am going to put my political capital into making sure there is an independent Palestinian state and solve all the core issues in two years.' If we bear in mind Israel's security needs and the demand that a final agreement means an end to the conflict, this is an opportunity that must not be missed.''
 Israeli officials acknowledge their unwillingness to stop all Israeli building in the West Bank, but said this was because the lives of Israeli settlers must go on until a deal is reached. 
 ''I am not willing to dry out, to turn my back on a quarter of a million Israeli citizens,'' Mr. Netanyahu said in an interview with Israel's Channel 10 on Thursday. ''It is clear that the fate of the settlements and of the borders will have to be decided. But they can't be decided until the talks start.''
 When asked if he would be willing to remove settlements as part of the solution, Mr. Netanyahu said that he saw no reason to volunteer concessions before the talks.
 Another top Israeli official said that the Palestinians should not object to the construction of kindergartens or other new public buildings inside existing settlements because if those settlements are ultimately transferred to the Palestinians, those buildings would go to them.
 ''We are not going to destroy any infrastructure when there is a deal,'' the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was discussing a subject under negotiation. He added that Israel had taken a number of steps in the West Bank to help the Palestinians -- removing roadblocks, encouraging the economy, helping the recent Fatah congress take place -- but that the Palestinians were stuck on a ''no-brick policy'' regarding settlements, meaning no construction at all.
 Mr. Erekat said that the Palestinians did not want Israeli kindergartens, they wanted their land.
 On Tuesday, Mr. Obama plans to meet with each side separately before seeing them together.
 While administration officials acknowledge that the president's special envoy, George J. Mitchell, has not been able to close the gaps between the two sides, they point out that Israel voted in a new government soon after Mr. Obama took office, and that tensions in the region were still high from the war in Gaza. Given where it started, these officials insist, the situation has improved.
 For his part, Mr. Barak said he would focus in Washington on maintaining Israel's qualitative military edge, on Iran and on the Palestinians.
 Israel is in the process of developing a three-tiered missile defense system aimed at stopping short-, medium- and long-range missiles, some of it with American help. The system will require a couple more years, according to most estimates. 
 Mr. Barak said that concern about Iran remains a top priority and that Israel wants the diplomatic efforts being pursued by the Americans to be limited, well defined and followed by tough sanctions. He reiterated that he removes no option from the table, a reference to the possibility of a military assault on Iranian nuclear facilities.
 In an interview last week with the Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot, Mr. Barak said that Iran did not pose an existential threat to Israel, because it did not yet have a nuclear weapon and because even if it developed one, Israel could protect itself. 
 The statement raised eyebrows in the United States because it seemed to suggest that Israel might be growing less concerned about Iranian nuclear weapons. But in his telephone interview, Mr. Barak said this was not the case. He simply wanted to urge his fellow citizens to refrain from panic over the Iranian program. Some Israeli leaders have compared the Iranian threat to that of the Nazis in the 1930s.
 ''I don't buy the relevance of comparing the situation with that of Europe in 1938,'' Mr. Barak said. ''Then, the hope for a normal Jew looking into the future was to flee. We are not in such a situation. We can defend ourselves against any kind of threat.''
 Mr. Barak said a central challenge for the United States now was how to handle the nuclear weapons of North Korea, because that would greatly influence Iran. 
 ''North Korea is developing long-range missiles in the backyard of China and Russia and nothing happens to them,'' he said. ''When the Iranian leadership asks themselves, 'Should we be worried or just go through the ritual of defying and cheating?' the answer depends on what happens to North Korea. A coherent move toward blocking nuclear proliferation should start with North Korea. It would have very positive ramifications for blocking Iran.''

HEADLINE: Challenge, Anyone?

BYLINE: By PAUL KEDROSKY. 
Paul Kedrosky is a senior fellow at the Kauffman Foundation, a center for economic research.

DATELINE: San Diego 

 BODY:
 ROGER FEDERER is getting teased, and not just because he lost the U.S. Open last week to Juan Martin del Potro. He is being mocked for his terrible eye. He challenged more calls in the U.S. Open than any other competitor, and yet he had one of the lowest success rates of any of the top players. 
 Insult to injury, right? Wrong. Federer is adept at challenging tennis calls, and he should challenge more of them -- as should his rivals. Professional tennis players are almost certainly losing matches because of their unwillingness to do so. 
 Here's how challenges work. Major tennis tournaments (like the U.S. Open) have multiple cameras arrayed around the court. This permits a simulated replay of a shot, showing to the millimeter where a ball landed on the court. So instead of futilely shouting, ''You can't be serious!'' at linesmen and umpires, players can raise their hand immediately after a call and ask for a replay. 
 The rules allow three incorrect challenges per player per set. In a best-of-five-sets match (which is normal for men), that means at least 18 available challenges per match, none of which carry over from set to set.In other words, use 'em or lose 'em. A player can get an additional challenge if the match goes into a tiebreaker, or if a fifth set goes overtime.
 Yet despite all these opportunities players have to dispute calls, at this year's U.S. Open, men's singles matches averaged 6.3 challenges that had a 29 percent success rate. Even Federer averaged a miserly one challenge per set in his 25 sets played at the Open. Why this reluctance to make a challenge? After all, the 29 percent success rate of challenges in the men's singles matches shows that linesmen are regularly wrong. 
 And the rewards for challengers can be substantial. For example, the No. 10 seed at the Open, Fernando Verdasco of Spain, averaged 0.4 challenges per set and had a sparkling 43 percent success rate. If he challenged once per set, like Federer, and his challenge success rate fell to a similar 30 percent, it could mean one more point to him in a three-set match. If his success rate didn't fall as much, however, and he challenged twice per set it might mean as many as three more points in a five-set match. Either way, it could be the difference between winning and losing.
 It's not all about math. There are also behavioral reasons that explain why tennis pros would shy away from challenges. Look at the sheepish faces on players when they're wrong, and listen to the clucking from announcers. But players should worry about total challenges won.
 Players also hang onto challenges ''just in case,'' only to have them expire when a set ends. But close line calls don't always show up when you need them to. 
 So what should players do? Rather than fretting about Federer's fondness for challenges, they should try to out-challenge him. Even challenge recreationally now and then. Sure, it might be embarrassing to challenge on a ball that looked well in, but who cares? The disruption to an opponent's rhythm can be worth it, as can the opportunity to take a short breather after a tough rally. The real challenge is to ignore the giggling critics.

HEADLINE: U.S. Fears That Increased Aid to Pakistan Will Feed Graft

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ; Sabrina Tavernise contributed reporting.

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 

 BODY:
As the United States prepares to triple its aid package to Pakistan -- to a proposed $1.5 billion over the next year -- Obama administration officials are debating how much of the assistance should go directly to a government that has been widely accused of corruption, American and Pakistani officials say.
 A procession of Obama administration economic experts have visited Islamabad, the capital, in recent weeks to try to ensure both that the money will not be wasted by the government and that it will be more effective in winning the good will of a public increasingly hostile to the United States, according to officials involved with the project. 
 As American lawmakers move toward passage of the aid legislation, the administration knows it must get quick results from the increased assistance or face potential Congressional cutbacks down the road in a program envisioned to cost $1.5 billion every year for the next five years. 
 ''We're struggling over how much cash to give to the government,'' said a senior American official involved in the planning, who declined to be named according to diplomatic custom. 
 The overhaul of American assistance, led by the State Department, comes amid increased urgency about an economic crisis that is intensifying social unrest in Pakistan, and about the willingness of the government there to sustain its fight against a raging insurgency in the northwest. It follows an assessment within the Obama administration that the amount of nonmilitary aid to the country in the past few years was inadequate and favored American contractors rather than Pakistani recipients, according to several of the American officials involved. 
 American officials say the main goals of the new assistance will be to shore up the crumbling Pakistani state by building infrastructure like roads and power plants, and to improve the standing of the United States with the Pakistani people.
 In return, the Obama administration expects Pakistan to keep up the fight against Islamic militants, though there are worries that the effort will turn out to be a short-term spurt overtaken by Pakistan's preoccupation with its archrival, India. 
 President Asif Ali Zardari has insisted that Pakistan cannot afford to continue its fight against terrorism without substantial American help, a number that he has sometimes put in the tens of billions of dollars. Mr. Zardari is scheduled to meet President Obama in New York this week, and assistance is expected to be a major topic. 
 American officials said the need to assist the Pakistani economy directly became alarmingly clear when recent power shortages across the country contributed to Pakistan's first year of negative industrial growth. There were widespread complaints here, including by Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin, that the government had solutions to improve the power output but was refusing to implement them in order to benefit a handful of power plant operators. 
 Another impetus came last week when 19 women were killed in a stampede for free flour in Karachi, even though Pakistan had a bumper wheat crop this year.
 After a recent visit to Islamabad, the deputy secretary for management and resources at the State Department, Jacob J. Lew, expressed anxiety about how to ensure that the aid money was spent properly, saying he was concerned that ''the money needed to go to the purposes for which it was intended.'' 
 ''We had to choose a method of funding that was most likely to produce results efficiently and effectively,'' he said Sept. 11 at a briefing at the State Department.
 Mr. Lew's suggestions of inappropriate spending by the Pakistanis caused such a furor among government officials that the American ambassador, Anne W. Patterson, issued an unusual public statement on Wednesday intended to reassure the Pakistanis that the United States was ''not depriving the Pakistani government any degree of direct funding as a result of lack of confidence or trust.'' 
 Part of the Obama administration's approach is to expand nonmilitary aid to Pakistan, after years in which almost all American assistance to the country was intended to help the military fight Al Qaeda and the Taliban. But some American officials said the Pakistani Army was diverting the money toward programs aimed at deterring India instead. A searing report by the Government Accountability Office last year said the Bush administration had relied too heavily on the Pakistani military to achieve its counterterrorism goals, and had paid too little attention to economic assistance. 
 Money intended to help civilians during the Bush years was generally delivered by American contractors who administered programs like training provincial government officials. 
 Mr. Tarin, the Pakistani finance minister, said in an interview that the private contractors absorbed up to 45 percent of the assistance in past years. 
 He said he understood, based on past American experiences in Pakistan, that the United States had concerns about ''transparency.'' He told the officials from Washington that they should work with the Pakistani government and develop ''joint oversight which both of us trust.'' 
 ''I said, 'Your interests are mine,' '' Mr. Tarin said of his meetings. ''Aid should be delivered through transparent platforms with maximum impact on the ground.'' 
 The United States should invest in developing vast coal reserves in the province of Sindh, and in hydroelectric, wind and solar power to bolster Pakistan's energy supply, he said. 
 The administration's special envoy for Pakistan and Afghanistan, Richard L. Holbrooke, has appointed Robin L. Raphel, an experienced American diplomat, to oversee the planning of the new aid programs. Mr. Holbrooke has also sent David Lipton, a senior member of the National Economic Council, to Islamabad twice to look at ways to fix the Pakistani economy. 
 One key factor in trying to find more effective ways to deliver aid to Pakistan is a recognition that big projects are likely to win more Pakistani friends because they are more visible, American and Pakistani officials said.
 ''It was not only an assistance issue but a public image issue, too,'' the senior American official said. ''People talk about the Chinese nuclear reactors and the Japanese.'' The United States was searching for a ''signature contract,'' the official said. 
 One road project under consideration in the troubled North-West Frontier Province would help in both improving security and gaining friends, a senior Pakistani official said. The $25 million project is designed to repair and expand the ring road around Peshawar, the capital of the province, they said. 
 The road has cratered because of heavy use by trucks hauling supplies for the NATO forces in Afghanistan from the port of Karachi through Peshawar and over the border to Afghanistan. The repairs would ease the transit of those goods, and possibly make them less vulnerable to attack by Taliban militants. 
 At the same time, it is hoped that the people of Peshawar who drive trucks, pedicabs, even donkey carts on the road would appreciate the American effort. 
 A prominent Pakistani economist, Ashfaque H. Khan, who served until recently as a senior figure in the Finance Ministry, said he had warned visiting American officials about the difficulties of plowing large amounts of American assistance into government programs without proper oversight, particularly in the power sector. 
 As increased American aid money pours into Pakistan, a permanent committee of American and Pakistani officials should be formed, Mr. Khansaid. The members should meet every two months to review the American-financed projects, he said. 
 ''There are ways you can minimize the risk of corruption by close coordination between the two sides,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Different Black Perspectives

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Scourge Persists,'' by Bob Herbert (column, Sept. 19): 
 Claims of racism and the reactions to them remind me of the responses in the black community to Bill Cosby's criticism of urban black youths and their parents a few years ago.
 Many African-American beneficiaries of the civil rights movement (as was I) fortunate enough to live apart from the troubled neighborhoods Mr. Cosby described were vehement in their responses. They didn't know any such people and accused him of cruel exaggerations. But those who lived in the neighborhoods and dealt daily with widespread unemployment, drugs, soaring dropout rates, youth violence and all else that propagates from them held different views. They often packed meeting halls to hear Mr. Cosby's message and strongly supported him.
 The differing views on racism in the greater society are similar and remind me of a saying from the Montgomery bus boycott: Where one stands on the issue depends on where one is sitting.

HEADLINE: Too Much Salt Takes a Blood-Pressure Toll

BYLINE: By Jane E. Brody

 BODY:
Perhaps nothing in medicine more aptly depicts the paradoxical statement ''doing better, feeling worse'' than high blood pressure. Despite an extraordinarily easy way to detect it, strong evidence for how to prevent it and proven remedies to treat it, more Americans today have undetected or poorly controlled hypertension than ever before.
 The aging of the population is a reason but not the only one, said Dr. Aram V. Chobanian, a hypertension expert at Boston University Medical Center. As he summarized the problem in an interview and in The New England Journal of Medicine in August, Americans are too sedentary and fat. They eat too much, especially salt, but too few potassium-rich fruits and vegetables. 
 The makers of processed and fast foods created and persistently promote a craving for high-salt foods, even in school lunch programs. And Americans without health insurance often don't know that their blood pressure is too high because they wait for a calamity to strike before seeking medical care.
 Solutions to the blood pressure problem require broad-scale approaches -- by the public, by government, by industry and by health care professionals. Several measures are similar to those that have been so effective in curbing cigarette smoking; others require better, affordable access to medical care for everyone at risk, including children and the unemployed. Still others need the cooperation of government, industry and the public to improve the American diet and enhance opportunities for health-promoting exercise.
 No one claims that the solutions are cheap. But failure to fix this problem portends even greater costs down the line, because uncontrolled hypertension sets the stage for astronomically expensive heart and kidney disease and stroke -- diseases that will become only more common as the population ages.
 Doing the Numbers
 Once, the prevailing medical opinion was that lowering an elevated blood pressure was hazardous because it would deprive a person's vital organs of an adequate blood supply. But a few pioneering medical researchers thought otherwise and eventually showed that lowering high blood pressure could prevent heart attacks, heart failure, strokes and kidney disease -- and save lives.
 Even then, it was long thought that the only important indicator was diastolic pressure -- the bottom number, representing the pressure in arteries between heartbeats. Further studies showed that the larger top number, systolic pressure, representing arterial pressure when the heart beats, was also medically important.
 And as the various studies reached fruition, it became apparent that the long-accepted numbers for desirable blood pressure were too high to protect long-term health.
 Now the upper limit of normal blood pressure is listed as 120 over 80; anyone with a pressure of 140 over 90 or higher is considered hypertensive. Those with pressures in between are considered prehypertensive and should take steps to bring blood pressure down or, at least, prevent it from rising more. 
 The change mirrors what happened with serum cholesterol, for which ''normal'' was once listed as 240 milligrams per deciliter of blood and is now less than 200 to prevent heart disease caused by clogged arteries.
 It was also long thought that blood pressure naturally rises with age. Indeed, the Framingham Heart Study showed that when 65-year-old people whose blood pressure was below 140 over 90 were followed for 20 years, about 90 percent of them became hypertensive because their arteries narrowed and stiffened with age, causing blood to push harder against artery walls.
 But in many societies where obesity is rare, activity levels are high and salt intake is low, blood pressure remains low throughout life. This is the best clue we have for the lifestyle changes needed to prevent illness and premature death caused by hypertension. 
 Dr. Claude Lenfant, who served as director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, is now 81 and has a blood pressure of 115 over 60, a level rarely found among older Americans not taking medication for hypertension. His secret: a normal body weight, four or more miles of walking daily, and no salt used to prepare his meals, most of which are made from scratch at home.
 In an interview, Dr. Lenfant, who now lives in Vancouver, Wash., said the problem of hypertension was rising all around the world and added that by 2020 the number of people with uncontrolled hypertension was projected to rise 65 percent. One reason is that doctors today are more likely to diagnose the problem, so it is reported more often in population surveys. ''But I'm much more concerned about the fact that so much high blood pressure is not controlled,'' he said, and called ''therapeutic inertia'' an important reason. 
 It is not enough for doctors to write a prescription and tell patients to return for a check-up in six months, he said. Rather, a working partnership between health care professionals and patients is needed to encourage people to monitor their pressure, adopt protective habits and continue to take medication that effectively lowers pressure.
 Treatment and Prevention
 Diuretics are a first-line and inexpensive remedy, but many patients with hypertension also need other drugs to lower pressures to a desirable level.
 Dr. Chobanian, whose New England Journal report was titled ''The Hypertension Paradox: More Uncontrolled Disease Despite Improved Therapy,'' noted that ''in the majority of patients, two or more antihypertensive drugs are required to achieve target blood-pressure levels.'' In the interview, he emphasized the detrimental role played by diets high in salt and calories and low in protective fruits and vegetables -- a result of portions that are too large, and of too many fast and processed foods that rely on salt to enhance flavor. ''Generally, the average person in our society consumes more than 10 grams of salt a day,'' Dr. Chobanian said, ''but the Institute of Medicine recommends a third of this amount as optimal.'' 
 A new RAND Corporation study finds that a one-third reduction in salt consumption could save $18 billion a year in direct medical costs. Dr. Chobanian called for better food labeling; changes in foods served in cafeterias, restaurants and schools; and less advertising on children's television of unhealthy foods high in fat, salt and sugar. Also needed are better opportunities for all people to get regular exercise. ''We have to focus more on children,'' he said. ''They're the ones who will be getting cardiovascular diseases in the future.''

HEADLINE: Debate Flaring Over Grants for Research

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Managers at the National Institutes of Health are increasingly ignoring the advice of scientific review panels and giving hundreds of millions of dollars a year to scientists whose projects are deemed less scientifically worthy than those denied money.
 Many of the favored recipients are ''new investigators,'' or scientists who had never before received a grant from the health institutes. By skipping projects submitted by older scientists and instead choosing to issue grants to projects from less experienced scientists, agency managers hope to use the scientific equivalent of affirmative action to encourage graduate students and newly minted professors to make careers in academia.
 The practice has stirred a debate among researchers. Mark O. Lively, a professor of biochemistry at Wake Forest who is president of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, said he taught many new investigators and noted that he was once one himself. 
 ''I see the value of providing more opportunities to our graduates,'' Dr. Lively said in an interview. ''There's an important need to create openings for those individuals.''
 But Peter Farnham, a spokesman for the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, said the health institutes had gone too far.
 ''At 19 percent, they're taking too much from the more seasoned investigators,'' Mr. Farnham said. ''We would be comfortable with a somewhat lower level.''
 Sally Rockey, the institutes' acting director for extramural research, said all projects financed by the agency were worthy.
 ''By reaching down, we're not sacrificing the quality of the science but instead reaching new investigators,'' Dr. Rockey said. ''We have a far greater amount of high-quality science projects than we could ever fund.''
 In 2007, the last year for which figures are available, 19 percent of the grants awarded to individual scientists were made as exceptions, or given outside of rankings by scientific reviewers, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office provided to The New York Times. That amounted to 1,059 grants totaling more than $380 million and was nearly double the level of 2003, when 10 percent of grants were made as exceptions. 
 Nearly all of the increase in exceptions in 2007 went to new investigators, with the young scientists' share rising from 20 percent of all exceptions in 2003 to half in 2007 -- a share that continues today, Dr. Rockey said.
 Representatives of many of the major scientific organizations said they supported favorable treatment for new investigators, a policy adopted by the former director of the health institutes, Dr. Elias A. Zerhouni. Dr. Francis S. Collins, the geneticist who led the government's successful effort to sequence the human genome, was confirmed in August as the institutes' new director. 
 The stakes are high. Getting a grant from the health institutes is a rite of passage for scientists, and investigators who fail often leave academia because universities rarely underwrite the entire cost of research. 
 In 2007, after years of nearly flat budgets, the agency financed only 21 percent of grants deemed worthy by scientific reviewers. The median age at which scientists land their first N.I.H. grant has risen steadily, to 41 years, from 35 in 1980.
 This year, the agency received $10 billion in economic stimulus money on top of its usual $30 billion budget. The budget is expected to drop back to $30 billion for next year. With a limited pot of money, every exception grant means that another grant deemed by a panel of experts to be scientifically superior will not be issued. In 2007, younger applicants had a better chance of landing an individual grant from the health institutes than older ones.
 The National Institutes of Health has long been the world's premier research agency for two reasons: It has lots of money, and it distributes much of that money through competitive scientific reviews. 
 There has been a growing chorus of complaints over the years that the agency's scientific review process is deficient -- that it fails to finance high-risk research; that projects must effectively be half done before financing is approved; that cliques control the process; and that reviewers are rarely the field's leading lights.
 Remedies for those perceived problems have often resulted in giving agency managers greater discretion in grant decisions. But science experts disagree on how much discretion is advisable, with some defending scientific review the way Winston Churchill defended democracy: ''the worst form of government, except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.''
 Exceptions are made entirely at the discretion of the directors of the agency's 27 institutes and centers, and the reasons behind them are not audited or monitored by the director of the National Institutes of Health. In their report, Congressional investigators said that failing to monitor such discretionary decisions was risky.
 Dr. Rockey said that every exception made at the institutes was for ''highly meritorious applications'' and that institute directors never skipped too far down the rankings. But she agreed with the accountability office that no one really checked. 
 ''We don't know,'' she said.
 Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, a leading Republican voice on health issues, expressed concern that the health institutes might not be monitoring the grant process closely enough. ''Deviations from the peer review process need to be well documented and made transparent so scientists and taxpayers can trust the decisions made by this agency,'' Mr. Grassley said.
 In a written response to the accountability office, officials at the Department of Health and Human Services said the director of the health institutes did not need to monitor the use of exceptions. ''Specific reasons for skips and exceptions must and should rely on the judgment of scientific officials who understand the current trends in science,'' the letter stated.
 Dr. Georges C. Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said that new investigators did need help but that somebody should monitor the process.
 ''You would think that the office of the director would want to look at performance statistics across the agency,'' Dr. Benjamin said. ''Hopefully, the new director will be able to put that in place.''

HEADLINE: For MacArthur Grants, Another Set of Geniuses

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
A papermaker dedicated to preserving traditional Western and Japanese techniques; a scientist developing theories of global climate change; and a journalist who helps uncover details of unsolved murders from the civil rights era are among the 24 recipients of the $500,000 ''genius awards,'' to be announced on Tuesday by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. 
 While many of the fellows are known mostly among their peers, others -- especially those in the arts -- have won renown. They include Edwidge Danticat, a 40-year-old writer who has won critical acclaim with her depictions of Haitian immigrants in works like the novel ''The Farming of Bones'' and the memoir ''Brother, I'm Dying.'' 
 ''It felt incredibly, wonderfully surreal,'' Ms. Danticat said in a telephone interview from Miami. ''What artists crave and need most is time. It will definitely buy some time. It's wonderful to have a sense of security, especially in these economic times.''
 This year's MacArthur fellows range in age from 32 to 69 and are evenly divided between men and women. As in years past, most live on the East or West Coasts, but a photojournalist is based in Turkey and an infectious-disease physician in Sudan. All will receive $100,000 a year for five years, no strings attached. Since the inception of the program in 1981 and including this year's fellows, 805 people ranging in age from 18 to 82 at the time of their selections have been named.
 Besides Ms. Danticat, other winners in the arts who have received public recognition are the documentary maker James Longley, 37, who explores Middle East conflicts with portraits of communities under stress; Deborah Eisenberg, 63, a short-story writer; Mark Bradford, 47, a mixed-media artist; Camille Utterback, 39, a pioneer of interactive art installations; Heather McHugh, 61, a poet known for her syntactical twists; Rackstraw Downes, 69, a realist painter of urban landscapes; and Lynsey Addario, 35, the Turkey-based photojournalist whose work in war-torn countries has appeared in The New York Times and National Geographic.
 Another journalist fellow, Jerry Mitchell, an investigative reporter at The Clarion-Ledger newspaper in Jackson, Miss., who focuses on cold-case murders from the civil rights era, said he would use the money to help write a book on the subject. ''I never in all my life expected this,'' Mr. Mitchell, 50, said of his award. 
 While all the fellows are accomplished, the MacArthur grants are distinctive because they reward the expectation of future achievement, said Robert Gallucci, who became president of the MacArthur Foundation this summer. ''We're looking for you to continue in a creative way, without anyone looking over your shoulder,'' he said. 
 Daniel J. Socolow, the director of the fellows program, noted that while about half the fellows are technically in the sciences, their work often touches on other areas. ''We focus on the work, not the field,'' he said.
 As examples, Mr. Socolow cited L. Mahadevan, 44, an applied mathematician at Harvard who investigates behaviors like how flags flutter and how skin wrinkles, and Theodore Zoli, 43, a bridge engineer who works to protect transportation infrastructure in the event of a natural or man-made disaster. Timothy Barrett, 59, a papermaker at the University of Iowa who studies the impact of books on society, also has a resume that is hard to categorize.
 ''For a lot of us, walking between the boundaries of disciplines and a bit off the beaten path, it's good to get a confirmation that people think highly of your work,'' said John A. Rogers, 42, a professor of material science and engineering at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Dr. Rogers invents electronic devices that, according to the MacArthur citation, ''lay the foundation for a revolution in manufacture of industrial, consumer and biocompatible technologies.''
 Beth Shapiro, 33, an evolutionary biologist at Pennsylvania State University, called the MacArthur ''a great opportunity to follow some research avenues that might be too risky for traditional funding sources.'' Dr. Shapiro examines fossils, dirt samples, biostatistics and other clues to reconstruct what happens to certain species. 
 The multidisciplinary approach can be seen in the work of two fellows with law degrees, Elyn Saks, 53, and Rebecca Onie, 32. Ms. Saks, a law professor at the University of Southern California, has written of her own mental illness and fights for the rights of the mentally ill. Ms. Onie was a sophomore at Harvard when she founded Project Health, a clinic-based program that addresses the connection between poverty and ill health. 
 ''The award is probably most significant because it ties in so powerfully with the current health care debate and conversation,'' Ms. Onie said. ''This gives us a platform to participate in that conversation.''
 Other winners in the sciences were Maneesh Agrawala, 37, of the University of California, Berkeley, who studies how design principles can improve the effectiveness of computers' visual displays; Esther Duflo, 36, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who analyzes the forces of poverty in South Asia and Africa; Lin He, 35, a molecular biologist, also at Berkeley, who researches cancer treatments; Peter Huybers, 35, a climate scientist at Harvard; Richard Prum, 48, an ornithologist at Yale who draws on developmental biology to examine questions about birds; Jill Seaman, 57, an infectious-disease physician working to treat infections in remote, war-torn areas; Daniel Sigman, 40, a Princeton biogeochemist investigating the ocean's fertility and the earth's climate; and Mary Tinetti, 58, a geriatric physician at Yale studying risk factors that contribute to fatal falls.

HEADLINE: Emissions Of CO2 Set For Best Drop In 40 Years

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD; John M. Broder contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
Global carbon emissions are expected to post their biggest drop in more than 40 years this year as the global recession froze economic activity and slashed energy use around the world. 
 The decline comes as political leaders are struggling to come up with a common approach to dealing with climate change. 
 The main factor behind this year's drop in emissions is the slowdown in industrial activity and trade around the world, according to a study due to be released in November by the International Energy Agency. 
 But the energy agency, which provides policy advice and research to industrialized nations, found that government actions had also contributed to the drop in emissions. The agency said it expected to see global carbon emissions fall 2.6 percent this year.
 The projected decline was first reported Monday by The Financial Times.
 World leaders will meet at the United Nations on Tuesday for a one-day summit meeting to pursue a new agreement to fight global warming. The talks are expected to conclude with a climate treaty in Copenhagen in December.
 The negotiations are stalled amid disagreements between developed and developing countries on how to share reductions in carbon emissions.
 Even if temporary, a global reduction in emissions could allow advocates of stringent new limits on carbon dioxide to argue that continued progress is available using existing technology and switching to cleaner fuels, like natural gas.
 The forecast should also make it easier for most nations to meet emissions reduction targets in the near and medium term and could give a lift toward a new global warming treaty, said Paul W. Bledsoe of the National Commission on Energy Policy, a bipartisan advisory group. 
 ''Because many countries are using 2005 as a baseline year, this will give them some breathing room when economic activity picks up again,'' Mr. Bledsoe said.
 The projection from the International Energy Agency tracks other forecasts from government agencies, including the Department of Energy, which found that greenhouse gas emissions in the United States fell 3.8 percent in 2008 compared with 2007; they are estimated to be down another 6 percent this year.
 However, an improving economy is expected to increase domestic carbon dioxide emissions 0.7 percent next year, according to the Energy Information Administration, an arm of the Department of Energy.
 Carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of energy sources account for 80 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.

HEADLINE: Airlines Rethink First Class

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
Before the recession hit, airlines fell over themselves to offer amenities to their highest-paying passengers. First- and business-class cabins featured gourmet food and wine, seats that turned into beds and even designer sleepwear. 
 But as the economy cuts into air travel, the carriers have had to rethink their approach to the front of the cabin. Some, like United and Qantas, are embracing or considering expanding a concept called premium economy, which offers more legroom and comforts and falls between coach and business in price. 
 While fewer people fly up front, their revenue is critically important to the airlines whose traffic, revenue and profits are shrinking. 
 ''In building up their premium classes, airlines have been building themselves a castle in the air that's ultimately unsupportable,'' said Peter Morris, the chief economist in London for Ascend Worldwide, an aviation consulting company. ''Unless the business world carries on expanding its needs for these services, the castle, to some extent, will come crashing down.'' 
 ''With cuts in corporate travel budgets, there is now much less willingness to pay up to eight times the fare on long haul for the extra legroom and Champagne offered by business class,'' he added. 
 In its latest global forecast, issued last week, the International Air Transport Association, an industry trade group, predicted that airlines worldwide would lose $11 billion this year, $2 billion more than it forecast in June. A major contributor to the loss, it said, would be a 20 percent drop in the number of first- and business-class passengers. 
 The association found that premium traffic on North Atlantic routes was 15.8 percent lower in the first seven months of 2009 than in the same period of 2008, while trans-Pacific premium traffic was down 26.6 percent in the first seven months of this year from 2008.
 Airlines charge a lot more to sit in the front of a plane. Consider these prices that United Airlines charges for a round-trip flight between O'Hare International in Chicago and Hong Kong. An economy-class seat is listed at $810, a business-class seat at $8,770 and a first-class ticket $17,524. For what it calls Economy Plus on that flight, the price is $1,068. 
 Henry H. Harteveldt, travel analyst for Forrester Research, said first- and business-class passengers on airlines' international flights generated 30 percent or more of passenger revenue. Corrine Png, Asian aviation analyst for JPMorgan in Singapore, estimated that such passengers represented 40 percent of passenger revenue at Cathay Pacific and Singapore airlines, among others.
 While the global economy is beginning to show signs of recovery, industry officials and analysts say they do not expect revenue from international premium air travel to return to the previous level soon -- if ever. 
 Mr. Morris said he expected airlines to look at creating more products and services between first class and economy ''to reflect the new reality, particularly for corporate travelers.'' 
 One of those options is premium economy, which Mr. Harteveldt described as ''less than half the price of business class, but it's pretty good, often with a first-class amount of legroom.'' 
 The idea has been around for a while. In the United States, passengers are probably most familiar with the idea on United, which offers up to five more inches of legroom on domestic and international flights. Now, other airlines are joining in. Air France and KLM, its sister airline, are introducing premium economy-class services on long flights.
 Brian Pearce, chief economist at the International Air Transport Association, said other airlines were considering reconfiguring cabins, ''but it's expensive.''
 Mr. Harteveldt said, ''Airline executives are telling me that for the foreseeable future, the day of the $10,000 business-class ticket is gone, and, in some cases, I'm hearing airline executives question if they should keep first class.''
 Tony Tyler, chief executive of Cathay Pacific, said in a telephone interview that his carrier was considering replacing some business-class seats with economy seats on aircraft like the 777-300 that operate within Asia. 
 In May, Qantas stopped offering first-class service on some long-haul routes through Oct. 31. And Alan Joyce, its chief executive, told The Australian in June that his airline was also considering reducing the size of business class on some of the 16 A380 aircraft it has on order from Airbus and possibly increasing some premium economy seating.
 John P. Tague, the executive vice president of the UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, recently told airline analysts, ''We're going to have to see where corporate travel settles out between the Economy Plus cabin, for example, internationally, and business class.''
 Damien Horth, airline analyst for UBS in Hong Kong, said: ''It's quite possible airlines will change the product; they will re-evaluate it next year. What the industry needs to understand is what is the new normal for premium-class demand.'' 
 But Mr. Pearce, the transport association economist, said that competition could prevent some airlines from changing in-flight services. ''If they are offering a lesser product than a competitor, they will lose customers,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Financier Peels Back The Curtain

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
''We all had too much money. It was just too easy.''
 That's the unvarnished appraisal of the private equity business by Guy Hands, perhaps best known for his unfortunate $4.73 billion purchase of the record company EMI in March 2007, the peak of the buyout boom -- a bet that will almost certainly lose his investors and his firm, Terra Firma, a fortune.
 That ill-timed acquisition aside, Mr. Hands's surprisingly candid assessment of the private equity industry is worth sharing. He was in the midst of the industry's growth to dizzying heights during the debt-fueled boom, and he is now having to deal with the aftermath of its shopping spree. Like others, he is desperately trying to keep businesses afloat and pay off the equivalent of huge monthly mortgage payments to the banks that financed them.
 Mr. Hands, a large man with unruly hair who is a name-brand financier in his hometown, London, was in New York last week to meet with investors and speak at a conference. A longtime investor who started his career at Goldman Sachs, he made his reputation investing for Nomura. His net worth is estimated at more than $400 million. 
 Over afternoon tea at the Jumeirah Essex House hotel by Central Park, Mr. Hands, who now lives on the island of Guernsey to escape British taxes, offered the most frank assessment of the private equity world -- including his mistakes -- I had ever heard from anyone still gainfully employed in the business.
 He had prepared remarks for a conference that morning, but didn't get to air many of them. Some of his most provocative thoughts were in his notes, which he shared with me. Most strikingly, he grabbed the third rail of the private equity world: the fee structure that gave the firms 2 percent of assets under management, plus 20 percent of profits. 
 The problem, he said, was that the funds had grown so big that the 2 percent became just as important as the 20 percent.
 ''Clearly a large number of P.E. firms were totally overpaid at the peak of the market,'' he said. ''The fees were an entirely unwarranted windfall, as the managers did not use the excess fees to invest in resources to grow the skill base of their funds.''
 He estimated that the private equity firms' ''net earnings will decline a minimum of 80 percent from the peak in 2007.''
 Success had less to do with performance or risk management, he said, and more to do with bulking up. ''It is time for investors to see through the elaborate marketing machines created by the industry,'' he said. 
 Between sips of his mint tea, he said that during the boom, investors had thrown so much money at so many private equity firms -- some of which formed consortiums to buy businesses from one another -- that they were ''really investing in the same thing so their capital was competing against itself, driving up prices.''
 He also argued that private equity firms formed consortiums not to spread risk, but because, ultimately, it was easier than going ''through the pain of gaining internal consensus to do something contrarian.'' The big firms would counter that consortiums allowed them to buy bigger companies and to spread the risk.
 With banks still holding back on loans, some on Wall Street have suggested that the private equity industry is dead. Others argue that the biggest firms -- the Blackstone Group, Fortress Investments, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, which is planning to go public -- will survive, albeit in a different form. Last year, Stephen A. Schwarzman, the co-founder of Blackstone, said, ''The people rooting for the collapse of private equity are going to be disappointed.''
 Mr. Hands is not rooting for the industry's demise, but he is predicting it will wither. The firms still have funds big enough to last them at least a decade, as they provide steady fees. ''Right now, the big firms have a tower of fees,'' he said. ''But the tower starts to collapse over time.''
 As the funds dry up, Mr. Hands expects the firms will struggle to raise enough new money to support the hundreds of employees they now employ. His prediction has a precedent -- that's what happened to venture capital after the late 1990s. The industry shrank sharply after it became clear that too much money was chasing too few deals. 
 But the pattern may play out in slower motion for private equity. ''Neither the banks nor P.E. want to come clean about mistakes,'' he wrote in his notes. ''Hence companies will live as zombies unable to grow their businesses or make long-term commitments. Meanwhile banks will try to suck out as much money as they can in fees and postpone recognizing the full extent of the losses of their underwriting decisions.'' 
 In the end, he said, ''Many P.E. firms are hoping that daylight doesn't shine on the corpses of their companies, so they are reluctant to restructure too quickly.''
 Of course, it's possible that some firms will make terrific bets now, in the depressed economy, and will come out even stronger when things improve.
 Mr. Hands is quite open that he made an awful mistake with EMI, which desperately needs to be restructured or sold (most likely to Warner Music, eventually). 
 His timing was off, he says, but not by much. If, by chance, he had waited several weeks, the deal probably wouldn't have happened. The securitization market was about to seize up, which would have pushed him into a higher interest rate, making it impossible to sell some of the business to co-investors.
 ''If the EMI auction started two weeks later, it wouldn't have occurred,'' he said. ''We wouldn't have bought it. We'd have 90 percent of our funds still to invest and we'd look like geniuses.'' 
 The good news for Mr. Hands is that most analysts, and even his own investors, give him high marks for operating the business very well, squeezing out every last efficiency.
 The bad news is that he has been unable to invest in the company's future and any additional cash goes only to one place: Citigroup, which provided the financing for the deal.
 The bank has become Mr. Hands's de facto boss now that there is more debt on the books than equity. ''Negotiations with one's bankers, when the debt is so large in relation to the earnings, are always difficult,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Small Victory at Ticket Booth as Lions' Skid Continues

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR. 
E-mail: sportsbiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
There was no Champagne party at the Detroit Lions' offices Friday morning when the team sold out its home opener against the Minnesota Vikings. Coming off last season's 0-16 record and five non-sellouts, filling Ford Field is a notable feat but not one to revel in.
 ''The cause for celebration is winning games,'' said Tom Lewand, the Lions' president. ''It's a testament to our fans that we sold out in light of our economic circumstances. They showed up and gave us a good home-field advantage, but we weren't able to capitalize on it.'' 
 The Lions lost, 27-13. But the sellout prevented the blackout of the Fox broadcast in the market. Only one N.F.L. market, Jacksonville, was blacked out; the Jaguars lost to Arizona, 31-17.
 Last week, Lewand said, the Lions were selling tickets fast enough to generate enthusiasm. By Thursday afternoon, three days before kickoff, they were still 1,700 short. The N.F.L. ordains a local television blackout if the game is not a sellout 72 hours before the game. But it also allows for a 24-hour sales extension that gave the Lions time to beat the blackout. The San Diego Chargers also sold out with the day's reprieve.
 Lewand said that since the off-season, the Lions have promoted partial season-ticket packages and created 5,000 all-you-can-eat seats (which sell for $15 above single-game ticket prices but include free sodas, nachos, hot dogs, bratwurst and popcorn). ''It's not much discounting, but it's about creating added value,'' he said. 
 The league's focus on selling tickets in hard times has led it to offer teams its help, said Neil Glat, the N.F.L.'s senior vice president for business development. ''It can be about how to set up your sales organizations, what promotional offers they have, and how you service your fans,'' he said. ''Some markets want a family section and some don't. In some markets, it makes sense to have an all-you-can-eat section.''
 In the past, sponsors have occasionally bought unsold tickets to avoid blackouts. But in the Great Recession, that is a less practical or affordable strategy. Which automaker or supplier would do that now in Motor City?
 Teams can also use their full-season allotment of 17,000 free tickets to reach a sellout. But Lewand said that nearly half those comps, or a bit over 1,000 a game, are committed to staff and players. 
 ''It's less of a legitimate sellout tool than you'd think,'' he said.
 Winning, as John Madden says, is a great deodorant. The Lions, then, need a lot of Right Guard to spritz after decades of misery. The team knows it is privileged that fans in a city with a jobless rate near 30 percent are spending money on football and that some are probably deciding between the Lions and the Tigers, who lead the American League Central. ''We're thrilled the Tigers are competitive, but they're also competing with us for dollars in the marketplace,'' Lewand said.
 The Lions would ideally love eight sellouts, but that is wishful thinking. The Washington Redskins, who play the Lions on Sunday, are not division rivals like the Minnesota Vikings and lack a Brett Favre-level attraction. ''Washington will be tough,'' said Lewand (who does not think Favre made a difference in reaching the sellout). 
 Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Cleveland and Green Bay visit Ford Field next. ''We need to win,'' Lewand added.
 A METRODOME CONFLICT On Oct. 5, the Green Bay Packers play the Vikings in prime time at the Metrodome in Minneapolis on ESPN. Major League Baseball also wants the Tigers and the Twins to play there that night if the teams are tied after 162 games and the Twins have won the season series. It is a bit of a long shot; the Tigers lead the Twins by two and a half games, but the Twins are 9-5 against the Tigers, with four games next week in Detroit. 
 A baseball official, Katy Feeney, said over the weekend that the N.F.L. would move the game to Green Bay. 
 But the N.F.L. said Monday it would not budge off her suggestion which, if followed, would also mean moving the Nov. 1 Vikings-Packers game from Green Bay to Minneapolis. ''We don't want to inconvenience fans by changing the schedule for a game that was announced in April,'' said Dan Masonson, an N.F.L. spokesman.
 Bill Lester, the executive director of the agency that runs the Metrodome, said it would be available Tuesday night, the eve of the start of the division series. And Matt Bourne, a baseball spokesman, said, ''We're working out the scheduling of a potential tie breaker and we're talking to all interested parties.''
 GIANTS-COWBOYS RATINGS The Giants' 33-31 win over Dallas on Sunday night, which drew more than 105,000 fans to the new Cowboys Stadium, generated a 16.5 preliminary overnight rating on NBC, the best such performance for a prime-time regular-season N.F.L. broadcast since a Denver-Miami game in 1998.

HEADLINE: Refitted to Bury Emissions, Plant Draws Attention

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, W.Va. 

 BODY:
Poking out of the ground near the smokestacks of the Mountaineer power plant here are two wells that look much like those that draw natural gas to the surface. But these are about to do something new: inject a power plant's carbon dioxide into the earth. 
 A behemoth built in 1980, long before global warming stirred broad concern, Mountaineer is poised to become the world's first coal-fired power plant to capture and bury some of the carbon dioxide it churns out. The hope is that the gas will stay deep underground for millenniums rather than entering the atmosphere as a heat-trapping pollutant. 
 The experiment, which the company says could begin in the next few days, is riveting the world's coal-fired electricity sector, which is under growing pressure to develop technology to capture and store carbon dioxide. Visitors from as far as China and India, which are struggling with their own coal-related pollution, have been trooping through the plant.
 The United States still depends on coal-fired plants, many of them built decades ago, to meet half of its electricity needs. Some industry experts argue that retrofitting them could prove far more feasible than building brand new, cleaner ones. 
 Yet the economic viability of the Mountaineer plant's new technology, known as carbon capture and sequestration, remains uncertain. 
 The technology is certain to devour a substantial amount of the plant's energy output -- optimists say 15 percent, and skeptics, 30 percent. Some energy experts argue that it could prove even more expensive than solar or nuclear power. 
 And as with any new technology, even the engineers are unsure how well it will work: will all of the carbon dioxide stay put? 
 Environmentalists who oppose coal mining and coal energy of any kind worry that sequestration could simply trade one problem, global warming, for another one, the pollution of water supplies. Should the carbon dioxide mix with water underground and form carbonic acid, they say, it could leach poisonous materials from rock deep underground that could then seep out. 
 Given the depths to which workers have drilled, they also fret that the project could cause earthquakes, although experts at the Environmental Protection Agency discount the risk of catastrophe.
 More broadly, some environmentalists argue that the carbon storage effort could give corporations and consumers another excuse to drag their heels in supplanting coal dependence with an embrace of renewable energy sources like the sun and wind.
 ''Coal is the drug of choice of a major industry with a lot of political power,'' said David H. Holtz, executive director of Progress Michigan, an environmental group. 
 Instead of adopting carbon capture, which Mr. Holtz likens to a methadone cure for addiction, he argues that the industry would do better to go cold turkey.
 ''There's no evidence that burying carbon dioxide in the earth is a better strategy than aggressively pursuing other alternatives that clearly are better for the environment and will in the long run be less costly,'' Mr. Holtz said.
 But power company officials say the effort is the energy industry's best hope of stanching carbon dioxide emissions over the next few decades. 
 ''I really believe, in my heart of hearts, that coal is going to be burned around the world for years to come,'' said Michael Morris, chairman and president of American Electric Power, which owns the plant here. ''Retrofitting is going to be essential.'' 
 American Electric Power is the nation's largest electricity producer, with a coal-fired grid stretching across 11 states.
 If all goes smoothly, this week engineers will begin pumping carbon dioxide, converted to a fluid, into a layer of sandstone 7,800 feet below the rolling countryside here and then into a layer of dolomite 400 feet below that. 
 The liquid will squeeze into tiny pores in the rock, displacing the salty water there, and assume a shape something like a squashed football, 30 to 40 feet high and hundreds of yards long. 
 American Electric Power's plan is to inject about 100,000 tons annually for two to five years, about 1.5 percent of Mountaineer's yearly emissions of carbon dioxide. Should Congress pass a law controlling carbon dioxide emissions and the new technology proves economically feasible, the company says, it could then move to capture as much as 90 percent of the gas.
 For now the project consists of the two wells and a small chemical factory. In the factory, smoke diverted from the plant's chimney is mixed with a chilled ammonia-based chemical. The chemical is then heated, releasing the carbon dioxide, which is pumped deep into the wells. 
 American Electric Power is spending $73 million on the capture and storage effort, which includes half the cost of the factory. Alstom, the manufacturer of the new equipment, paid for the other half of the factory, hoping to develop expertise that will win it a worldwide market. Alstom would not say what it spent, but public figures indicate that the two companies are jointly spending well over $100 million. 
 For energy planners, a crucial question is how much this technology would cost if refined and installed on a bigger scale. The answer remains elusive. 
 Still, many scientists emphasize that Mountaineer is within a dozen miles of four other big coal plants with a combined capacity of 6,000 megawatts, a concentration so great that industry insiders have nicknamed the area Megawatt Alley. If the technology spread to all of them in a cost-effective way, many say, it could have a broad impact on the coal industry.
 S. Julio Friedmann, leader of the carbon management program at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, calls this corner of the Ohio River Valley a ''must win'' region for carbon dioxide storage.
 Robert Socolow, a Princeton University engineering professor, echoed that sentiment. The nation's fleet of coal-burning plants ''completely dominates our national emissions,'' Professor Socolow said.
 It is also far easier to corral several million tons flowing from a single chimney than a comparable amount coming from tens of millions of car tailpipes or home heating systems, experts point out. 
 Far larger projects for capturing and storing carbon dioxide underground have been under way for several years in Europe and North Africa. In North Dakota, the Great Plains Synfuels plant, which converts methane to natural gas, takes the leftover carbon dioxide and pumps it through a pipeline to Canada to stimulate oil production there. But Mountaineer is the world's first electricity plant to capture and store carbon dioxide.
 A state permit issued to American Electric Power limits the pressure it can use to inject carbon dioxide into the rock. This is to reduce the risk that the injection will crack rock layers above that engineers are counting on to keep the carbon dioxide in place.
 A nonprofit research group, Battelle Memorial Institute, has installed monitoring wells around the rock that will measure changes in pressure and temperature. Engineers can also send energy pulses through the earth between the wells and measure how fast these travel, as a guide to how the carbon dioxide is spreading. 
 Asked whether the injections of carbon dioxide could increase the frequency or magnitude of the small earthquakes that are common in the area, an E.P.A. official said it seemed unlikely. 
 ''With proper site selection and good management, we should be able to implement this safely,'' said Dina Kruger, director of the agency's climate change division. Ms. Kruger also emphasized that the carbon dioxide would be monitored to see if it was seeping. 
 Some local residents are skeptical.
 ''It doesn't matter to me if a scientist says it may or may not leak,'' said Elisa Young, an anti-coal activist who lives nearby on the Ohio side of the river. ''That's not going to stop it from leaking when push comes to shove.''
 At the same time, many others in this coal-dependent region suggest that the notion that carbon dioxide is a menace has been overplayed. 
 Charles A. Powell, the manager of the Mountaineer plant, who has worked there since it opened three decades ago, pointed out that the gas is given off by every human and animal. 
 ''You are breathing out?'' he asked a visitor dryly. 

CORRECTION-DATE: September 23, 2009

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about a coal-fired power plant in West Virginia that is capturing and burying some of the carbon dioxide it generates misstated the materials processed by a plant in North Dakota that captures carbon dioxide and sends it to Canada for storage. That plant, Great Plains Synfuels, converts coal to methane; it does not convert methane to natural gas. (Methane is the principal component of natural gas.)

HEADLINE: Study Shows Better Scores For Charter School Students

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
Students who entered lotteries and won spots in New York City charter schools performed better on state exams than students who entered the same lotteries but did not secure charter school seats, according to a study by a Stanford University economist being released Tuesday. 
 Charter schools, which are privately run but publicly financed, have been faring well on standardized tests in recent years. But skeptics have discounted their success by accusing them of ''creaming'' the best students, saying that the most motivated students and engaged parents are the ones who apply for the spots. 
 The study's methodology addresses that issue by comparing charter school students with students of traditional schools who applied for charter spots but did not get them. Most of the city's 99 charter schools admit students by lottery.
 The report is part of a multiyear study examining the performance of charter schools in New York City by Caroline M. Hoxby, a Stanford economist who has written extensively about her research on charter schools and vouchers. 
 Ms. Hoxby found that students who attended a charter school from kindergarten to eighth grade would nearly match the performance of their peers in affluent suburban communities on state math exams by the time they entered high school, a phenomenon she characterizes as closing the ''Harlem-Scarsdale'' achievement gap. The results are somewhat less striking in English, where students closed 66 percent of the gap, according to the study. 
 ''I wanted to look at something that reflects the reality of what goes on in the New York area,'' Ms. Hoxby said in an interview. ''In terms of life outcomes, I think we just don't know yet. This is not the silver bullet, but this is showing a major and lasting difference.''
 By the third grade, according to the study, the average charter school student was 5.3 points ahead on state exams in English compared with students who were not admitted to the charter schools. In math, the students were 5.8 points ahead. Most tests are scored on a scale of roughly 475 to 800.
 The gap between students in charter schools and those in traditional public schools widened the longer students remained in the charter schools, according to the report. 
 Ms. Hoxby did not reach any conclusions about what practices at the schools caused the jump, but she noted that many charter schools had extended school days and school years, many required students to attend classes on Saturdays and most paid teachers based on their performance and responsibility, rather than the traditional teachers' union salary scales. 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein, have embraced charter schools as a key to their effort to overhaul the city's school system. Mr. Klein has made an effort to recruit charter school operators that have been successful in other parts of the country to open schools throughout the city, particularly in the South Bronx, Central Brooklyn and Harlem. 
 There are approximately 30,000 students in charter schools in the city, and another 40,000 students on waiting lists to be admitted to those schools.

HEADLINE: Maladies of Interpreters

BYLINE: By JOSHUA FOUST. 
Joshua Foust, an independent military analyst, writes the blog Registan.net.

DATELINE: Charlottesville, Va. 

 BODY:
 IN counterinsurgency, the most important thing is winning over the local population. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the commander in charge of all NATO forces in Afghanistan, was right to warn that a ''crisis of confidence among Afghans'' imperils the effort to rebuild the country. For most American troops, however, the only connection they have to the locals -- whether soldiers in the Afghan army or villagers they're trying to secure -- is through their interpreters.
 United States Army doctrine describes interpreters as ''vital,'' which is fairly obvious given the bevy of languages spoken in Afghanistan: Dari, Pashto, Tajik, Uzbek and others. Yet the way the military uses translators is too often haphazard and sometimes dangerously negligent. Many units consider interpreters to be necessary evils, and even those who are Americans of Afghan descent are often scorned or mistreated for being too obviously ''different.''
 Mission Essential Personnel, the primary contractor providing interpreters in Afghanistan, has basic guidelines: interpreters need to be given a place to sleep, for example, and fed. But beyond that, how they are treated is often left up to the individual unit. Many times, they are treated the way they should be: as vital members of a team. Sometimes, however, they are shockingly disrespected. 
 Earlier this year, I traveled through central Afghanistan as a civilian member of an American Provincial Reconstruction Team. We had a translator -- we called her Brooklyn -- who had been born and raised in California. During the initial briefing before our convoy set out, however, the team's commander, an Air Force colonel, demanded that Brooklyn leave the briefing area, referring to her as ''that local woman.'' 
 The briefing slides were market ''SECRET,'' which caused the colonel understandable alarm. Brooklyn, however, had a security clearance allowing her to be present. Perhaps the real problem was that she wore a headscarf, as one would expect a pious Muslim woman to do. 
 The next day, as we were driving between two bases, we ran into a traffic snarl at a bridge, with dozens of Afghan soldiers and police officers milling about. Our colonel, who had left his own translator back at his base, got out of his Humvee and asked Brooklyn to begin translating for him. After discussing the issue with the Afghan forces, she explained that they had found several bombs underneath the bridge, and were waiting for an American bomb disposal team to arrive. They had likely saved our lives, but we got that message only because we had an interpreter, the one the colonel had treated like an enemy spy the night before. 
 ''Your interpreter is way more important than your weapon,'' Cory Schulz, an Army major who led a tactical team embedded with Afghan troops in Paktika Province, told me. With an interpreter, he explained, you can command hundreds of Afghan soldiers; with a gun, you can only defend yourself.
 Interpreters do more than talk and listen. Eight years into the war in Afghanistan, United States troops receive only minimal cultural training before they deploy. Thus interpreters often serve as cultural advisors -- helping Americans learn the nuances of typical Afghan behavior.
 Major Schulz said of his ''terp,'' as they're often called, ''he saved my life more than once.'' Once the interpreter helped his unit identify a suicide bomber in a large crowd before the man could activate the explosives in his vest. The would-be bomber was acting nervously in a way that Afghans could recognize but that Americans were oblivious to, and the translator picked up on it.
 American troops in some isolated parts of Afghanistan have little hope of such guidance. In March I met some officers at Bagram Air Force Base, north of Kabul, who were trying to find an interpreter who spoke Pashai; the Pashai represent only about 1 percent of Afghanistan's population, but live in some of the most violent and insurgency-ridden areas of the country's northeast.
 Mission Essential Personnel couldn't supply anyone who spoke the language, the officers told me, yet they felt that being able to speak to the Pashai could prove important for the war effort. So they went to the camp on the outskirts of Bagram where many interpreters live and found one who could speak the rare language. (Later I was told that he had been assigned to a battalion in Khost, 100 miles south of any Pashai-speaking areas, because he also spoke Pashto.)
 American officers and enlisted soldiers repeatedly told me how vital interpreters are. Yet there remains no standardized way for units to use them, which can lead to insulting incidents like the one Brooklyn had to endure.
 Often, the insults are more subtle, but more personal. In Khost Province, I met an interpreter named Afzal, who worked for a team of Army civilians doing economic and cultural research. Afzal had helped this team for several years, through three rotations of leadership and personnel. He had been trying for a long time to get a visa from the State Department to come to the United States, something many interpreters hope for because of threats to their families. Eventually, extremists began posting threatening letters on his door overnight. 
 Afzal told me that two years earlier, the team's leader, a lieutenant colonel, had promised to submit the paperwork for the visa and vouch for his status as an interpreter, but he apparently never did. The next team leader, another officer, made the same promise, but also apparently never followed through. It was not until the arrival of the third team leader, a civilian, early this year that Afzal was able to submit his application. The delay has complicated the procedure -- for this year the State Department cut the number of available visas for interpreters from Afghanistan and Iraq to 50 from 500.
 Brooklyn told me that the occasional grumpy officer wasn't her only problem. She also complained about Mission Essential Personnel's sloppy management, saying that the company tended to hire elderly interpreters, unsuited for rough travel in a war zone, just because they passed a language test. She said the contractor was unresponsive to complaints of sexual harassment and mistreatment.
 There is also a growing number of stories of local interpreters who have been denied medical treatment. According to CorpWatch, a group that monitors military contractors, an interpreter named Basir Ahmed was fired for ''failing to show up for work'' last year when he was recuperating from shrapnel wounds to his leg received from a homemade bomb that exploded while he was on patrol with American forces near the Pakistani border. 
 In winning hearts and minds, how we treat Afghans as individuals matters more than how many Taliban we kill or how many roads we build. If we cannot treat our military interpreters with basic respect, why should Afghan civilians trust us to help them remake their nation?

HEADLINE: After Loss, Home Builder Turns Optimistic

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The Lennar Corporation, the house builder, reported a wider quarterly loss on Monday as it continued to write down the value of land and unsold homes.
 Orders for new homes were down 8 percent compared with a year earlier, but such orders rose each month during the quarter. 
 In addition, Lennar had more sales in the works at the end of last month than at any time since August 2008, and executives said the company would be profitable next year if the economy remained stable.
 ''We're gaining confidence that we're getting much closer to the end of this housing-led downturn,'' Stuart A. Miller, Lennar's chief executive, said in a conference call, adding that consumers were feeling more confident about buying a home.
 Lennar, which caters to first-time homeowners, sold 2,691 homes in the quarter, down 29 percent compared with year-ago levels. The average sales price was $239,000, down 11 percent, but stronger demand allowed Lennar to reduce the incentives it offered homebuyers to $42,200 for each home, down from $45,900 a year ago, and from $52,600 it offered during the previous quarter.
 The company reported Monday that it lost $171.6 million, or 97 cents a share, in its most recent quarter, worse than the loss of $89 million, or 56 cents a share, a year earlier. The most recent quarter included a one-time charge of 76 cents a share for tax adjustments and write-downs.
 Revenue in the period, which ended Aug. 31 and was the third quarter of Lennar's fiscal year, fell 35 percent, to $720.7 million, from $1.11 billion. Shares of Lennar, which is based in Miami, fell 52 cents, to $16.02 a share.

HEADLINE: From 0 to 60 in a Recession

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
It was not exactly a planned strategy, but the recession, particularly in the United States, has been very good for Hyundai, the South Korean automaker.
 After years of struggling to prove to consumers than it was more than a second-tier brand, Hyundai Motor America and its affiliate, Kia Motor America, accounted for 8 percent of the new-vehicle market in the United States in August, more than Chrysler's 7.4 percent. The company sold more than 60,000 vehicles last month as buyers rushed to take advantage of the government's cash-for-clunkers program before its end.
The carmaker's sales topped August 2008 by 47 percent -- total industry sales were up only 1 percent. 
 ''They have a tremendous amount of momentum right now, and I don't see that stopping,'' said Erich Merkle, an analyst who founded the Web site Autoconomy.com in Grand Rapids, Mich. ''Hyundai is a competitive threat not just to the Big Three but for the first time to the Japanese automakers as well.''
 Globally, the Hyundai-Kia Automotive Group, which owns the Hyundai Motor Company and about 39 percent of Kia Motors, passed Honda last year and the Ford Motor Company this year. It became the fourth-largest automaker, behind Toyota, General Motors and Volkswagen (it is seventh in the United States). It was in 11th place worldwide less than a decade ago.
 Hyundai and Kia both expect to sell more vehicles in the United States this year than they did in 2008, a claim that only one other automaker, Subaru, can make. Sales by all of Hyundai's bigger competitors have fallen by more than 20 percent so far this year.
 ''There's a great spot for a brand like ours, particularly in a recessionlike environment,'' John Krafcik, the chief executive of Hyundai Motor America, said. ''Consumers are beginning to question the value of a premium brand -- is it worth an extra $5,000?''
 Hyundai's Exhibit A is the Genesis, a luxury sedan that was named North American car of the year at the Detroit auto show in January. Part of the appeal of the Genesis, in addition to a price tag that is thousands less than that of its chief rivals, may be that hardly anyone associates Hyundai with the word ''luxury.''
 Its lowest-priced model, the Accent, sells for just under $10,000 for the base package. The Genesis, its most expensive model, starts at $32,250 -- by comparison, the Lexus ES 350 costs $34,470, and the Cadillac CTS costs $36,560. 
 Several dealers have said that they are selling the Genesis to business owners who, after laying off some employees, want to project an image that they, too, are cutting back.
 ''The current economic climate really places an emphasis on people spending their money wisely,'' said George Glassman, a Hyundai and Kia dealer in suburban Detroit who sold Oldsmobiles until G.M. eliminated that brand in 2004.
 ''They're appealing to people's desires to spend reasonably and to get great value for your dollar,'' Mr. Glassman said. ''Twenty years ago, Hyundai was a reasonable alternative to purchasing a used car. Now they are attracting consumers from all ages and all walks of life.''
 Mr. Glassman's recent customers include Joe Randazzo, who had considered the Chevrolet Malibu sedan because his son works for G.M. Despite the family connection and his past preference for Cadillacs, Mr. Randazzo chose to buy a Hyundai Sonata.
 ''It's a very good ride, and I really enjoy driving it,'' said Mr. Randazzo, 79, who is retired from running a ceramic tile business. ''I used to drive Cadillacs all the time. I don't need to drive a heavy car like that anymore. No disrespect to G.M. or anybody, but my next car will be a Hyundai, too.''
 Hyundai's research indicates that 30 percent of consumers now consider the brand when shopping for a new vehicle, nearly triple the number who did about five years ago.
 ''They went from the perception of cheap to an excellent value,'' said Mr. Merkle, the analyst. ''I think that this will stick even after we come out of this environment, because people are becoming better acquainted with the product.''
 Aggressive marketing is another reason Hyundai's sales are surging. The automaker introduced a first-of-its-kind offer early this year that lets customers who find themselves without work return their car with no penalty for up to a year. It later expanded the offer to include up to three months of payment relief. 
 G.M. and Ford briefly offered similar programs after the Hyundai program helped increase sales.
 Hyundai also jumped ahead of competitors this summer, by inviting customers to turn in old, inefficient vehicles under the cash-for-clunkers program three weeks before its official start.
 ''They're really trying to use this recession as an opportunity to take market share, which they have,'' Jessica Caldwell, director of industry analysis at Edmunds.com. 
 Hyundai and Kia are pushing for more. In November, Kia plans to open a new assembly plant in West Point, Ga., its first in the United States. (Hyundai has a plant in Alabama.)
 Several new models are coming soon, including the compact Kia Forte this fall and revamped versions of the Hyundai Sonata and Tucson next year.
 The company's goal is to have the industry's highest fuel economy by 2015; it is currently third, behind Toyota and Honda, even with no hybrid in its lineup.
 ''We may do that a couple of years earlier if you look at the trajectory we're in,'' said Mr. Krafcik.

HEADLINE: New Life Where Towns and Teams Are Dying

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

DATELINE: CANADIAN, Tex. 

 BODY:
Last Friday, as on all football Fridays at state champion Canadian High School, a black-and-gold flag flew along Main Street outside the City Drug Soda Fountain. A painted sign spelled out Wildcats on the window at Treasure's Beauty Salon. Up the street, at the Hemphill County Courthouse, Sally Henderson showed off the paw-print design on her black-and-gold fingernails.
 Until a nail salon opened over the summer in this tiny, wealthy and ambitious Panhandle town, Henderson drove 45 miles to Pampa or 100 miles to Amarillo to have her nails done for football games and holidays.
 ''My husband is so glad I don't have to drive anymore,'' said Henderson, 52, a cheery administrative assistant to the county judge and the wife of the county sheriff. ''I'd stop and do Wal-Mart, and every time I got my nails done, I'd spend $300.'' 
 After an energy boom tapped out in 1985, the downtown in Canadian, population 2,233, grew desolate. A dozen buildings were left empty or boarded up. But the town grew more savvy about the boom-and-bust cycle of oil and gas, remaking itself in the late 1990s as a regional center for ecotourism and refurbishing its downtown with restored brick storefronts, a popular steakhouse and a state-of-the-art movie theater.
 Canadian has a blue-jean casualness and a Mayberry hospitality, but its small-town warmth is buttressed by big-city business acumen. It is an unlikely commodities trading center, a cowboy-booted alternative to the tassel-loafered trading floors of New York City. And as the town has reinvigorated itself, so has the Canadian Wildcats football team.
 Until 1992, the school had never won a playoff game. Two years ago, under Coach Kyle Lynch, the Wildcats began using a spread offense as wide open as the land here and won a state Class 2A title in 2007 and a Class 1A title in 2008.
 This season, Canadian is 4-0, and despite graduating 20 seniors from last year's team, the Wildcats are seeking a third consecutive championship, the school, the team and the town linked by a sense of pride, tradition, innovation, high expectation and reinvention.
 ''We're 100 miles from any place you can buy underwear,'' said Tresea Rankin, 50, owner of the Bucket sandwich shop, who supplies seven restaurants across the Panhandle with her celebrated sourdough bread. ''You make a choice. You can be of the world or have your own. We choose to have our own.''
 In geography and sustainability, Canadian defies many stereotypes of West Texas and the Panhandle. The land is not flat but rolling and not dry but lush enough in the Canadian River Valley to support a fall foliage festival. The town is socially and politically conservative but civically progressive.
 Canadian has avoided the withering of a number of small towns from population shifts to urban areas. Some places can no longer field an 11-man football team. In 1993, 83 public schools in Texas played six-man football; now there are about 125, according to Granger Huntress, who operates a Web site devoted to the six-man game.
 Canadian, on the other hand, begins tackle football in third grade, and of the nearly 100 boys in grades 9 to 12 -- most of them working-class children -- 63 play on the varsity team or the junior varsity.
 ''We specialize in being audacious,'' said Laurie Ezzell Brown, the editor of The Canadian Record. ''We haven't accepted the fate of most dusty Panhandle towns. At some point, we decided not to curl up and die.''
 Brandon Robinson, Canadian's senior quarterback, who threw for 3,269 yards and 44 touchdowns last season, arrived from Guthrie, Okla., in 2007 when his father, who owns a bulldozer business, told him, ''We're moving to the oil boom.''
 ''I fought with him a long time,'' Robinson said.
 Yet, once he arrived in Canadian, Robinson said he quickly became comfortable in a place where on Thursdays, residents eagerly await the flying of a green flag outside The Canadian Record that signals the arrival of the weekly edition; where Buddy King, a wealthy businessman, carries a broom and a garbage bag in his pickup truck to sweep up any trash; where a proposal before the school board would guarantee a chance at college for all Canadian kids, regardless of their financial situation. 
 ''Everyone was so welcoming,'' Robinson said.
 The current recession has gut-punched oil and gas drilling, costing 400 to 500 local jobs, city officials said. Yet Canadian remains one of Texas' most prosperous school districts. It has an enrollment of only 798 from pre-K through 12th grade, but the school district's property values were last assessed at $1.5 billion.
 Each student in grades 7 through 12 has been issued a laptop computer by the district. The tennis team has four courts on campus. The state champion track team has a new running surface. The football team has an artificial turf field, an 8,500-square-foot field house scheduled to open next month and a sophisticated computer scouting system that can track opponents' plays for the last five years.
 Every practice is videotaped, uploaded to a Web site and watched by Lynch on his computer each night after his two sons go to bed. At some point, he will give the password to his players.
 ''I don't want everything to end up on YouTube,'' Lynch, 44, said with a laugh.
 Football serves as the town's connective tissue, said Rankin, the restaurateur. Her son, Jed, a linebacker who has graduated, was named the 2008 state Class 1A defensive player of the year. The building next to her home, known as the Barn of Fame, is papered with newspaper articles, her son's jersey and a shirt that she wore, without washing (along with the rest of her outfit), to each game during the 2007 championship season.
 ''You know how you like to sit around the table with a good pan of chicken for Sunday dinner?'' Rankin said. ''That's what football is, a good pan of chicken.''
 Football also reflects the civic ideal that residents of Canadian should take care of their own and strive for general excellence. Salem Abraham, 43, whose Lebanese-American family has played a prominent role in town for a century, left to obtain a finance degree at Notre Dame, returned home and now manages a hedge fund firm with assets of $450 million.
 In 1998, as Canadian turned to nature tourism by building hiking trails and prairie-dog towns and organizing spring bird-watching tours around the mating habits of the lesser prairie chicken, Abraham began a $3 million effort to renovate downtown.
 He has spent more than $1 million refurbishing the century-old Palace Theater, installing a sound system invented by George Lucas for a ''Star Wars'' movie and a Sony digital projection system that, Abraham said, is found in only 68 theaters around the country.
 When he built a skate park, he consulted Tony Hawk on the design. Abraham is also a member of the school board, which, flush with oil and gas money and ranching wealth, has issued $34 million in bonds since 2002 -- $30.5 million to be paid off by early next year -- to improve athletic facilities, science labs, the county library and a 700-seat auditorium at the middle school that, Abraham hopes, will attract traveling Broadway shows. His father, a retired physician, has transformed his 8,000-square-foot mansion into an art gallery. 
 ''No one drives across the street for ordinary,'' Abraham said of his desire to attract visitors from as far as 100 miles. ''You've got to go over the top. It has to be great.''
 The football team's motto is ''212 degrees,'' a reference to the boiling point of water. ''At 211 degrees, water does nothing,'' Lynch said. ''One degree of extra effort, and it boils and creates steam. With steam, you can move a locomotive.''
 Lynch insists that his players win and lose with dignity. The Wildcats avoid trash-talking, help opponents off the ground and stand at midfield after each game as the other team sings its alma mater.
 ''I hate football, but I want to be part of it,'' said Diana McGarr, 64, a longtime English teacher at Canadian High School. ''I love Kyle; he's tough but positive.''
 As in other parts of Texas, football is a secular religion here. When Rankin's daughter, Tandi, wanted to schedule her wedding for Oct. 23, her mother nixed the idea, moving it to the 24th.
 ''The 23rd's a Friday,'' Rankin said. ''We play Booker that night.''
 When the playoffs arrive in November, Rankin will again make sourdough sandwiches for the players to take on the road, as she has done the past two championship seasons.
 ''The bread's undefeated,'' she said.
 Even in Texas, though, there are limits to a town's support for the high school team. Plans for an indoor practice facility were scrapped after some residents complained about the cost. Others thought the team should practice outdoors in the same conditions in which it would play.
 ''We didn't want to raise any hothouse athletes,'' Ezzell Brown, the editor, said.

HEADLINE: Quitting Their Jobs to Focus on Beer

BYLINE: By JENNIFER 8. LEE

 BODY:
Stephen Valand, 23, and Erica Shea, 25, quit their jobs earlier this year to start the Brooklyn Brew Shop, which makes gallon beer-brewing kits sized for New York City apartments. The couple starting selling the kits in early July at the Brooklyn Flea Market and online. But before deciding to jump into business together, they went on a seven-week backpacking trip to Europe to see if they were compatible. 
 Gathering the seed money:(Mr. Valand) We just worked, just quit our jobs and did it with our own money. I've always been good at saving money. It's pretty much all my money. (Ms. Shea) He gets paid back first, and I am basically working for free. Because we are going through the flea market, the overhead isn't that high. The stand itself is basically $100 a day. The major investment was the grain and the equipment and meeting wholesalers' minimum buy-ins. Right now everything we make is reinvested.
 Was it hard to quit?(Ms. Shea) No, that part was easy. (Mr. Valand) The hard part was saving the money, deciding not to eat out. My father was a truck driver, so he worked for himself. I never liked the idea of working for people or taking orders.
 How did you get the idea?(Ms. Shea) I grew up in a record store, vinyl. My dad had done some home-brewing through the record store. I came across all my dad's old equipment and decided it would be a fun thing to get into. 
 The business plan?(Mr. Valand) We wrote stuff down on random pieces of paper. We learned how to make beer from reading these random Web sites; we figured we might as well learn how to start a business from sites, too.
 Backpacking and business: (Ms. Shea) Seeing my parents open new locations of stores, I knew that starting a new business is a 24/7 job, especially in the beginning. It takes a lot of mutual respect to get over being tired and irritable and hungry and lifting heavy things. The seven-week backpacking trip through Europe -- if we made it through that, we could make it through a business.
 The hardest part of starting a company in this economy?(Ms. Shea) We had friends getting laid off in media. I was in a job. To tell somebody that you are quitting your jobs when they got laid off is a delicate issue.
 What would you do differently now? (Mr. Valand) Order things a little bit in advance, for UPS will make a way to make you pay.
 The legal stuff: (Ms. Shea) We have friends at Brooklyn Law School that are part of the clinic that helps start new businesses get their proper licensing in order, so they offered to help us.
 Who are your customers? (Ms. Shea) We had a groom stop by and pick up six as his groomsmen gift. (Mr. Valand) Weddings and birthdays have been good for us. Apparently people don't know what to get for guys. 
 What are you doing for health insurance?(Mr. Valand) We hope for reform. We want the town halls to stop.

HEADLINE: G-20 Urged to Force Banks to Add Reserves

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
World leaders at the Group of 20 meeting this week should force banks to build up their reserves substantially to avoid another acute financial crisis, a leading association of regulatory experts said Monday. 
 Lurking behind the appeal from the European Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee, a panel of academics and former regulators, is a fear that the political momentum for deep-seated reform may be waning as the financial crisis ebbs. Although a recent meeting of G-20 finance ministers in London discussed ideas for increasing the reserves that banks must hold against losses, there was little sense of urgency. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said he wanted to see a final agreement by the end of next year.
 Harald Benink, a professor of banking and finance at Tilburg University in the Netherlands and a member of the shadow committee, said the global effort to revamp banking regulation had slowed badly as officials became bogged down in debates over executive pay. But only higher reserves will avoid future crises, he said.
 ''There is no point in doing anything but talking about how much capital banks need to have on hand,'' Mr. Benink said.
 The group called on officials who will attend the G-20 meeting, in Pittsburgh, to create rules that would ''raise the average bank capital requirement substantially.''
 The group also criticized plans by the G-20 to introduce what are known as counter-cyclical capital buffers, or rules that require banks to put away more reserves in good times and draw them down in bad times. In theory, such rules would have forced banks to reserve capital during the decade-long global housing boom that ended so badly.
 But in reality, neither financial markets nor regulators were able to predict the housing bust and are unlikely to foresee future bubbles, the shadow committee said.
 ''Bubbles are easily identifiable ex post but rarely recognized beforehand when it would be desirable to build up the capital base,'' the group wrote.
 The committee also called on the G-20 to find a solution to the ''too big to fail'' problem in which governments have bailed out large banks that posed a threat to the financial system as a whole. Some officials have suggested a ''resolution regime'' that would permit regulators to unwind and dissolve major banks.
 The shadow committee suggested that regulators could instead require banks that are too big to fail to hold even more capital in reserve, a step that would presumably reduce the likelihood of failure. In any case, regulators need to dampen expectations that they will behave the same in future crises as they have in the current one, lest they encourage excessive risk-taking, the committee said.
 ''Current crisis management may have sown the seeds of future crises,'' the committee wrote.

HEADLINE: A.I.G. Said To Be Stable, But Hurting For Cash

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
The research arm of Congress reported on Monday that the American International Group's financial condition had stabilized but that it was not clear whether the giant insurance group would ever be able to repay the federal government. 
 The Government Accountability Office said the $182 billion bailout package had succeeded in breaking A.I.G.'s calamitous fall and had produced signs of improvement in its insurance businesses. But the company's ability to restructure and survive over the long term depends on ''market conditions and continued government support,'' the office concluded. 
 Paying off the debt to the government will be a slow, hard process, the report suggested, because raising the money will mean selling businesses that make up 65 percent of the company and employ roughly 70,000 people. 
 That difficulty stands in stark contrast to the relative ease with which many of the nation's biggest banks have begun to repay the government funds they were extended during the depths of the financial crisis. 
 The report suggested that A.I.G. would struggle just to stay current on its government debt, much less repay it. Under the initial bailout agreement, A.I.G. was to pay a 10 percent dividend on preferred stock, in exchange for $40 billion in capital from the Treasury. A quarterly dividend payment of about $1 billion is coming due in November. The company does not appear to have the means to pay it, and was granted the option of not paying as part of a debt relief package in March. If the company misses four payments, though, the Treasury can elect two directors to its board.
 The report also cast questions about a debt restructuring with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The plan, outlined in March in broad strokes, would allow A.I.G. to extinguish about $8.5 billion of debt by giving the Fed an ownership stake in the future cash flows of its domestic life insurance businesses. The transaction has not been scheduled nor have details been disclosed, and it is not clear that the insurance units really have $8.5 billion to spare. 
 The assessment of A.I.G.'s prospects coincided with word that a senior House Democrat was planning to ask the Federal Reserve and the Treasury about possibly easing the terms of A.I.G.'s government debt yet again. 
 Representative Edolphus Towns, Democrat of New York, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, began considering debt relief after meeting last week with Maurice R. Greenberg, A.I.G.'s former chief executive, according to a spokeswoman. 
 The terms of A.I.G.'s rescue have been eased three times, because they threatened to crush the troubled company. Some elements of the most recent package, announced in March, have not been fully adopted. 
 Mr. Greenberg led A.I.G. as it grew into the world's largest insurance group before being forced out during an accounting scandal in 2005. He and a group of companies he controls are still the largest common shareholder, although the federal government took an 80 percent interest when it first rescued the company a year ago. 
 Ever since the bailout, Mr. Greenberg has been an outspoken critic of the government's plans to dismantle the company and sell parts to repay the federal government. He has argued that this would destroy value, and that it would be better for the government to provide long-term loans so that A.I.G. can keep operating as a group and pay back the government more slowly but, probably, more completely. 
 For most of the last year, A.I.G. paid little attention to its former leader. Recently, a new chief executive, Robert Benmosche, conceded that Mr. Greenberg might have some useful ideas.
 The spokeswoman for Mr. Towns said the congressman had been hearing reports about ''fire-sale prices'' for A.I.G.'s businesses, and had wanted to find out whether Mr. Greenberg's ideas might be better for taxpayers. She said that after the meeting Mr. Towns had asked the committee staff to study Mr. Greenberg's proposals, which include greatly reducing the government's stake in A.I.G., among other things.
 The G.A.O. confirmed that A.I.G. had been getting low prices on its asset sales, but said that the amount coming in on the sales was rising. As of the end of the third quarter of this year, it had taken in a total $8.6 billion. That is still far short of the amount needed, but some large businesses have yet to be sold. 
 The report listed a number of indicators that the government would be monitoring to assess A.I.G.'s long-term viability. Among them were its credit ratings, its available cash and its success in winding down the trading unit, called A.I.G. Financial Products, that sold the exotic derivatives that set off last fall's crisis.
 ''The ongoing potential of systemic risk remains a concern until A.I.G. is restructured and market conditions improve,'' the report said. 
 The government also said it would watch the prices that traders were charging each other to guarantee A.I.G.'s debts, also through the buying and selling of derivatives. 
 The insurance group's credit ratings have been unchanged since March, for the most part. That was when the Fed and Treasury took steps to ease the terms of A.I.G.'s debt for the third time. (One rating agency, Fitch, downgraded the insurer's debt in May but has kept its ratings constant since then.)
 The ratings are important because if they fall, A.I.G.'s trading partners can demand collateral on their contracts -- precisely the situation that led to the global crisis last fall. The amount they could seek would vary, depending on the severity of the downgrade. As of late May, a three-notch downgrade by either Standard & Poor's or Moody's would have required A.I.G. to post $7.7 billion. 
 A lower credit rating might disqualify A.I.G.'s business units from working with the Fed's commercial paper facility, something that already happened to its airline-leasing unit, which was downgraded in January and appears to be running into a liquidity problem. 
 In addition to rating insurers' creditworthiness, the agencies also rate their ''financial strength,'' a reference to their ability to fulfill their promises to policyholders. The G.A.O. said that if A.I.G.'s financial strength rating were to fall, its life insurance businesses would be ''severely affected,'' with high surrender rates and the suspension of policy sales by some firms.
 Its property and casualty businesses would also be affected, the G.A.O. said, estimating that if A. M. Best downgraded the financial strength of A.I.G.'s property and casualty businesses, premiums could decline by about 50 percent. That would cause operating losses and might prompt many employees to leave.

HEADLINE: Dell to Spend $3.9 Billion To Acquire Perot Systems

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL and ASHLEE VANCE

 BODY:
Dell, which has struggled with flagging sales of personal computers and servers during the downturn, has bought itself a piece of the federal government's stimulus pie.
 The company said Monday that it would spend $3.9 billion in cash to buy Perot Systems, a provider of technology services that is especially strong in the growing field of electronic health records. The government is pouring $19 billion over the next five years into technology to help doctors and hospitals digitize medical records.
 Dell and Perot were already working together on some medical projects, but the combination brings tremendous firepower to the task. Perot serves 1,000 hospitals -- more, it says, than any other services firm. And Perot already helps automate the patient records of 200,000 doctors. 
 While Dell has long taken a lean and focused approach to the computer business, devoting itself mainly to wringing the most efficiencies possible out of the manufacturing process, it has been forced to look for new ideas in recent years. The recession has hit Dell hard because it depends more than its rivals on sales to businesses, which have frozen their purchases of PCs and other data center equipment.
 Dell's largest rivals -- I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard -- are leading players in computer services, which provide a steady revenue stream that is less vulnerable to the fluctuations of the economy. 
 Dell is paying $30 a share for Perot Systems, a 61 percent premium over the company's closing price Friday. Some investors found that price too expensive, and Dell's stock fell about 4 percent in Monday trading to close at $16.01. 
 A. M. Sacconaghi, a computer hardware analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said that Dell paid ''a rich price.'' But he said the deal was ultimately sound financially and strategically.
 In Mr. Sacconaghi's view, since Dell is flush with cash, putting $3.9 billion into Perot will earn more than the interest that money would have garnered sitting in the bank. In addition, the companies hope to eliminate $300 million in annual costs as Dell's services business is consolidated into Perot Systems. 
 The combined unit will still use the Perot name and retain its Plano, Tex., headquarters, which is about 200 miles from Dell's home office in Round Rock, Tex., on the outskirts of Austin. It will be run by Peter Altabef, now Perot's chief executive.
 Dell plans to help Perot Systems expand to industries and countries that it currently does not serve. At the same time, it is counting on Perot to increase Dell's sales in the health care industry. 
 Michael S. Dell, the chief executive of Dell, said that Dell and Perot would continue to focus on finding the most efficient way to provide services to clients, including providing services from centralized, remote facilities.
 ''This is about expanding what we do for a large number of customers,'' he said. Mr. Dell said that the company would look to acquire more services companies to fold into Perot. He added that Dell was also hoping to make acquisitions in other areas.
 Perot Systems was founded in 1988 by H. Ross Perot, the two-time presidential candidate. He founded another services company, Electronic Data Systems, in 1962 and sold it to General Motors in 1984. E.D.S. was eventually spun out by the car company and bought last year by Hewlett-Packard for $13.9 billion.
 At the $30-per-share acquisition price, the Perot family's stake in the company is worth $952 million, according to calculations by Bloomberg News.
 The two companies have been both flirting and working together for several years. Dell was interested in buying Perot in 2007, but the companies could not come to terms. 
 ''We had no interest selling the company,'' said Mr. Perot's son, H. Ross Perot Jr., who is chairman of Perot Systems. ''Michael is a very good salesman. His vision got us excited and got my father excited.''
 The younger Mr. Perot said he believed this acquisition would turn out better than the family's sale of E.D.S. to General Motors. 
 ''It's a little bit different selling to an auto manufacturer than to Dell,'' he said. ''And also, this is a Texas transaction. I've known Michael since the 1980s. Our families are close. The cultures are close. There is not a lot of mystery in this relationship.'' 
 He added that Dell had a ''test drive'' of Perot Systems because it has used the firm to run some of its own technology projects.
 Perot Systems' stock has bounced between $10 and $15 for the last eight years, in part because investors have been concerned about the tight margins in the services business. Perot also lost its largest client, the Swiss banking giant UBS, in 2007, said Joseph A. Vafi, who follows Perot Systems for Jeffries & Company. 
 The computer services business historically has involved high risks because the service providers need to buy and finance the hardware they use on behalf of their clients. Perot Systems shied away from that sort of big deal and sought projects in which it could manage computers it did not own. 
 Dell has stepped up its pace of acquisitions recently, buying about 10 companies in the last two years after spending its first two decades making no deals of note. The largest previous buy for Dell was in late 2007 when it acquired the storage maker EqualLogic for $1.4 billion.
 Analysts have praised H.P.'s good timing in buying E.D.S. during a slump in the economy. The services revenue helped pad H.P.'s bottom line when PC, printer and data center hardware sales were plummeting.
 H. P. has spent the last year reworking E.D.S.'s cost structure through extensive layoffs and salary cuts. At a meeting with analysts this week, H. P. is expected to update Wall Street on its progress with these measures while boasting that it is ready to expand the E.D.S. business.
 Dell, by contrast, has spent the last year talking about making acquisitions, but did not spring into action until now.

HEADLINE: Three Cheers For Irving

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Irving Kristol was born into a fanatical century and thrust himself into every ideologically charged battle of his age. In the 1930s, as a young socialist, he fought the Stalinists. In the 1940s, as a soldier, he fought fascism. In the decades beyond, as a writer and intellectual, he engaged with McCarthyism, the cold war, the Great Society, the Woodstock generation, the culture wars of the 1970s, the Reagan revolution and so on.
 The century was filled with hysterias, all of which he refused to join. There were fanaticisms, none of which he had any part in. Kristol, who died on Friday, seemed to enter life with an intellectual demeanor that he once characterized as ''detached attachment.'' 
 He would champion certain causes. He could arrive at surprising and radical conclusions. He was unabashedly neoconservative. But he also stood apart, and directed his skeptical gaze even on his own positions, and even on the things to which he was most loyal.
 ''There are no benefits without costs in human affairs,'' he once wrote. And so there is no idea so true and no movement so pure that it doesn't require scrutiny. There was no position in this fallen world without flaws.
 So while others were marching to barricades, picking out bits of the truth that confirmed their own prejudices, editing contrary evidence and working themselves up a righteous lather, Kristol would adopt an attitude of smiling forbearance. He was able to pick a side without losing his clarity.
 Kristol championed capitalism and wrote brilliantly about Adam Smith. But like Smith, he could only give two cheers for capitalism, because the system of creative destruction has victims as well as beneficiaries.
 Kristol championed middle-class virtues like faith, family and responsibility, especially during the 1960s when they were so much under attack. But he acknowledged that bourgeois culture could be boring and spiritually unsatisfying.
 Kristol championed democracy but understood its limitations. He emphasized that the American founders believed in a democratic system, but were appalled by the democratic faith: the idea that the majority view should be followed in all circumstances. They built a system that was half-democracy and half a republic, designed to acknowledge and also subdue popular will.
 Kristol embraced the welfare state (one of his great achievements was to reconcile conservatism with the New Deal), but he was skeptical of most individual proposals. Improving society is so intractably hard that all efforts to do so should be subject to the most careful scrutiny.
 His goal, he wrote, was ''not to dismantle the welfare state in the name of free-market economics but rather to reshape it so as to attach it to the conservative predispositions of the people.'' He believed that government programs that were not paternalistic, but merely provided social insurance, would ''engender larger loyalties,'' which is ''precisely what the art of government, properly understood, is all about.''
 Kristol was easily the most influential contemporary writer in my life, and while going over my worn collections, I've wondered where this attitude of detached attachment came from.
 My first guess is ethnic. Kristol grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Brooklyn and seems to have absorbed the elemental Jewish commandment: Don't be a schmuck. Don't fall for fantastical notions that have nothing to do with the way people really are.
 My second guess is philosophical. Kristol wrote in a time when intellectuals saw themselves as heirs to the Enlightenment, by which they meant the French Enlightenment. They put their faith in a rational elite and a moral avant-garde that would champion justice, virtue and equality by leading social and political revolutions.
 But Kristol was drawn to the other Enlightenment: the Anglo-Scottish Enlightenment, led by Lord Shaftesbury, Adam Ferguson, Adam Smith and Edmund Burke. This was a more prosaic Enlightenment, which was hostile to passionate politics. The leaders of the Scottish environment hoped that progress might come gradually and organically -- if individuals were given the liberty to develop their own responsible habits and if they themselves built institutions to guide them on their way.
 My third guess is moral. In ''The Brothers Karamazov,'' Dostoyevsky has his Antichrist flaunt a banner that, in modern form, reads: ''First make people prosperous, and then ask of them virtue.''
 Kristol argued that this was the great seduction of modern politics -- to believe that problems that were essentially moral and civic could be solved by economic means. They can't. Political problems, even many economic problems, are, at heart, ethical and cultural problems. And improving the attitudes and virtues of a nation is, at best, a slow, halting process.
 Kristol pursued this task by being cheerful, patient and realistic -- by being at once courageously committed and skeptically detached.

HEADLINE: Border Fantasies

 BODY:
Members of Congress who voted for the Southwest border fence as the fix for illegal immigration professed shock -- shock at the news that the project is running years behind, and billions of dollars ahead, of the Bush administration's early, rosy projections. 
 Auditors reported last week that the high-tech, 28-mile ''virtual'' section of the fence was running a mere seven years behind this month's planned opening. Initially, designers talked of using off-the-shelf technology for the radar, cameras and other sensors, but problems cropped up. (Imagine, discovering that cameras tremble in rough weather.) ''I'm trying to figure out why this is so difficult,'' said Representative Michael McCaul of Texas. ''These are basically cameras on a pole.'' 
 The current cost estimate for the Buck Rogers barrier? $1.1 billion. 
 Investigators from the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office report that the larger, actual fence -- covering a 600 mile-plus stretch between San Diego and Brownsville, Tex. -- cost $2.4 billion to build and will cost an extra $6.5 billion in upkeep across two decades. 
 Investigators also concluded that there's no good way of gauging the effectiveness of the fence. 
 The current decline in border arrests could be because of the bad economy as much as the fence (which the innovative have already learned to breach with cutters, torches and ladders). Even then, the fence covers only the more manageable third of the border with Mexico.
 Members of the House border security subcommittee voiced grave concern but didn't peer much beyond fencing technology to the more complex reality: the need for Congress to reform the nation's immigration laws. No fence can keep a determined immigrant out or absolve Congress of that responsibility.

HEADLINE: Census Data Offer a Snapshot Tinted by Recession

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
A smaller share of Americans married, drove to work alone, owned their own home or moved to a new residence last year than the year before. 
 More lived in overcrowded housing. Property values declined. And fewer immigrants arrived, which meant that for the first time since the beginning of the decade, the total number of foreign-born people in the country did not grow.
 Those were among the findings released Monday in the Census Bureau's annual American Community Survey, a wealth of data comparing the nation's profile in 2008 with that of 2007. 
 Several experts, including Mark Mather, associate vice president for domestic programs at the Population Reference Bureau, said a number of the changes could be attributed to the national recession, which began at the end of 2007. The result is an early statistical snapshot of the economic downturn and the housing bust.
 For example, after rising steadily since 2000, median home values dropped in 2008, and the homeownership rate fell half a point, to 66.6 percent, the lowest since 2002. Among blacks, who have been disproportionately affected by foreclosures, homeownership fell a full point, to 45.6 percent. 
 Furthermore, in a country where people typically move to take advantage of better job opportunities, those who changed residences fell to 15 percent in 2008, from a recent peak of 16 percent in 2006.
 ''Job loss, or the potential for job loss, leads to feelings of economic insecurity,'' Dr. Mather said, with implications for additional matters like the timing of divorce and marriage. Such insecurity appears to have added to a longer trend in which the share of people over age 15 who have never married increased to 31 percent last year from 27 percent in 2000.
 The latest figures appear likely to fuel political debates on subjects as varied as health care (the rate of uninsured children last year ranged as high as 20 percent, in Nevada) and immigration (fewer newcomers appear to be illegal or unnaturalized immigrants). 
 Earlier private and government surveys suggested that immigration was slowing, but these were the first annual census figures showing it to be stagnant. 
 ''We've had an economic downturn, and that may well be affecting the attractiveness of the United States as a destination,'' said Thomas A. Gryn, a statistician with the bureau's immigration statistics staff.
 William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, said: ''The general economic malaise in the U.S. has drawn fewer immigrants from Mexico and elsewhere. At the same time, there are increases in high-skilled immigrants from India'' and some other Asian countries.
 The statistics also showed that real median household income declined nationwide, rising in only five states -- New York, New Jersey, Kansas, Louisiana and Texas -- compared with 33 states in 2007. It ranged from $37,790 in Mississippi to $70,545 in Maryland. Income inequality was highest in metropolitan New York, where the top fifth of households received 20 times as much as the bottom fifth.
 The median price of an owner-occupied home fell nationally (by 2 percent, to $197,600) and in 22 states. The biggest declines were in Nevada and California (16 percent) and Florida (9 percent).

 The proportion of people lacking health insurance ranged from 4 percent in Massachusetts to 24 percent in Texas.
 Overcrowding, defined as more than 1.51 people per room, afflicted 1.1 percent of households, up from 0.7 percent.
