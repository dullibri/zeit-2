HEADLINE: The News Faces a Deadline, but the 2 Sides Aren't Even Negotiating

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
The Daily News and leaders of its nine striking unions are locked in a new dispute that has stopped all negotiations, even though the clock is ticking on a management threat to close the paper unless the strike is settled or the paper is sold.
The News announced 10 days ago that it had filed formal notice as required by Federal law that it intended to close the paper in 60 days. Citing mounting losses from the strike, The News said that only a prompt settlement or a sale could prevent the paper's closing. 
 Union leaders say they have not scheduled negotiating sessions because The News's management has refused to delay the time-consuming discovery process on a lawsuit against the unions charging illegal secondary boycott and intimidation of advertisers. The unions have said their actions, like distributing leaflets at stores of advertisers, have been legal.
James Hoge, publisher of The News, said he would not delay the discovery process because union violence and intimidation against the paper's advertisers had not stopped.
The resulting deadlock has raised concern among some union members that their leadership might not be moving fast enough toward serious negotiations, regardless of the burden imposed by the discovery process.
"We feel like this is the moment of truth, and we want to make sure we don't miss any opportunity to prevent the closing of the paper," said Tom Robbins, a striking investigative reporter who is a member of the Newspaper Guild strike committee.
George E. McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades Council, the umbrella union organization, said that he was not ruling out negotiating but that doing so while trying to satisfy the voluminous demands for information that were part of the discovery process "makes it harder for us."
As of yesterday, no striking unions hadscheduled negotiating sessions with The News.
Mr. Hoge said the paper had put all the unions on notice yesterday that they must act soon or risk having no role in what will happen. He said unions must contact News management by the close of business next Tuesday "if you intend to bargain over the decision of closure or sale."
The maneuvering by The News and the unions as the final deadline nears is heavily influenced by a desire both share not to be blamed if The News is closed.
The News is liable for an estimated $100 million in lifetime job guarantees that could be nullified if the paper is closed for legitimate economic reasons but not if closing the paper is unnecessary or artificially spurred by News management. Legal action would probably be needed to resolve the issue.
In addition, a host of lawsuits filed by both sides remain outstanding, and it is in the interests of both sides to portray the other as unreasonable and unwilling to do what is required in a good-faith effort to save the paper.
For instance, while Mr. Hoge has been unwilling to suspend the discovery process, he has said he is willing to negotiate "any time, any day, any night, week or weekends, without advance notice."
On the union side, Jay Mazur, president of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, said yesterday that more than a dozen unions were mounting a $75,000 advertising campaign aimed at the Chicago-based Tribune Company, which owns The News.
In announcing the campaign, Mr. Mazur said The News was "part of the soul of the city" that the Tribune Company seemed determined to kill by refusing to bargain in earnest. The campaign's headline: "Save New York's Hometown Paper -- Settle or Sell."
Individuals on both sides say on a not-for-quotation basis that they think prospects of a negotiated settlement are small.
But Mr. McDonald, the allied unions' leader, said yesterday that Mr. Hoge had told him The News intended to present unions with a revised proposal. Mr. Hoge declined to discuss any aspect of negotiations.
Barry F. Lipton, president of the Newspaper Guild, said The News had sent him a proposed change in the language of the management rights portion of the contract. He characterized the change as a basis for further negotiations but not a significant change in itself.
 
Possible Shift on Clause
 From the beginning of negotiations, The News has demanded a contractual "management rights" clause that would give the Tribune Company the power to determine staffing, overtime and many other items that have previously been negotiated item by item. News management has said such authority is essential to making the paper profitable, but union leaders have said such blanket control would break the unions.
An article in yesterday's Guild Strike News said the new language proposed by The News would grant blanket management rights "unless expressly prohibited elsewhere in the contract."
The new language raises the prospect that The News might be willing to agree to a management rights clause tempered and limited elsewhere in the contract in ways that would make the concept more acceptable to unions.
A person who spoke on condition of anoynmity and who is associated with Robert Maxwell, the British communications magnate, said that Mr. Maxwell's interest in buying The News remains "very deep."
"He won't do it at any price, but it's important to him," said the person.

HEADLINE: $6 BILLION DEFICIT IS SEEN BY CUOMO FOR NEXT BUDGET

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 24

 BODY:
 Gov. Mario M. Cuomo announced today that he expected New York State's budget gap to balloon to $6 billion, or one-fifth of the state budget, in the next fiscal year and that the state would have to borrow $900 million to close this year's budget deficit.
Mr. Cuomo warned that it would take Draconian measures like reducing the welfare grant and laying off hundreds of state troopers to close the gap purely with spending cuts. He said he had ruled out many of those options, thus suggesting that he was trying to pave the way for possible tax increases. 
 The widening budget gap resulted from "a precipitous decline" in state tax revenues, caused by the national recession, Mr. Cuomo said. He said this and other factors would cause the state to finish the current fiscal year, which ends on March 31, with a $900 million deficit in its $29.2 billion budget.
For the third consecutive year, Mr. Cuomo said, the state will have to eliminate a deficit at the end of the year through short-term borrowing, a step he had hoped to avoid.
 
'A Lot of Complaining'
 That $900 million will be added to a $5 billion deficit that the Governor said today that he envisioned for the new fiscal year, starting April 1.
Although Mr. Cuomo used his news conference today to prepare the state for excruciating fiscal pain, he vowed that his mission of protecting the defenseless and promoting free enterprise would not be eviscerated.
"There will be a lot of complaining and a lot of screaming, from the judiciary, from the workers and everybody else, but still the strength of this state will be evident," the Governor said.
He is not required to disclose his budget proposal for the 1991-92 fiscal year until Feb. 1, and he revealed few details today. But people in his administration, while stressing that many decisions had yet to be made, said tax increases might be used to close about one-fourth of the $6 billion gap.
The measures being considered, they said, include creating a statewide value tax on motor vehicles, increasing the gasoline tax and continuing to delay a scheduled reduction in personal income tax rates.
Mr. Cuomo said today that he hoped to avoid rate increases in broad-based taxes like the personal income tax and sales tax, which he said would put New York at a competitive disadvantage with neighboring states. But he said he had not ruled out expanding the base of the sales tax, as was done this year.
In announcing his projections of this year's deficit and next year's shortfall, Mr. Cuomo added his voice to the cries of fiscal anguish that are resounding through state capitols and city halls across the Northeast.
The Governors of New Jersey and Connecticut have announced sizable gaps in their budgets for this year and next year. And Mayor David N. Dinkins presented a budget plan last week for New York City that would close a $2.2 billion gap by reducing the city's work force by 25,000 employees and imposing $580 million in new or higher taxes.
 
Inextricably Connected
 The city and state budgets are inextricably connected, and Mr. Dinkins said today that he was "very, very concerned" about the impact that the state budget gap would have on the city.
Although Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature trimmed this year's state budget by $1 billion just last month, the Governor said the sharp decline in state revenues would make it necessary to borrow about $900 million. That would exceed the $775 million borrowed in the 1989-90 fiscal year and the $460 million borrowed in the 1988-89 fiscal year.
With just over two months remaining in the fiscal year, Mr. Cuomo said that the state budget was virtually depleted and that the budget could not be balanced through spending cuts.
When the Governor proposed to eliminate the $1 billion shortfall late last year, he pledged to do so without borrowing. "Deficit notes would simply add to next year's substantial budget problems," he said in November.
He said today that he had kept that pledge but asserted that he never promised not to borrow if an additional budget gap emerged. "I did it and then you got a new deficit," he said. "I didn't say, 'Even if on the day before the end of the year, there's another $900 million, I'll do it again.' "
This year's borrowing will have to be repaid with interest in the next fiscal year, thus deepening next year's budget gap. A budget gap is the difference between a government's anticipated revenues and the cost of maintaining its existing programs.
 
'Unwelcome News'
 State Comptroller Edward V. Regan, a frequent critic of past state borrowing practices, called the announcement of the deficit "unwelcome news." But he said, "It is apparent to everyone concerned with the state's fiscal condition that the use of deficit notes, rather than rolling liabilities over into the next fiscal year, is the most prudent course of the choices available."
Several fiscal analysts who monitor the state's finances said Mr. Cuomo had little choice but to borrow at such a late date. But they expressed concern that the deficit had not been avoided through larger reductions in spending last year. Signs that the budget gap was growing emerged almost immediately after the Legislature finished cutting the budget in December.
"They could have leapfrogged the problem for a change instead of being in the position once again where they have to chase their tail at the end of the year," said Cynthia Green, an analyst for the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group financed by businesses.
A significant factor in the size of next year's gap was the state's reliance in this year's budget on $1.9 billion in nonrecurring revenue measures, like sales of state property and raids on reserve funds. Mr. Cuomo said there would be few of the so-called one shots in this year's budget. "I'm looking for them," he said. "There aren't many around."
 
To Be Fairly Distributed
 The Democratic Governor pledged that the budget cuts he would announce next week would be fairly distributed. He has said no program will be spared, although he has exempted financing for AIDS programs.
But Mr. Cuomo also has said he plans this year to establish special funds, with dedicated revenue sources, for environmental and transportation projects. And he will come under heavy pressure to maintain two programs, Liberty scholarships and a child health insurance plan, that he considers centerpieces of his social agenda. Both are scheduled to begin this year.
A countervailing pressure may come from the Republican-led State Senate. "I don't think we'll have any problem accepting the Governor's estimate of the size of the gap," said John E. McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino. "But it may be predicated on a level of spending that we have concern with."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: IRAQ;
Iraq Closes Border With Jordan, Cutting Off Escape for Foreigners

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Iraq was reported today to have barred war refugees from entering Jordan, blocking the major escape route for hundreds of thousands of foreigners trapped behind the lines and prey to deprivation and allied bombardment.
Because of deteriorating conditions in Baghdad, where water, food and fuel are said to be scarce, the Iraqi move could lead to a "large-scale human tragedy if people do not get out," a Western diplomat said. 
 Travelers from the border area also said they had seen little evidence of the tanker trucks carrying crude oil from Iraq to Jordan that provide this economically crippled country with the only petroleum supplies available to it.
Jordan has told the United States and its allies that while it is trying to enforce the international trade embargo on Iraq, it cannot do without Iraqi supplies of crude oil. Until today, scores of Jordanian tanker trucks plied the pot-holed blacktop connecting Jordan and Iraq.
A lone trucker at the Ruweishid border post said today that he had been told by the Iraqi authorities that his safety could not be guaranteed, travelers reported. Iraq has suspended the sale of gasoline to civilians as it seeks to marshal its resources for the war with the United States and its allies.
International relief agencies had been expecting a flow of hundreds of thousands of fugitives, most of them from other third world countries, as the allied bombardment intensified. Several hundred have already arrived, but many more were reported today to be stranded on the Iraqi side of the frontier after the border was closed to traffic bound for Jordan.
 
Iran Is the Only Exit Route
 Jordanian officials and diplomats here said Iraq had not explained its decision, and it was not clear how long the border closing would be enforced. The move leaves Iran as the only exit route from Iraq.
Arab diplomats said the Iraqi action could reflect a concern that the images and accounts of refugees arriving from Baghdad would leave the impression that Iraq is being beaten.
In its official pronouncements, the Baghdad radio continued to rebut allied and Israeli assertions that American missiles had foiled the latest Iraqi missile attacks and saying targets in Israel and Saudi Arabia had been hit.
The Iraqi press agency also reported that President Saddam Hussein toured front-line positions on Wednesday, despite heavy allied bombing. "After giving him a report on the condition of the mother of battles, the commanders said that because of cowardice and fear of combat, the enemy tried to avoid establishing any serious contact by only bombing from high altitudes," the agency said.
The Baghdad radio also accused American airmen of causing a huge oil slick in the Persian Gulf by attacking two Iraqi oil tankers.
 The United States Navy reported Wednesday that American carrier-borne aircraft had badly damaged an Iraqi tanker and destroyed three armed Hovercraft in the gulf.
The Baghdad radio said, "the aggression led to the leak of a huge quantity of oil in the gulf water." It was quoting from a military statement that said Iraq had shot down four allied aircraft or missiles, while the "enemy aircraft carried out 15 raids on our country until 0700 this morning."
In Washington, Bush Administration officials said today that although Baghdad radio and television were still functioning, they were faltering under continued attack from allied jets and missiles.
Asked whether Baghdad television was still broadcasting, one Administration official said: "Yes, with much difficulty. It's a weak signal. It appears they've found a way to continue to broadcast for the time being."
A Congressional official who has been briefed on the conflict said broadcasting was especially difficult to disrupt because radio and television antennae, as well as broadcasting equipment, are mobile and can be operated with relatively little electric power.
 
Economic Woes May Deepen
 Iraq's apparent decision to close the border with Jordan could presage deeper economic woes here.
Jordan has only limited supplies of petroleum products, and is considering rationing, economists here say. Its foreign exchange reserves, enough for two months' worth of oil imports, are not being replenished despite the $400 million in Western aid to those countries suffering from the embargo on trade with Iraq.
The country's other sources of income have all but evaporated. No tourists come to Jordan any more, ships will not pick up its phosphates at Aqaba because of high insurance rates, and remittances from Jordanians in the oil-producing gulf countries and Iraq have virtually disappeared.
Additionally, economists say, the gulf fighting and political tensions between Saudi Arabia and Jordan have cut off the kingdom from the traditional markets for its fresh produce. At the same time, Jordan has forfeited aid from the gulf oil-producers by tilting toward Iraq.

HEADLINE: Bank of Boston Posts Loss

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
In another reflection of the dismal New England economy, the Bank of Boston Corporation, the region's biggest banking company, yesterday reported a net loss of $395 million for 1990, including $187 million in the fourth quarter.
For the quarter, the bank company's loss compared with profit of $9 million, or 8 cents a share, in the comparable 1989 quarter. For all of 1990, the loss compared with a profit of $70 million, or 80 cents a share, in 1989.
To reduce costs the bank company cut 1,100 jobs in the fourth quarter and said it planned to eliminate another 1,000 positions this year. The bank, which employs about 18,000, said it would accomplish this through attrition.
As a result of nonperforming or questionable loans, many of them stemming from sour real estate deals, the bank added $170 million to its reserves against possible losses in the fourth quarter and $620 million for the year.
Bank of Boston's share price closed unchanged today, at $4.25, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: THE TROOPS;
Blacks Wary of Their Big Role as Troops

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Wesley Hatch, a black teen-ager from Chicago's impoverished West Side, graduated from high school with few choices two years ago. He dreamed of going to college to study architecture, but his mother did not have the money. That left dead-end jobs, the streets and the military. He chose the military.
"He didn't want to go," said his mother, Rhoda Hatch. "But he thought by joining the Army he'd be able to do better, help me out and go to school."
 
104,000 in the Gulf
 Now he is a foot soldier on the Kuwaiti border, one of about 104,000 black men and women who, Defense Department statistics show, account for nearly 25 percent of the American troops in the Persian Gulf and almost 30 percent of Army troops there. 
 Despite their numbers in the armed forces, blacks make up 12 percent of the nation's civilian population. And as the gulf conflict moves closer to ground combat, a painful debate has divided many blacks about young blacks' role in the war and in the military.
The statistics documenting the number of blacks in the gulf have stirred a deep well of resentment and anger in some blacks who fear that their community will pay disproportionately for a war that many of them do not support.
The most recent New York Times/ CBS News Poll, conducted Jan. 17-20, asked 3,002 adults whether they favored starting military action or continuing the use of economic sanctions. The 250 blacks in the poll split about evenly on the question, and whites favored military action by a 4-to-1 ratio. And in a vote four days before the war started, all the black Democrats in Congress were against the measure authorizing force in the gulf.
Some black critics of the war say they are bitter that their sons and daughters are being sent to war by an Administration that they see as being insensitive to members of minority groups. Others say problems like drugs and crime in this country are more important than Kuwait but will not receive attention because of the preoccupation with the war. And with a fervor reminiscent of the civil rights movement, some are forming antiwar groups to discourage more blacks from joining the military.
Still other blacks express pride and comfort in Gen. Colin L. Powell, the nation's first black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as a loyal, if resigned, sense of duty to the war effort. Others fully support President Bush's use of force against a man many view as a threat to the entire Middle East and say that other concerns have to take a back seat for now.
Pentagon officials acknowledge the dispproportionate number of blacks in the armed forces, but say it is the random outcome of having an all-volunteer force. "Nobody's making them enlist," said Christopher Jehn, Assistant Secretary of Defense for force management and personnel. "They're not victims; they're willing, patriotic Americans."
 
Critics Point to Inequities
 Black critics of the war argue that blacks have defended the country its wars and still face inequities at home. "Once and for all, black women are saying, we're not sending our sons anymore," said Jamillah Muhammad, a Muslim who heads a black women's group in Chicago that is opposed to the war. "Until things change for our children," she said, the military is not going to getthem.
But those who support the war say that this is a time when blacks and whites should be pulling together in the face of a larger threat.
Bertha Bailey, a high school teacher in McKinney, Tex., whose grandson is among the blacks serving in the gulf, says she accepts the inevitabilities of war. "Sometimes, some things can't get corrected without someone getting hurt," Mrs. Bailey said. "We don't need a fight within a fight. Why worry about who is overrepresented when they're all at danger points?"
But the Rev. Jesse Jackson and many black Congressmen have said the disproportionate number of blacks in the gulf was evidence of the bleak economic opportunities they have.
 "This nation ought to be ashamed that the best and brightest of our youth don't volunteer because they love it so well, but because this nation can't provide them jobs," said Dr. Benjamin L. Hooks, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
And during a week of commemorations marking the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., his son urged blacks not to participate in the war. In a speech in Chicago last week for Operation PUSH, Martin Luther King 3d said: "Every black soldier ought to say: "You all do what you want to. I'm not going to fight. This is not my war.' "
The debate underscores an agonizing irony for blacks. Blacks have faced discrimination and harassment as they fought for important war posts to prove their worth and citizenship. In the last 20 years, since the easing of racial strictures, large numbers of them volunteered for the armed forces as a way out of poverty and now must face the war as a consequence of that decision.
At the core of the problem, said Martin Binkin, a military analyst with the Brookings Institution, are the mixed perceptions of the military and perhaps the conflicting motivations of those who join. "The military is seen as a benefit in peacetime," Mr. Binkin said, "and a burden during war."
In the years of peace since the Vietnam War and the end of the draft, which had tended to equalize the number of blacks and whites in the armed forces, blacks have joined the military at a rate up to three times that for whites. In 1980, 42 percent of black men between the ages of 19 and 24 who could potentially qualify for the armed forces had served in the military, as against 14 percent of all potentially qualified white men in the same age group, according to research conducted by Mr. Binkin. He estimated that today 33 to 35 percent of all qualified young black men have served in the military, as against 16 or 17 percent for young white men.
Military analysts and many blacks agree that the armed forces, while not a racial utopia, offer a more egalitarian and welcoming environment for blacks than perhaps any place in the civilian world. That assessment stems in large part from a military system of promotion and pay based mainly on seniority and skill rather than on race and intangibles.
"The military is the only major institution in America with something like a level playing field," said Prof. Charles Moskos, a sociologist at Northwestern University. "It is the only place where a white will be bossed around by a black on a regular basis at the local level. There is probably a better racial climate in the military than on a college campus."
General Powell has said, "The armed forces have always provided opportunities for blacks, which blacks have found attractive and have gone after, and I see no reason to change that now."
 
A Poverty Draft Is Seen
 But critics say the military is taking advantage of economic conditions in which the armed forces are the only chance for steady work that some black people have. They say that such enlistment amounts to a kind of poverty draft. "We join because we don't have anyplace else to go," Mrs. Muhammad said.
Now that troops have been sent and a war has started, there is scarcely a black church or inner-city school where someone does not know at least one person, if not a lot of people, in the gulf. "There is a sense of impending disaster," said the Rev. George H. Clements, pastor of Holy Angels Roman Catholic Church in Chicago, a predominantly black church with 104 members or relatives of members in the gulf.
Critics of the war fear that the black communities that have already lost great numbers of men to drugs and crime will now lose "the good ones" to war. Military analysts say, that unlike white enlistees who tend to be poorer and less educated than their civilian counterparts, most black men and women in the military are high school graduates or better from working- and middle-class families.
"The stabilizing forces in our community are being drawn out," said Kathy Flewellen, a leader of the National African-Americans Against United States Intervention in the Gulf, a network with affiliated groups in six cities that was formed in Washington, to protest the war.
The feelings of loss and dispair are mixed with a sense of satisfaction about General Powell. "Everytime he's on TV I feel proud," said James Exum, a Vietnam War veteran living in Chicago. "I feel confident with him there. I don't think he'll rush into ground action knowing that there are black men on the front lines. I feel a sense of comfort knowing that there's a black man calling the shots."
Like so many black servicemen, Mr. Exum, a former army captain and Green Beret, enlisted right out of high school to escape the housing projects of Washington. "I didn't see that I had any options," he said. "I got many benefits, but I could have gotten killed."
He survived commando raids that he led into North Vietnam and said he experienced a kind of multiracial fraternity he has not seen since the war. "When somebody got shot down, none of us asked if they were black or white or what religion they were," Mr. Exum said. "All we needed to know was, is the person American. It was the only time we lived up to what this country is all about."
The recent debate over racial disparities in the military has stirred several efforts on Capitol Hill, and hearings on the topic in the coming weeks are being considered.
And black antiwar groups across the country are pushing for improvements in vocational education to give black youths an alternative to the military.
But many say that the demographics of a volunteer force, will not change, until the economic climate does. "Until the problems of society are solved where blacks have more opportunities, you almost by definition will have a disproportionate number of blacks in the military," said Mr. Binkins of the Brookings Institution. "Until then, we have to live with what's over there now."

HEADLINE: Abused Wife Found Guilty Of Murder

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

 BODY:
Sarah Smith, a 43-year-old Bronx social worker who said she shot her abusive husband to death to save her own life, was convicted of his murder yesterday.
She faces a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison. She had earlier declined to plead guilty to manslaughter in return for a recommended prison term of 4 to 12 years. 
 The jurors in State Supreme Court in the Bronx announced a guilty verdict on the charge of second-degree murder at 5:45 P.M. on their third day of deliberations. The verdict left Ms. Smith, her lawyer, his assistants and her family stunned.
"I am astounded," said Ms. Smith's lawyer, Michael G. Dowd, who has successfully defended a half-dozen battered women who killed their husbands or lovers. "I have never in 24 years been so shocked by a verdict."
 
'We Didn't Believe Her'
 Neither the jurors nor the chief prosecutor in the case, Assistant District Attorney Elisa Koenderman, would discuss the outcome. As the jury of seven women and five men hurried from the white granite courthouse into the cold night, most said nothing to reporters asking for comment. One man said simply, "We didn't believe her."
The verdict came as a striking exception to a series of prominent cases in which battered women seemed to gain greater acceptance for the claim of having killed in self-defense.
Last month, Gov. Richard F. Celeste of Ohio granted clemency to 25 women who killed men they said had abused them.
Ms. Smith's case also brought a rare defeat for Mr. Dowd, whose clients included Karen Straw, a 29-year-old Queens woman who came to symbolize the anguish of women seeking protection from violent men. Ms. Straw, who had pressed assault charges against her estranged husband and obtained court orders of protection against him, stabbed him to death during a violent argument one night after she said he had beaten and raped her.
By contrast, Ms. Smith testified that she mistrusted protection orders after reading about the killings of three Long Island women, apparently by husbands ordered to stay away.
Neither side in her case disputed that on May 23, 1989, Ms. Smith shot Owen Smith, 31, once in the head with his .25-caliber pistol as he lay resting on the bed of their South Bronx apartment, then drove his body to Yonkers and dumped it in an abandoned schoolyard.
Ms. Smith said she killed him in self-defense, fearing that he would he would make good on that evening's drunken threat to kill her soon.
The jurors seemed to focus on just what she meant by "soon." In explaining the charge and re-explaining it several times during the deliberations, Justice John P. Collins told them that Ms. Smith would have been justified in using deadly force against her husband if she believed it necessary to prevent his "imminent" use of deadly force.
 
Read From a Dictionary
 Three times, the jurors asked the judge to define the word "imminent." Finally, he read from a dictionary: "immediately or soon."
From the moment she surrendered to the police, Ms. Smith had insisted that the killing had been motivated by the abuse of her husband, who was unemployed. For the last three years of their marriage, she said, he had harassed and threatened her, at times choking her or firing at her with one of his three handguns. One morning, she testified, she woke up staring into a pistol barrel.
For the most part, the prosecution did not challenge testimony that Ms. Smith had been abused. Instead, Ms. Koenderman stressed that Owen Smith had never seriously injured his wife or made good on the threats she said he had made in the past. Had Ms. Smith wanted to, Ms. Koenderman insisted, she could have fled the apartment.
"You could have left him when he was lying down, couldn't you?" the prosecutor asked Ms. Smith.
 
'Blow My Brains Out'
 "Not without chancing that he would catch me at the door and blow my brains out, no," she answered.
In April, 1989, the month before the shooting, Mr. Smith was arrested on drug charges on three successive Sundays. Twice in the months before that he had been arrested for assaulting police officers. On May 19, four days before the killing, Ms. Smith requested a transfer from her job as a caseworker for the Department of Social Services, saying she feared bodily harm and wanted a new job where her husband could not find her.
After the killing, Ms. Smith said, she wrapped her husband's 6-foot-3-inch, 175-pound body in two blankets, wheeled it into her parking lot on a borrowed dolly and put the bundle in the trunk of her car with the help of two passing strangers. She said she gave the men $20 and never saw them again.
She said she dumped the body and did not call the police for a week so that she could spend a last few days with her two daughters.
 
Fear of Retaliation
 Mr. Dowd said Ms. Smith had feared that her husband, who boasted of beating up police officers and selling drugs and getting away with both, would retaliate against her, her mother, daughters or five grandchildren.
"If society couldn't control his lawlessness," Mr. Dowd asked, "how could she expect it to control his violence against her?"
Ms. Koenderman argued that she did not try.
Mr. Dowd had hoped that Ms. Smith's defense would be well-served by his portrait of a woman who, despite hardships, struggled to better herself.
Born in the Bronx, abused by an alcoholic father, Ms. Smith graduated from high school the same day she had her first child. Before her first marriage broke up, she took in the daughter of friends when she found out the girl was being beaten by her father. She earned a college degree at night.
 Later she met Owen Smith, who was then an illegal immigrant from Jamaica. She said their first years together were happy, but ager Mr. Smith obtained legal residency in late 1985, she said, the marriage turned into a nightmare.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: EGYPT;
Mubarak Cites Accords To Help Rescue Kuwait

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Facing growing hesitation here about the extent of Cairo's military and political involvement in the Persian Gulf crisis, President Hosni Mubarak said today that Egypt was obligated by its commitments to the United Nations and the Arab League to go to the rescue of Iraqi-occupied Kuwait.
Speaking to a special joint session of the elected Egyptian Parliament and the appointed Consultative Council, a body of distinguished citizens, he said that even a week after the war had started, "I say in the name of the Egyptian people: Even in these moments we will not slow our efforts to end this tragedy, if Iraq commits itself to withdraw from Kuwait and restore legitimacy and sovereignty there." 
 In a two-hour speech, Mr. Mubarak seemed to go out of his way to detail the many efforts Egypt had undertaken to pacify President Saddam Hussein. He said he had made 26 appeals to the Iraqi leader, including a 44-page letter in which Mr. Mubarak detailed Egypt's views about the crisis.
The Egyptian President tried to draw a line between Egypt's continued commitment to the welfare of the Iraqi people and its view of the future of the Iraqi President. He said that at this point "what happens to Saddam is not Egypt's business, but the Iraqi people are very dear to us."
 
Palestinian Issue Addressed
 Addressing a sore issue often raised by Egyptian opposition parties -- that the United States, while showing great resolve in dealing with the occupation of Kuwait, has not shown the same resolve in addressing the grievances of Palestinians under Israeli occupation -- Mr. Mubarak strongly implied that Egypt and Saudi Arabia had pledges from President Bush to look into the Palestinian issue once the gulf crisis is settled.
In a response later tonight, Rifaat el-Saeed, a spokesman for eight opposition parties and a senior official of the Progressive Alignment party, said the opposition parties rejected Mr. Mubarak's propositions and would circulate a petition calling for an end to the war, which he described as "a savage American attack on the Iraqi people."
Mr. Saeed said the opposition parties would try to meet with Mr. Mubarak to present their petition and would also seek meetings with the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, Turkey and France and the Secretary General of the Arab League.
In his speech, Mr. Mubarak harshly criticized Mr. Hussein's use of Scud missiles against Israel, describing these weapons in terms of their military value as no more than "firecrackers," similar to what Egyptian children use on holidays.
 
Called Political Missiles
 But he said that while the military value of these missiles was nil, they were potent "political missiles" that harmed the Palestinian cause by drawing much sympathy to Israel from around the world and enabling Israel to ask for substantial increases in military and economic aid from the West.
Mr. Mubarak refrained from making any specific comments about the military role of Egypt's estimated 45,000 soldiers stationed in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia as part of the allied force.
But he stressed that sending Egyptian troops to Saudi Arabia "was undoubtedly an unavoidable decision in light of our specific contractual obligations, which we view with the utmost seriousness and rigor." This was a reference to Egypt's participation in Arab League mutual defense accords.
He said the purpose of those accords was to prevent relations between nations from reverting to "the law of the jungle," and he strongly saluted the Egyptian armed forces, to rousing applause by the legislators. He described his decision to send troops as "a brave decision."
 
Meeting With Hussein Described
 Leaders of virtually all the opposition parties in Egypt, except for the social democratic Wafd party, have strongly opposed the participation of Egyptian troops in a conflict with Iraqis and asked that the Egyptian troops be moved to western Saudi Arabia to protect the Muslim shrines of Mecca and Medina instead.
Mr. Mubarak said that in his last private meeting with Mr. Hussein immediately before the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, the Iraqi leader told him that Baghdad had so badly shaken Arab gulf governments with its repeated threats against Kuwait that the time was ripe for Egypt to present them with any financial or economic demands for aid it wanted, in the expectation that they would immediately respond.
Quoting the Iraqi President, Mr. Mubarak said he had advised, "This is a good opportunity to ask the gulf rulers what you like and get it."
Speaking about what is likely to happen in the next few days, Mr. Mubarak said the Iraqi Army would suffer the gravest losses once the land battles to liberate Kuwait begin. "We must realize this," he said, addressing the Iraqi leader. "What logic is there in causing the death of thousands of these people. What will you achieve?"

HEADLINE: American Express Net Drops 46%

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The American Express Company reported yesterday that its net income had dropped 46.4 percent in the fourth quarter and 84.6 percent for all of 1990, because of a loss of nearly $1 billion on the year at its troubled Wall Street brokerage house, Shearson Lehman Brothers.
American Express said it had earned $137.9 million, or 28 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with $257.2 million, or 61 cents a share, a year earlier. Fourth-quarter revenue declined less than 1 percent, to $6.3 billion, compared with $6.32 billion a year earlier. 
 For the full year, the company reported earnings of $181.5 million, or 34 cents a share, compared with last year's $1.16 billion, or $2.70 a share. Full-year revenue declined nearly 3 percent, to $24.3 billion, from $25 billion a year earlier.
 
Problems at Shearson
 While its main business units, including Travel Related Services and IDS Financial Services, reported record profits, American Express saw its earnings dragged down by Shearson's poor performance.
American Express disclosed the earnings shortly before 6 P.M., well past the close of the stock market. Its stock rose 25 cents yesterday, to $20, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Analysts expressed surprise at the magnitude of Shearson's losses. Many had been predicting fourth-quarter losses of $50 million to $75 million. Instead, Shearson reported a loss of $115 million for the quarter, compared with earnings of $4 million a year earlier. For the full year, Shearson reported a loss of $966 million, compared with 1989 profit of $110 million.
"The area of continuing surprise has to be Shearson," said Alison A. Deans, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. "No one was expecting another round of severance charges of this magnitude."
The 1990 figures include $787 million in charges for layoffs and office closings at Shearson, as well as $50 million in the fourth quarter for severances and more charges related to dismissals and closings.
Fourth-quarter results at Shearson also reflected a reserve of $35 million that the company said was related to shares in the troubled Polly Peck International P.L.C., which were bought on behalf of Polly Peck's chairman, Asil Nadir. Polly Peck's stock collapsed late last year. American Express did not elaborate on the statement.
Shearson's annual revenues totaled $10.2 billion in 1990, down more than 18 percent from $12.5 billion in 1989, primarily because of decreased interest and dividend revenues.
American Express attributed Shearson's poor performance to "a continued and worsening industrywide slowdown in a difficult economic environment."
 
Commissions Are Down
 Brokerage commission revenues were down 18 percent, to $1.6 billion. Revenue from market-making and principal transactions were down 5.5 percent, to $1.2 billion. Investment banking revenues dropped 41.5 percent, to $563 million. And investment advisory revenues fell 7.5 percent, to $633 million.
American Express said its management had met its targets for reducing expenses. Shearson's fixed expenses were cut 9 percent, or $266 million, from 1989 levels. What American Express described as "fourth-quarter, ongoing fixed expenses" were reduced by $86 million from fourth quarter 1989, or $344 million on an annualized basis.
Ms. Dean noted that Shearson had made some progress in cutting staff costs, but she said it still had a long way to go. Last year, the number of stockbrokers declined 16 percent, to 8,711, and the overall Shearson work force fell 12 percent, to 31,300.
 
Gains at Charge-Card Unit
 Meanwhile, American Express's mainstay business, the charge-card and travel division known as Travel Related Services, reported an annual profit of $956 million, up 15 percent from $830 million a year earlier. Full-year revenue increased 16 percent, to $9.7 billion.
In the fourth quarter, net income for Travel Related Services rose 13 percent, to $215 million. Charge volume during the quarter, which occurs during the Christmas buying season, rose 10 percent, to $30 billion.
American Express also said its IDS Financial Services, which provides financial planning and other services, posted net income of $207 million during the year, up 18 percent from the 1989 level. Revenue rose 14 percent, to $2.2 billion, from $1.9 billion in 1989. In the fourth quarter, IDS's net income rose 16 percent, to $56 million.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: EUROPE;
Gulf Fighting Shatters Europeans' Fragile Unity

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
The war in the Persian Gulf has abruptly halted momentum toward political unity in Europe, breathed new life into the "special relationship" between the United States and Britain and raised widespread concern about pacifism in Germany, diplomats, Government officials and strategic experts here say.
Partisans of European unity have been deeply dismayed by the European Community's virtual irrelevance in the crisis since President Saddam Hussein of Iraq spurned the 12 nations' last-ditch attempts to avert war by diplomacy. Since he refused to comply with the Jan. 15 United Nations deadline to pull his troops out of Kuwait, Britain, France and Germany have all gone separate ways. 
 Because the European Community has a six-month rotating presidency, Luxembourg now coordinates foreign and defense policy for the community's 336 million people. Jacques Poos, Luxembourg's Foreign Minister, complained on Wednesday that the war had shown up "the political insignificance of Europe."
 
'A Military Worm'
 "Europe is an economic giant, a political dwarf, and a military worm," the Belgian Foreign Minister, Mark Eyskens, conceded a few days before the war started.
Britain's 35,000 troops in the gulf are committed to battle under United States command, and France's 10,000 will fight but only to get Iraqi forces out of Kuwait, according to the Government of President Francois Mitterrand. Some smaller countries have sent ships and equipment to the gulf, but Belgium turned Britain down when it requested ammunition for its forces there, according to British and Belgian officials.
Germany, with the most powerful and vigorous economy in Europe and one of its biggest armies, has refused to send any troops into battle and hesitated before sending 18 planes to Turkey, a member of the NATO alliance, for protection against possible Iraqi attack.
 
'Lost Its Fighting Spirit'
 It eventually went ahead last month but has pointedly not declared that it will automatically come to Turkey's aid militarily if Saddam Hussein attacks it, prompting President Turgut Ozal of Turkey today to charge that "Germany has become so rich that it has completely lost its fighting spirit."
Germany's contributions to the gulf war have otherwise been limited to logistical support and money, and on Wednesday Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Germany would go beyond the $2.2 billion it had earlier pledged -- up to $6.7 billion more, according to German officials.
Mr. Kohl was critical of the anti-American undertone to the antiwar demonstrations that have erupted in Germany since the war broke out, but Joachim Fest, a commentator for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, said today that the Chancellor's policy was partly to blame. "What is lacking is a notion of where we belong and what we are willing to stand up for when push comes to shove," Mr. Fest wrote. Another huge demonstration is planned in Bonn on Saturday.
"I thought I understood German pacificism," said Francois Heisbourg, director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. "But here Germany is not a target for attack, the war has been sanctioned by the United Nations, and it's far away. It's not going over well in Paris or London," he said. "How can there be a common European policy when the British and French take ground losses in Kuwait and the Germans keep themselves deliberately aloof?"
 
Bush-Major Relationship
 Because of the crisis, the new British Prime Minister, John Major, has suddenly found himself in the kind of warm special relationship with President Bush that his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, enjoyed with President Ronald Reagan. British officials say that he and Mr. Bush have been conferring frequently by telephone since the war started, and that the President told Mr. Major when the war would start about 24 hours before he called most of the other NATO allies.
Until the gulf crisis broke last August, Mr. Bush had seemed to be leaning more toward Germany and Mr. Kohl as the principal American ally in Europe, but all that has changed. Senior NATO diplomats said that officials in Washington had been seriously disappointed by the skittish German response to the gulf crisis, and worried about its implications for the future in other crises.
"Now I hope you know who your friends really are," said John Gilbert, a Labor Party Member of Parliament who said that if his party came to power here in the next elections, the trans-Atlantic partnership would remain just as vital.
 
'Complicating Factor'
 In Paris today, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said Britain would welcome a strengthening of European effort in the gulf, to keep American public resentment over lack of support from Europe from developing into an "important complicating factor" in trans-Atlantic relations.
Britain would like to see Germany and Japan provide more help, officials at 10 Downing Street say. "We think what we're doing in the gulf is worth doing even if nobody gives us money," said one aide, "but it's obviously basic fairness that there should be some burden-sharing here."
Nor is the end of the war likely to bring the Europeans closer together.
British war aims appear to be identical with those of the United States, but very different from those of France or Germany. Citing United Nations resolutions calling for a restoration of peace and stability in the region, British officials and legislators of the two major political parties say that Britain would support sending ground forces into Iraq even after driving Saddam Hussein's armies out of Kuwait, if the Iraqis were still fighting at that point.
In Germany, where the Social Democratic opposition is already calling for withdrawal of the 18 planes from Turkey, Mr. Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher want an end to hostilities as soon as possible. Until today, France had refused to authorize air strikes against targets in Iraq, saying it was bound only to come to the assistance of Kuwait. French planes made their first attacks inside Iraq today.

Ismail Enters N.F.L. Draft; Patriots Consider Options

BYLINE: By SAMANTHA STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif., Jan. 24

 BODY:
A short time after Raghib (Rocket) Ismail officially declared his intention to forsake his senior season at Notre Dame and enter this spring's National Football League draft, Dick MacPherson, the new head coach of the New England Patriots, was wishing aloud today that this time the Rocket would not get away from him.
MacPherson, who is here preparing to coach the East team in the annual East-West Shrine game on Saturday, failed in an effort to recruit Ismail at Syracuse, where MacPherson coached until hired by the Patriots on Dec. 31. Now his new team, coming off a 1-15 season, has the first pick in the N.F.L. draft, which could very well be Ismail. 
 In making his announcement at a news conference in South Bend, Ind., Ismail reversed his field a bit. He had said often during the season that he would return for his final season at Notre Dame, where he gained 4,187 all-purpose yards in three years. But today he said that the recent death of the mother of his teammate, Chris Zorich, had helped change his mind.
"It made me feel that I wanted to do something for my mother and my family," Ismail said. He added that his decision was supported by Coach Lou Holtz, who thanked him for his contributions to Notre Dame and wished him well.
"I'm positive he's going to be a very, very viable choice," said MacPherson, speaking of the triple-threat player who returns kickoffs, carries the ball and catches it well enough to have been the runner-up for the Heisman Trophy this past season.
But MacPherson cautioned that the Patriots had not made a decision about what they would do with the pick.
"I have no idea what the personnel director has in mind," MacPherson said. "I'm just going on board. The people in New England know the New England Patriots better than I do now. This is going to be a lot of fun. The price of poker went up, hey?
"I think that anybody would want Rocket. I'm sure there will be a lot of offers out there and we'll have to weigh them and see what's best for the Patriots. The nice thing about it, is the worst thing you can do is end up with Raghib Ismail. Nobody can lose with that one."
Sam Jankovich, the Patriots' chief executive and owners' representative, said in a statement: "The Patriots, like other N.F.L. teams, are in an evaluation process at this particular time and it is far too early to make decisions. Anytime a quality person and player like Rocket Ismail enters the draft, it surely adds to the value of the Patriots and other N.F.L. teams."
MacPherson said he had been in touch with Ismail's brother, Qadry, a defensive back, who played for him at Syracuse last season.
MacPherson said Ismail had made the only sound economic move.
"I'm sad for college football," MacPherson said. "I'm sad for Notre Dame and the team. But I think that when anyone has a guaranteed income that he has, by making this option, I'm all for it. He's done his duty and he's paid his dues and he's on to the next level.
"I tried to recruit him. He got away from me once. But it's going to be hard to get away from me again."

Without Sentimentality, The Work of 6 Germans

BYLINE: By ANDY GRUNDBERG

 BODY:
The influence of Bernd and Hilla Becher on contemporary German photography is not exactly a secret. The dryly observant, seemingly neutral style of their detailed pictures of industrial structures has been adopted by Andreas Gursky, Thomas Ruff, Thomas Struth and other artist photographers who studied with Mr. Becher at the Art Academy of Dusseldorf. These younger artists' pictures have frequently been shown in Manhattan in the last two years, creating the impression that German photography is particularly vigorous these days and that the Bechers are largely responsible for it.
This impression is enhanced by a show of six lesser known but equally talented young German photographers at the Sonnabend Gallery in SoHo. All are about 30 years old, are recent graduates of the Dusseldorf school where Mr. Becher teaches and are showing their work in the United States for the first time. Surprisingly, considering how obviously they are indebted to the Bechers, their photographs have fresh and distinctive charms. 
 How interesting the images are is largely proportional to how far they stray from the precedents of their teacher and his wife. Boris Becker (the photographer, not the tennis player) takes black-and-white pictures of stone and concrete structures that appear to be falling down or under construction, but they are such mirror images of the Bechers' work that Mr. Becker's own contribution seems minimal. On the other hand, Simone Nieweg's views of backyard gardens and Ulrich Gambke's landscapes dominated by farm machinery introduce an agrarian theme that lies outside the Bechers' domain.
 Mr. Gambke's combination of wheat fields and the implements that shape them is especially potent, since it links a 19th-century romantic notion of the landscape with 20th-century technology. The plows, harrows and rakes that appear in the foreground of his pictures are as curious and fascinating as the water towers and blast furnaces the Bechers have documented for nearly 30 years; in addition, they serve as symbols of the mechanization of agricultural production.
While Ms. Nieweg's and Mr. Gambke's photographs may reach beyond the Bechers in subject matter, they remain linked to the tradition from which the Bechers draw strength. They bring to mind the New Objectivity movement in Germany in the 1920's and, in particular, August Sander's landscapes of the rural regions around Cologne. Sander's enduring influence is also felt in Andi Brenner's portraits of athletes and laborers, which seem to revive the notion of a distinct Aryan physiognomy, although with the disconcerting addition of loud patterned backgrounds.
 The largest pictures in this otherwise modestly sized exhibition belong to Manfred Jade, who photographs headstones in Jewish cemeteries as if they were living presences lining up to tell the stories of their lives. The most individual images, however, are the work of Jorg Sasse, who fashions disarming color prints of small, seemingly insignificant interior objects like a pink toilet-brush holder and a radiator covered by a board. Much like the Swiss collaborative artists Peter Fischli and David Weiss and the American Tim Maul, Mr. Sasse records a world of small but peculiar events and nonevents.
In one image, an inverted drinking glass sits on a saucer, as if a feat of magic or sleight of hand was about to take place. Mr. Sasse's photographs are uneven, and he sometimes seems distracted by their affinities with geometric abstraction, but they probe a part of the world that is rarely scrutinized. And like the rest of the pictures in this invigorating show, they are intensely meditative works devoid of the slightest traces of sentimentality or artistic inflation. All this is further evidence that the Bechers, who are represented by the Sonnabend Gallery, have tapped into a deep and rich vein of photography.
The show of photographs by six German artists remains at the Sonnabend Gallery, 420 West Broadway, near Spring Street, through tomorrow.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
The Musical Returns To America

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
WHEN the 1980's departed, it was not only the Trump yacht and Drexel Burnham Lambert that sailed into the sunset. Somewhat less conspicuously, the theater's own symbol of a money-crazed decade -- the over-produced English musical -- began its inexorable retreat to the wings. Built on opulent stage effects, London's theatrical spectaculars were as symptomatic of the money-mad 80's as a Malcolm Forbes birthday bash, and in the 1990's, their party, too, seems to be over.
In the nearly two years since "Aspects of Love" opened in the West End, no new Andrew Lloyd Webber project has gone much past the press-release stage in New York, London or Hollywood. The only smash hit "English" musical still in the pipeline to New York, "Miss Saigon," is in fact the work of French and American authors. And whatever that production's merits prove to be in its New York incarnation, doesn't it already feel like old news?
 
 All of which brings hope to those diehard chauvinists who dream of the resurgence of the American musical. That dream has been fueled of late not just by the pricking of the English-musical bubble, but by the steady rise in American musical-theater output. "Assassins," Stephen Sondheim's new show, opens at Playwrights Horizons on Sunday night, the third prominent musical, following "Falsettoland" and "Once on This Island," to originate at that company since last spring. Despite a recession that has otherwise flattened Broadway production, at least two major new American musicals are promised to follow "Miss Saigon" onto Broadway this spring: "The Secret Garden" and "Ziegfeld Presents Will Rogers."
 Until then, the front line for the American musical remains the two current flagship American musicals on Broadway, "City of Angels" and "Grand Hotel." Both recently entered the second year of their runs, and that in itself represents a comeback for the form. Not since the 1983-84 Broadway season produced both "La Cage aux Folles" and "Sunday in the Park With George" have two new American musicals opening in the same season had such staying power on Broadway.
 "City of Angels" and "Grand Hotel" deserve their longevity, without question. But revisiting the two shows this month to see how they were faring after substantial cast turnovers, I was struck by how transitional they both look. These musicals seem to be taking place on two different planets, esthetically at least, and each seems incomplete, as if it were lacking what the other had. If the American musical is now poised to rally for another era of international glory, it can make good on that promise only by transcending the sum of both these shows' better theatrical parts.
 Those parts are still in splendid working order. "Grand Hotel" never depended on the quality of its cast -- which was largely mediocre when the show opened -- and it still doesn't. It's hard to believe that the director Tommy Tune could find an actress as inappropriately cast as a fading ballerina (the old Garbo role) as that tough French cabaret chanteuse Liliane Montevecchi. But in Rene Ceballos, a gawky exemplar of Broadway brashness, he has found an equally far-fetched replacement. As the ballerina's lesbian aide-de-camp, the not untalented Caitlin Brown tailors her voice, makeup and hair so exactly to the image of her distinctive predecessor, Karen Akers, that it's hard to know whether her performance is meant to flatter Ms. Akers or give her the creeps. At least the one major cast holdover, David Carroll as the Baron, acts with more elegant command now than he did before, but what really matters at "Grand Hotel" is Mr. Tune's staging. It remains pristine, and thrilling.
 At "City of Angels," Tom Wopat's rumpled, battered masculinity proves ideal for Stone, the fictional hard-boiled 1940's private eye first played by James Naughton. As Stine, the jaundiced novelist turned screenwriter who created Stone, Michael Rupert is more plausibly cast than his boyish predecessor, Gregg Edelman, but is taking the character's Hollywood humiliations so much to heart that Stine threatens to become as glum as Willy Loman. The gifted Mr. Rupert needs to move a bit further away from the anguish of his last musical role (in "Falsettoland") to retrieve the buoyant charm he brought to his last role in a Cy Coleman musical (opposite Debbie Allen in "Sweet Charity").
 "City of Angels" and "Grand Hotel" have lost the respective supporting players, Randy Graff and Michael Jeter, who won Tony Awards for late-evening show stoppers, and in both cases the replacements (Chip Zien as the dying bookkeeper in "Grand Hotel," Susan Terry as the long-suffering secretary in "City of Angels") rekindle the spirit if not the spark of their predecessors. Even so, the experience of seeing either of these musicals is not markedly different today than it was at the end of 1989. But a repeat visitor may find, as I did, that seeing a second cast does bring the strengths and failings of the musicals themselves into sharper relief.
 Given its reviews, its Tony Award for best musical and its consistently higher attendance, "City of Angels" has been judged by most audiences to be the superior of the two shows, and I concur with that sentiment. The mirror-image double narrative of Larry Gelbart's script is a farcical wonder, as one would expect from the co-author of "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum," and his Hollywood-phobic dialogue is a volley of detonating punch lines worthy of the man who also co-wrote "Tootsie" and the television series "M*A*S*H." Mr. Coleman's exuberant mock-period jazz score, which has been rousingly arranged in the Billy May-Nelson Riddle tradition by Billy Byers, can be faulted only because it imitates the past (sometimes Mr. Coleman's own past) rather than attempting something fresh.
 Vastly entertaining as this musical is, however, there are times when I wish it might check into Mr. Tune's "Grand Hotel." To be sure, the "City of Angels" director, Michael Blakemore, and his designer, Robin Wagner, have done an ingenious job of piggy-backing the show's on-screen and off-screen Hollywood tales by depicting them, respectively, in black-and-white and color. At its best, the ricocheting between the show's two realities is as hilarious as was Mr. Blakemore's similar juggling of on- and offstage shenanigans in his classic production of Michael Frayn's backstage farce, "Noises Off." But "City of Angels" has virtually no musical staging, despite the listing of someone charged with that responsibility (Walter Painter) in the Playbill.
 By musical staging, I do not mean dancing per se -- though "City of Angels" has none of that, either -- so much as a sense of show-biz authority in the presentation of musical numbers. Too many songs are statically set forth, dead center stage, and most of them trail off rather than come to a punctuated, exhilarating finish. For all the sophistication of its content, "City of Angels" is, in theatrical terms, a throwback to George Abbott musicals of the 1950's and early 60's, minus the contributions of Jerome Robbins and Bob Fosse: Nearly every scene is a separate blackout sketch, bordered by a set change (often occurring behind a drop).
 "Grand Hotel," though also short of dancing, is a celebration of the modern musical-theater stagecraft that "City of Angels" avoids. Often several stories are told simultaneously during Mr. Tune's intricately designed two hours of swirling, nonstop movement, and nothing that happens is hidden from the audience behind drops or within blackouts. Mr. Tune needs only an evocative, two-level skeletal set (by Tony Walton), movable stiff-backed chairs, a portable revolving door and waltzing bodies to evoke every dark cranny of a seething, doom-laden Berlin hotel of 1928. When a curtain finally does fall late in "Grand Hotel" -- the only curtain to fall all evening -- the effect is shocking. Mr. Tune uses the curtain's slow descent in the most showy way imaginable: to demonstrate that only the lowering of a figurative wall could possibly still the churning panorama of life that he has unfurled onstage before.
 This director is some kind of genius, with an impeccable theatrical eye and an ability to take subconscious charge of an audience's vision. As the change in performers accentuates, the real reason why the dying bookkeeper's number ("We'll Take a Glass Together") stops the show has less to do with character, plot or performance than with a visual twist in the staging: Mr. Tune heightens the celebratory excitement of the oppressed bookkeeper's belated leap to freedom by making him the only character in the evening who literally leaps out of the grid-like frame that encases the show.
 The blot on "Grand Hotel," aside from its occasional rehashes of directorial ideas from Harold Prince's "Cabaret" and from Mr. Prince and Michael Bennett's "Follies," is that the whole show is fairly meaningless except as a predictable mood piece about Weimar Germany. "Forbidden Broadway" rightly parodied this musical as "Grim Hotel," for its grimness is ludicrously unearned, despite the periodic attempts to drag in class conflict by having scullery servants harangue the audience with the lyrics "Some have/Some have not." Does anyone really believe that Mr. Tune gives a hoot about Marxism? Worse, the director seems to invest little passion in the pulpy aspects of "Grand Hotel" as well. The show never delivers the romance, sexiness and tear-jerking soap operatics of the M-G-M movie that shares its title.
 In part this shortfall is due to the casting and the score, both of which are far too lackluster to convey grand emotions. ("Grand Hotel" must be the first musical in Broadway history to run more than a year without anyone lifting a finger to record it.) But surely Mr. Tune has the power to recruit better performers and to insist upon stronger material; is it possible he does not want any other strong creative personality to upstage him? This has been and continues to be the principal impediment to his career. Unlike Mr. Bennett, Mr. Prince, Mr. Robbins, Gower Champion and Agnes de Mille, Mr. Tune has never worked on a musical in which the other principal collaborators, off- and onstage, were all of his artistic stature. Would those directors be considered giants today if their reputations rested on musicals of the caliber of "Nine" and "Grand Hotel"?
 A triumph of showmanship over substance, "Grand Hotel" has the sensual kick and clammy aftertaste of high camp. A triumph of witty literary intellect over musicality, "City of Angels" is the funniest musical in years but hardly among the most theatrical. Neither show whips up one genuine emotion -- both are far more at home with the put-on -- and neither has a song that will make it to Broadway's all-time hit parade. Yet both have unmistakable, idiosyncratic personalities that linger in the imagination long after the assembly-line English spectaculars have blurred together, and they remain essential viewing for anyone who really cares about where the American musical goes from here.

HEADLINE: SUPER BOWL XXV;
It's First-and-10 for Buffalo's Zooming Civic Pride

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUFFALO, Jan. 24

 BODY:
When Carletta Rock was a girl, Buffalo was bigger than Los Angeles, and everybody really did call the place the Queen City of the Lakes. She grew up on stories about the days when this terminus of the Erie Canal was one of the busiest ports in the world, the meeting place, residents boasted, of Western supply and Eastern demand.
All this has something to do with why the 74-year-old woman, who confesses to not liking football and not really understanding the rules, was browsing through the racks of the AM & A Department Store here, looking for an official Buffalo Bills Super Bowl XXV T-shirt. 
 "This could put us back on the map," she said. Then, ever so slightly raising a fist, she added: "They'll respect us now. They've got to respect us."
For Buffalo, which more recently has found recognition in Johnny Carson jokes about its snow, the Bills' appearance in the Super Bowl has taken on an air of civic significance out of all proportion to what will unfold on the playing field. The city that produced two Presidents is once again at the pinnacle of something, and nobody seems to mind that it's only a game.
 
Gung-Ho Fans
 That the nation is at war has hardly dimmed the fervor: in a way, fans here seem to have fused the two events, so that in Buffalo the ardor for the home team has become an extra dimension of patriotism.
Many of the 80,000 fans at Sunday's victory over the Los Angeles Raiders waved both American flags and Bills pennants. In suburban Cheektowaga, a large sign in front of a gas station says, "Pray for Peace," and then right below, "Go Bills Go."
Buffalo, in any event, has long been a sports-crazy town. Bills quarterbacks, winning ones anyway, have become local heroes: Jack F. Kemp parlayed his career on the field into a Congressional seat; Edward J. Rutkowski was elected county leader.
The city of about 325,000 is engaged in an almost manic quest to attract a major league baseball team, and even its minor league squad, the Bisons, has attracted more fans in recent years than some major league teams.
 
Rodney Dangerfield Syndrome

But while people are clearly excited about the chance to win a championship, they seem equally motivated by the desire to get some respect.
"Buffalo has had a chip on its shoulder for a long time about how it was perceived by the rest of the world," said Verlyn Klinkenborg, who chronicles a changing Buffalo in his book, "The Last Fine Time," the story of a family tavern on the city's Polish East Side.
Having once been known as a bustling, even glorious place, Buffalo, Klinkenborg said in an interview, "somehow became part of a vaudeville act. You'd say the name and you'd get a laugh. I think a lot of people have been hungering for quite some time for an outward symbol of continuing excellence."
If not always spelled out in historical context, many people here seem to have a profound appreciation for the fact that Buffalo was once more important.
 
A Bad Image to Overcome
 "Buffalo used to be a big stop on the nightclub circuit," said Karen Orosco, the manager of J. J. Mugg's, a sports bar in Lackawanna, just south of Buffalo. "There used to be a saying: 'If you can make it in Buffalo, you can make it anywhere.' I'm not making that up."
The city -- once 8th-largest in the country, now around the 50th -- has yet to overcome its Rust Belt image of decay, although in many ways it deserves to. Thanks in large part to the Canadian free-trade agreement and to $2.5 billion in investment in its downtown and lakefront areas, it has weathered the Northeast's economic downturn better than any other area of the state.
The Bills, some municipal leaders hope, could help highlight an ascent that might otherwise be ignored. "Fortune magazine ranked us one of the top five growth communities in the country," said Dennis Gorski, the Erie County Executive. "That's not sensational; that's not sexy. But if football is what lets you shine in the international spotlight, you seize the moment."
 
A Long Wait
 Many fans are simply reveling in the Super Bowl moment, some perhaps exaggerating the forbearance it took them to reach this point.
"Twenty-five years we've been waiting for this," said Mike Zgoda, who despite 19-degree weather was tossing a football the other day with some friends on Whitehall Avenue in South Buffalo. Mike, a third-grader at St. Ambrose School, is 9 years old.
The enthusiasm is visible throughout the city. At some of the entrances, signs calling Buffalo the home of the "Future World Champion Bills" have been posted.
There have been a few difficulties. Two weeks ago, during the playoff game with Miami, so many of the Erie County Water Authority's 500,000 customers waited until commercials to use the toilet that five water mains broke.
 
Engineers Are Ready
 "We got those fixed, and fortunately the L.A. game was such a romp that not everybody waited until the ads," said George Markle, the authority's supervising production engineer.
He is taking no chances for the Super Bowl: engineers will be "assigned" to watch the game, he said, so that as commercials come on they can adjust pressure valves.
"The last M*A*S*H* show was a headache too," he said, "but this could be the greatest challenge of all."

HEADLINE: Borrow a Few Billion, Not Trouble

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, warned Congress this week not to raise taxes to pay for the war against Iraq. It's very good advice.
The war is now costing the U.S. about $500 million a day, $15 billion a month. The allies are paying probably half that, what with Japan's new contribution of $9 billion. That leaves the U.S. with an amount that's surely manageable in a $6 trillion economy. The question is whether to raise the money with higher taxes or more borrowing. 
 Mr. Greenspan's answer is to borrow, at least for the next few months as the country sorts out the costs and figures out what's happening to the economy. The gathering recession is no time to pile on a stiff tax hike. Besides, deficits are less worrisome during recessions because corporations borrow less and don't compete as much with the Government for capital.
To protect the economy, Congress needs to control structural deficits: the imbalance between continuing expenditures and costs. These deficits siphon money away from private capital formation and were the target of last fall's Congressional budget compromise. Deficits due to war and recession are nonrecurring and, therefore, less troubling.
In time, Congress will have a firmer estimate of the war's costs and can determine the mix of taxes and borrowing that best meets long-term needs. In the meantime, Mr. Greenspan is right to advise a safe course: Borrow to fight the war and thus spare the now-fragile economy any unnecessary trauma.

HEADLINE: Mr. Skinner Aids the Traveler

 BODY:
Eastern Airlines stopped flying last week. Pan Am and Continental are bankrupt, though still operating for now. Gone too are a number of former regional carriers -- like Ozark, PSA, Air California and Republic. Deregulation of the airline industry has spurred numerous mergers and failures, leaving only a half dozen major U.S. carriers.
Such consolidation raises concern that declining competition could allow fares on some routes to rise, harming the traveler. One way to inject competition and desperately needed financing into the industry is to lure foreign investment into struggling U.S. airlines. That's why Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner wisely announced this week new rules to ease restrictions on foreign ownership of U.S. carriers. Under the ruling, a foreign investor may purchase up to 49 percent of a U.S. airline, as long as foreign ownership of voting stock is limited to no more than 25 percent. 
 Mr. Skinner's ruling allows KLM Royal Dutch Airlines to keep its nearly 50 percent ownership share of Northwest Airlines. That allows Northwest to hold onto $250 million of desperately needed capital and the wherewithal to stay competitive.
Despite the wave of consolidations that accompanied deregulation, travelers have not suffered -- yet. Competition on typical routes has actually risen, and fares, after adjusting for inflation, have fallen. But if the wave of mergers and failures continues unabated, travelers will be left to the mercy of monopolistic carriers.
Mr. Skinner's ruling alone won't solve the problem. Few foreign investors will bid on U.S. carriers because severe legal barriers -- such as the 25 percent limit on voting shares -- remain. But he has taken an important first step to turning around an overly protectionist U.S. policy. The next step would be for Congress to permit foreign airlines to fly U.S. passengers from one American city to another.
The immediate beneficiary of Mr. Skinner's ruling is Northwest Airlines. And if he pushes Congress to loosen further, the ultimate victors will be every U.S. traveler who wants quality service at affordable fares.

HEADLINE: Harcourt Accepts Bid From General Cinema

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, the publishing and insurance company that has been struggling under a heavy debt load, yesterday accepted a $1.4 billion takeover bid from General Cinema, the movie theater company that controls the Neiman Marcus retail chain.
The deal would give holders of Harcourt's stock, both common and preferred, $1.30 a share, 5 cents above yesterday's common stock closing price, and will also include tender offers to the company's debt holders. If approved by the holders of Harcourt's stock and debt, the deal is expected to be completed this spring. 
 "It's an extraordinary deal, a near miracle, considering the state of the company, the economy and publishing companies," said Ivan Obolensky, vice president of the brokerage firm Shields & Company. Until yesterday, Mr. Obolensky had consistently expressed pessimism about Harcourt's future as an independent corporation after it borrowed nearly $3 billion to fend off a 1987 takeover attempt by Robert Maxwell, the British publisher. Harcourt stock traded as high as $63.75 a share during the takeover struggle with Mr. Maxwell.
 
Assets Sold
 Harcourt, whose current long-term debt is close to $2 billion, was forced to sell parts of the company to meet interest payments. Had the company been able to survive until 1993, Mr. Obolensky said, it would have faced accrued interest payments on two bond issues in excess of $500 million -- plus regular annual interest payments of at least $160 million.
General Cinema's offer surprised book industry executives because the company was not known to have bid for other publishing houses that were offered for sale in recent years. The company did not explain why it was willing to assume Harcourt's heavy debt load, but said it had looked at book publishing for several years and found it an attractive area.
Publishing executives speculated that General Cinema was willing to pay a premium for Harcourt, by assuming the debt, as the price of admission into the industry.
Richard A. Smith, chairman and chief executive of General Cinema, said in an statement: "HBJ is a fine company with a rich heritage and prestigious franchises in the publishing field. We look forward to bringing HBJ into the General Cinema group of companies and providing it with the financial resources to further strengthen its operating businesses."
The General Cinema Corporation, based in Chestnut Hill, Mass., operates 315 movie theater complexes in the United States and owns 60 percent of the Neiman Marcus group. It had revenues of $2.1 billion in its fiscal year ended Oct. 31, and net earnings of $111.3 million, or $1.51 a share.
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich had a loss of $26.3 million in its fiscal year ended Sept. 30, on revenues of $1.4 billion. Its assets at that time were valued at about $3 billion, but liabilities totaled $4.5 billion. Its principal business is book publishing, but it is also an underwriter of life, health and accident insurance.
 
Several Offers
 "The debt has been like the bad weather over Iraq," said Peter Jovanovich, Harcourt's chief executive. "It wasn't always possible to assess what was going on at this company, but underneath the fog we have wonderful publishing units -- some that took a hundred years to build. Thankfully, General Cinema had their fog lights on."
Mr. Jovanovich said several companies had bid for Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, but he declined to name them. It is known that one was K-III Holdings, the partnership controlled by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, the investment banker.
Harcourt's trade book unit is medium sized but often publishes distinguished lists. This spring, for example, it will publish books by Mark Helprin, Alice Walker and Georges Simenon, and it also publishes Octavio Paz, who won the 1990 Nobel Prize in Literature, and Umberto Eco.
Much of the strength of the company, which was founded in 1919, is in its balance. Academic and professional book publishing accounts for almost half its revenues, while elementary and secondary school publishing accounts for much of the rest. But so many units publish such different books that even in hard economic times one or more units are likely to have a good year.
The company, based in Orlando, Fla., has lost share in recent years in the increasingly competitive market for elementary and secondary school texts. And when Harcourt sold its theme parks, including several Sea World parks, for $1.1 billion last year to meet its debt payments, the sale netted $400,000 less than the company had said it hoped for.
But John S. Herrington, who last May succeeded William I. Jovanovich as chairman of the company, said yesterday that the theme parks' sale looks better every day. "In retrospect the falling attendance rates at theme parks and the gas crisis have proved that was an excellent sale," he said.
General Cinema also has an option to buy a separate part of the company, Academic Press, a profitable publisher of medical and scientific books, for $390 million.
Harcourt officials said they had received assurances that the current management would remain in place.
General Cinema will soon begin preparing tender offers for each series of Harcourt's outstanding public debt securities, and will solicit the consent of their holders to amend certain provisions of the related indentures. The cash amounts to be offered range from $930 per $1,000 principal amount for 13 percent senior notes, to $400 for 14 3/4 subordinated pay-in-kind debentures. Tendering debt holders will also receive, as part of their tender consideration, accrued and unpaid interest until March 15, 1991.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 26, 1991, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
A chart on the front page of Business Day yesterday titled "A Link Between Movies and Books," with an article about a takeover bid by the General Cinema Corporation for Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, misstatedthe full-year revenue figures for Harcourt, as well as the stock prices and fiscal years of Harcourt and General Cinema. Harcourt's revenues were $1.11 billion in 1987; $1.27 billion in 1988, and $1.34 billion in 1989. Harcourt's stock closed Thursday at $1.25 a share, unchanged; its fiscal year ended Dec. 31. General Cinema stock closed Thursday at $20.50, up 12.5 cents; its fiscal year ended Oct. 31.
In addition, the article misstated the year in which Harcourt completed the sale of its theme parks. It was 1989, not 1990.

Dime Savings Bank Raises Its President to Chairman

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
The Dime Savings Bank of New York yesterday elevated its president and chief executive, Richard D. Parsons, to be chairman and chief executive and hired a new president and chief operating officer, Lawrence J. Toal, a former Chase Manhattan banker.
The Dime said Mr. Parsons, 42, succeeded Harry W. Albright Jr., who retired and was named chairman emeritus. Mr. Albright has been chairman since 1981. 
 Mr. Toal, 53, was recruited for the Dime from the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, a subsidiary of the Meritor Financial Group, where he had been president. He had left the Chase Manhattan Bank in 1987 after a 26-year career there to follow Frederick S. Hammer, another Chase executive, who had gone to Meritor as its president.
The Philadelphia bank is "very profitable," Mr. Toal said. The Meritor holding company, however, ran into trouble when it expanded nationally, realized it could not sustain the growth and cut back on its operations.
The Dime, Mr. Toal said, "has what it takes to weather the storm over the next 12 to 18 months and be a major player."
"It has a good name, good capital position, and a good customer base," he said.
The Dime, which is the largest savings institution in New York, has not been without problems, however. In the third quarter last year, it posted a loss of $153.6 million, citing rising losses on real estate lending, and suspended its common stock dividend. Mr. Parsons said at the time that he was pessimistic about the near-term prospects for the New York economy.
Mr. Toal, born in Queens, is a graduate of Dartmouth and holds an M.B.A. in finance from New York University.
He worked in an assortment of banking jobs at Chase, running its credit card operation, its branch networks and its national expansion program, among other assignments. For three years, he was assigned to Hong Kong to run Chase's operations there, followed in 1984 by an assignment in London to start up Chase's international consumer business.

Transamerica Gives President a New Title

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

 BODY:
The Transamerica Corporation said yesterday that its president, Frank C. Herringer, would assume the additional post of chief executive.
Mr. Herringer, who is 48 years old, will succeed James R. Harvey, 56, on April 25.
Mr. Harvey, who was named chief executive in 1981, will continue as Transamerica's chairman. He previously served as Transamerica's president from 1979 to 1986 and has been chairman since 1983. 
 Over the last 10 years, Transamerica has restructured itself from a highly diversified company to one focused on insurance and financial services.
"While we have made great progress in developing and implementing a new set of strategies for Transamerica, there is still much that needs to be done," Mr. Harvey said. "I think it's very advantageous to our shareholders to have a younger leader who can enthusiastically carry out our strategic plans and who will also bring a fresh perspective."
Mr. Herringer said he would continue to work closely with Mr. Harvey. Over the last decade, "there is no significant decision that I haven't been fully a part of," Mr. Herringer said. "We have had our differences of opinion, but in the end we always agreed."
Mr. Herringer was elected president of Transamerica in 1986. He joined the company in 1979 as vice president and assistant to the chairman. In 1980, he was named senior vice president with responsibility for corporate strategic planning, including mergers and acquisitions. In 1982, he was elected group vice president for Transamerica's insurance brokerage, manufacturing and transportation operations. In 1984 he was named executive vice president, with responsbility for all of the corporation's insurance activities.
Before joining Transamerica, Mr. Herringer served as general manager of the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District, known as BART, administrator of the Federal Urban Mass Transportation Administration and a principal with the management consulting firm of Cresap, McCormick & Paget Inc.
Mr. Herringer serves on the boards of the Unocal Corporation, the Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center, the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration at Dartmouth College and at Mills College in Oakland, Calif.
A native of New York City, Mr. Herringer received a bachelor's degree in mathematics and economics from Dartmouth College and an M.B.A. from the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration at Dartmouth. He and his wife, Maryellen, have two children.

HEADLINE: AS A NEW WAR IS RAGING, OPPOSING VOICES FROM THE PAST SOUND OUT AGAIN;
McGovern: 'I Am Ready' to Run

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DURHAM, N.H., Jan. 24

 BODY:
The year is 1991 and America is at war in the Persian Gulf. But for a moment today it seemed as if it was the early 1970's and a different war, for here was George S. McGovern on a college stage talking about running for President.
"I have not yet made the decision, but I am seriously considering it," former Senator McGovern told an overflow audience of 850 students and faculty members at the University of New Hampshire. His suggestion drew cheers and prolonged applause on a campus not noted for political activism. 
 Donna Melillo, a 42-year-old psychologist with the school's counseling service, said, "It's great to hear him talk again." Dr. Melillo said she had voted for Mr. McGovern when he was the Democratic nominee in 1972 and, running on a platform of opposition to the Vietnam War, lost badly to President Richard M. Nixon. He carried only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia.
"It sounds like a lot of hookey, but he appeals to what is best in us, to honor, and not to the greed of the 80's," Dr. Melillo said.
 
A New Set of Issues
 The three-term Senator of South Dakota said that if he did decide to run again, "I would not plan to base my campaign primarily on opposition to the war in the Persian Gulf." He said that while he would have preferred that the United States continued with economic sanctions against Iraq and not gone to war in the gulf, "as an American, I want our forces to prevail."
Mr. McGovern, now 68 years old, said that for the next election he was primarily concerned with America's deteriorating economy and the erosion of the nation's political system. Borrowing a catch phrase from the Republicans, Mr. McGovern said that what America now needs is "a new definition of patriotism" that gets beyond symbolic flag waving.
Under this new patriotism, he said, it would no longer be patriotic to accept huge national debts, to spend hundreds of billions of dollars for defense against the Soviet Union with the cold war over, to tolerate pollution or to go along with "the philosophy of greed and breakdown of Federal supervision that produced the savings and loan scandal."
"It is not patriotic to commit young Americans to war unless our national security clearly requires it," Mr. McGovern added. "It is certainly not patriotic to wink and nod as race relations come under new strains."
 
Into the Vacuum
 Looking tanned and relaxed, Mr. McGovern said, "I would prefer that a younger, less battle-scarred candidate would now come forward" to provide a strong new voice for the Democrats. "But if that is not to be, I believe that I am ready in heart, mind and body to raise the Democratic standard."
He noted that so far, no Democrat has seriously begun a campaign for the Presidency, and in particular that not a single Democrat has opened a campaign operation here in New Hampshire, with its influential first-in-the-nation primary.
It was Senator McGovern's strong second-place finish in the New Hampshire primary in 1972, after Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine, the favorite, that helped propel him to a surprise capture of the Democratic nomination that year.
In 1984 Mr. McGovern, with a poorly financed organization, tried again, narrowly missing a second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses to Walter Mondale and Gary Hart, his former campaign manager.
 
Third Time the Charm?
 Four years later Mr. McGovern bought an inn in Stratford, Conn., but it has been struggling to survive. Asked in an interview about a new Presidential bid, he said: "I'm not under any illusions. I'd like to get something other than pure ridicule if I did it."
In particular, friends say, Mr. McGovern does not relish being labeled another Harold Stassen, the perennial Republican candidate of the 1940's, 50's and 60's.
But Mr. McGovern, who frequently lectures at colleges, said that he had been contacted "by a number of people around the country over the past year about running again." As a result, a group of these people met at his inn on Dec. 28 and decided to form an exploratory committee.
"I haven't told them I would do it, but I said I would give them an answer in a couple of months," he said in the interview.
His visit to New Hampshire today is part of an effort to see whether it makes any sense to run, Mr. McGovern said. The keys are whether he can get enough contributions to qualify for Federal matching funds and whether he can put together a strong campaign organization, he said. In his 1972 campaign, it was his army of zealous volunteers, many of them strongly opposed to the Vietnam war, that helped propel him to the Democratic nomination.
 
Mixed Feelings From Supporters
 Encouraging him to run again is Woody Woodland, a minister in New Boston, N.H., who was Mr. McGovern's state coordinator in 1984. "McGovern people who know the Senator personally have mixed feelings," Mr. Woodland said. "We are excited, but we know it will be rough with comparisons to Stassen."
In his appearance today, Mr. McGovern was careful to differentiate his all-out opposition to the Vietnam War from his reservations about American involvement in the gulf. "One obvious difference is that there was clear aggression in the gulf, with Saddam Hussein invading Kuwait," he said.
He pointed out that Dale Nitzschke, the president of the University of New Hampshire, has a son who is a Marine fighter pilot in Saudi Arabia. And he asked for a moment of prayer for all those caught in the war.
Paradoxically, it was Mr. Nitzschke who invited Senator McGovern to speak here. "I have great respect for George," Mr. Nitzschke said. "The invitation was extended some time ago, before the war, but I know George has a little gleam in his eye. He's sampling things."

HEADLINE: Dinkins to Lead Contingent in Trip to Israel

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins, who has repeatedly criticized the American effort in the Persian Gulf, said yesterday that he would travel to Israel next week in a symbolic gesture of support for Israelis and for American troops.
In the tender world of the city's ethnic politics, the visit could prove awkward. It would appeal to Jewish supporters and strengthen his pro-Israel stance, but it might appear too hawkish to some of his anti-war constituents, including many blacks, who still form the base of his support. 
Mr. Dinkins announced at a news conference that he would travel to Israel on Feb. 2 and return on Feb. 4. During his stay, the Mayor plans to meet with President Chaim Herzog, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Mayor Teddy Kollek of Jerusalem and Mayor Shlomo Lahat of Tel Aviv. Mr. Dinkins will be accompanied by Representative Charles B. Rangel; the Israeli Consul General, Uriel Savir, and representatives of the Jewish Community Relations Council and the United Jewish Appeal Federation of Jewish Philanthropies.
The Mayor also plans to greet Ethiopian and Soviet Jews who have recently arrived in Israel and to visit victims of Iraqi missile attacks.
"As the Mayor of the city with the largest Jewish community anywhere in the world," Mr. Dinkins said yesterday, "I hope our visit will serve to reaffirm our historic solidarity with the State of Israel, our concern for the safety of the people of the Middle East who are caught up in this conflict, and of course, our support for the men and women in uniform who are risking their lives for freedom."
Albert Scardino, the Mayor's press secretary, said security would be tight and gas masks would be provided for the contingent. City officials are still working on the details, but the trip will be financed by one or two private, nonprofit Jewish organizations that do not do business with the city. Although Mr. Dinkins has said he is opposed to the war, he has expressed continued support for American troops and for Israel's safety as it comes under attack from Iraq.
Many blacks, based on both anecdotal evidence and a recent New York Times/CBS News Poll, are opposed to the gulf conflict. The poll asked 3,002 adults whether they favored starting military action or continuing the use of economic sanctions. The 250 blacks polled were about evenly split on the question, while whites favored military action by a 4-to-1 ratio.
In the vote four days before war started, all black Democrats in Congress opposed the measure authorizing force in the gulf.
During a Jan. 21 rally near City Hall to celebrate the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., some in the predominantly black crowd heckled Mr. Dinkins as being pro-war for appearing the previous day at a rally in support of Israel.
 
'Political Fallout'
 "I don't make decisions based on what the political fallout will be," Mr. Dinkins insisted yesterday when asked about the political ramifications of his visit. "It seems to me that one has to do is make a judgment on what one feels."
The Mayor said yesterday that he and Mr. Rangel, a longtime friend and political ally, conceived the idea of visiting Israel on Thursday night, the same day that Mr. Dinkins and a contingent of mayors attending a United States Conference of Mayors in Washington made a similar overture of support by visiting the Israeli Embassy.
Although Mr. Dinkins said yesterday that he planned the trip without considering political ramifications, he acknowledged that various meanings will inevitably be attached. When asked what he hoped to accomplish beyond an expression of support of Israel and American troops, Mr. Dinkins said that was the simple intent.
Michael Miller, executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council, praised the Mayor's visit by saying: "Most Israelis know who David Dinkins is. Those in New York see this as a symbolic link between Jews in Israel and people in New York."
Mr. Rangel, who will speak at an anti-war protest in Washington today, said opposition from blacks and from those opposed to the war is a non-issue in regard to his visit to Israel with Mr. Dinkins. He said the visit is a show of solidarity and respect for the State of Israel.
"If you're going to be in Washington tomorrow you'll be privileged to hear me speak against the war," Mr. Rangel told a reporter. "What the heck has that got to do with me going to some people who have been the victims of the war?"

HEADLINE: Florio Budget Is Said to Cut 8,000 Jobs

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
The Florio administration is planning to eliminate up to 8,000 state jobs -- about 9 percent of the state work force -- in the next fiscal year as part of budget plans that include more than 4,000 layoffs and the reduction of the number of departments to 16, from 19, administration officials said today.
Officials say Gov. Jim Florio plans to present a $14 billion budget that includes severe cuts in state government. They said the proposal, to be presented to the Legislature on Tuesday, reflects an attempt to cope with weak state revenues in a political environment that makes it impossible for the Governor to raise anything resembling a tax. 
 The administration will rely heavily on layoffs, they say, and the consolidation of government departments. State agencies employ about 85,000 people. New Jersey's next fiscal year, when the budget would go into effect, starts on Aug. 1.
 
Decline in Revenues
 "What we've tried to do is make it all more manageable," said an administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "We have gone back to check the mission of every agency when it was established and see if it should still have the same mission. We've tried to get rid of duplication."
Like New York, New Jersey suffered a sharp decline in revenues in the last 12 months as the region's economy slowed.
But as a result of sales, income and other taxes raised here last year, administration officials say New Jersey's problem is not as serious as in nearby states. New Jersey's gap is $800 million, compared with $6 billion in New York and $1.5 billion in Connecticut. The Florio administration said reducing the size of government would save the state $400 million.
 
Cutbacks Are Less Severe
 The $800 million gap represents about one-twentieth of New Jersey's budget, while $6 billion represents about one-fifth of New York's and $1.5 billion is about one-fifth of Connecticut's.
New Jerseyans will see cutbacks in a wide range of services, officials say, but they say there will not be the extreme cuts or the borrowing expected elsewhere.
The consolidation plans for state agencies include the merging of the state's Banking, Insurance and Commerce Departments into a new Department of Regulated Commerce. The Department of Environmental Protection would be merged with parts of the Board of Public Utilities to form a Depart ment of Environmental Protection and Energy.
In preparation for those moves, Mr. Florio today announced the resignation of the Environmental Protection Commissioner, Judith Yaskin and her replacement by Scott Weiner, the president of the Board of Public Utilities. Administration officials said this week that Mr. Florio planned to announce job reductions of between 5,000 and 6,000 in his speech next week. But the administration's ultimate goal, one official said, was to reduce the size of state government by up to 8,000 jobs,The administration's targets for reductions include:
*The layoff of 3,000 workers as a result of 8 percent reductions in the budgets of state departments that Mr. Florio asked his commissioners to make plans for last year.
*The dismissal of up to 1,000 middle-management state workers who are paid an average of $45,000 a year.
*The elimination 300 to 500 state employees as a result of the consolidation of the training and vehicle maintenance programs.
*The early retirement of 2,500 employees under an incentive program for workers who are at least 50 years old.
*The elimination of an additional 2,000 jobs through attrition, replacing only two of three workers who leave the state payroll.
The administration is fairly certain it can eliminate 4,000 jobs through the 8 percent budget reduction and the dismissal of middle-management workers. The jobs to be eliminated through consolidation, retirement and attrition are projections.
 
Workers' Rally
 "The 4,000 layoffs are firm," the official said. "But plans call for 8,000 as a goal."
In response to expected layoffs and demands for givebacks by unionized workers, several thousand state workers who are union members demonstrated outside the State House today, chanting "Hell No, Florio," and "They say pay back. We say give back." The Communications Workers of America and other unions said the Florio administration had asked them to accept $400 million in salary and health concessions on current contracts or to face 10,000 layoffs. The administration denies having threatened 10,000 layoffs.
"We are not going to stand idly by while elected officials attempt to make political points by slam-dunking state workers," said Jan Pierce, a Communications Workers district vice president. "We will be heard."
 
Tax Increases Last Year
 The $14 billion proposal represents a substantial rise in spending. The budget for the current fiscal year is more than $12 billion. The increase includes a jump of $1.1 billion in aid to education, money raised from an income tax increase that Mr. Florio urged last year. That money went to finance Mr. Florio's controversial program to aid poor and lower-middle-income school districts.
About half of Mr. Florio's $2.8 billion in tax increases last year came from a sales tax used to fill a budget shortfall. The other half was an increase in income taxes used to finance his education plan and to provide rebates for middle- and lower-income property taxpayers.

Bohan: A Gallic Revolution in London

BYLINE: By BERNADINE MORRIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
Marc Bohan gave the stolid British couture a lively injection of Gallic style with his first collection for Norman Hartnell , dressmaker to the Queen and her mother. Mr. Bohan, 63 years old, was for almost 30 years the designer for Christian Dior in Paris. His new clothes were graceful, colorful and stunningly simple.
British fashion buffs hope that Mr. Bohan can raise the status of the couture houses here to offer a serious challenge to Paris. 
 The main advantage today is in prices. Several designers claim that a customer could receive change from a 1,000-pound note (the pound is worth about $2) when ordering a relatively simple made-to-order suit or dress. Typical French prices are two to four times as much.
 
Visitors From Paris
 The houses here operate without much fanfare or elaborate promotional efforts, and the workrooms are less sophisticated, one of the reasons Mr. Bohan says he kept his styling simple. Still, the results were particularly appropriate for a time of almost worldwide recession and war in the Persian Gulf. Both situations cut the number of Americans, both clients and press, at his show Thursday, but friends from Paris did cross the channel. They included Alistair Blair and Jean-Louis Scherrer, the designers, and Anne Arnault, the wife of Bernard Arnault, the head of Financiere Agache, which owns Dior.
Mr. Bohan's presence has already spurred five other couture houses here to form a loose federation that coordinated showing dates, scheduling them the week before Paris. Each show consisted of about 50 pieces, half the usual number in Paris.
The Bohan opening capped the week and brought a standing ovation from the usually restrained, mostly British audience. The clothes avoided the frivolities of typical British style as well as the exaggerations of French fashion. They were in cheerful, but not strident, colors, and the neat, clean lines were easy to comprehend and to wear. They expressed a feeling of restrained elegance, comforting in a world in turmoil.
The key to daytime dressing was a fingertip-length jacket that slid gently over the body and often topped a matching short skirt or dress with a flurry of pleats near the hemline. For evening, he offered floor-length dresses that opened at the front to show a shorter skirt underneath. They were occasionally brightened with mirror embroidery, silver nailheads or sequined patches. The clothes were clearly the work of a seasoned designer not interested in making raucous fashion statements.
Anouska Hempel , the trendiest designer showing in London, drew Twiggy and Princess Margaret to her relatively restrained presentation. Mid-thigh hemlines that curved up even higher at the sides, pompons everywhere and touches of color brightened her collection, which usually focuses on black. Twiggy was impressed by the dark green and purple styles.
"Gimmicks are passe," said Franka Stael von Holstein, a designer born in Yugoslavia whose husband is Swedish. Franka , as she known professionally, makes wearable, easy-fitting black dresses with white collars and cuffs and party dresses in interesting shades of chiffon like copper with burnt orange or gold. Her knitwear has been successful at Saks Fifth Avenue and she plans to introduce ready to wear in March.
While the two women staged modest shows in their salons, Victor Edelstein , like Mr. Bohan, introduced his collection at Claridge's and Hardy Amies chose the rotunda of the Coutts & Company's bank headquarters in the West End. Amid reports that French designers were nervously canceling entertainments after their shows, both Mr. Edelstein and Sir Hardy gave cocktail parties or dinners.
Both showed respectable clothes that brought comments like "lovely" or "charming" from their neatly dressed clients.
 
Satin Nehrus
 The Hardy Amies collection combined Bermuda shorts with tailored jackets in bright colors like aqua and yellow in what he called "couture sportswear." It seemed adventure enough. A green chiffon tent was the best of his cocktail dresses and a black silk column decorated with a trio of black ribbons the best of the long dresses.
The most original design for evening was seen in his men's clothes, which included satin Nehru suits, quilted velvet vests and topcoats with cut-velvet shawl collars. Women loved them, for themselves.
The silk tweed fitted suits and a coat in purple, green and orange that opened Victor Edelstein's show were expressed in soft, clean tailoring with a bit of dash. His evening dresses had big, rounded skirts and snug jeweled bodices, except for a white crepe style with controlled fullness. Many thought it would be great for the Princess of Wales.
The best exponent of typical British style is Lachasse , a company that has been around since the early part of this century. Hardy Amies trained there.
"Clients come through recommendations -- women bring their granddaughters," said Peter Lewis-Crown, the owner and designer since 1949. He added that business was up 50 percent for the month of January over the same period last year.
Traditional tweed suits and printed silk ball gowns are specialties; godets and pin tucks were prominent details. A hand-woven Irish tweed suit looked cheerful and indestructible, and showed that fashion can be immutable.

HEADLINE: One City's Merchants Sense an Eerie Quiet

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Jan. 22

 BODY:
To Hugh Cline, owner of a two-store appliance business in the suburbs of Richmond, big news is usually good news. Whatever happens, he figures on doing a brisk business in television sets.
Not this time. The outbreak of war in the Persian Gulf has hit hard at Cline Appliance and other local merchants like Hyman Brothers Pontiac and the Adventures Unlimited travel agency. War has put a sizable, though hard-to-measure, dent in a local economy already in recession. 
 "I'd say traffic is off at least 50 to 60 percent" since the shooting started, said Mr. Cline, whose stores sell refrigerators, ranges and other kitchen appliances as well as televisions. "It was just like somebody turned the faucet off."
Other merchants have suffered less. Some, including those who provide shortwave and portable radios, flags, maps, military gear, pizza and snack food, model planes and religious publications, have enjoyed some benefit. Others have already experienced big gyrations.
"The first couple of days it was real scary," said Carl Rosen, general manager of Alan Furs on East Grace Street. "But this week we've been blowing merchandise out of here." With the aid of colder weather, he said, the sales pace has nearly reached the "phenomenal" level generated by post-holiday price cuts and promotions this year, he said.
And at Radio Shack, Gloria Holley, the assistant manager, said, "It was crazy in here for a while." She said customers had swarmed in to buy radios at prices from $24.95 to $199.95 until supplies ran out.
 
Much to Be Lost

Interviews with dozens of Richmond-area businesses and consumers indicate that while the economic impact of the first week of war is mixed, there is relatively little to cheer and potentially much to be lost, even from levels diminished by months of recession.
Consider, for example, the situation at Hyman Brothers, which calls itself Virginia's No. 1 dealer in Pontiacs, a make especially popular among military-age and blue-collar drivers. "It's been very slow for us," since shortly after the shooting started, said Ernie Simopoulos, the worried general manager. He said his competitors, which he has taken to checking frequently, were similarly suffering. 
 
Shattered Confidence
 Richmond, with a population of just over 200,000, is typical of many smaller East Coast cities, with a diverse economy of manufacturing, government and service industries, including medical and educational institutions.
Consumer confidence was shattered when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, an event that many contend pushed a teetering economy over the brink. But confidence will not be easily restored even by a quick victory for the United States-led coalition, said Prof. Richard T. Curtin, who supervises the consumer attitude surveys of the University of Michigan. And should the war be prolonged, as seems increasingly likely, consumers' expectations would probably be further tempered.
"The upside potential is rather shallow," Professor Curtin said, "while the downside risk is much greater."
Consumers rarely shift buying patterns enough to cause the economy to change direction. But because they account for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, their mood and their ability to buy are crucial to sustaining trends, and if those don't soon improve the recession will likely be longer and more severe than the mild, short-lived slump still projected by most analysts.
At most stores, shops and service establishments in Richmond, consumers are scarce and skittish.
 
A Fear of Terrorism
 "Last Wednesday, it died," said Cathy Madison, a vice president of Adventures Unlimited, of new bookings, especially those to overseas destinations. "It was just like a curtain fell." She said people were not even requesting brochures from the travel agency, much less planning trips. Ms. Madison said she feared that if a terrorist attack occurred in the next week or two it would keep customers away indefinitely.
At the Sixth Street Marketplace, a downtown mall, David Elyea was in a particularly somber mood. A partner in Nicholas & Alexandra, a shop selling Soviet-made gifts, Mr. Elyea, who is in his 20's, was thinking of canceling a trip to the Soviet Union next month because of the risk that he said is "on everybody's mind." He had returned home from Europe on Pan Am only a few days before the December 1988 bombing of Flight 103.
Over on Church Hill, a block from where Patrick Henry made his "liberty or death" speech in old St. John's Church, Jim and Lynn News fretted about business at their inn, called Mr. Patrick Henry's.
"It's going to hurt us," Mr. News said of the war, adding that the couple had added possible furloughs of employees to a list of previously adopted cost-control measures. He noted that restaurants were a luxury that many people could do without. "Nobody needs to go out to eat," he said.
 
Even Dance Classes Affectred
 And except for the items they particularly wanted right away -- from radios to yellow ribbon -- consumers here seem inclined to pull back in ways small as well as big.
At the Shops at Willow Lawn, for example, Carole Lodel said fresh economic uncertainty involving gasoline prices and the war had prompted her to cancel a dance class for her daughter, Elisabeth.
On the other hand, Sue Haase, a single parent who works in the computer department of the James River Corporation, said while buying two $1 flags at a downtown variety store that her outlook was already gloomy because she had been unable to sell her house.
Mr. Cline attributes his failure to sell televisions of late to the fact that people were glued to those they already had. He assumes this situation will not last for long but has little hope of recovering lost sales.
"The last week is pretty much gone forever," he said.
Professor Curtin observed that Americans do not have a recent memory of wartime shortages, unlike the situation at the outbreak of the Korean War. In the absence of indications of shortages, he said, people are unlikely to make precautionary purchases that would spur the economy. Moreover, even a protracted war is unlikely to deplete military stocks enough to generate a big increase in weapons production, which would also stimulate the economy.

HEADLINE: USAir Pulling Back on West Coast

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
USAir, abandoning its hopes to become a force on the West Coast as it is in the East, said yesterday that it was pulling out of six markets in California and one each in Oregon and Washington state.
The carrier also reported a loss of $221.1 million in the fourth quarter of 1990 on revenue of $1.66 billion, compared with a loss of $101.7 million on revenue of $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 1989. 
 As part of its pullback in the West, USAir said it would retire 18 BAe-146 aircraft, an 81-seat jet made by British Aerospace. The jet became a favorite of large commuter airlines for carrying passengers to the large hubs of major airlines.
 
Cuts in the East, Too
 USAir also said it would reduce service by 20 daily flights at Cleveland and by 25 daily flights at the Baltimore-Washington International Airport, one of its larger hubs.
The carrier had already been struggling with service problems before the Persian Gulf crisis sharply raised jet fuel costs and induced many travelers to stay home.
USAir was just making progress in solving problems stemming from its merger with Piedmont Airlines. Among the difficulties were a disruption of flights because of a shortage of crews, long delays at airports and misrouted baggage.
Edwin I. Colodny, the chairman and president of USAir Group, the airline's parent company, said a downturn in traffic, a huge increase in fuel costs and the competitive need to offer discount fares put great pressure on the entire airline industry in the fourth quarter.
"Most of these factors continue to be present," he added. "It is unrealistic to think the airline industry's economic environment, which is adversely impacted by the gulf war, will change significantly in 1991."
The cutback will mean that some workers will be dismissed, the company said. But it added that the number had not been determined.
Most of the cutbacks come at what used to be PSA Airlines, which USAir took over in 1986 for $400 million to stay in the race to build a nationwide route system.
USAir will no longer fly from the Burbank, Oakland, Ontario. Orange County, Palm Springs and San Jose airports in California, or from Portland, Ore., and Bellingham, Wash.
USAir said there would be no change in its hourly service between Los Angeles International Airport and San Francisco International Airport.
Over all, the steps will reduce USAir's capacity by 4 or 5 percent.
"It shows that rationality is coming into the airline industry," said Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst for Morgan Stanley. "The West Coast got top-heavy with capacity, and now it's the domain of those that have hubs at Los Angeles and San Francisco."
He said that United Airlines, with its San Francisco hub, and Delta, with a hub in Los Angeles, had survived a grueling battle for the lucrative West Coast markets.
 
 A Series of Cutbacks
 The plans announced today are the latest in a series of steps that USAir, based in Arlington, Va., has taken to stem losses since 1989.
In August the airline furloughed 3,600 workers, including 500 managers, in one of the largest recent cuts in the industry.
The loss that USAir reported for the fourth quarter included a one- time pretax charge of $90 million. The charge consisted of $44 million for lease obligations for the 18 aircraft that will be gradually retired and $46 million for the costs of laying off and relocating employees.
Its losses for the full year of 1990 totaled $454.5 million on revenues of $6.56 billion, compared with a 1989 loss of $63.2 million on revenues of $6.25 billion.
USAir announced this week that Seth E. Schofield would succeed Mr. Colodny as chief executive in June, when Mr. Colodny reaches retirment age. Mr. Colodny, who guided the carrier through the more competitive times of deregulation, will continue as chairman of both USAir and the USAir Group.

HEADLINE: Ouster of Realty Leader Jolts Corporate Japan

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 25

 BODY:
The harmonious facade of corporate Japan cracked today in an extraordinary board room attack, as the directors of Itoman & Company, an ailing trading and real estate concern, rose up and voted to oust the company's president, Yoshihiko Kawamura.
Not since 1982, when the domineering president of Mitsukoshi, a large department store, was dismissed after a scandal has the sometimes harsh warfare inside Japanese companies broken into the open so unceremoniously. 
 The board room battle was just the latest in a series of blows to hit Itoman and the financial institution that effectively controls it, the Sumitomo Bank, Japan's and the world's third-largest bank. And it appears that it was Sumitomo that orchestrated Mr. Kawamura's ouster.
 
 Prices Soared
 Itoman, which is based in Osaka, is one of several big real estate companies that have fallen victim to a Government-ordered credit squeeze. The Finance Ministry stood aside during the last five years as extremely low interest rates and an economic boom sent the prices of various assets, particularly stocks and property, rocketing to unprecedented levels.
Having decided that speculation had gotten out of hand, ministry officials said it was time to wring some of these excesses out of the system.
Itoman is a textile trading company that in the speculative boom of the 1980's went on a real estate buying binge. That has left it smothered by nearly $10 billion in debt, and a cutoff by some lenders.
The Sumitomo Bank rescued Itoman once before, after the oil crisis in 1974 sent Itoman's textile trading business into a tailspin. Mr. Kawamura, in fact, was a Sumitomo executive sent by the bank in 1975 to lead Itoman's overhaul and rehabilitation.
Although Sumitomo owns just under 5 percent of Itoman, in traditional Japanese fashion it exercises effective control through cross-holdings with other affiliated companies and informal ties that have involved sending a number of executives to help manage Itoman.
 
Rates Raised Sharply
 Itoman's recent problems appeared several months ago when it was disclosed that it was suffering from the staggering debt load. Banks here were being forced by the Finance Ministry to curb their lending to speculative real estate companies. The Government also raised interest rates sharply, putting even more pressure on companies that had borrowed heavily to buy property in Japan and in the United States and Europe.
As a result, a number of big real estate concerns have run into problems, among them the Shuwa Corporation, which owns ARCO Plaza in Los Angeles, and EIE International, which is developing the Regent of New York Hotel on 57th Street in Manhattan.
But in most instances, a bank has stepped in to support the ailing real estate companies and provide credit until debt could be reduced, properties sold and the company rebuilt. The Sumitomo Bank has had to sharply increase its lending to Itoman to make up for other forms of credit that were drying up.
Itoman's debt to Sumitomo has jumped to about $3.6 billion, from a little more than $2 billion last September, according to recent reports, as investors stopped buying Itoman's commercial paper and Sumitomo had to replace it with new loans.
 
Scandal Over Art Works
 News reports said Mr. Kawamura had refused repeated suggestions that he resign, saying he wanted to complete the debt reduction and restructuring.
Even worse for both companies' images was a scandal late last year when it was disclosed that Itoman had spent hundreds of millions of dollars on art works. According to news reports, the paintings were bought at inflated values as part of a scheme to avoid direct payments for real estate transactions. In effect, the transactions involving the paintings were used, according to these reports, as a circuitous means of providing payments in land transactions and avoiding the scrutiny of regulators.
Shortly after newspapers reported the scheme, a top Itoman executive, who had come from Sumitomo, committed suicide.
Sotoo Tatsumi, Sumitomo's president, said after the startling announcement of Mr. Kawamura's ouster that Sumitomo would increase its control over Itoman.

HEADLINE: Economy Falls at 2.1% Rate; Decline Is Biggest in 8 Years

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
The economy contracted at a 2.1 percent annual rate in the final three months of 1990, the biggest quarterly drop in more than eight years and the most definitive proof yet that the nation's longest peacetime business expansion has ended.
But the fall was not as sharp as most Government and private economists had predicted. And the report released today was seen as supporting a widely shared view that the recession now gripping the nation, as best as can be judged in the early stages of the Persian Gulf war, would be less severe than most and would end by midyear. 
 "The current economic downturn is likely to be relatively brief and mild," Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said. "Inflation is subsiding, overall inventories are relatively lean in relation to sales, and the Federal Reserve continues to take steps to support economic growth. In addition, U.S. exports are expanding at a solid pace."
Others took considerably less comfort in the department's report on gross national product. They contended that the fourth-quarter decline would have been far worse without the stimulus of the military buildup and that improvement in exports could not be sustained. The economies of various trade partners are also floundering, they noted, making it unlikely that these countries will buy more American goods.
"The worst isn't over yet," contended Bruce Steinberg, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch & Company, noting that private domestic demand fell more than 4 percent in the latest quarter, with weakness in nearly every sector.
For all of 1990, G.N.P. rose by nine-tenths of 1 percent, compared with 2.5 percent in 1989 and 4.5 percent in 1988. It was the worst annual performance since a 2.5 percent decline for 1982.
The report unsettled the Treasury securities market, which thrives on negative economic news. Investors in debt issues had been expecting a larger drop in the G.N.P., which is the value of all goods and services the economy turns out.
Projected declines for the fourth quarter had ranged from about 2 percent to as much as 5 percent. The Bush Administration was in the mainstream with an estimate of 3.4 percent, while the Congressional Budget Office, with an estimate of 2.6 percent, was in the unusual position of being more optimistic than the White House. Both predicted a smaller contraction for the current quarter, implying that the worst was already over, followed by the beginnings of recovery.
The fourth-quarter decline of about $22.4 billion, or 2.1 percent, followed a 1.4 percent rate of economic growth in the third quarter, a gain that some still find somewhat puzzling, since the recession is thought by many economists to have begun in the summer months.
 
 Expecting 'Clear-Cut' Gains
 The third quarter ended worse than it started, as did the fourth. Speaking today after the G.N.P. figures were released, Michael R. Darby, the Commerce Under Secretary, said, "This trajectory suggests continued softness in the first quarter's output, most likely another outright drop in real G.N.P., but less severe than the fourth-quarter setback."
He said he hoped to see "clear-cut signs of recovery" in three months.
Two straight quarterly declines in G.N.P. are popularly regarded as a sign of recession. But the arbiters at the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private group, consider the depth and breadth of a downturn as well as its persistence, and they have already issued a preliminary ruling that the recession probably started in the summer.
The latest decline was the first since a drop of 1.8 percent in the second quarter of 1986. That decline was unrecognized at the time, emerging later only after many statistical revisions. Last quarter's decline was the largest since one of 3.2 percent in the third quarter of 1982, toward the end of what until now was the most recent American recession and the deepest downturn since the Great Depression.
 
 Inventories Were Slashed
 The fourth-quarter decline was concentrated in motor vehicles, with lower output reflecting weak sales to businesses and consumers and the fact that much of the existing demand was met by drawing down inventories rather than raising production.
Sparse inventories, however, means that when car buying and other demand picks up, "there's going to be instantaneous throttle response" at factories, said Thomas F. Carpenter, chief economist at ASB Capital Management, a Washington money management firm. G.N.P. rises when goods are produced, even if they pile up in the hands of manufacturers or dealers.
Businesses slashed inventories at a rate of $16.3 billion in the quarter, a $21 billion swing from the third quarter, when stocks climbed $4.7 billion.
The fourth quarter was also marked by very strong foreign trade, without which the 2.1 percent decline in G.N.P. would have been almost twice as great, observed C. Fred Bergsten, head of the Institute for International Economics.
He called this a "stunning performance" and said it must be sustained if the economy was to rebound. Mr. Bergsten said he was optimistic that foreign growth would be sufficient to raise imports of American goods and that United States companies, facing weak demand at home and benefiting from a low dollar, would be driven to exploit markets overseas.
Government purchases also helped to minimize the decline in G.N.P. in the last quarter, but this was partly offset by increased military purchases overseas, which raised imports. Thus, the deployment in the Persian Gulf "had little impact" on G.N.P., the Commerce Department said.
When asked about the economic effect of the war, Mr. Darby ventured that while new uncertainty was causing a "holding back" among consumers, this would be countered by higher military spending. "How these balance out is not clear," he said.
 
 Personal Consumption Down
 Real personal consumption fell at a rate of 3.1 percent, today's report also showed, with durable goods down 8.6 percent, nondurables down 5.8 percent and services up seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Housing fell at a 15.4 percent rate, nonresidential fixed investment at 4.6 percent and imports at 6.3 percent. Exports, however, rose at a 7.8 percent rate for the quarter and Government purchases rose 4.9 percent.
Real final sales edged down one-tenth of 1 percent, the report said.
Inflation, as measured by the fixed-weight price index that assumes no change in the composition of output, ran at a moderate 4.1 percent rate in the quarter, slightly below the 4.2 percent of the third quarter. The implicit price deflator, which takes account of changed production patterns, fell to 2.8 percent, from 3.7 percent.
In current dollars, rather than in constant 1982 dollars, G.N.P. rose three-tenths of 1 percent, compared with 5.3 percent in the third quarter.
The savings rate -- personal savings as a percentage of disposable personal income -- was essentially unchanged at 4.1 percent last quarter.

HEADLINE: $56 Million Loss at Texas Instruments

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Jan. 25

 BODY:
Texas Instruments Inc. said today that it had lost $56 million in the fourth quarter, as demand for computer chips remained depressed and prices continued to fall. The company's chairman, Jerry R. Junkins, indicated the loss would widen in the current quarter.
"We expect the pressure on financial results to become more intense in the near term," he said. Revenues in the fourth quarter were up 2.3 percent, to $1.76 billion from $1.72 billion. In the 1989 quarter, earnings were $36 million, or 33 cents a share. 
 The loss for 1990 was $39 million, and it was the first unprofitable year for the company since 1985, when the loss was $140.9 million. Earnings in 1989 were $292 million, or $3.04 a share. For the year the company had revenues of $6.57 billion, up less than 1 percent from 1989's $6.52 billion. Share Price Off $3
The size of the fourth-quarter loss and Mr. Junkins's comment disappointed Wall Street, where Texas Instruments' share price fell $3, to $34.625, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Prices for high-volume chips made by Texas Instruments and several of its Asian rivals plummeted as the American economy weakened in the second half of the year.
For example, chips with a million characters of memory -- used in increasingly huge quantities in computers, cars and electronics -- fell in price to $3.50 each in early December, from $6 early in the year, according to In-Stat Inc., a research firm in Scottsdale, Ariz.
Texas Instruments continued its heavy spending to complete new chip-making plants and to finance research, but it slashed 1,600 jobs from slowing military operations. Mr. Junkins said military orders could increase in the months ahead because of the gulf war but that the trend in military sales was downward. The company makes a laser-guided bomb, the Paveway, and a high-speed anti-radiation missile, called the HARM, used by the American-led coalition against Iraq.
 
Japanese License Deal
 Texas Instruments also said today that it had completed a patent-licensing pact with the Oki Electric Industry Company, a Japanese concern. As in earlier deals with the Toshiba Corporation and Samsung Electronics, Texas Instruments did not disclose the terms. It did say that it expected that royalty payments with the three companies would "greatly exceed" yearly amounts from past agreements. Royalty income in 1990 was $172 million, compared with $165 million in 1989.
Some analysts had estimated that the licensing pacts Texas Instruments has completed or negotiated since 1987 with Asian chip makers could bring more than $4 billion in royalty income through 2001. Mr. Junkins's warning of larger losses ahead was a hint that those estimates were too high, said James L. Barlage, a semiconductor analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company.
Sales could improve quickly if the economy picked up, Mr. Junkins said, because inventory levels among computer chip customers were low. Demand should rebound later in the year and into 1992, but for now, demand from electronics manufacturers, especially computer companies, was sluggish, he said.

HEADLINE: Administration Foresees a Deficit In Bank Insurance Fund by 1992

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
Raising the specter of another huge taxpayer bailout, the White House has estimated that the program that insures bank deposits will show a deficit sometime next year, Government officials said today. And after that, they said, the hole will only grow deeper.
The projection by the Office of Management and Budget, made in the budget request the White House will send to Congress on Feb. 4, is the first official estimate to become public that suggests that the bank insurance fund could be insolvent as early as 1992. The White House projection is that by the end of next year, the fund will have a deficit of $4 billion and that by 1995 the shortfall will be $23 billion. 
 A taxpayer rescue could be averted through increased industry contributions, but the insurance fund's troubles would still be felt by bank depositors and other customers through increased fees and lower rates paid on deposits.
The fund has posted three consecutive years of losses, and is now at its lowest ratio of insurance to deposits since its creation in 1934. Because of the growing number of failures of large banks, the fund is expected to show record losses for both last year and this year, totaling $9 billion. That would leave it with about $4 billion by the end of this year.
 
Fears of Another Bailout
 Administration officials have struggled in recent months to distinguish the plight of the fund and the commercial banking industry from that of the nation's savings and loans. The bailout of that industry could cost taxpayers as much as $500 billion over 40 years. But the latest estimates on the bank fund and the failure of the banking industry to agree on a solution provide the strongest indication so far that a bailout to protect bank deposits may also be needed.
"The Treasury is looking at a budget that has a black hole and saying our first job is to fill that black hole," a bank lobbyist said. "If the economy and the real estate markets do not turn around soon, then it is clear we will not be able to make up the difference."
Industry representatives have been meeting with regulators and Treasury officials this week to try to find a way to rebuild the insurance fund through industry contributions in a way that would not cripple banks, many of which have been posting anemic profits.
"They are still far from any agreement," said L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. He added that within the next month, the F.D.I.C. would probably be considering another increase in the premiums that banks pay to the insurance fund.
 
 Rising Premiums
 On Jan. 1, the premium paid by banks to the fund rose to 19.5 cents for every $100 in deposits, from 12 cents. Lobbyists are predicting that it could soon be increased again, to at least 23 cents. For the first nine months of 1990, the industry earned about 60 cents for each $100 in deposits.
The White House estimate is based on the expectation that the premium will increase to 23 cents, an 18 percent jump over the current payments and a 92 percent rise over the 12 cents paid last year. Its projections for losses are based upon an economic model that compares the capital and quality of assets of banks with the trends shown by similar institutions that failed.
A similar method has been used by the Congressional Budget Office, which will present its latest forecasts on the health of the insurance fund at a Congressional hearing on Tuesday. The budget office projection is also expected to show a deficit, even assuming an increase in industry contributions.
Mr. Seidman said the F.D.I.C. was in the process of calculating how it would fare in 1992, and he questioned the reliability of long-range forecasts. Within the last year, the F.D.I.C. has been forced several times to increase its estimates of the amount it expected to lose.
The Administration is preparing to release its proposals for overhauling the banking industry next week, shortly after the President's State of the Union address on Tuesday.
 
 Activities Are Restricted
 The proposals will call for the elimination of barriers that have prevented the merger of commercial and investment banks, have sharply limited interstate banking and have prohibited industrial enterprises from owning commercial banks. The Administration will also recommend a significant reorganization of the regulatory structure that oversees banks and savings associations.
But officials said today that the package might not include specific details on reorganizing the bank insurance fund because bank trade groups in Washington had been unable to agree among themselves on how to proceed.
A senior official at the Treasury Department said that despite the disagreements, the Administration would support some significant principles in next week's report.
"We think our plan ought to take care of the future and rely on the industry," said the official, who insisted on anonymity. "But it ought not break the backs of the banks."
"It ought to have the industry's leadership behind it, but that is complicated to achieve," the official continued. "To bring together an industry as diverse as banking is a very, very tough job."
 
 Sizing Up the Contributions
 The official said the Treasury Department did not know how much the industry would be able to contribute without damaging some banks and leading to sizable failures.
One proposal under discussion is for banks that are more secure to set up a fund to invest in weaker institutions. But officials and industry representatives said there were substantial disagreements over the size of such a fund and its structure. Of particular concern to some banks, especially the smaller ones, is whether the fund would be used only to prop up the larger institutions.
Another proposal being discussed is the issuing of zero-coupon bonds backed by bank assets to raise $25 billion.

HEADLINE: Carter Hawley Cuts Nearly 100

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 25

 BODY:
Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. said it had dismissed nearly 100 workers after failing to achieve enough job cuts through attrition. In October, the Los Angeles-based retailer cut 350 workers and said it would eliminate another 650 jobs by leaving openings unfilled. But the level of attrition was low because of the uncertainties of recession and the Persian Gulf crisis, forcing this week's action, a company spokesman, Bill Dombrowski, said.
The department store operator suffered a loss of $14.9 million in its first quarter, which ended on Nov. 3, after losing $9.5 million in the previous fiscal year. The company, which operates Broadway, Weinstocks and Emporium stores in California and the West, recently sold its Thalhimer division for $325 million.

Avery Charge Of $85 Million

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 25

 BODY:
The Avery Dennison Corporation, an office and industrial products company formed three months ago through the merger of Avery International and Dennison Manufacturing, said today that it would take an $85 million charge against fourth-quarter earnings to cover the cost of job cutbacks and other changes.
The changes, which include eliminating 700 to 900 jobs in the next 18 months, will result in a loss for the quarter. 
 Avery Dennison, which is based in Pasadena, Calif., said it had been hurt by the slowing economy and had unexpectedly weak profits from its Dennison operations.
The company said it was realigning several businesses and would sell off some small operations besides eliminating jobs. The $85 million charge comes in addition to a $14 million charge covering merger expenses.
The restructuring charge will reduce net income by about $52 million, resulting in a quarterly loss. The company predicted full-year earnings will be about 10 cents a share.
Avery Dennison's stock slipped 25 cents today, to $20, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Treasuries Unsettled by G.N.P. Data

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
The Treasury securities market was unsettled yesterday by a smaller-than-expected decline in the nation's gross national product and the erratic behavior of the interbank lending rates in recent days, which suggested that banks have become reluctant to lend reserves to other banks, or even to dealers.
At the opening, the Treasury debt market reacted negatively to the Government's report of a 2.1 percent decline in the total output of goods and services in the last quarter of 1990. This was much less of a decline than most estimates had suggested. 
 Because the market in fixed-income debt thrives on negative economic news, the G.N.P. report caused selling of Treasury debt issues. Also weighing on the bond market, which always fears any development that could stimulate inflation and higher interest rates, was the persistent high level of the rate that banks charge one another for temporary loans.
 
Fed Intervened at Midday
 Despite another move by the Federal Reserve to add reserves to the banking system, the interbank lending rate soared as high as 9 percent just before the close. The funds rate was at 7 percent, or a quarter-point above the Fed's perceived target, when the central bank intervened at midday to reduced this bedrock cost of credit.
Philip Braverman, senior vice president and chief economist at the DKB Securities Corporation, the domestic arm of the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Tokyo, said some banks had become reluctant to lend reserves to other banks and even to Treasury securities dealers who normally tap the funds market to finance inventory.
What may also be causing banks to hold back their reserves, he continued, is the belief that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may at some point limit its coverage of bank deposits to $100,000 for each individual Social Security number.
"When this happens, we can expect a massive outflow of funds from banks by individuals and all kinds of other depositors with more than one account," Mr. Braverman said. "We can also expect a huge inflow of funds into Treasury securities, which may be one of the few safe investment places left for savings and deposits over $100,000."
 
Quarterly Treasury Refunding
 Government securities dealers were loath to discuss their inventory financing practices or how they plan to finance their purchases at the coming quarterly Treasury refunding, the terms of which are to be announced on Wednesday. The Treasury is expected to auction a record $34 billion of 3- and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds the following week.
In late trading, the Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 8.75 percent issue maturing in August 2020, had recovered a bit to close down 28/ 32, at 105 26/32. This caused its yield to climb to 8.22 percent, from 8.15 percent the day before and 8.17 percent a week ago.
Because of the confusion over the funds rate, dealers said it had a minimal, if any, influence on Treasury bill rates, which are most sensitive to any change in the funds rate. The discount rate on 90-day bills rose five basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 6.18 percent. Six-month bills gained three basis points, at 6.20 perent, and the one-year bills advanced four basis points, to 6.20 percent.
Among other representative Treasury issues traded in the secondary market, the new 7 percent notes of 1993 and 7.5 percent notes of 1996 that were auctioned this week showed little change from the average sales prices.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises on G.N.P. Data; Gold Prices Also Advance

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar edged up in cautious trading yesterday after pessimism about the economy was tempered by a Government report that was better than expected.
Gold was slightly higher, with the price up in New York by $2.70 an ounce, to $375.70 on the Commodity Exchange. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid for gold of $375.50, up $2.75 from late Thursday. 
 Traders said the dollar staged a small early rally when the Commerce Department reported that the United States economy declined at an annual rate of 2.1 percent in the final three months of 1990.
The Government said the gross national product -- the country's total output of goods and services -- dropped at the sharpest rate since a 3.2 percent decline in the third quarter of 1982. Many economists took the report as verification that the nation is in a recession.
But currency analysts said the number was better than the 3 to 4 percent decline that the market had been expecting. "It was a startling bit of news," said Robert Ryan, corporate foreign exchange manager for the Bank of New York. "It dampened the pessimism that was out there."
 
Dealers Wary
 The dollar moved narrowly, a reflection of reluctance among dealers to take major positions without knowing what might happen in the Persian Gulf over the weekend.
"People are playing close to their chest," said Bob Morrissey, senior trader at the Bank of Boston. "If they are running positions over the weekend, they are running much smaller than they usually are.
The dollar rose marginally in New York against the Japanese yen, to 132.55 yen from late Thursday's 132.35. In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.73 yen, to 132.38 yen. Later in London, it was quoted at 132.25 yen.
The dollar also rose slightly against the British pound in New York, where sterling fetched $1.9564, compared with $1.9565 late Thursday. In London, the pound fell to $1.9580, from $1.9600 late Thursday.
And the dollar was up against the German currency, to 1.4910 marks from 1.4868.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday, were: 1.2628 Swiss francs, up from 1.2575; 5.0685 French francs, up from 5.0550; 1,120.50 Italian lire, up from 1,117.75, and 1.1643 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1600.

HEADLINE: For Collection Agencies, These Are Busy Times

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
In the current recession, promptly paying bills -- or not paying bills -- is perhaps the best indicator of an individual's financial health. And the people who best know when and whether bills are being paid these days are the nation's 6,000 collection agencies, the companies that collect debts owed to others. As they tell it, there's been a slowdown in paying bills, which makes them busier than they've ever been before. What's more, today there are more collectors in the field.
"If you have increasing unemployment, folks are going to have less discretionary dollars for bills they have accumulated," said William Mark Edwards, vice president of Credit Bureau Systems, a debt collection agency in Paducah, Ky. "It's going to make it a tougher dollar to collect." Mr. Edwards is also the chairman of the collection service division of Associated Credit Bureaus, a trade association. 
 Larry D. Wages, the president of the Merchants Association of Fresno, Calif., which handles collections among its other activities, said: "As things slow down, merchants and other creditors start looking at their outstandings. They are turning stuff to collection agencies a little bit sooner."
The American Collectors Association, the major trade group for collection agencies, with about 3,500 members, estimates that three million companies in such fields as retailing, banking and health care grant credit to consumers each year. But less than 1 percent of all outstanding debts are turned over collection agencies, the group said.
Mr. Edwards noted that companies that have extended credit now typically call in a commercial collection agency when payments are three to four months past due and an outside agency seems to be their only hope of getting any money at all.
"In tough times, most collection agencies will have more listings, but we will not recover as much as in better times," said George Goodyear, the president of Goodyear & Associates, a collection agency in Charlotte, N.C., and the president of the American Collectors Association.
Last year, $72.4 billion worth of debts was listed with collection agencies in the United States, compared with $51.5 billion the previous year, according to the collectors asssocation. But the actual collection rate fell to 18.4 percent of the total amount, compared with 21 percent the previous year..
Collection agencies work on commission, now 25 to 34 percent of the amount collected. Richard W. Gilbert, a senior vice president of Equifax, Inc., the giant Atlanta financial company whose services include bill collection, said that the commission depends on many factors, including the balance due, the length of time the account has been overdue and the type of account.
Since collectors derive income only from the amount they collect, their appetite has been growing as the economy weakened.
"The most common consumer complaint is oral harassment," said Jean Noonan, the associate director for credit practices of the Federal Trade Commission. "Consumers have a right to tell the debt collector to stop contacting them."
Another common complaint, Ms. Noonan said, is so-called third-party contacts, which are illegal. "They can call a relative, neighbor or employer for location information," she said, "but they cannot discuss the debt."
The usual first step taken by collection agencies is to send a form requesting payment, This gives the name of the creditor and the amount owed, and it must advise you of your rights and inform you what to do if you believe that you do not owe the money.
The actions that debt collectors can and cannot take are governed by the Federal Debt Collection Practices Act, which is administered by the F.T.C. But collection agencies do not have to be licensed by the Federal Government.
Among the outlawed collection tactics: calling you at inconvenient or unusual times. That means before 8 A.M. or after 9 P.M., but if you have a good reason -- say, you work at night and sleep during the day -- you can ask to be called at another time.
In addition, collectors are not permitted to threaten, intimidate or make false statements. They cannot, for example, say directly or imply that they are government representatives or that you have committed a crime. They may not send you any material that looks like an official document from a court or government agency. And they may not obtain information under false pretenses, collect more money than is legally due, deposit a postdated check before the date on the checkor hold the debtor up to public ridicule.
If you think that a collector has broken the law, you can, of course, sue the collection agency. If you win, you can receive up to $1,000 in damages plus your legal costs, Ms. Noonan said. And you can complain to your local Better Business Bureau, state Attorney General or to the F.T.C.
You can also sue the collection agency. If you win, you can receive up to $1,000 in damages plus your legal costs, Ms. Noonan said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Called Set to Urge Summit Delay

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
Administration officials said today that the United States intended to inform the Soviet Union on Saturday that because of the crackdown in the Baltics, Washington wants to "postpone" the next summit meeting indefinitly.
The Soviet Foreign Minister, Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, is to meet here on Saturday with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. 
 A senior Administration official said that unless Mr. Bessmertnykh brings some startling and convincing new message about a changed Soviet policy for the Baltics, or possibly concessions that will allow the still uncompleted negotiations for a treaty limiting long-range nuclear weapons to be concluded, he will be told that the Administration wants to postpone the summit meeting, planned for Feb. 11 to 13.
"Unless Bessmerthnykh pulls a rabbit out of a hat, the plan is to postpone," a senior Administration official said.
 
Hoping to Break Deadlock
 One reason American officials in recent days have indicated that they are inclined to postpone the summit may be the hope that this signal would induce the Soviets to break the deadlock in the negotiations for a strategic arms reduction treaty, known as Start.
President Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, had hoped to sign a strategic arms reduction treaty at the February summit. But the two sides have not been able to resolve some highly technical disputes over how to verify certain aspects of the treaty. If Mr. Bush could say he was going to Moscow to sign a treaty that would slash long-range nuclear arsenals by 30 percent, it would be much easier for him to justify the meeting, despite the violence in the Baltics.
But even if such a treaty is possible, the summit meeting would still be jeopardy, officials said.
"It's not only the Baltics that's a problem," an Administration policymaker said. "It is also the idea of the President being in Moscow for three days in the middle of a war."
 
Meeting With Bush on Monday
 A formal announcement about the fate of the summit will be made only on Monday, after Mr. Bessmertnykh meets the President at the White House. A cancellation would almost certainly be presented as a "mutual decision," in hopes of lessening the embarrassment and domestic political damage to Mr. Gorbachev.
In a brief news conference Friday, Mr. Bush declined to commit himself, but he gave the most downbeat public assessment yet about the prospects for a summit meeting, in the wake of the recent killing of 19 pro-independence demonstrators by Soviet troops in Latvia andLithuania.
"I am looking forward to the consultations that Secretary Baker will have with Mr. Bessmertnykh," Mr. Bush said. "Mr. Bessmertnykh knows the United States very well, and he knows the difficulties that we have with any use of force in the Baltics. We're going to see how this plays out, and we have an arms control agenda that I want to see fulfilled. But whether it would be ready in time for the meeting as now scheduled, I don't know. We're having some difficulties there, frankly."
Asked whether he now felt it was less important for American-Soviet relations if Mr. Gorbachev survived in office, or if Washington intended to cancel the summit anyway simply because of American outrage over the Baltics, Mr. Bush said:
"I'm disappointed in the Soviet actions in the Baltics because use of force is not the way to resolve that problem. And I've had an opportunity to discuss that with the President, and I know the difficulties that he faces. And I have not lost sight of the fact that Mr. Gorbachev was the catalyst, really, for much of the change that has taken place in Eastern Europe; had a lot to do with the reunification of Germany, a lot to do with common ground in the Persian Gulf."
 
'Great Difficulty' on Baltics
 He then added: "But the problems in the Baltic states, the use of force there, causes us great difficulty. And so the Bessmertnykh-Baker talks will touch on a wide array of issues, some where we have very much common ground, some where we have common objectives that are not fulfilled, and some where we might have clear differences. And at that point, I will take a look again at the whole problem and see what must be done, and I'm sure the Soviets will be doing the same thing."
Mr. Bessmertnykh, a former Ambassador to Washington, will be on his inaugural visit to the United States as Foreign Minister, since he replaced Eduard A. Shevardnadze two weeks ago.
Both the Senate and the House have passed nonbinding resolutions calling on Mr. Gorbachev to halt immediately his use of force in the Baltics, and at a meeting Thursday at the White House between Mr. Bush and Republican Congressional leaders, the President was bluntly warned about the rising sentiment in Congress against his going to Moscow at this time.
The Senate resolution, passed Thursday, appealed to the President to suspend all technical exchanges with the Soviet Union, review all economic aid to Moscow and consider withdrawing Washington's support for Soviet membership in the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The Soviets have already begun drawing the $1 billion in food credits that Mr. Bush extended last month in order to help the country through the winter.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: North Africa;
Pro-Iraq Sentiment Is Increasing in North Africa

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TUNIS, Jan. 23

 BODY:
All along this city's main boulevard, clusters of young men, many of them unemployed, form in front of newsstands and grow angry as they read the latest news from the Persian Gulf war.
"Storm Over a Few Prisoners of War, Silence Over a Genocide," declared the two-inch-tall headline in La Presse, while the front page of Le Temps announced, "Saddam Hussein Proclaims That Iraq Has Not Yet Used All Its Arms." 
 "We're all for Saddam," said Chadli Braham, one of the angry young men hanging out on the boulevard. "I'm absolutely sure that Saddam is going to win. America isn't fighting just 17 million Iraqis; it's fighting hundreds of millions of Arabs. We have God on our side."
Although Tunisia has long been Washington's best friend in the Arab world, it has been hard to detect much good will here -- or in much of North Africa -- toward the United States since the American-led coalition began bombing Iraq last week. Through protest marches, officials' statements and harsh newspaper commentaries, Tunisia has joined other North African countries, including Algeria and Mauritania, in lashing out against the United States and its military partners.
 
Government Condemns Bombing
 North Africa's people, poor and long angry about the plight of the Palestinians, overwhelmingly support the Iraqi leader's defiance of the West. Tunisia's Government, like Algeria's, has condemned the bombing of Iraq, both in deference to the passions so evident on the street and in part to keep the fundamentalist opposition from stealing the issue.
"If the people are with Saddam, it is because he is challenging the Western world," a senior Tunisian official said. "He is a symbol of pride. Arab people feel humiliated, especially regarding Israel and the lack of progress of the intifada. The Arabs are hoping that through Saddam they will regain a sense of dignity."
The Tunisian Government has begun a campaign to collect blood for its "Iraqi brothers." In Morocco, opposition leaders are calling on King Hassan II to withdraw the nation's 1,500 troops in Saudi Arabia, saying they are not defending Arabs, but carrying out a "Zionist plan" against Iraq.
In Mauritania, the police fired tear gas to break up a rally of 20,000 demonstrators who marched on the American and French Embassies after Friday prayers. Heeding the advice of the Government, almost 1,000 Westerners, most of them French, have left their homes to camp out at the heavily protected French Embassy.
 
Many Seek to Enlist for Iraq
 As war fever is sweeping Algeria, hundreds of young men have sought to enlist to fight on Iraq's side. The Government, after speaking softly and trying to mediate in the gulf crisis, has begun competing with the fundamentalist opposition for the most fiery pro-Iraqi, anti-American polemics.
While the Algerian opposition, the Front for Islamic Salvation, called for a trade embargo against Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the Government's newspaper said, "The battle that has begun in the gulf is not Iraq's, but that of all the Arab and Muslim countries, against the great Western powers: the United States, Britain, France and the West's creature, Israel."
Since the State Department warned of possible danger in North Africa last week after the war began, thousands of Americans and other Westerners have left the region. For the last week, the Tunisian Government has protected the American Embassy with tanks, machine gun-armed soldiers and five-foot-tall spirals of barbed wire.
"It's wrong for a heavyweight like the United States to hammer on a lightweight like Iraq," said Abbes Agha, who owns a men's wear shop. "America has dropped more bomb tonnage on Iraq than was dropped on Hiroshima. The Americans are proud of that, but I'd say that's nothing to be proud of."
 
Hypocrisy Is Seen
 Mr. Agha added that he thought Washington was hypocritical to go to war to end Iraq's occupation of Kuwait while doing little about Israel's occcupation of Palestinian lands. "Whatever warm feelings Tunisians had toward America are fast dissipating," he said.
From the start, the Tunisian Government, unlike many of its people, criticized Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. But the Government now says the bombing campaign against Iraq goes beyond what the United Nations Security Council approved.
"We're witnessing the total destruction of Iraq's industrial and economic potential and not the liberation of Kuwait," the Tunisian Foreign Minister, Habib Boulares, said in a radio interview. This "won't fail to have grave consequences for the security and interests of the entire Arab nation."
"Tunisians are very angry inside about the war, but things are relatively quiet because the Government has made it clear that it will clamp down," a teacher said.
 
Fighting Against the Rich
 A major reason most Tunisians, Algerians and Moroccans back Mr. Hussein is they see him as their brother in fighting against the rich. The masses of people have few kind words for Kuwait and were not sad that Iraq gobbled it up.
"It's not fair that the Kuwaitis were building million-dollar castles and investing billions of dollars abroad when most of the Arab world has to eat crumbs," said Fathi Bouguerra, a taxi driver.
The people here also have little sympathy for the Saudi monarchy, seeing it as a plutocratic elite that cares little for the Arab poor. In their view, the monarchy betrayed the Arab world by inviting in Westerners to help defend it, rather than finding an Arab solution to the crisis.
The region has also embraced the Iraqi leader because he has struck out against Israel and spoken out for the Palestinians.
"You can't imagine how great our happiness was when Scuds landed in Israel," a Tunisian official said. "The fact that he showed Israel could be struck put pride in our hearts. It showed the Arab world could strike a blow against Israel."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Religious Leaders;
Cardinal Says Iraqi's Acts Prove Bush Right

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
Saying that prompt military action in the Persian Gulf now appears to have been necessary, Bernard Cardinal Law of Boston has become the highest-ranking Roman Catholic prelate in the nation to offer support for President Bush's position.
In a column published yesterday in the weekly newspaper of the Boston Archdiocese, Cardinal Law said President Saddam Hussein's conduct since Jan. 15, the United Nations-imposed deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, showed that postponing military action "could have played to his advantage." 
 "The allies were faced with a regrettable dilemma," the Cardinal wrote. "Even as we echo the prayer of Pope Paul VI, 'No more war, war never again,' with heavy hearts we realize that such a prayer is not fulfilled at the price of granting tyrants and aggressors an open field to achieve unjust ends."
Although the nation's Roman Catholic hierarchy had urged continued reliance on economic sanctions, since the outbreak of fighting individual bishops have taken positions ranging from outright condemnation of the war to stances similar to that of Cardinal Law.
On Jan. 17, the president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, Archbishop Daniel E. Pilarczyk of Cincinnati, said, "History will judge whether or when this war should have been launched." The Archbishop emphasized that moral limits had to be respected in combat.
And last Sunday, James Cardinal Hickey of Washington said Catholic "moral tradition clearly does not sustain peace at any price." He cited the conclusion of "many well-informed persons" that "armed intervention has become a necessity to resist aggression."
But unlike Cardinal Law, Cardinal Hickey did not quite say he had personally reached the conclusion that American military action had been necessary now.
Within the spectrum of Catholic bishops' opinion, two trends are becoming discernible. Some bishops are insisting that because, in their judgment, economic and diplomatic means for obtaining a settlement had not been exhausted the Persian Gulf war did not meet the requirement in Catholic teaching that a war can be just only if undertaken as a last resort.
"I am not convinced that this is a war of last resort," Archbishop Francis T. Hurley of Anchorage said Jan. 17. "It is a war without glory."
Prelates like Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen of Seattle and Bishop Walter Sullivan of Richmond have also continued to challenge any need for war.
 
Moral Scrutiny of Fight
 But many other bishops, following Archbishop Pilarczyk's lead, are taking the fact of the war as a starting point and concentrating on moral scrutiny of the way it is fought. John Cardinal O'Connor of New York and Archbishop John R. Quinn of San Francisco, for example, have warned against direct attacks on civilian populations.
At an antiwar demonstration at the White House last Wednesday, Auxiliary Bishop Thomas Gumbleton of Detroit, president of Pax Christi U.S.A., a Catholic antiwar group, expressed disappointment with the recent statements of many fellow bishops.
Since the war began, he said, their attitude has been "to get behind the President and be careful not to divide the Catholic community." Bishop Gumbleton has said he hopes to encourage conscientious objection among military people.

HEADLINE: State Capitals Show Population Gains

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
Expanding employment in state government and higher education in the 1980's fueled population gains in college towns and state capitals, according to 1990 census figures released today.
The population of cities like Lawrence, Kan., home of the University of Kansas; Columbus, Ohio, home of the state government and of Ohio State University, and West Lafayette, Ind., home of Purdue University, gained 20 percent or more even as the states around them stagnated. The new census figures show that North Dakota, for example, lost 1.7 percent of its population, but its capital, Bismarck, gained 10.7 percent. 
 This trend did not hold true in older cities in the East that are state capitals, like Boston or Atlanta. But generally, said John Connally, an assistant director of the Census Bureau, "You get one star if you have a state capital, two if you have a college or university, and three if there's a major medical center there."
In their overall depiction of the country, the new numbers reflected trends long tracked by demographers, most dramatically the population gain of 6 million in population registered by California, much of that on the immigrant- and industry-rich southern coast.
 
Decline of Northern Cities
 The new numbers also demonstrated anew the decline of many Northern urban centers, a decline now spreading to the inner suburbs of cities like New York, Washington and Detroit. And they reflected the continued decline of old industrial cities like Gary, Ind., which lost 26 percent of its population in the 1980's, and the quick expansion of suburban and satellite communities on the edges of metropolitan areas from Frederick County in Maryland to Orange County in California.
But, while the new figures provide a thorough confirmation of some of the population trends of the decade, particularly the impact that an influx of 7 to 9 million Latin American, Asian and European immigrants has had on the United States in the 1980's, demographers combing through the numbers today found other trends that have gone relatively unnoticed. Among them are these:
*Older industrial cities in the South are joining their Northern counterparts in the cycle of decline. Atlanta, Birmingham, Ala., Macon, Ga., Chattanooga and Knoxville, Tenn., were among the Southern cities losing population. "About 25 percent of all the big cities lost, and half of those that lost were in the South," said William O'Hare, director of policy studies for the Population Reference Bureau, a Washington-based research organization.
*Immigration has been a bulwark against decline in other major cities, he said, including Miami, New York and New Jersey communities like Elizabeth and Jersey City, both of which registered modest population gains of 2 to 4 percent. In the more suburban areas of New Jersey like Gloucester, Hunterdon and Middlesex counties, a combination of expanding suburbs and thousands of immigrants from India, China, the Philippines and the Dominican Republic pushed growth rates to near 15 percent, triple the state's growth rate.
*California's growth, while the best-told story of the 1990 census, continued to generate astonishing statistics: of the 29 cities that surpassed the population mark of 100,000 for the first time, 18 were in California. Seven of the 10 fastest growing cities in the 100,000-plus group were in Southern California, including Chula Vista, Bakersfield, Irvine, Oceanside and Escondido. One American in eight now lives in California.
*In other states with big gains, like Texas and Florida, there was a mixture of growth and decline, although growth predominated. Texas, whose population swings tracked the roller-coaster fortunes of the oil industry, still had two cities among the 10 fastest population gainers -- Plano and Arlington, both suburbs of Dallas. Austin, the state capital, gained 35 percent, a rate double that of the state as a whole.
*The changes in rural America were more dramatic than earlier indications had shown. Half of all rural counties lost population in an exodus of more than two million people from dwindling mining communities in Wyoming and Kentucky, from cotton and catfish farms of the Mississippi Delta and from parched farms on the Great Plains, according to Calvin Beale, a demographer for the Department of Agriculture.
 
Move to Rural Areas
 But while these areas, which encompass more than a million square miles, emptied out, one-third of the nation's rural counties were growing quickly. Ocean-view communities, mountain resorts and farm land an hour's commute from urban areas were booming with long-distance commuters, vacationers and retired people.
In an article awaiting publication, Mr. Beale says the movement of retired people to rural areas is so pronounced that 20 percent of all rural counties may now be retirement areas. These counties grew by 15 percent in the 1980's, compared with a national growth rate of 10.2 percent.
About two-thirds of all state capitals gained population. Those that lost were largely in the East, including Albany, Harrisburg, Pa., Columbia, S.C., Augusta, Me., Trenton, Charleston, W.Va., and Richmond. Capitals that were both the seat of government and of a state university, like Madison, Wis., and Columbus, Ohio, which each grew 12 percent, far outstripped their states' growth.
State government experts and private statisticians say the population growth in state capitals parallels the 16.3 percent growth in state employment over the decade. And they say it may be a fragile trend, as many states wrestle with intractable budget deficits because of the current recession.
 
Heyday in State Capitals
 The 1990 census may be a picture of a heyday in state capitals that is now over, said Edward J. Spar, president of Market Statistics, a New York marketing and demographic analysis firm.
"The figures are a wonderful reflection of the Federal Government pushing more and more down to the states, which have to increase staff to handle the burden," said Mr. Spar. "But you can't project this data into the future with the current recession."
The similar, though less dramatic, boom in college communities may be tempered by declining numbers of college-age students as well as by shrinking budgets in the next few years. But in the 1980's, college towns in many states were population meccas. The population of Norman, Okla., seat of the University of Oklahoma, grew by nearly 18 percent, while the state as a whole grew by 4.2 percent.
Austin, Tex., benefited both by the presence of the state capital and the state university, but its 35 percent population growth rate was also attributable to the annexation of new land. Immigration was apparently an important factor pushing up the population rate in South Texas -- four counties bordering the Rio Grande showed gains of 34 percent to 48 percent.
Occasionally, a single company turned a city around. Although South Dakota had the same problems as its neighbors on the Great Plains, Sioux Falls, now home to the billing operation of Citibank MasterCard, went from a population of 81,000 to 101,000, a 24 percent increase.

HEADLINE: Entire Staff Is Laid Off From Operation PUSH

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 25

 BODY:
Operation PUSH, the grassroots firebrand of civil rights organizations and brainchild of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, has been searching for an identity since its charismatic founder left Chicago for Washington more than a year ago. Now the group is in such deep financial trouble that this week laid off its entire staff of 12.
The action came six months after the organization began a boycott of Nike Inc., the athletic shoe and apparel company, a protest that never appeared to catch on and had little apparent effect on the company's sales. The company did hire more minority managers after PUSH's action. 
 Political observers here say that, despite the efforts of the organization's energetic new leader, the Rev. Tyrone Crider, PUSH has not been able to gain momentum without Mr. Jackson, whose image still appears in posters and photographs thoughout the organization's South Side offices. They say the 20-year-old organization's financial troubles reflect a loss of enthusiasm that might be expected during a major transition.
 
'Natural Pangs of Transition'
 "The organization is changing, but it hasn't died," said Robert Starks, an associate professor of politcal science at Northeastern Illinois University. "It has maintained its tradition of fighting injustice. These are the natural pangs of transition."
But the current leaders at PUSH say that the nation's recession has hurt its poor and working-class membership and thus dues and donations, its major sources of revenue, were down.
"Sears just laid off 21,000 people, T.W.A. just laid off however many thousands, and Eastern closed down completely," said the Rev. Willie Barrow, vice chairman at PUSH. "We're not immune. When America catches a cold, black people catch pneumonia."
PUSH staff members did not receive a paycheck this week and were laid off temporarily until the group's financial situation improves, PUSH officials said. Most of the employees are now working on a volunteer basis.
 
A Modest Operation
 "They've been coming in everyday," Ms. Barrow said. "Some of them are single mothers and we've told them, 'We'll help you find something else.' We may be financially handicapped but not morally bankrupt."
PUSH has always been a loosely run organization of mostly volunteers and a small staff that works out of a modest complex. On the whole, the group is meagerly run. "We pay just enough people to open the doors and make sure the telephones get answered," Ms. Barrow said.
But the group fell into fiscal chaos in the mid-1980's, when it ran so deeply into debt that its auditor warned it might not be able to continue operating. In 1987, the Justice Department accused the group of misspending or improperly accounting for about $1.4 million in Federal grants for its education and job-training program. The dispute was settled, with PUSH agreeing to pay back about half the money.
 
Fund Raising Is Planned
 PUSH is preparing for a major fundraising drive. The announcement of the layoffs prompted an outpouring of support and offers for money from people who themselves have turned to PUSH. For years many of them have come for inspiration during its Saturday morning services and for help in getting things from job referrals to voter registration cards.
Members are expected to address the organization's finances at its meeting on Saturday.
What is unclear is the role that Mr. Jackson may play in financially rehabilitating his longtime bailiwick. He has been officially removed from the day-to-day operations since he began his Presidential campaign in 1984. But did not appear to cut the umbilical cord until he moved to Washington in 1989.
Frank Watkins, Mr. Jackson's spokesman, said that Mr. Jackson was traveling and unavailable for comment, but was aware of the layoffs.
Mr. Watkins said that the group had never been in such financial trouble. "There may have been a time or two when we cut back a staff member or two, but I'm sure there wasn't anything like this," Mr. Watkins said.
Ms. Barrow hinted that she hoped Mr. Jackson would help out. "If you're a real good parent, you never deny your child," she said.

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Moves to Change Environment Priorities

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
The Environmental Protection Agency took to Congress today its campaign to reassess national environmental priorities that the agency's leader says are sometimes misplaced.
The campaign won the support of Senators from both parties on its broad objectives but also evoked misgivings and skepticism about whether scientists know enough to rank environmental risks accurately. 
 William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the agency, told the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works that what scientists regarded as the most serious environmental threats were often different from those that excited the public and stimulated Congressional action.
For example, he said, a study by a board of scientists who advise the agency has determined that global warming caused by gases from human activity is among the highest environmental risks, while hazardous waste is among the lowest. But he said people rated them the other way around in public opinion surveys, placing hazardous waste as a top threat and relegating global warming to a spot far down the list of concerns.
 
Push for National Debate
 Mr. Reilly has said he is seeking to prompt a national debate on the subject. It is part of an effort by his agency to take a central role in shaping a coherent, long-term environmental policy based on scientific assessments of risk. In the past, he has acknowledged, the agency has mostly reacted to public and Congressional environmental concerns on a case-by-case basis. Those concerns can differ from scientists' long-term view because they are often a reaction to a crisis, for example, when there is a big oil spill or release of toxic chemicals.
Until recently, Mr. Reilly told the Senate committee, "questions of relative seriousness have not been asked."
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the committee, said that he was "enormously heartened" by the direction the agency was taking and that its attempt to get the nation to re-examine priorities could "define the next stage in this whole area of public policy."
But Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, said the establishment of environmental priorities "certainly sounds good" but it "might be easier said than done." The scientists who advised the E.P.A. acknowledged that much information was lacking about some environmental risks, Mr. Metzenbaum said, adding, "Frankly, I don't find that very reassuring."
And Senator Dave Durenberger, Republican of Minnesota, said, "I don't think we know enough to make risk judgments with any confidence."
 
Panel's High-Risk List
 At the center of the debate is a report issued last fall by the E.P.A. Science Advisory Board, a group of independent scientists who advise the agency. In addition to destruction of habitats and global warming, the group's list of high-risk ecological threats includes depletion of the ozone layer that protects the earth from harmful solar radiation, the extinction of species and loss of biological diversity.
Medium-risk threats on the list included herbicides and pesticides, acid rain, pollution of surface water and airborne toxic substances. Relatively low-risk problems included oil spills, the escape of radioactive materials into the environment and groundwater pollution, which can be caused by hazardous wastes and leaking underground storage tanks.
The group also identified these high-ranking environmental risks to human health: indoor and outdoor air pollution, the exposure of workers to chemicals and pollution of drinking water. Citing inadequate data, the group declined to go any further in ranking environmental health risks.
The panel also urged that the E.P.A. concentrate more than it has on the protection of natural ecosystems. "The E.P.A. and the nation should attach as much importance to reducing ecological risk as to reducing human health risks," Dr. Raymond C. Loehr of the University of Texas, co-chairman of the science advisory panel, told the Senate committee. He said there was a vital long-term interaction between a healthy environment, sustainable economies and human health.
 
The Big Picture
 He said the panel judged and ranked environmental risks on the basis of how severe their effects could be, how many people and how broad a geographical area they could affect and how long it might take to reverse their ill effects.
Mr. Reilly said in a statement to the committee that he did not "want to minimize the importance of other problems that were not ranked high, like oil spills," adding, "These problems can cause real damage." But he emphasized, "They are typically in a different league compared to some of our other problems, such as stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change, which have the potential to affect life everywhere, and for many years to come."
In describing what he considers his agency's more active role in shaping policy rather than just responding to episodic environmental crises and concerns, he cited its role in working toward treaties on global warming and reforestation and its work on the phasing out of chemicals that destroy the ozone layer, on the planting of trees, the protection of the African elephant and debt-for-nature swaps.

HEADLINE: Germany's Ostrich-Politik

 BODY:
The new world order begins with a huge hole in the center of Europe. Germany, now Europe's most important state, is trying to minimize its involvement in the gulf war, citing the country's militarist legacy. It would be more constructive to redeem past errors by making collective security more truly collective, providing a real alternative to superpower policing of global crises.
Germany has not stayed entirely aloof from the gulf conflict. It joined the diplomatic coalition condemning Iraq's aggression. It pledged $2.2 billion to support allied efforts last fall, and now, under pressure, weighs a substantial increase. This week it offered Israel Patriot missiles and $165 million in emergency aid. But all this falls short of what might be expected from Europe's richest economy. 
 Germany's postwar Constitution prohibits offensive use of the country's military forces, but also provides for participation in "a system of mutual collective security." That includes NATO and, arguably, the United Nations-sponsored action in the gulf. Yet Chancellor Helmut Kohl has refused to acknowledge Germany's obligation, under Article 5 of the NATO treaty, to treat any attack on Turkey as an attack on NATO as a whole. And the Kohl Government interprets the Constitution as barring any direct German military role in the gulf.
Mr. Kohl's reticence is easy to understand. Polls show 75 percent of Germans opposed to military participation in the war. Peace demonstrations have drawn wide support. The peace issue helped left-wing parties win a key state election this week.
Many demonstrators act as if allied military action against Iraq is a replay of the Vietnam War. It's not. For one, Saddam Hussein bears direct responsibility for triggering this crisis with his invasion and sack of Kuwait. More to the point, the allied coalition, though assembled and commanded by Americans, is remarkably broad, and would be broader still if Germany played a larger part.
Further, German businessmen, like other Europeans, have some responsibility for helping Saddam Hussein build his war machine. German companies sold biological and chemical weapons components to Iraq, helped increase the range of its Scud missiles and built a luxurious Presidential bunker designed to survive aerial attack.
Recent history has left Germans skeptical of military solutions and involvements far from their fatherland. Germans worry more about instability in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union than about who will sell them oil in the Persian Gulf. And reunification costs leave little budgetary slack.
Yet history is the strongest reason for Germany to become more actively involved. Before 1945, Germany's inability to find a constructive international role commensurate with its economic strength brought terrible grief. In the postwar years, West Germany, through integration with NATO and the European Community, became a valued and respected partner.
A united Germany can now build on that legacy of cooperation. It can add its hard-won sense of perspective and caution to coalition debates and draw strength from its partners to face uncertainties in the east.

HEADLINE: Why Library Funds Shouldn't Be Cut

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Thus far this fiscal year, the Queens Borough Public Library has absorbed a cut of $2.4 million in New York City funds. Now, the library is faced with an additional cut of $2.1 million -- bringing the total to about $4.5 million, or 12.15 percent of its city budget. We are mindful of the city's problems. But we must cite two reasons why City Hall must reconsider.
One is the high illiteracy rate in New York and across the country, a matter of deep concern for many businesses in their search for qualified personnel. Another is that less than half the city's public school students read at or above grade level.
The Queens Borough Public Library and its counterparts in Manhattan and Brooklyn address these problems through adult literacy programs that serve many thousands and services that encourage reading by students of all ages.
Libraries, then, are making a tremendous contribution to the economic as well as to the educational and cultural life of the city. Any further cuts in funds could cause irreparable damage to our efforts to improve the quality of life for vast numbers of citizens.

HEADLINE: Oil Prices and Profits: What Goes Up . . .

BYLINE: By Mark Green; Mark Green is New York City's Commissioner of Consumer Affairs.

 BODY:
Next to blood and water, gasoline is the most important liquid for Americans. So they wonder why the combination of plunging crude oil prices and ballooning petroleum industry profits isn't leading to a rollback of gasoline prices, which could help jump-start the stalled economy.
And that's why Congress should insist on restoring a windfall profits tax if the industry, which is announcing record profits this week, doesn't immediately start cutting prices. With Americans sacrificing in the Persian Gulf, the public won't tolerate Big Oil unpatriotically profiteering from the crisis.
 That was quickly evident when consumers became outraged by the price spike that began after Aug. 2, when Iraq seized Kuwait. In New York City, the average pump price rose from $1.19 per gallon of regular gasoline in July to $1.54 in December (this week it is $1.39). The cost of filling up a 15-gallon tank rose from $17.85 to $23.10. Put another way, the extra outlay for gasoline and home heating oil for consumers, business and government in the five boroughs would be $1 billion over a year -- enough to fund the "Safe Streets, Safe City" police plan for three years. 
 The American Petroleum Institute argues that the "free market," not oil firms, set the price, and that oil companies had to keep pump prices high to compensate for the months they lagged behind higher crude oil prices. Besides being mutually exclusive, these alibis lag behind reality.
As for the "free market," Daniel Yergin's "The Prize" explains how cartels -- Big Oil, from 1928 to 1973; OPEC, since 1973 -- created anticompetitive habits that led to nonmarket prices. Nor is it persuasive to say the industry is passing on the "replacement costs" of the next barrel of crude, as set by the commodities market. Only 1 percent of all crude used in the U.S. is traded on the crude oil futures market. Besides, oil firms hold more than two-thirds of the contracts traded there: An infant is more independent of its parents than this market is from oil companies.
Second, there was no "lag." While crude oil prices fell 27 percent fromJanuary through June ($20.64 to $14.98 per barrel), the average price of regular unleaded gasoline rose 4 percent ($1.04 to $1.08). Since the industry raises pump prices when crude prices go both down and up, this pricing theory appears to be heads-we-win-tails-you-lose.
While nearly 100 percent of the crude oil and wholesale gasoline price increases since August have evaporated, retail price increases have fallen back by only half. Why? Profiteering by procrastination. Firms quick to increase pump prices are slower to lower them because delay means huge profits by exploiting the difference between low crude oil costs and high consumer prices.
The proof? This week, the top oil companies are reporting fourth-quarter profits nearly double those of 1989. As profit shoots up, it shoots down the argument for high consumer prices.
A truly free market based on old-fashioned criteria of supply and demand should lead to a retail rollback to pre-August prices. Since supplies are ample because of Saudi overproduction, since there seems to be no plausible Iraqi threat to Saudi oil facilities, since President Bush has begun tapping the 600 million barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve and since consumer demand is down and wholesale gasoline prices are now below pre-invasion levels (even counting December's nickel-a-gallon gasoline tax), oil firms have run out of excuses just as consumers have run out of patience.
Lower prices could help restore consumer confidence, spur more home building and retail buying, lower overall business costs and hasten the recovery by adding a half point of growth to the gross national product. Is Houston listening to America?

HEADLINE: Your Money;
2 Trusts Suitable For Middle Class

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
Trusts, long a favorite financial planning tool of the rich, can also be used advantageously by middle-income people. In recent interviews, two advisers offered trust plans that are particularly appropriate in a sluggish economy.
Douglas S. Brown, a certified public accountant who is president of Sherwood Trust Consultants in Springfield, Mass., described a trust he set up for a client who wanted to supplement the modest retirement benefits provided by his employer. The same approach could be used by many owners or employees of small businesses that have minimal retirement plans, he said, or by people who fear they may lose their jobs before they are vested in a corporate pension plan. 
 And Samuel J. Friedman, senior tax partner in the New York law firm of Hall, Dickler, Lawler, Kent & Friedman, describes how a couple with sizable assets could transfer their vacation house to a trust, enabling them to continue using it and eventually to pass it on to their children without burdensome estate taxes on its appreciated value.
Mr. Brown's client, a 30-year-old man, could have used an individual retirement account to save for his retirement, but at his income level his contributions would not have been tax deductible and would have been limited to $2,000 a year.
By setting up a charitable remainder trust, he can make contributions of any amount he wants, Mr. Brown said. If he contributes $2,500 a year until age 60 -- $75,000 total over 30 years -- and his trustee invested in zero-coupon bonds, assuming a 9 percent annual compounded return, he would have about $350,000 in the trust at retirement age. He can then switch to an income-producing investment, and that income could be used to supplement his company pension plan.Each year he contributes to the trust, he will get a charitable income tax deduction for part of the contribution, Mr. Brown noted, and when he dies, the charity that is to benefit from the trust will receive the principal. Thus he will have financed a sizable charitable gift.
"It is still a novelty idea," Mr. Brown said. But its use may grow "either as a replacement or a supplement to the traditional qualified pension plans," he predicted, because small businesses, in particular, are cutting back on traditional pension plans. One reason is to save money; another is because of tough Federal regulations intended to make sure that benefit plans do not discriminate against lower-paid employees.
Another client, a doctor, told Mr. Brown that he liked the idea because of the flexibility it afforded in contributions from year to year.
"People who do not need the income flow until retirement should structure the investments in the trust so they are not income-producing," he said, suggesting zero-coupon bonds or growth stocks.
Mr. Friedman's plan for the vacation home applies to people whose estates would exceed $600,000 -- the level at which estate taxes start.People with a primary home, an investment portfolio, possibly an interest in a business and a vacation home can easily reach that level.
No estate taxes are due on property left by one spouse to another. But when the surviving spouse dies, leaving the property to children or other heirs, the estate is subject to taxes, which are as high as 55 percent at the Federal level.
A grantor retained interest trust can be created and property transferred to it, though a principal residence is excluded. The grantor retains the right to use the property, and eventually his or her children, as beneficiaries, get the property.
"A house that was worth $400,000 a few years ago might be worth $300,000" in today's market, Mr. Friedman said, making it a good time for the transfer. "Say they retained the right to use it for 10 years," he continued. That might mean the gift to the trust would be worth $100,000 to $120,000, using up that much of the $600,000 that is not subject to gift or estate taxes. But over the long term, houses can be expected to appreciate, and this strategy will shift the appreciation out of the taxable estate.
"It doesn't work with mortgaged property," Mr. Friedman continued, "or where there is equity financing, because payment of the mortgage benefits everyone and could be viewed as additional gifts."
Also, he added, this is not the sort of maneuver to do in isolation. Rather, it should be part of an overall estate plan.
One of the simplest estate planning strategies is giving money away. Individuals are allowed to give up to $10,000 apiece -- $20,000 for couples -- to as many people as they want each year, free of gift and estate taxes. Mr. Friedman said he always advised affluent clients to make such gifts as early in the year as possible, because Congress could restrict it at any time and each year's opportunity expires on Dec. 31.
"You get an idea of how your children will look at money," he said, "a preview of an inheritance."

THE TRUE AND ONLY HEAVEN
Progress and Its Critics.
By Christopher Lasch.
591 pp. New York: W.W. Norton & Company. $25. 
 Sometimes a scholarly work is more important for the questions it raises than the answers it provides. In this provocative, and certain to be controversial, book, Christopher Lasch, a professor of history at the University of Rochester, pursues a fundamental question: "How does it happen that serious people continue to believe in progress, in the face of massive evidence that might have been expected to refute the idea of progress once and for all?" According to Mr. Lasch, despite the shrill and acrimonious conflicts between the left and the right, they share a common belief in the inevitability and desirability of economic and technical development.
However, in "The True and Only Heaven" he maintains that the idea of progress rests on several untenable propositions: that material expectations can be constantly revised, that luxuries can be ceaselessly redefined as necessities, that new groups can be continually incorporated into the culture of consumption and that a global market embracing impoverished populations around the world can be ultimately created. Neither the right nor the left has yet come to grips with an increasingly obvious problem: "the earth's finite resources will not support an indefinite expansion of industrial civilization." Given the present rate of population growth, he argues, an environmental disaster would be created if the Western standard of living were successfully exported to the poorer nations of the world. Moreover, the advanced countries have neither the will today nor the resources to assume such an immense program of development. They cannot even address their own problems of poverty. "In the United States, the richest country in the world," Mr. Lasch writes, "a growing proletariat faces a grim future, and even the middle class has seen its standard of living begin to decline."
Mr. Lasch's critique of the idea of progress has a one-sided focus, however. Except for a brief, vague discussion of the deleterious social and environmental effects that would result from the program of economic growth and unregulated business enterprise advocated by the right, it is the liberal supporters of progressive ideology who are under attack in "The True and Only Heaven." To fully understand Mr. Lasch's concentrated criticism of the left, one has to recognize that his recommended alternative to the idea of progress would be anathema to supporters of liberal ideology -- a return to the moral conservatism of "petty-bourgeois" culture.
Lower-middle-class culture, Mr. Lasch argues, reflects an emphasis on the family, the church and the neighborhood. A community's continuity is valued more highly than individual advancement, social solidarity is favored over social mobility and the maintenance of existing ways takes precedent over mainstream ideals of success. Parents want their children to succeed in life, but they also want them to be considerate of their elders, to willingly bear their responsibilities and to show courage under adversity. "More concerned with honor than with worldly ambition, they have less interest in the future than do upper-middle-class parents, who try to equip their children with the qualities required for competitive advancement."
Mr. Lasch acknowledges the provincialism and narrowness of lower-middle-class culture, and he does not deny that "it has produced racism, nativism, anti-intellectualism, and all the other evils so often cited by liberal critics." But, he maintains, in their zeal to condemn such objectionable traits, liberals have failed to see the valuable features of petty-bourgeois culture -- what he calls moral realism, skepticism about progress, respect for limits and understanding that everything has its price.
Mr. Lasch's clear discussion of petty-bourgeois culture provides an important context for a more sophisticated understanding of the lower middle class's discontent with liberalism. Indeed, no book has done a better job of capturing the perspective of the lower middle class on the abortion debate, family values, the politics of race (particularly the politics of busing and affirmative action) and other issues that dominate liberal discussions of white backlash. "Whatever can be said against them," Mr. Lasch states, "small proprietors, artisans, tradesmen, and farmers -- more often victims of 'improvement' than beneficiaries -- are unlikely to mistake the promised land of progress for the true and only heaven."
In pursuit of the question of why people continue to believe in progress in the face of recurrent calamities, Mr. Lasch interprets the writings of great thinkers who both supported and criticized the notion of progress. Among their works he claims to find ideas that resonate with key aspects of petty-bourgeois culture.
From the writings of earlier supporters of the idea of progress such as John Maynard Keynes and the 18th-century moralists Adam Smith and David Hume, Mr. Lasch derives the postulates of progressive ideology -- an indefinite expansion of wants, a steady rise in the general standard of living and the incorporation of the masses into the culture of affluence. "It is only in this form that the idea of progress has survived the rigors of the twentieth century," he argues. More extreme versions of the progressive faith, grounded in assumptions about the perfectibility of human nature or the potential of love and reason, foundered ages ago.
The critique of the surviving idea of progress that Mr. Lasch highlights should not be equated with nostalgia, which "freezes the past in images of timeless, childlike innocence," or with the idea of community, with its historical and confining discourse of intimate versus larger social groups, Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft. Nor should the argument be reduced to one between tradition and modernity. Rather, the opposition to progressive ideology that Mr. Lasch finds definitive is embodied in historical writings on the idea of limits.
Such work includes that of the 19th-century philosophers and social critics Thomas Carlyle and Ralph Waldo Emerson (who discussed human limitations and argued that control of destiny could be accomplished only by gratefully acknowledging that the world was not made solely for human enjoyment, and that unrestrained wants invite retribution); William James (who emphasized, among other things, the value of self-sacrifice, loyalty, devotion and civic honor); and, in the early 20th century, Georges Sorel (whose attack on progress focused on the importance of proprietorship and pride of workmanship formerly embodied in small-scale private ownership).
The idea of limits is also found in G. D. H. Cole's arguments for guild socialism, the American philosopher Josiah Royce's philosophy of loyalty, the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr's discussion of the "spiritual discipline against resentment" and the thinking of Martin Luther King Jr. on nonviolent resistance. All of these wise men, Mr. Lasch argues, speak to the distinctive concerns of the lower middle class. This is difficult to recognize in the works of major thinkers, he argues, "only because we expect major thinkers to participate in the general revulsion against the petty-bourgeois way of life."
Mr. Lasch, whose other books include "The Culture of Narcissism" (1979) and "The Minimal Self" (1984), does not hesitate to express strong views on sensitive topics, and therefore "The True and Only Heaven" will provoke considerable controversy. Because of the sheer force of his critique of the idea of progress and of liberalism, however, the book is required reading for any student of social criticism and cultural history. Although many will object to his arguments purely on ideological grounds, many others will find much in this book that is objectionable on scholarly grounds.
"The True and Only Heaven" is marred by a number of assertions that lack firm empirical foundation. And Mr. Lasch's central arguments are shaped more by informed opinion than by systematic theory. Moreover, the connection between material progress and cultural (including moral) progress is only vaguely discussed in the book. Thus the reader is left unsure about the extent to which the evolution of such issues as minority rights, women's rights, gay rights and abortion rights is actually linked in progressive ideology to the growing material expectations and the redefinition of luxuries into necessities. Since the book is not sharply focused, issues rising out of liberal ideology are often confounded with issues of progress.
Furthermore, scholars of cultural and intellectual history will find little that is new in the hundreds of pages on the works of the critics of the idea of progress. And the summary themes Mr. Lasch derives from these pages are so vague that the connection he sees between the ideas expressed by the critics of progress and important features of lower-middle-class culture is not clearly or convincingly demonstrated. Finally, despite Mr. Lasch's elaborate discussion of the history of the struggle between the idea of progress and the idea of limits, he fails to provide an explicit answer to the central question of the book -- why the idea of progress has survived the challenges of the 20th century.
However, this book is a major and challenging work because of the questions it raises. Despite its contentiousness and polemics, "The True and Only Heaven" will add an important new dimension to the continuing debate on the decline of liberalism.
 
STANDING UP FOR THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS
 Christopher Lasch, in "The True and Only Heaven," takes care to refine, and often reject, labels. And he pretty much rejects any label for himself.
"Populist, I guess," Mr. Lasch responded during a recent telephone conversation from his home in Rochester when asked how he would label himself if he did. "But that is widely misunderstood. My intention was to show why the labels that are used commonly to describe political positions are no longer valid. One of the things I pursued is how the lower-middle-class culture, sometimes referred to contemptuously as the petty bourgeoisie, is the source of the most persuasive arguments against the theory of unlimited abundance."
Mr. Lasch, who is 58 years old, is the Watson Professor of History at the University of Rochester, and he reads a lot. He knits together the finiteness of the earth, the social ambiance of 19th-century artisans and farmers, Thomas Carlyle, Martin Luther King Jr., abortion, school busing and Reaganomics. The last stitch -- a reprise on finitude -- comes on the last few pages.
John Bunyan's complaint in "Prilgrim's Progress," about the superficiality of the town of Vanity, and especially of its fair, is echoed in Mr. Lasch's epigraph, taken from "The Celestial Railroad" by Nathaniel Hawthorne: a lament that Americans have come to think that Vanity Fair -- "the true and only heaven" -- is real.
"The culture of unlimited material progress now has the blessing of highest moral authority: the press, the educational establishment," Mr. Lasch says. "And, yes, politicians." Why the hesitancy? "Well, Americans are still not completely sold on the dream of progress and abundance without limits. All the evidence seems to contradict this, and now those whose beliefs are bound up with the promise of luxury speak with diminished authority. Today's culture has ceased to stand for the values that many people continue to believe in: families, continuity, self-discipline." -- BARTH HEALEY

THE ANTI-COMMUNIST MANIFESTO
Whom to Help in Russia.
Edited by Lev Timofeyev.
Translated by Vitaly Kisin and Oleg Glebov.
Foreword by Richard Pipes.
96 pp. Bellevue, Wash.:
Free Enterprise Press. Paper, $7.95. 
 Not quite three-quarters of a century after the revolution that ushered it in, the Soviet Union -- the greatest and most costly of this century's political experiments -- appears to be heading into its final phase. Although the tale is not yet concluded, the rise and decline of Soviet power already abounds with ironic parallels.
Consider: in the early 1920's, with famine looming, the Soviet Union accepted enormous quantities of foreign food aid to keep the socialist revolution alive. Seventy years and twelve five-year plans later, hunger is again a menacing presence, and Moscow is accepting emergency relief from such unlikely benefactors as India.
By the same token, only months before the coup through which they gained power, the Bolsheviks passed a resolution affirming that "every nation forming a part of Russia must be recognized as having the right to secede freely and to form an independent state." Today the central authority of the Soviet Government is being challenged by a multiplicity of nationalist movements, all of them agitating for the self-determination that the Communist Party had earlier promised.
A newly published collection of essays, ably translated for a Western audience by Vitaly Kisin and Oleg Glebov, adds yet another parallel to the list. Years before the ultimate collapse of the czarist order, but in anticipation of it, Lenin wrote the influential pamphlet "What Is to Be Done?" Nearly nine decades later, six citizens of the ailing order Lenin helped to found have answered his question with a pamphlet of their own, entitled "The Anti-Communist Manifesto: Whom to Help in Russia."
The authors of this important document include Vasily Selyunin, Larisa Piyasheva and Boris Pinsker, newly prominent economists who have already provided powerful critiques of Soviet performance, as well as the scientist Maksim Frank-Kamenetsky and the journalist Anatoly Strelyany. The manifesto's editor, Lev Timofeyev, who himself has contributed a piece on the black market, spent two years in the Gulag for his criticisms of Soviet economics -- after Mikhail S. Gorbachev had come to power. The group is representative of an emerging body of thinkers who prefer to remain on Russian soil, but who refuse absolutely to acknowledge the legitimacy of Communist rule or to collaborate in its continuation.
As perhaps befits a polemic against Leninism and its worldly works, the authors of "The Anti-Communist Manifesto" do not speak with a single, disciplined voice. Their visions of a post-Communist Russia differ in a variety of particulars. They are unanimous, however, in their reading of the current Soviet crisis, and they are united by their apprehension that the West's impending aid programs may forestall rather than promote liberal reforms and renewal in the Soviet Union.
"The empire of evil," Mr. Timofeyev writes, "is being destroyed." "It is already clear," he says, "that the Communists have been utterly defeated politically" but "it is only privatization that can ensure the irreversibility of democratic reforms."
These writers do not view Mr. Gorbachev as their ally. Mr. Pinsker dismisses the current leadership as "reformers terrified of reforms." To be sure, he notes: "This is indeed the best government the Soviet state has yet had. Still, 'best' is far from being equivalent to 'good.' When the Communist government talks of reforms, it never wants to yield any property to private ownership."
The current system, says Mr. Selyunin, "combines the irremovable vices of command planning with an absence of any responsibility on the part of producers. The result is economic chaos." He recommends a "rapid and decisive transition to a market economy" characterized by private property, free enterprise, currency convertibility and free prices. "Privatization of property," he pointedly insists, "does not present any special technical problems." Participation in the world economy figures centrally in Mr. Selyunin's program, and he views the creation of an attractive climate for foreign business as essential, for "the grim reality is that the USSR needs the foreigners more than they need it."
Today's "increasingly hysterical reports of urgent conferences, extraordinary measures and emergency mobilizations," observes Ms. Piyasheva, "may be highly instructive for a prospective foreign investor." She warns against private loans to the Soviet Government: "Under Soviet conditions renovation programs tend to take a long time . . . products are typically noncompetitive . . . and thus there will simply be no earnings to pay off such loans. They will be written off as happens with loans to the dictatorships in Latin America, Africa and Asia." Outright aid, for its part, is said to risk "prolonging the agony" engendered by the existing system. She advocates "stringent economic and political conditions" on aid to Moscow: "Substantial loans . . . must be accompanied [by] elimination of central planning of the economy and . . . guarantees of access to the Soviet economy by foreign investors, international trade in Soviet securities and so on." "Unless it gives appropriate guarantees and makes real steps toward privatization and free enterprise," she writes, "no loans or most-favored nation status in trade must be given to the USSR."
It may be, as Richard Pipes suggests in his foreword, that "The Anti-Communist Manifesto" underestimates the difficulties of adjusting back to a market order after three generations of enforced socialism. Moreover, if the authors of this manifesto consider themselves "disciples of Friedrich Hayek," as one writer intimates, their tutelage would appear to be as yet incomplete: a program of private ownership that envisioned Government spending of up to 50 percent of national output, like Mr. Selyunin's, would surely be unobjectionable to a Swedish Social Democrat, but is unlikely to be embraced by Mr. Hayek, Milton Friedman or other exponents of a more classical liberalism. Such qualifications notwithstanding, this bold, thoughtful and passionately honest salvo poses a genuine and indigenous alternative to the temporizing of Mr. Gorbachev's crippled regime. This manifesto is sure to be followed by others, but its arguments and points of view are likely to have a continuing influence on the struggle for liberty and prosperity in the Soviet Union.

BYLINE: By GEORGE JOHNSON

 BODY:
A TENURED PROFESSOR, by John Kenneth Galbraith. (Houghton Mifflin, $7.95.) After a Harvard economist discovers how to quantify the irrational side of economic behavior, he and his wife reap a fortune, devoting their sudden millions to making the world a nicer place. Last year our reviewer, Barbara Ehrenreich, called the novel "a liberal wish-fulfillment fantasy, transmuting greed to good with rollicking zeal. Along the way, Mr. Galbraith has great fun at the expense of the powerful and their all-too-numerous admirers."
JAZZ CLEOPATRA: Josephine Baker in Her Time, by Phyllis Rose. (Vintage, $12.95.) The daughter of a St. Louis laundrywoman, the dancer Josephine Baker caused a sensation in the clubs of Paris when she appeared onstage wearing little more than a skirt of bananas. Later she became known for her work as a spy in the French Resistance, as a campaigner for civil rights in the United States and as the matriarch of a multiracial family of adopted children she called the Rainbow Tribe. In 1989 The Times's Michiko Kakutani said Phyllis Rose "has a gift for combining biography with literary, social and psychological analysis, and there are passages in 'Jazz Cleopatra' where this talent shines."
FOR THE SAKE OF ALL LIVING THINGS, by John M. Del Vecchio. (Bantam, $5.95.) While her brother is working as a leader of the Khmer Rouge, a Cambodian woman falls in love with an American adviser to the Government in Phnom Penh. Last year our reviewer, David Murray, said the novel succeeds because of "the power of Mr. Del Vecchio's prose and the enormous amount of information he submits to his readers. He has added another memorable book to the literature of the Southeast Asian conflict, a tragic, bloody saga that seems to be with us forever."
ISARA: A Voyage Around "Essay," by Wole Soyinka. (Vintage International, $9.95.) In a book that is part imagination, part fact, Wole Soyinka, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1986, tells about his father, a teacher named Essay, and his life in colonial Nigeria. The book "goes far beyond a homage," Rita Dove said here in 1989. "It supplies the essential ingredient missing from history books -- not only the Zeitgeist, but the heart that propels the spirit."
ADVANCE, RETREAT: Selected Short Stories, by Richard Rive. (St. Martin's, $10.95.) Written by a South African who was found murdered in his home in 1989, these short stories tell what it is like to be of mixed race in the land of apartheid. "Richard Rive's historical place in the development of South African literature is assured," Tony Eprile said here last year. "This humane, sharply observant collection of stories shows that his is a voice to be discovered by each new reader, a voice that lingers long after one has read the stories."
THE COMING GLOBAL BOOM: How to Benefit Now From Tomorrow's Dynamic World Economy, by Charles R. Morris. (Bantam, $12.95.) Despite the prevailing view of the doomsayers, an economist argues, the world is on the verge of an unprecedented boom. "Charles R. Morris is not afraid of optimism," Adam Smith said here last year. "In 'The Coming Global Boom' he has once again set himself up as contrarian critic, and has published a bullish argument in lively form."
TIME'S WITNESS, by Michael Malone. (Pocket Books, $5.95.) The police chief of a small town in North Carolina uncovers a web of corruption when he investigates the murder of a local black political leader. In 1989 our reviewer, Valerie Sayers, said the novel offers "a complex and satisfying plot, a rich panorama of a class-stratified Southern town and dense portraits of even minor characters."
DOWN THE RIVER, by Edward Abbey. (Plume, $9.95.) When these essays by Edward Abbey, the patron saint of environmental guerrillas and nature-loving misanthropes, were published in 1982, our reviewer, Tim Cahill, said, "He can write movingly about the most simple outdoor pleasures: planting a tree, seeing a bear, watching hawks in flight, getting drunk." THE JOURNEY HOME: Some Words in Defense of the American West (Plume, $9.95) shows Abbey as an "American artifact, part maverick, part pastoral extremist, part semi-hermit, part latter-day Jeremiah Johnson," Ted Morgan said here in 1977. The publisher has also reissued two other books by the author, who died in 1989: ABBEY'S ROAD ($9.95), a 1979 collection of wilderness essays, and GOOD NEWS ($10.95), a 1980 novel set in a future time when American civilization has fallen apart, replaced by a preindustrial economy of whites and Indians living off the bounty of the West.
ANY WOMAN'S BLUES, by Erica Jong. (Harper Paperbacks, $5.95.) As she approaches middle age, the liberated heroine of "Fear of Flying" finds herself grounded by an addiction to sex, drugs and an abusive young boyfriend named Darton Venable Donegal 4th. Last year our reviewer, Benjamin DeMott, said he liked "Fear of Flying" better but that "an occasional idiom or patch of comic invention elsewhere calls up Ms. Jong's earlier achievements."
EAST OF CHOSIN: Entrapment and Breakout in Korea, 1950, by Roy E. Appleman. (Texas A&M University, $14.95.) Through interviews with survivors and other sources, a historian of the Korean War tells what happened when American forces at Chosin Reservoir were surprised by a regiment of the Chinese Army. "For most Americans, knowledge of the Korean War is both scant and vague," Bernard E. Trainor said here in 1987. This book "deals at once sympathetically and analytically with one of the painful episodes of that struggle."

HEADLINE: ARE THINGS AS BAD AS THEY LOOK

BYLINE: By Charles R. Morris; Charles R. Morris is a partner in Devonshire Partners, an investment advisory firm. His last book was "The Coming Global Boom."

 BODY:
Yertle the Turtle, Dr. Seuss assures us, came a cropper when his hastily rigged empire turned out to be just another shell game. Yertle was the ruler of a small turtle pond, who had the brilliant insight that his kingdom extended as far as he could see. His subjects were ordered to pile up in a higher and higher stack while Yertle, perched on top, exulted in his new glory. Alas, the underpinnings of his kingdom proved structurally unsound when a little turtle at the bottom of the pile had the bad manners to burp. The whole stack came crashing down and a thoroughly humbled Yertle ended up stuck deep in the turtle pond mud.
It's clear that the American economy has been splashing about in the mud since Saddam Hussein's tanks rolled into Kuwait, knocking both oil prices and financial forecasts for a loop. The questions are: How deep will the plunge be? And how long will it take to climb out again? The answers, in large measure, turn on an assessment of how rickety the economy's financial underpinnings really are. Will another hiccup, on top of an oil crisis, the fighting in the gulf, the continuing catastrophe in the savings and loan industry, serious problems in the banking system and heavily indebted consumers and businesses, be enough to bring down the whole structure? 
 ALTHOUGH MOST ECONOMISTS expect that the present recession will be relatively brief and mild, there is pervasive worry about what one analyst calls "the nightmare scenario." At least two of Wall Street's inveterate pessimists, A. Gary Shilling, of the economic consulting firm that bears his name, and Stanley D. Salvigsen, of the money management firm Comstock Partners, talk about a stomach-churning financial plunge of a severity not seen since the 1930's. Shilling sees a deep recession that may last "a couple of years," while Salvigsen says "the word 'depression' rings a little closer to our theme."
The nightmare scenario goes something as follows: As sales slow and unemployment rises during a recession, consumers and businesses start to default on the heavy debts they built up during the 1980's. Banks take big losses on their mortgage portfolios and their credit-card and business loans; under pressure from regulators, they sharply curtail their lending, even to healthy businesses. Unemployment shoots up, mortgage defaults become widespread, home prices drop like a stone and, in growing panic, consumers watch their primary savings, their home equity, disappear. As the banks get into deeper trouble, money-market funds, which hold a lot of bank paper and are not Federally guaranteed, begin to default, and the run for the ratlines starts in earnest.
But it gets even worse. In a normal recession, interest rates would drop as the economy slows, easing debt pressures, and the Government would kick in with increased social spending to cushion the decline. But now, since the Federal deficit is already so high, a surge of Federal borrowing, on top of the borrowing to bail out banks and savings and loans, could make the credit crunch worse -- interest rates, that is, might actually rise, causing new waves of debt defaults to ripple through the country. And we can no longer count on the world's deep-pocket savers, Germany and Japan, to supply the missing credit. Germany's bailout of the crippled East German economy dwarfs America's savings and loan problems, while in Japan, unbridled speculation has driven the market value of real estate to ridiculous levels. If that bubble bursts, and Japanese money goes squirreling into mattresses, the whole world economy could collapse at the same time.
No one is discounting the nightmare scenario out of hand. Even Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities, who has been resolutely upbeat through a series of recession false alarms, says that this time a really serious crash "is not outside the realm of reality." But Yardeni and a number of other economists, like Peter Canelo, the chief strategist at the investment banking firm Bear Stearns, still foresee only a mild recession.
All economists look at the same data. Economics is more metaphor than science, a way of imposing interpretive order on the buzz of transactions that make up a modern economy. Forecasting, in particular, is a narrative art form; there's no black box to grind up the numbers and produce a reliable prediction. Here are some program notes for watching the evolving drama.

THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT MOST OF THE EIGHT recessions in the postwar era started with inventory buildups. As good times rolled, companies would stockpile more and more goods to stay ahead of demand. When consumer spending slowed even a little, businesses choked on their unsold inventories, factories shut down, workers were laid off, consumer spending screeched to a halt and there would be a full-scale recession. Inventory ups and downs have been the prime driver of the boom-and-bust "business cycle" that has dominated the economy from time immemorial.
The difference today is that companies worked very hard through the 1980's to keep inventories lean. A typical example is a foundry in Virginia that makes cast-iron parts for Chrysler. Not many years ago, the foundry stockpiled parts until there were enough to fill a freight car. Now trucks leave each night carrying just enough parts for Chrysler's production run one day later, cutting the parts pipeline from about three months to just a few days. Nationwide, total inventories stand at less than six weeks' worth of sales, the lowest level ever. "If you look at just the traditional business-cycle factors," says David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services, "they point to a short recession, because the manufacturing sector has maintained such good control."
The other bright spot is that prices have behaved relatively well. "Strip away the volatile sectors, like food and energy, and inflation looks under control," says Peter Canelo. "Producer price inflation is down from an annual rate of 5 percent a year ago to about 3 1/2 percent now, and it's probably going lower." On the eve of the fighting in the gulf, most analysts felt that, unless the conflict was prolonged, energy prices would stay under control. Even without production from Iraq and Kuwait, world oil supplies are bigger than they were a year ago. Once the gulf crisis is resolved, one way or the other, oil prices could fall quite sharply.
With inventories and inflation in good shape, why all the nightmares? A number of analysts fear that the risks in the present slowdown may be quite unlike any we have seen in the recent past. They are worried that American assets, the things that businesses and consumers own, may be worth a lot less than we thought they were. So much wealth is tied up in assets like office buildings and housing that a widespread crash in asset values could bring down the whole economy, much as happened in the 1930's.

THE REASON ASSET VALUES ARE such a worry is that during the 1980's we all borrowed against our assets as never before. Business borrowing rose about 40 percent a year faster than in the previous 30 years, much of it fueled by the late and much-lamented revolution in junk bonds, the high-interest securities sold by companies with shakier credit than America's industrial blue-chips. Each day's headlines bring news of another company either in the tank or hanging on by its fingernails because heavy debt service payments have gobbled up cash flows -- Donald Trump's casinos, Eastern Air Lines, Robert Campeau's department store chains (Bloomingdale's, Abraham & Straus) and William Farley's textile empire (Fruit of the Loom, West Point-Pepperell).
Consumer borrowing tells the same story. For a number of years, consumer debt has been growing some 5 to 8 percent faster than paychecks. Sooner or later, as Stanley Salvigsen puts it, "you hit the wall." Home mortgages have grown at a similar clip. In 1980, homeowners had borrowed about 37 percent of the current value of their homes; by 1990, the ratio was over 50 percent, despite the fact that home values had increased substantially. Now that house prices are falling on both coasts, homeowners worry that they may never get their money back. If they decide to walk -- mortgage delinquency rates are rising around the country -- banks may have to write off a large portion of the debt when they try to sell the foreclosed property.
The collapse of the junk-bond market and a depressed residential real-estate market have drawn most of the publicity, but the true disaster is commercial real estate. As George A. Puskar, the head of Equitable Real Estate Investment Management, puts it, "an undisciplined flow of capital fueled rampant overbuilding without regard to supply and demand." Warning signals, especially rising office-vacancy rates, were flying as early as 1985; but banks, savings and loans, insurance companies and pension funds kept on lending anyway -- mostly, it seems, because it was a business they were familiar with. Almost 45 percent of the office space ever built in America was constructed during the 1980's. Real-estate loans accounted for 87 percent of the growth in commercial-bank lending from 1986 through 1989. Richard Kateley, the president of Real Estate Research Corporation in Chicago, says "commercial vacancy rates are so high in most of the country that it will take until mid-decade to work off the glut."
All of these excesses add up to a strained financial system. Investment banks like Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse/First Boston have a lot of their capital tied up in junk bonds. Insurance companies like Equitable have invested heavily in real estate and junk bonds, and the commercial banks are exposed across the board, at a time when their capital is still draining into third world quicksands like Brazil and Argentina. Digging out from under all these commitments, David Hale says, "creates the danger of a serious financial accident." And that's why so many analysts, even the more optimistic ones, wake up and stare at the ceiling in the middle of the night.

THERE ARE OTHER THINGS TO worry about. During much of the 1980's, profligacy in the United States was supported by frugality abroad. High savings rates and trade surpluses in countries like Germany and Japan created a big pool of capital that financed American trade and budget deficits and kept the investment machine humming. But those pools of capital may be drying up. To end the political division of Germany, a major cause of the cold war, West Germans agreed to pay for the economic damage wreaked by their Communist cousins to the East. The total bill, including the cost of repairing the dilapidated East German infrastructure and supporting a lot of laid-off East German workers, may be as much as a trillion dollars over the next decade. In the near term, the German budget deficit will balloon to about 5 percent of its gross national product, or double the level in the United States.
On the other side of the world, the portents in the Japanese tea leaves are every bit as dire. Lurking beneath the smoothly running exterior of "Japan Inc." may be the world's biggest savings-and-loan-type scandal. The long economic boom in Japan was fueled by very rapid credit creation. In most countries, turbocharged money growth quickly spills over into price inflation. But in Japan, docile consumers just plunked their new money into low-interest bank accounts, where it financed a huge increase in business investment.
But the inflationary pressures bubbled over into stock prices and real estate. The Nikkei index, Japan's version of the Dow Jones average, shot up to 60 times company earnings -- American investors get nervous if stock prices exceed 15 times earnings. The run-up in real-estate prices was even more absurd: The value of real estate in Japan is four times higher than all the real estate in America (which is 25 times larger). Stock prices finally cracked last year, and the Nikkei index fell almost 50 percent in 1990. (By way of comparison, during the "Black Monday" stock market crash in October 1987, the Dow Jones fell only half as much, a loss it recouped by the end of the year.)
Japanese real-estate prices are still holding firm, at least for the time being. But the banks and the government are watching nervously. Unlike American banks, those in Japan can include part of the market appreciation of stocks and real estate in their official capital. Banks can lend up to something like 12 times their capital. So if real-estate values suddenly break, the banks will have to call in 12 yen worth of loans for every yen their capital base falls. That is almost too nasty to contemplate. To avoid suddenly pitching headlong off the treadmill, the Japanese Government is easing back on credit growth by raising interest rates -- Japanese rates are now actually higher than in America. The problem is being addressed, that is, but a misstep could be disastrous.

WITH SO MANY ACCIDENTS waiting to happen, why is it that so many economists still foresee a relatively mild recession? The answer, once again, depends on the spin you choose to put on the data. If you are inclined toward pessimism, you see an economy that was unusually weak even before the technical recession got under way, which suggests that the recession will be unusually severe. If you are inclined toward optimism, you see an economy that had managed to handle more than a year of very bad news and still avoid a recession until the oil-price shock following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last August, which suggests substantial underlying strengths. And the available data can easily be made to support either interpretation.
Take the problem of corporate debt. On the one hand, the rate of debt growth was high during the 1980's, and corporate debt service now consumes a bit over 20 percent of corporate cash flows, which is historically high. But at the same time, a 20 percent debt service ratio, up from about 16 percent in 1980, doesn't seem too frightening. Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley, points out, moreover, that companies whose cash flows are squeezed hardest during recessions, like heavy manufacturers, have actually been reducing debt quite sharply for several years. Debt growth has been concentrated in industries whose sales hold up best during downturns, like food and tobacco manufacturing. "We have a tendency to base a lot of analysis on headlines, the Campeaus or Macy's," Roach says. "But if you look at the data in the aggregate, and sort out the debt based on companies' ability to carry it, the risks are a lot less than is commonly appreciated."
There is no gainsaying the problems in commercial real estate, which, far more than junk bonds, are at the heart of the problems in the savings-and-loan and banking industries. But the picture in residential real estate -- about three times as big as the commercial market -- is more mixed. "The residential market is soft," says Richard Kately, "but by no means a disaster area."
Glenn E. Crellin, vice president for economics and research for the National Association of Realtors, makes the point that "residential markets are inherently local." While prices are falling in New England, New York and parts of California -- all areas where there was double-digit appreciation during the 1980's -- they are holding up in the Midwest and most of the West, and a recovery may be under way in Texas. "A lot of the 'losses' we hear about are just sellers getting less than they had hoped," says Crellin. "Most homeowners have been in their houses for more than six years, and they've enjoyed a lot of price appreciation."
James J. McDermott Jr., president of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, an investment-research firm, suspects that the banks' problems may also have bottomed out. "Banks have been building up their reserves for some time now," he says, "and actually are in much better shape than they were before the last recession. If the downturn is only moderate, they should come through quite well. What really worries me is how the regulators will behave. Bankers are spending so much time introspecting that they may forget how to make loans."
Finally, according to some analysts, developments in Germany and Japan may offer as many opportunities as dangers. "We're already running a trade surplus with Europe, and that should increase as Germany reconstructs," says Steven Nagourney, chief international strategist at Lehman Brothers. Nagourney also expects that Japan will solve its real-estate problems and reach a better economic balance with the rest of the world as it completes "a critical transition from a third world type of export-driven economy to a more balanced first-world economy."

DESPITE THE radically different scenarios of the most optimistic and the most pessimistic of the forecasters, there is substantial agreement on the main issues. Widely divergent predictions result from very small differences in emphasis. Just as Edward Yardeni of Prudential-Bache, a defiant optimist, concedes that a serious crash is within the realm of reality, Gary Shilling, one of the most confirmed pessimists, concedes that we might skate through. "This is a bailout era," he says. "The S.& L. industry is being ripped apart, but things just go on their merry way, with maybe a little grumbling about higher taxes. Conceivably, we could bail out the banks, then the insurance companies, and people will say, 'Well, just one more bailout' and ignore it -- although you have to believe all the risks are on the downside."
With the economy poised on a knife edge, much may turn on psychology. Consumers and businesses maintained remarkably stiff upper lips in the face of cascades of bad news through most of 1990, although confidence was clearly cracking by late fall. One reason for the relative cheeriness was that much of the country -- the Midwest, and parts of the Southwest and West -- chugged through the year at a respectable, if unspectacular rate; the recession has been felt most acutely in the Northeast. The Wall Street establishments, the banks and the insurance companies that rode the crest of last decade's boom now must streamline and consolidate, just as Rust Bowl manufacturing businesses were forced to do in the 1980's. (Since the financial-services industry also happens to house a lot of economic forecasters, the lamentations accompanying this round of restructuring may be more heartfelt than in the past.)
There is no way to know for sure how long the recession will last. It has been anticipated for so long, and so intently, that all the bad news may be out on the table. With the Federal Reserve easing up on interest rates and pushing banks back into the lending business, a turnaround could come quite quickly -- assuming, of course, that the crisis in the gulf is successfully resolved.
However long it takes, the restructuring of the financial-services industry is long overdue. Strikingly, the optimists, Yardeni and Canelo, and the pessimistic Shilling all agree that the 1990's could be a period of very strong growth for the United States, as the average age of the work force rises and investment capital shifts away from real estate into factories and technology.
But the burning question for most Americans is not what will happen over the long term, but what will happen over the next 6 to 18 months. Will the recession be very severe or will it blow over quickly and relatively painlessly? And the frustrating reality is that economic forecasting tools are much too crude to answer that question with any confidence. What happens next is anybody's guess.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN: Montreal

BYLINE: By NANCY LYON; NANCY LYON, who lives in Montreal, is at work on a travel book about Quebec for Passport Books.

 BODY:
Montreal in summer bares its Latin soul in cafe terraces, street fairs, and festivals of fireworks, jazz, theater and stand-up comedy. But when the snow piles up to the windows and hockey sticks fly, Montreal's jovial French-Canadian camaraderie and cosmopolitan flair combine to give this city its winter spirit. Yes, everyone complains about the length of the season and the ritual of brush, scrape, chisel, shovel and push to park and unpark cars. But who does not thrill at the sights of the city in winter -- snow falling through a neon pink sky from a cafe window on Rue St.-Denis, ice-skaters gliding by moonlight on the lagoon in Parc LaFontaine, toboggans zipping down Mount Royal.
Winter is a time for conversation, the favorite pastime of Montrealers, bilingual quibbles aside. Quebec's bilingual tensions get played out in Montreal in a tussle of commercial and street signs proclaiming chiens chauds and hot dogs, Arrets and Stops. But the citizens of the second-largest French-speaking city in the world can sling a bilingual joke as deftly as a snowball. Social interchanges here are verbal salads, tossed with sentences that begin in good radio French, but quickly get salted and peppered with Canadian or American English and end up with joual -- Quebecois slang. 
 Skates and snowshoes and cross-country skis and poles and hockey sticks are toted in Metro cars as if they were Alpine trams. Right now they're playing baseball in snowshoes and racing canoes, dog sleds and beds on the ice for the ninth annual Fete des Neiges, or Winter Festival, which began yesterday and runs through Sunday.
 
The Winter Festival
 Ile St.-Helene and Ile Notre Dame, islands across the St. Lawrence from the Old City, are the main sites for the festival. A quick Metro hop from downtown, Ile St.-Helene became a public park in 1874, but since the island was tripled in size (to 336 acres) for Expo '67, it has become a year-round family playground, with race track, museums, ice rinks, toboggan runs and, in summer, pools, beach amusement park and waterslides. In winter these hilly, wooded islets in the river's rapids become a wonderland for skating, cross-country skiing, tobogganing and snowshoeing.
At the Ile Notre Dame's Jardin de Neige, tons of snow have been transformed into a three-and-a-half-story chateau, a setting for friendly snow skirmishes. (Open daily 8 A.M. to 7:30 P.M.) Winter festival activities at the Olympic Basin include ice sculpturing and speed skating next Saturday from 9 A.M. to 1 P.M., and a bed race and a dog-sled promenade next Sunday from 9 A.M. to 1 P.M. To get to Ile Ste.-Helene and Ile Notre Dame during the festival take the Metro to Ile Ste-Helene station where buses depart daily for the site. Although there is generous parking on the islands, traffic jams are inevitable.
The other center for the winter festival is Old Montreal, where the cobbled Place Jacques Cartier has been turned into a downhill ski slope, complete with ski lift, snow cannons and terrain for snowboarding, as well as an area for snow and ice sculpture (Feb. 2, 9 A.M. to 5 P.M.). At the old port at the foot of Place Jacques Cartier, there's a traditional cabane a sucre, or maple sugar shack. Syrups and candies are on sale, and visitors can try tire des neiges, hot maple syrup dripped onto fresh snow and eaten like taffy. Information on the festival: (514) 397-9190.
Montreal's other big winter passion is ice hockey. The screams and whistles, brightly lighted ice, melodramatic organ music and gravelly cries of vendors all contribute to the fervor. The Montreal Canadiens play from September to May at the Montreal Forum (2313 Ste.-Catherine West, at Atwater; (514) 932-2582. If you can't get a ticket inside the Forum, you can buy one outside from scalpers from $20 to $40. Official prices range from about $9.25 for standing room to $20 for seats. (Prices in U.S. currency, based on 87 Canadian cents to the U. S. dollar.) Depending on availability of tickets, reservations can be made up to a month in advance.
 
Mont Royal
 For those who prefer a quieter winter scene, there are dozens of charming places to ice skate free, including the parks of LaFontaine, Maisonneuve (with the Botanical Gardens) and Angrignon, with its children's zoo and Winter Fairyland with ornate ice palace. But traditionalists go to Beaver Lake on the Mountain.
Montrealers always call Mount Royal (designed by Frederick Law Olmsted) "the Mountain," even though its peak is only 764 feet above sea level. The park, a dense woodland habitat threaded with steep fir-crested paths, twisting through stands of maple and oak. The base is about a 20-minute walk from downtown. All paths around the mountain lead to Beaver Lake and the Grand Chalet, site of an interpretive nature center. On a sunny Sunday, Beaver Lake takes on the atmosphere of a snow circus, with skaters waltzing, and children with toboggans and sleds flying down the sloping lawn. Two cross-country ski trails start at the lake. Rather than walk to the mountain, you can also drive along the Camillien Houde Parkway, hire a horse-drawn caleche, or hop the No. 11 bus (from Rue Mont Royal) to Beaver Lake.
 
The Old City
 In summer everyone goes to Old Montreal and the old port to stroll, bicycle along Lachine Canal, sip a cappuccino and gawk at the big ships. In winter, when snow in the rest of the city may look thin or brown around the edges, the narrow, cobbled streets of the old town recall the 19th century. Until the Quebec Government declared Old Montreal a historic zone in 1962, the fieldstone walls and steeply-pitched roofs of its old stone buildings had been left to deteriorate in the shadows of rusty warehouses and grain elevators marring the skyline of the port. Now the French Regime residences and buildings, which date to 1685, have been restored and are occupied by residences, offices and boutiques.
The old city has two hearts, Place Jacques Cartier, the historic political center, and Place d'Armes, the economic and religious center. In close proximity to the Place Jacques Cartier are the Hotel de Ville, or City Hall (1874-1878), with its mansard pavilions, green copper covered dormer windows, and the splendid Chateau de Ramezay, at 280 Notre Dame Street East. Today it is a museum reflecting the middle class life of 18th-century settlers in New France. (Open Tuesday to Sunday, 10 A.M. to 4:30 P.M.; admission is $1.75, students and seniors, 85 cents. (514) 861-7182.)
Along the Place d'Armes dignified banks and businesses line the square. One place to visit is the foyer of the Bank of Montreal and its Numismatist's Museum; 129 Rue St.-Jacques West, Monday to Friday 10 A.M.-4 P.M. Another is the interior of the Basilica of Notre Dame, for many years the second most popular tourist attraction in Canada after Niagara Falls. This neo-Gothic limestone giant 260 feet long, with a luminous gold and blue interior, was begun in 1823 and stands where 60 French settlersfounded Montreal's original settlement, Ville-Marie, in 1642. The 12-ton bell can be heard for miles around, and the 6,800-pipe organ, a century old this year, has an astonishing voice. The basilica is a popular venue for concerts by the Montreal Symphony Orchestra. Informal tours are offered regularly, and the small museum has a valuable collection of sacred vestments and ornaments, bishops' thrones and croziers. (Open Saturday and Sunday, 9:30 A.M. to 4 P.M.; admission 87 cents, children 40 cents.)
 
Underground City
 They say that Montrealers, some 200,000 a day, swear by their Metro, not at it. The subway is a gigantic museum, each of its stations designed by a different architect. The Montreal University station, for example, at the base of Mount Royal, evokes a feeling for nature, with wooden benches and earth colors. The Metro started out in 1966 with 22 stations and 14 miles of track and now has 65 stations and 40 miles of tracks. More than 30 percent of Montreal's developed downtown space is connected -- via pedestrian passageways and the Metro. The statistics keep growing but at last count the underground city comprised six hotels, 1,400 boutiques, 150 bars and restaurants and 30 cinemas and theaters.
Buy your Metro tickets six at a time ($6); bought individually they cost $1.50. The subway opens at 6 A.M. and closes at 1 A.M., and trains run every 3 to 10 minutes, and a bit slower on Sundays.
 
Night Life
 Montrealers are indefatigable night owls. In the Latin Quarter on Rue St.-Denis, the bars and cafes are in colorful old Victorian homes with peaked roofs and dormer windows. St.-Laurent Street, "the Main," divides Montreal East (French) from Montreal West (English). The long strip between Sherbrooke and Fairmount is a fascinating mix of ethnic shops and imaginative cafes and bistros, including Le Bar Business (at No. 3510), Cafe Melies-Le Cinema Parallel (3682), Zoo Bar ( 3556), and Cafe Lux Complex (5220), a converted textile mill. Crescent Street, the English answer to Rue St.-Denis, boasts its own strip of bars and cafes between Rues Ste.-Catherine and Sherbrooke. Nearby Biddles (2060 Aylmer) is popular for jazz.
For a sense of Quebecois tradition, one can attend a square dance. The rollicking Quebecois jigs and reels are a hybrid of lilting Celtic sounds mixed with French, sung and played on violins, melodeons, harmonicas and backed by pianos and spoons. For the uninitiated, a sense of humor and the words main droit and main gauche (right hand, left hand) are probably enough to bluff one's way through the evening. Dances are monthly at 2275 Boulevard St.-Joseph East (Metro Laurier) at 8:30 P.M., admission $6. The next two are Feb. 16 and March 16. Information: Societe Pour la Promotion de la Danse Traditionnelle Quebecoise; (514) 598-8295.
Call or visit Place des Arts (1501 Rue Jeanne-Mance) to see what concerts, operas, ballet and theater are available. Call (514) 285-4200 for information, and (514) 842-2112 to order tickets.
 
 Where to Eat
 There are hundreds of fine restaurants, bistros, patisseries and cafes. But beware the sign "Mets Canadiens" or "Mets Quebecois" -- Quebec dishes. Quebec food, at least in its old-fashioned neighborhood restaurant form, is based on sugar and fat. The touch is somewhat lighter at Le Festin du Gouverneur (Ile Notre Dame), Les Filles du Roy (415 Bonsecours) and Le Blanc Bec (5091 de Lanaudiere).
The wealth of Continental French restaurants is concentrated mostly on Rue St.-Denis and in old Montreal. The Old Fort on Ile Notre Dame provides the jovial setting for "Nouvelle France," eat-with-your-knife banquets and dinner shows at the Festin des Gouverneurs (514-879-1141). A set price of $35.30 buys a four-course dinner featuring pate de foie gras and oven-roasted honey-glazed chicken with carafe of wine, and a bilingual dinner show from 7 to 9 P.M. Reservations are needed at the Festin and for the elegant castle-like Helene-de-Champlain on Ile Ste.-Helene, 200 Tour de l'Ile; (514) 395-2424). The Continental French cuisine menu is $26.50 for table d'hote and runs from $50 to $80 a la carte.
Other Continental French restaurants, all in the old city, include: Les Filles du Roy, 415 Bonsecours; (514) 849-3535 (Sunday brunch with French songs and accordion music, about $13; table d'hote, $18); La Mare (404 Place Jacques-Cartier; (514) 861-9794), about $43; Restaurant des Gouverneurs, 458 Place Jacques-Cartier; (514) 861-0188); Le Fripon, 436 Place Jacques-Cartier; (514) 861-1386, $17.50; and A la Catalogne, 311 St.-Paul East; (514) 866-6254, also $17.50. Prices do not include wine. At the historic Maison Pierre du Calvet (400 St.-Paul East), you can sip cappuccino beside a roaring fireplace and eat pastries baked on the spot.
In addition, there is a thriving Chinatown, and good Belgian, Cajun, Indian, Italian, Vietnamese and kosher food.
 
Where to Stay
 It's still as fashionable as ever to stay at the Ritz-Carlton, a Montreal institution since 1912, and Le Quatre Saisons. The Ritz-Carlton, with 230 rooms, is at 1228 Sherbrooke West, (514) 842-4212 or (800) 363-0366. Room rates for two in winter range from about $110, the lowest weekend rate, to $235.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Airline and Tour Packager Liable in Nile Cruise Fire

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
TRAVEL law in New York State took a further step in the consumers' direction in November when a jury found an airline responsible for negligence in a 1983 fire that sank a Nile cruise boat used by the airline's packager. Two women who swam ashore holding a deck chair sued Trans World Airlines and the tour packager for personal injuries, charging negligence because the T.W.A. brochure said the airline had inspected the vessel. The airline's defense cited the brochure's small type, which, as is usual in tours combining more than one element, disclaimed any responsibility for actions of independent contractors.
The crux of the case was the assertion by the two passengers that the boat, the Pharaoh, had no life preservers available to the passengers, that there were no fire extinguishers or evacuation plans and only one lifeboat, which the plaintiffs said was used by employees of the vessel. An inspection by the airline or its tour operator, as claimed in the brochure, would have shown these fundamental safety defects, the lawsuit said. 
 The State Supreme Court jury awarded $420,000 to the two women and their husbands on Nov. 15, but T.W.A. and the tour packager, Travelers Intenational, said they would appeal, a process that could take a year. The Nile cruise boat burned in the early morning of Oct. 11, 1983. On Dec. 20, 1990, the couples agreed to accept an immediate settlement of $245,000. The two women, Lillian Elsis of New Jersey and Theresa Weinstein of Long Island, each received $112,500 instead of the $200,000 the jury awarded, and their husbands, who were not on the trip, got $10,000 each. The husbands had been awarded $20,000 each on the ground that the marital relationship was impaired after the wives returned from their trip. The maximum legal fee in such a case is limited to a third of the settlement, according to lawyers in the case.
A number of the 76 other Pharoah passsengers -- no one died in the fire and sinking -- sued in California but Travelers International was excluded as a defendant on technical grounds and a settlement of $7,000 a passenger was reached at an early stage, so no new ground was broken there.
The Judge's Ruling
In New York, because the jury ultimately supported the passengers' case, the pro-consumer language that will set precedent for future travel lawsuits was set down by the judge who presided, Justice Elliott Wilk. In a preliminary ruling a year ago sending the case forward for trial while rebuffing T.W.A.'s effort to have it halted by seeking a summary judgment, Justice Wilk reviewed the arguments.
He wrote that the two women booked a tour to Egypt, selecting from a brochure, "T.W.A. Getaway & the Middle East 1983," which included a 14-day tour with air travel to Cairo, four days at hotels and a seven-day cruise on the Pharoah. Justice Wilk quoted from the big type in the brochure, adding emphasis:
"T.W.A. has a proven track record as one of the most successful operators of tour programs to this part of the world . . . Every one is custom-designed by T.W.A. and Travelers . . . Travelers maintains full-service offices in Cairo and Athens. They're staffed by travel experts who examine every hotel, every sightseeing attraction, every cruise ship on site."
After discussing the small type in which T.W.A. as a tour operator disclaimed responsibility for "injury, damage, loss, accident, delay or irregularity," Justice Wilk wrote:
"It seems clear that having explicitly undertaken to 'examine . . . every cruise ship on site,' defendants may be held liable in negligence for their failure to detect obvious defects in safety equipment aboard the M/S Pharaoh. Moreover, having created the image of 'T.W.A. Getaway' and implored passengers to 'sit back and relax with the peace of mind that only T.W.A. Getaway Egypt vacations can offer,' defendants undertook to provide a cruise ship with expected safety features such as lifeboats and preservers."
The plaintiffs, Justice Wilk wrote, "do not seek to hold defendants liable for the acts of another, but rather for their own negligence in booking passage on an unsafe vessel." The jury supported the plaintiffs.
David L. Ganz of Ganz, Hollinger & Towe in New York, which handled the case for the Elsis and Weinstein families, was satisfied with the result of the three-week trial. "I think it's good for the consumer," Mr. Ganz said. "Every packager will look over what they are putting out, and it will give a boost to truth in advertising. If the operator says it looks over the cruise boat to check on alarms, extinguishers and lifeboats, they better do it."
Frederick A. Nicoll of Shanley & Fisher, the chief lawyer for T.W.A. and Travelers International, said neither he nor his clients wanted to comment on the outcome. Asked if he would recommend that his clients take a closer look at the wording of any brochures they published, he said he would not comment.
 
Frequent Flier Cases
 The endless procession of frequent flier court cases resulted in one decision in favor of an airline, one in favor of consumers.
The airline won in Utah, where a Federal court issued what seems to be the first decision declaring the brokering of frequent flier coupons illegal. The court ruled in favor of American Airlines, which sued in 1988 to stop three coupon brokers from buying passengers' frequent flier coupons and reselling them. All airlines say their frequent flier mileage coupons, which are exchangeable for tickets, may not be sold, although many airlines allow them to be given away to family members and sometimes others. The airline accused the brokers of interfering improperly with its contractual relations with the passengers holding the coupons, and of unfair competition.
On Oct. 16, 1990, District Judge David K. Winder agreed with American, issuing a partial summary judgment declaring that the brokers, Platinum World Travel and Coupon Connection of Salt Lake City and Texas Budget Flights of Dallas, were engaging in illegal acts. The judge did not issue an injunction requiring the brokers to stop, but both sides said he was expected to do so.
American Airlines said it was the first decision that selling coupons was illegal and would set a precedent for further efforts to halt the activities of brokers, of whom there are 50 in the United States. Michael W. Gunnn, a senior vice president for marketing for American, said the decision "will greatly support" the line's legal fight.
A lawyer for American, Richard A. Rothman of Weil, Gotshal & Manges in New York, noted that there had been settlements in 1990 in three other cases against four brokers in Dallas, New York and Los Angeles. He said those brokers agreed to stop selling American coupons and paid the line settlements in "six figures," which he said he could not further explain under the agreement.
Scott Wangsgard of Conder & Wangsgard in West Valley City, Utah, the lawyer for the brokers in the Utah case, said the decision would be appealed in the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals and that his clients would ask the judge to stay the effect of his expected injunction until the appeal was heard. Mr. Wangsgard noted that the Federal Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in California had just overturned an injunction preventing a broker there from trading in T.W.A. coupons.
In the appeal, Mr. Wangsgard said, the brokers would ask the court to balance the public interest in doing what it wishes with its coupons against the airline's need to restrain the public.
Con Hitchcock, a lawyer at the Aviation Consumer Action Project in Washington, said of the ruling, "I understand the economics of the airlines but if you can give a ticket to Aunt Shirley and Uncle Ed, why can't you sell it to them?"
The other frequent flier decision came in the Illinois appellate court on Dec. 12, when the judge opened the way for a lawsuit by holders of American Airline coupons who said the coupons' value had been eroded when the line began to limit the number of seats available to award-holders in 1988. The plaintiffs plan a class-action suit on behalf of all who joined the plan before 1988. American Airlines is asking the highest Illinois court, the Supreme Court, to hear an appeal, but the request might be rejected. The class action suit cannot begin in the 60 days that the appeal request is pending.

HEADLINE: Postings: Symposium;
A Car-Free New York?

 BODY:
Put tolls on the East River Bridges to discourage drivers from coming into the city. No, build more parking garages so they have places to park. No, reduce the number of parking spaces and plant grass and trees in their place, and raise taxes on cab rides. No, leave medallion cabs alone but control private car services. No, put tolls on the East River bridges.
New York's cocktail of competing economic and environmental interests will get a stirring Friday at a Municipal Art Society symposium called "Auto-free New York: Is It Possible?" at which panelists will argue about whose car should be gored in the interests of a less congested, less polluted, more congenial city.
The burden of proof will probably land on one of the panelists, George Haikalis, a transportation consultant who heads the Auto-free New York Committee. He and Arthur Rosenblatt, an officer of the Grand Central Partnership, the business improvement district, want to try mid-town pedestrian malls. Mac Victor, head of the Metropolitan Parking Association, will argue for more parking. Mark Simon will talk on his work as director of the Alternate Fuels Program in the city Department of Environmental Protection and Jack Lusk, head of the Taxi and Limousine Commission, will moderate.
"When New Yorkers visit other cities -- London, Berlin, Paris -- they see large commercial central zones that are indeed auto-free," said Mr. Rosenblatt. "They make a case that large pedestrian zones can be accommodated in New York without inhibiting business and the free flow of commerce."
The discussion runs from 6 to 8 P.M. at the Society's offices, 457 Madison Avenue, at 51st Street, and is open, free, to the public.

HEADLINE: New-Home Deals Are Getting Sweeter

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
DOMINICK AND MARIE PANZERA wanted to retire near their daughter on the Jersey shore, and a developer's offer of a premium, very private lot in his new development at no extra cost clinched their decision to buy a new house in Bayville, N.J..
Connie and Vito Valvano are newlyweds who will be neighbors of the Panzeras when their new home is completed. They picked the development because they liked the social life centered on the project's clubhouse. 
 Paul and Katie Lakin already had a friend living at Chesterfield Farms in Chester, N.J., and the view from the hillside lot was spectacular. Since the builder also offered a deeply discounted fixed-rate mortgage, they found the deal too good to refuse.
These buyers of new homes in the New York metropolitan region bought in different areas for different prices and for different reasons, but they share one or two traits that distinguish today's new-home buyers from those of recent years. They bought because they really needed a new place to live -- not for speculative reasons -- and because they liked the sweetened deals they were able to work out in bargaining with builders.
None of the buyers could point to a single factor that decided a deal for them, but all of them were moved to buy by the readiness of developers to offer much more than they would in a better market to make a sale.
"Builders are giving up lots of incentives out there," said Patrick J. O'Keefe, head of the New Jersey Builders Association, a trade group. "Financing, price reductions, amenities, upgrades -- they are offering all kinds of things they would never think of offering when the market was red hot."
A year or so ago, as the housing recession was just getting its teeth into the market, many developers turned to frivolous come-ons to make sales, such as trips to Disney World, health club memberships or savings bonds for future college tuition bills. Today's incentives or more likely to focus directly on the value of the property and can be worth tens of thousands of dollars in savings.
An important difference in today's new-house market is the general scarcity of already built speculative houses. During the boom mid-80's years, most new houses were built before they were sold. Now, after two years of slow sales, most speculative houses have been sold off at heavy discounts, or, in the case of town-house condominiums, turned into rentals.
"Spec houses are off the market -- they just aren't being built anymore," said Edwin Schwenk, head of the Long Island Builders Institute, a developers' group. "First of all, there isn't much to spec for in this market, and banks have just closed the door on financing them."
An exception to this may be in New York City, where a strong rental market gives home builders an option that is far more difficult for their suburban colleagues to follow. Herb Roleke Jr., a Queens developer, is working on only one house so far this year, compared to half a dozen a year during the mid-80's, and he is resigned to the idea that he may have to keep it.
"I'd love to sell it, but I'm not optimistic," he said of the three-family detached house nearing completion at 142-32 84th Avenue in the Briarwood section. He is asking $575,000 for it but has had only two phone calls on the property so far.
"If someone comes along and wants to deal, I'm prepared to be flexible," he said, "but I think I'll end up keeping it for a while as a rental."
EVEN with build-to-order housing, however, builders have vacant land to pay off and construction or management staffs they want to keep on the payroll for the next economic upturn.
Robert H. Karen's Sonata Bay Club, opened in October 1989 in Bayville, N.J., has 312 lots, of which 20 have been built on and sold, including the one to the Panzeras. Thirty more are under contract and are being built on -- one for the Valvanos -- and buyers for 20 more are waiting to sell their current homes, a constant stumbling block to sales, Mr. Karen said.
Buyers are offered four basic two-bedroom models, ranging from the $139,000 Schubert,through the Ellington and the Strauss, to the $152,000 Gershwin. The builder said his profits come from the extras the buyers order, including premiums for lots on dead-end streets or those backing on woods. But nowadays those extras are being heavily discounted too, Mr. Karen said.
Mr. and Mrs. Panzera wanted a sunroom addition for their two-bedroom retirement home at Sonata Bay Club, along with a bigger family room and different tile work. Mr. Karen agreed to make the changes for them at a reduced price.
Most of all, Mr. Panzera wanted a better yard.
"He happened to offer me a very choice lot at no extra cost, no houses behind it, just woods," Mr. Panzera said. "For me, that made the difference." He paid $180,000 for his two-bedroom retirement home, which was completed in May, and believes he got a good deal.
"I bought in a soft market," he said, "and I feel Bob Karen could have got a lot more money for these houses if his business were going better."
Mr. Karen would rather not have to make deals like that, but he considers the concessions he makes the a price of keeping busy.
"In a real hot market I don't know if I would do it," he said, "because every change requires a great deal of administrative work, going back to the architect, amending the town plans. But you have to be willing to play 'Let's Make a Deal.' "
Of course, the Panzeras had to sell their one-family home in Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn. But having paid $50,000 for it 15 years ago, the $200,000 they got was enough.
"I did all right," Mr. Panzera said. "I feel that if I had waited to sell in a high market I would have had to buy in a higher market. It all balances out."
He does not think he drove a very hard bargain, however squeezed the builders seem to feel -- an idea many buyers repeated.
"I don't consider myself a very hard bargainer, and I'll tell you why," said Mr. Lakin, a computer specialist with A.T. & T. "I've built several houses and I know that builders will accept almost anything you're willing to pay, but they'll take it out of the construction. He's in the business to make some money and I just want to make sure I get the quality I want."
Arthur Welles, whose company is building Mr. Lakin's $750,000 home in the Chesterfield Farms development, makes no bones about the pressure he is under from less understanding customers. His homes are already selling for about $100,000 less than last year, not only because he is cutting prices, but also because people are buying less expensive models, he said.
Last year he even bought a customer's old house to get rid of a spec home, he said, selling the old home at a loss.
One of the most sought-after incentives is the so-called end loan, or builder mortgage financing at below market interest rates, usually written by lenders of the construction funding on new developments. They have become scarce as banks have pulled back from development lending, but Mr. Welles's partner in the development, the Harmonia Savings and Loan Association of Elizabeth, N.J., offers buyers 30-year mortgages at a fixed rate of 7 percent, or almost three percentage points below the market for fixed-rate mortgages, and for only a $300 application fee.
The lower rate is worth about $1,000 a month in payments compared to his current Maryland mortgage, Mr. Lakin said. When Mr. Welles also gave up the $100,000 surcharge he had placed on the two-and-a-half-acre hillside lot, Mr. Lakin agreed to buy.
"I think it's very creative of them to bring down their prices through the financing," Mr. Lakin said. "That and the $100,000 drop he took on the lot."
Mr. Lakin believes buyers who squeeze the builder only set themselves up for disappointment. "Working with the builder is much more important than focusing on the contract," he said. "I think contracts are set up as excuses to fail, and I'm interested in dealing with someone who is not going to fail me."
THE Valvanos -- Gloria is a travel agent, Vito a public school consultant -- will move into Sonata Bay later this spring when Mr. Karen finishes putting up their house, bought after their marriage last year when she pressed for a new home in which to start their new life together.
"I said to my husband, either we do it now or forget it," Mrs. Valvano declared. "We both wanted a little more room than we have now, and we wanted a social life."
A visit to the Sonata Bay clubhouse sold them on the community, she said.
"We went to look, and we saw the men were playing pool, and I could be in the whirlpool or the exercise room, and it just clicked for us."
Of course, they still had to settle on the house with Mr. Karen.
In the end, they rearranged the location of some windows, got a bigger, two-tub kitchen sink, an ice-maker, different cabinets and better tilework in their bathrooms, at no charge. Mr. Karen made them pay for upgraded light switches.
"We ended up getting a lot of things that he's not charging us for because they're trying to establish the homes there," Mr. Valvano said. "Later on, they won't have to give so much. So this is a perfect time to purchase a home, even if you have to sacrifice when you sell your present home, because you won't be able to get deals like this when the market gets better."
If most of today's buyers move because of a change in personal circumstance, such as a job transfer, marriage or retirement, Meyer Lang chose his $350,000 town house in the Apple Ridge development of Mahwah, N.J., for more direct reasons.
"To be honest with you," Mr. Lang, a pet supply wholesaler, said with a little chuckle, "I moved to New Jersey to get away from New York taxes. It looks like I jumped right into New Jersey taxes."
His choice of the house had more to do with the development's landscaping and the design of the properties than with the price, he went on. "I just liked it and that's why I bought it," he said, echoing Mr. Lakin's advice against pushing a builder too hard.
Mr. Land eschewed hard bargaining with Brian Stolar, head of East Crescent Developers, the builders. "I've been in business practically all my life and I don't see any point in doing to others any different from the way I want them to do to me," he said. "So he gave me a little, and I gave him a little. and now all I have to worry about is how much my decorator is charging."
According to builders, it is the customers in today's chilled housing market who sometimes fail to bargain in good faith, more and more frequently by using a kind of sudden-death bargaining tactic, by threatening to pull out of a signed contract at the last minute. This leaves the builder with the choice of meeting onerous new demands or giving up on a sale that seemed to be in the bag.
"IT is a troubling trend," said Mr. O'Keefe of the New Jersey builders' group. "It means that the builder is at a real risk even with an executed contract, and financial institutions will become even more reluctant to lend construction money than they already are if it becomes no longer clear that the buyers will be at the table at the time of closing."
Mr. Welles, the builder of Chesterfield Farms, said that in the decade before the slump, only one of his buyers had tried to break a contract. But it has happened at least three times in the last 11 months. So far, he said, the buyers have backed down in all but one case.
"My position is that I try to squelch that immediately," he said.
"I have not done it, but I could think of scenarios where I might," he added, speaking of giving in to new demands to avoid a broken contract.
The one case where the contract did not go through was out of his hands, he said; the buyer responded to a divine message against the purchase and gave up $50,000 of a $70,000 deposit to break the deal.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: The Cooper Square Plan;
Smoothing the Path to Redevelopment

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
NO love was lost between former Mayor Edward I. Koch and the Cooper Square Community Development Committee and Businessmen's Association. For that matter, the association has had its differences with mayors and housing commissioners for 31 years.
The committee was formed by Frances Goldin and the late Thelma Burdick to oppose the urban-renewal efforts of Robert Moses, who wanted to "tear everything down from Ninth Street to Delancey Street," as Ms. Goldin put it. "We are the oldest anti-displacement organization in the United States," she said. 
 Adjustments were made to the urban renewal plan in 1971, providing for more rehabilitation. But in the 80's, as the market began to improve, the city's attention turned to the possibility of encouraging 80 percent market-rate housing on two large sites where relocation and demolition were far advanced, and using proceeds of land sales to assist low-income production and rehabilitation. The committee opposed that as an encouragement of gentrificiation.
Last month the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins, in one of its first achievements in advancing city-assisted housing, reached an agreement with the committee that both sides consider a compromise. The committee agreed to support new mixed-income housing on the two redevelopment sites, although with a higher proportion of low- and moderate-income apartments than the Koch administration had planned.
In addition, the city will rehabilitate 430 units in dilapidated city-owned buildings that were taken long ago for urban-renewal redevelopment. The apartments will then be put under the ownership and management of a mutual housing association that the committee will organize. They will become permanent low-income housing.
"We are thrilled by this agreement," said Maria Torres Bird, the chairwoman of the committee.
The reconciliation underscores the shift in approach from the Koch to the Dinkins administration, as well as the shift in market conditions. With the slump in the market, the city has probably lost the chance to underwrite all or most of the cost of the rehabilitation from the value of vacant urban renewal land. Instead, Mayor Dinkins is prepared to use capital funds to create gut-rehabilitated low-income housing, at least in the Cooper Square urban renewal area.
The area runs from East Fourth Street south through Houston Street to Stanton Street one block farther on. The other boundaries are the Bowery (lower Third Avenue) on the west and Second Avenue and Chrystie Street on the east.
THERE are two development sites with scattered occupied structures at the southern end of the area, on each side of Houston Street. But on East Fourth and East Third Streets the old buildings still stand, with tenants paying rent to the city. Among the tenants is the Cooper Square committee itself. It runs a housing and social services operation at 59 East Fourth Street.
Under the agreement, 31 occupied and six vacant city-owned buildings are to be renovated and turned over to the mutual housing association. This rehabilitation phase, already under way, means major improvements to 390 occupied apartments and 40 vacant apartments at a cost of $17 million.
Several theater and dance companies, including La Mama Experimental Theatre, currently lease space in some of the buildings on East Fourth Street. That space, too, will be renovated and then offered on favorable terms to their occupants.
The new-construction plan calls for one rental and one for-sale project. On Site 1A, 59,500 square feet of land just south of Houston Street, developer proposals will be sought for 200 units of rental housing, with a maximum of 80 percent for moderate- to middle-income households and a minimum of 20 percent for low-income households. The Cooper Square committee will participate in tenant selection. Eight loft buildings on the site will be rehabilitated and may become part of the mutual housing association's inventory.
The other development site, known as Site 2, lies between Houston and East SecondStreet. It would become a 360-unit co-op or condominium, with 80 percent of the apartments sold at market rate. The rest would be low-income units reserved for the mutual housing association.
The Site 2 plan also involves the rehabilitation of certain existing residential buildings and the provision of a community facility to replace the existing annex of the Church of All Nations. The design plan will preserve a community garden on Houston Street. The agreement clears the way for choosing a developer and the public review that follows. The rehabilitation work near Cooper Square itself is already under way, however.
One of the ironies of the long period of dispute over a redevelopment plan for the area is that what is going to be achieved in the 90's could have been achieved in the mid-80's, at less cost to the city, if there had been less friction over housing ideology. The Department of Housing Preservation and Development has long had in place the mechanisms for mixed-income rentals and condominiums and for the rehabilitation of existing buildings for low-income occupancy, with or without the Cooper Square committee as sponsor.
The decline in land values in the late 80's has served not only to narrow the city's redevelopment options but also to blur the distinctions between market-rate and assisted housing. The gap in income between those who can afford market-rate vacant apartments on the Lower East Side and those who can afford new middle-income units is narrow or nonexistent. Buildings are being "gentrified" by households that fall within the city's definition of middle-income, that is, with incomes up to 180 percent of the New York City median.
Renovated one-bedrooms can be found in well-kept railroad-flat walk-ups for around $700 a month, down about $100 a from two years ago, brokers report. Two-bedrooms rent for $850 to $1,200. An apartment renting for $1,000 a month is affordable to a tenant earning $42,800 a year, using a 28 percent rent-to-income ratio.
Similarly, co-ops have become more affordable. The sponsor of Village Court, a converted 66-unit building at 99 East Fourth Street, is asking $89,000 to $110,000 for his six vacant one-bedrooms and $165,000 to $169,000 for three vacant two-bedrooms. "It's a slow market, there's no getting around it," said Douglas White, who represents the sponsor, the G.L.M. Companies, based in Washington. The conversion plan became effective in June. The last sale was made in July. No insiders have bought.
In the end, the compromise agreement has proved an expensive solution for the city, however gratifying it is to both sides. It is desirable mainly because it is a practical way of achieving compromise on an issue that looks more ideological than real. And it could lead to a Cooper Square committee of greater stature as a contributor to community welfare.

HEADLINE: Cost-Cutting Plan Inspires Question: Is Cheaper Better?

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
FROM the very beginning, in 1989, when the General Assembly appropriated $4 million for an independent report on improving the efficiency of state government while reducing state spending, the question nagged: would the report tell lawmakers and agency heads how to do things better, or simply how to operate on the cheap?
Last week, the study was completed and filed, but the question remains. The study group, dubbed the Thomas Commission for its chairman, DeRoy C. Thomas, president of the I.T.T. Corporation, reported to the Governor that $578 million could be saved by making a series of large and small changes in the way the state manages and spends its money. 
 The commission said that Connecticut treats its employees too generously, that grants to towns and cities have outstripped demographic trends and should be capped, and that every agency from the Department of Public Works to the Bureau of Purchases should be tightened, tucked and trimmed.
 
Two Members Dissent
 Legislative leaders hailed the report and said it would be thrown into combat immediately against the huge shortfall in state tax revenues caused by the recession. Connecticut faces a gap of more than $600 million in the year than ends on June 30, in a budget of just over $7 billion. The projected shortfall for the following year is $1.5 billion.
But the murmurs of doubt have not entirely subsided. Two of the 23 commission members refused to endorse the final report. State budget officials said the commission was sometimes wildly optimistic in how much money could be saved by making specific changes. The Speaker of the House, Richard J. Balducci, a Democrat from Newington, said he thought the real saving could be closer to $300 million than the $578 million crowed over in the report.
And Mr. Thomas himself, while defending the commission, said in an interview that if all the proposals became law, residents would certainly experience greater inconvenience in their contacts with the state, if only by being required to wait longer or drive farther to get their driver's licenses renewed.
The report suggests that the General Assembly explore the idea of consolidating the number of offices of the Department of Motor Vehicles from the current 18 down to 8, but it does not formally recommend such a change for the immediate future.
"They lost sight of the question, how can we do this more effectively and efficiently?" said John W. Olsen, president of the Connecticut State A.F.L.-C.I.O. and one of the commission members who dissented from the final recommendations. "The only thing they were looking for was cuts and savings."
Mr. Olsen said that his strongest objections arose over the proposal to cut back state employee benefits, a measure that would directly affect some 40,000 workers affiliated with Mr. Olsen's union. But he said he also disagreed with what the commission began defining as spending cuts.
He noted, for instance, that the report said that capping grants to cities and towns could save the state $70 million to $170 million. "There's a lot of cost shifting to the cities and to the public at large," Mr. Olsen said. "Cost shifting is not savings."
But the report's defenders, including Mr. Thomas, said that the final saving figures are not the point, and that if the commission's work encourages Connecticut's elected officials to re-examine the premises of government, the panel will have succeeded in its mission.
 
Receptive Climate
 Those proponents say that the timing of the report -- begun 19 months ago but filed now, coincidentally, in the midst of a crushing budget crisis -- has created an opportunity that should be seized.
"With a potential shortfall of $2.2 billion, I think that the climate of the legislature will be changed and will be very receptive to suggestions to do things differently," said the State Senate majority leader, Cornelius O'Leary, a Democrat from Windsor Locks. "Nobody likes to see this kind of a deficit situation, but there is opportunity in it as well. The Thomas Commission represents some of that opportunity."
The final report, which distilled 18 separate consultants' studies into one book, includes hundreds of separate suggestions by the panel, whose formal name is the Commission to Study the Management of State Government. Some of the suggestions, if passed into law by the legislature, would clearly be felt by state residents. The report urges the closing of the Mansfield Training School, operated by the Department of Mental Retardation, to save $2.5 million a year, as well as the closing of two satellite vocational schools, in Enfield and Essex, for a saving of $1.2 million annually.
Other measures might be undertaken with little pain. The commission estimates, for instance that more than $27 million worth of underutilized state buildings and land could be sold to the public.
But many of the measures are expected to fall into the middle ground between efficiency and economy, which will make their passage through the General Assembly uncertain. The report recommends reducing the state's contribution to the state employee medical plan from 100 percent to 80 percent, a move that would affect most of the state's 52,500 employees while saving the state $9 million a year.
Another measure approved by the commission that could become a point of controversy in the legislature concerns inmate detention by the Department of Correction. The commission said the state could save $14.5 million next year by maintaining the present term of 9.1 months as the average time served by state prisoners.
 
Outcry About Prisoners
 The average time takes into consideration the thousands of inmates who served only fractions of their sentences before being freed on "supervised home release," a program that the legislature voted to terminate last year after an outcry from the public about people who were committing new crimes only weeks or even days after their sentencing. Keeping the average detention period as low as 9.1 months would almost certainly mean reversing at least part of the course that the legislature charted last year.
State Representative Linda N. Emmons, a Republican from Madison who was the only commission member to join Mr. Olsen in dissenting from the final report, said the debates that loom in the General Assembly over the commission's work were a major consideration in keeping her name off the final document. Getting the Thomas Commission's suggestions into law will not be easy, she said, and she wanted to be prepared to defend herself when the time comes.
"I don't have a whole lot of problems with most of it," Ms. Emmons said. "But I didn't want to be in a debate on the floor of the House and have someone say, 'You didn't dissent on that particular point on the Thomas Commission.' "

MOZART COMMEMORATION
 Nine musical events will be performed in Waterbury this year in commemoration of the death of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart on Dec. 5, 1791, at the age of 35. The first is a concert by the Naugatuck Valley Youth Symphony at 2 this afternoon focusing on his early works: the Symphony No. 6 in F and the Serenade in D.
 The music will be preceded by a talk on "Mozart: Prodigy and Genius" by Vincent deLuise, a Waterbury opthalmologist whose avocation is musicology. "We chose to begin the festival today because it is Mozart's birthday," he said. Admission to the Mattatuck Museum at 144 West Main Street, where the concert will take place, is $6.
 An ensemble of 20 musicians from the 140-member Naugatuck Valley Youth Symphony will be playing this afternoon. The organization was founded in 1971 by Edward Bergin, who was the Mayor of Waterbury, and the composer Leroy Anderson who lived in the area. John Pytel, a member of the woodwind section of the Waterbury Symphony Orchestra and a music teacher in the local school system, is the permanent director of the group. For more information call 755-4540.

ELLSWORTH HOMESTEAD
 George Washington was not the only president to sleep at the home of Oliver Ellsworth and Abigail Wolcott Ellsworth. John Adams was also an honored guest in the Windsor residence.
 Mr. Ellsworth was Connecticut's first United States Senator after serving as a member of the Continental Congress and a framer of the Constitution. His home and birthplace, built in 1740, is currently undergoing restoration by its owners, the Connecticut Daughters of the American Revolution, and a lecture about the process will be given today at 3 P.M. in the Connecticut Historical Society auditorium, 1 Elizabeth Street, Hartford.
 Rose-Marie Ballard, the site administrator and curator of the historic house, is the speaker, drawing on the wealth of letters, diaries and other written records, which have provided architectural and decorative information as well as insights into the lives and times of the Ellsworth family.
 Admission to the program, titled "Restoration as an Interdisciplinary Approach: The Documentation of the Oliver Ellsworth Homestead," is free. For more information call 247-8996.
 
JOYCEAN CELEBRATION
 James Joyce has been celebrated in South Windsor over the past decade or so at the Paperback Alley bookstore, 984 Sullivan Avenue, where Lila and Marshall Cohen, the proprietors, have been hosts to annual events based on the author's birthday, writings and mystique.
 Feb. 2 is Joyce's 109th birthday and the catalyst for browsing the shop's Joycean books, posters, paintings and artifacts and to become involved in literary discussions anytime from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. on Saturday and noon to 4 P.M. on Sunday.

HEADLINE: DIVIDED LOYALTIES

 BODY:
In his article "Divided Loyalties" (Dec. 16), Joel Brinkley argues that Jordanian society is split over the question of support for Saddam Hussein.
From our reading of both the Western and Arab press and recent visits to Jordan, we are convinced that opinions on the crisis are in fact shared by Jordanians and Palestinians. There was little initial support for the invasion among either populace. Once, however, American troops began pouring into Saudi Arabia, a consensus formed that was as much one of opposition to the actions of the United States as it was support for Saddam Hussein. It was an unlikely consensus at that, crossing as it did lines of gender, socio-economic background, religious commitment and political affiliation. It was a reaction that has also been seen in other Arab countries that permit popular expression, such as Yemen, Tunisia and Algeria.

HEADLINE: BETTING THE PLANET

 BODY:
It is not what a decade does to the cost of inanimate copper or tin that matters to the future of humankind but what happens to the nature and value of life. I thought your letters column would straighten the matter out, but not one letter alluded to the central environmental issue.
Why didn't Paul Ehrlich and Julian Simon bet on the decline of living habitat or the increase of extinctions? Is it because Simon knows that no ingenuity is being applied to this problem and that more people make it worse -- or was it because Ehrlich has found that we accord life no measurable value.
It is a poor environmental bet that glosses over the fact that there are things of immense value that cannot be purchased for any price, cannot be manufactured and for which there are no substitutes.

HEADLINE: Potholes, Traffic Jams and Now a New Worry: Bigger Trucks

BYLINE: By States News Service

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
NEW JERSEY drivers who are already plagued by potholes, traffic jams and rising gas taxes may soon have another worry to add to the list: triple trailer trucks.
Fiercely opposed by public safety groups, the triple trailers weigh up to 110,000 pounds, ride on 28 wheels and stretch 110 feet, more than one-third the length of a football playing field. Thirteen states allow such trucks on the highway, and the American Trucking Association wants Congress to clear the way for them nationwide. 
 The trucking industry argues that bigger trucks will increase efficiency, decrease costs for customers and pose little safety hazard. Congress will decide whether to let states permit heavier trucks on the road when it reauthorizes the Surface Transportation Assistance Act this year. And Representative Robert A. Roe, as the new chairman of the House Public Works and Transportation Committee, will play a major role.
But New Jersey public interest groups, police officers and state legislators are gearing up for a major fight against the association's proposal, which they say will make the state's growing highway problems even worse. The opponents say that with an aging infrastructure, narrow bridges and the densest vehicle volume in the nation, New Jersey cannot handle triple trailer trucks.
"It's like taking a 10-story building, laying it on its side and running it down the road," said Dan Capriotti, New Jersey coordinator for Citizens for Reliable and Safe Highways, a national safety coalition created last year in response to the association proposal. Dubbed Crash, the group is lobbying Congress and organizing local opposition.
In New Jersey, the group has mustered support from some 30 organizations, from town councils to health-care organizations and several city councils in Mr. Roe's district, which includes most of Passaic County and parts of Bergen, Essex and Morris Counties. The group has also encouraged opponents to write some 130 letters to Mr. Roe, Democrat of Pompton Lakes, opposing the association's proposal, and it has paid for three billboards in Passaic County.
Now visible near the junction of Route 3 and Route 46 in Clifton, a billboard greets drivers with the sight of a mammoth truck driving straight at them, and the blunt message: "They're Coming."
"Our concern is that doubles and triples are inherently unsafe," said Bill Bronrott, a Washington spokesman for the lobbying group, which is based in California. "And in an environment in which we are losing 45,000 lives a year and hundreds of thousands are injured or crippled for life, we need to be improving highway safety and not worsening it."
Like most spokesmen for the group, Mr. Bronrott is armed with statistics on the hazards caused by oversized trucks. From 4,500 to 5,000 people died last year in truck-related crashes nationwide, and 100,000 people were injured, he said. Car occupants are 49 times more likely to die in such crashes than truck drivers, and polls indicate widespread public opposition to bigger trucks.
The American Trucking Association says that Crash has received close to half of its $1 million budget from the Itel Corporation, a railroad equipment supplier based in San Francisco. The railroad industry strongly opposes the introduction of bigger trucks on the highway, largely for fear of losing business.
"We oppose it on economic grounds, because these trucks would divert traffic to the highways that are now going by rail," said Dan Lang, a spokesman for the Association of American Railroads in Washington. "And all of that could see us losing up to 50 percent of profit."
In contrast with the trucking industry and its $250 billion annual budget, railroads receive some $30 billion in revenues a year. At bottom, the fight over truck size reflects an increasingly bitter battle between the railroad and trucking industries. The battle even prompted Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner to warn in a Dec. 10 speech that healthy competition between the two industries should not become "open warfare."
The American Trucking Association points to higher fuel costs, which have risen 30 to 35 percent for the industry since August, and new gas taxes as evidence of the need to improve efficiency. A study requested by Congress and completed earlier this month by the Transportation Research Board, a branch of the National Academy of Sciences, indicates that trucks heavier than the standard 80,000 pounds will not damage highways, provided the number of axles is increased, said trucking association officials.
"The emotional side is just raising the specter of larger and bigger trucks," said Robert Farris, the trucking association's vice president for policy. "There needs to be safety concern about trucks and motor vehicles and motorcycles on the highway. But trucks now move about 70 percent of everything that's produced in this country."
In the 13 Western and Middle West states that do allow triple trailer trucks, Mr. Farris said, safety has not been a problem. Only experienced drivers with special training are allowed to drive the big rigs, which are permitted only under limited conditions and on certain roads, he said. The trucking group is asking Congress to let states permit larger trucks only on specific routes, and in conjunction with extra fees to pay for associated highway damage.
In 1983, Federal laws allowed double-tandem trailer trucks on highways, at the discretion of each state. New Jersey was one of a handful of states to restrict those trucks tightly; they are generally allowed only on interstate highways and their connecting roads.
Crash officials, who do not like double trucks either, say triple trailer trucks are even more unstable and difficult to maneuver under any conditions. A "crack the whip" effect makes it difficult for drivers to control the third trailer, and impossible for drivers to back up. Longer, heavier trucks have tremendous difficulty braking and stopping, and are more likely to jacknife and roll over, said Mr. Capriotti, of New Jersey's Crash branch.
Crash officials hotly denied that they were influenced by the railroad industry's financing. The group has turned down $10 million from the railroads in an effort to maintain credibility, said Mr. Bronrott, its spokesman. He noted that many groups, including truck drivers themselves, opposed the oversized rigs.
In New Jersey, the American Trucking Association proposal has been criticized by police officers throughout the state, and many have written to Mr. Roe and other legislators in an effort to block the plan. And this month, the North Jersey Transportation Coordinating Council, a local advisory body, approved a resolution calling on Gov. Jim Florio to oppose triple trailer trucks.
"They are making trucks bigger, they are making cars smaller, and we feel that they are making a very dangerous mix on the highway," said Anthony Parenti, president of the New Jersey Traffic Officers Association and a spokesman for the state Association of Chiefs of Police. "It can't help but add to the accident rate, injury and death."
 
23.3 Million Trucks on Turnpike
 A major problem in New Jersey is simple density, said James S. Arena, director of the New Jersey Division of Highway Traffic Safety. In 1990, 23.3 million trucks traveled the New Jersey Turnpike, or 11.9 percent of total vehicle traffic, he said. Yet truck accidents accounted for 34.1 percent of the 4,924 collisions that took place .
The New Jersey Department of Transportation is also not receptive to the idea of increasing truck sizes. But Crash officials fear that states like New Jersey could feel pressure to go along if neighboring states adopt the trucking proposal.
Representative Roe said he needed to hear all the evidence before making a final determination. Nevertheless, he said he resisted the notion of allowing larger, heavier trucks on the highways. New Jersey already faces a transportation crisis, Mr. Roe said, and needs to encourage more cooperation among trains, trucks, cars and planes.
Mr. Roe said he was sympathetic to the trucking industry's financial problems but did not want to solve one problem by creating 10 more.
"We need trucks," Mr. Roe said. "But there has got to be a limit to what the highways will hold."

Tough Economic Times for 'Military Town'

BYLINE: By ALBERT J. PARISI

DATELINE: WRIGHTSTOWN

 BODY:
WHEN thundering jets climb into the evening and early morning skies here, residents in this Burlington County community rarely complain. Many who live and work here say the roar of straining engines brings with it a feeling of security, just like a ringing cash register.
With war a reality, more and more aircraft arrived and departed,most of them C-141B Lockheed Starlifters, military air transports assigned to neighboring McGuire Air Force Base. But the sound of cash registers has faded, in part because of a sagging economy and the deployment of service men and women in the Persian Gulf area. 
 "There's no question in my mind, we're hurting all right," said James S. Davis Jr., a past president of the Wrightstown Rotary and owner of the Thunderbird Bowling Lanes on the Wrightstown-Cookstown Road.
"I've seen good times and bad here, but this is different," he said. "We don't know where this crisis is taking us and whether it's short or long term. People around here are feeling the effects in more ways than one."
For decades, this mile-square borough of 3,700 residents has depended on military spending for its economic survival, local merchants and elected officials say. Whether it's off-duty service men and women frequenting taverns and fast-food shops or civilians employed at both McGuire and nearby Fort Dix, an Army training center, the sight of uniforms and military-style haircuts has been as common here as summer vegetable stands along rural roads.
 
'You Have Our Prayers'
 Placards and storefront windows proclaim "We are with you" and "You have our prayers" and far outnumber graffito inscriptions of "No blood for oil." Yellow ribbons adorn many trees on front lawns.
"During Korea, during Vietnam, things were tough, but we thrived because there were a lot of people stationed here," said Mr. Davis, whose family has operated the Thunderbird Lanes for 31 years.
But in recent years, he said, the personnel at Fort Dix have been drastically cut back as part of a national effort to decrease military spending. Currently, the deployment of McGuire active-duty and Reserve air crews in and out of the Saudi Arabian desert "means that there are that many less people spending their money on weekdays and weekends," he said.
All told, Mr. Davis and other merchants said, business is off by as much as 20 percent since United States forces began leaving for overseas duty last August.
"A lot of it has to do with the economy and the state that it's in -- we know that here," Mr. Davis said. "But what's happening in the Persian Gulf is affecting everybody, each in their own way."
While some businesses are hard hit, others are holding ground.
"About the only businesses not affected by what's going on are the beauty parlors," Mr. Davis said. "While most of those who have shipped out are the guys, their wives and girlfriends are still here waiting for them to come home, and making appointments to get their hair done."
While officials at McGuire are reticent about revealing the number of aircraft and crews deployed overseas, they admit that the absence of military personnel has affected a way of life both on and off the base.
"It's been busy here and we've had a lot to do," said Art Covello, a spokesman for the 514th Military Airlift Wing, an Air Force Reserve unit based at McGuire. He said that the economic downturn was not restricted to Wrightstown, but affected other neighboring communities frequented by off-duty service people and their families.
In his unit alone, some 400 reservists are either overseas or manning continual flights to and from the Saudi desert ferrying in troops and supplies as well as providing air medical evacuation for the wounded and ill. In addition, McGuire is a key staging area for the delivery of some 200,000 pounds of mail daily destined for the gulf.
For Margaret Steere, manager of the Goodyear Auto Service Center on Fort Dix Street, a tough economy and regular customers' going overseas mean a significant drop in business.
"Compared to last year, my decline in business from customers on both bases is pretty obvious," she said, "and I'm sure it's going to get worse before it gets better."
While she did not give specific figures on her lost volume, she said it was more than the average 20 percent decline being experienced by the local business community.
But such times have also helped to strengthen ties between shop owners and their military customers and families. The crisis has served to bring out compassion in many besides a sense of business as usual.
"I can feel for what these families are going through because I come from a military family," Mrs. Steere said. "My husband spent 27 years in the Air Force, and I know what it means to live on a limited budget and have someone you love far away. People in business around here go out of their way to help others, but with this crisis we all have to be more accommodating, caring and thoughtful for those living on the edge whose wives and husbands are in the gulf."
Mrs. Steere said she and her employees had gone out of their way to provide transportation back to military housing for spouses needing car repairs and "have helped to change a few diapers" along the way. They have also tried to alleviate the tension and anxiety felt by many families.
Wrightstown's history was agricultural until 1917 and involvement in World War I. Fort Dix's role as an Army recruit training and embarcation center for troops moving overseas "was this town's rebirth" and has helped its economy through the Depression, World War II and United States participation in ensuing conflicts, Mr. Davis said.
 
'We've Come a Long Way'
 As a "military town," the borough has retained some of the seedier aspects of catering to a service community, like raucous bars and a tattoo parlor, but business leaders also point to a 15-store mall built in 1959 designed to cater to service families.
"We've come a long way and we've still a long way to go, depending on what direction the gulf crisis takes us," Mr. Davis said.
Mrs. Steere said, "People are afraid here, and that fear has made this community a stronger family." Her son and daughter are both in the service and awaiting orders to the Persian Gulf.
"I've got a nephew who is a helicopter pilot out there right now and like everybody else, we live from headline to headline," she said. "In the meantime, I wear my Desert Shield heart on my blouse and do what I can do to help."

Gulf War Leads To a 30% Drop In World Travel

BYLINE: By ERIC WEINER

 BODY:
Fearful of terrorist attacks spawned by the Persian Gulf war, Americans are canceling vacation and business trips, not only in the Middle East but also in Europe, Latin America and the United States, according to travel agents and industry analysts. International travel has declined by at least 30 percent since war broke out Jan. 16, they said.
Virtually all commercial airline service to the gulf region, including most flights to Israel and Egypt have been suspended. Also suspended are some flights to Athens, Istanbul and Ankara, Turkey, and Karachi, Pakistan. 
 Some businesses are now prohibiting employees from traveling overseas, said Roger Ballou, president of the Travel Services Group of American Express, the nation's largest travel agency. Mr. Ballou said the number of tickets sold by American Express had declined about 15 percent between the time Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and the outbreak of hostilities. Higher air fares and the national recession had also contributed to the slump, he said.
"All international travel is off," said David Perelman, president of D.M.S. Travel Group, a travel agency in New York. "It's not just the Middle East. It's not just the Mediterranean. It's a concern about travel outside the United States."
Some international flights are being rerouted around the Middle East, via China, the Soviet Union, Mongolia, Pakistan or Afghanistan. Because of the expense of this additional mileage, some fares could rise, according to industry analysts.
Responding to passengers' concerns, several airlines are waiving their cancellation penalties. For instance, American Airlines said it would allow customers who had purchased a nonrefundable international ticket for travel before Feb. 15 and exchange it for a voucher good for travel at any time. In addition, American will allow customers already traveling abroad to change their return date without incurring a penalty. The offer is valid for any of American's international flights, but most people taking advantage of it had planned to travel to Europe, the airline said.
Some carriers offer the waiver only for international flights, but as of earlier this week, at least two airlines, Northwest and T.W.A., were extending the policy to domestic flights as well. All airlines said they were constantly reviewing their waiver policies and might widen them if the war continued for several months.
Even if the war were to end quickly, industry analysts predict Americans will continue to avoid overseas destinations because of the lingering threat of terrorism. Phil Davidoff, president of the American Society of Travel Agents, said, "When it comes to a vacation, if there is the slightest bit of fear, it is no longer a vacation."

A Helping Hand To Hard-Pressed In Soviet Union

DATELINE: PROVO, Utah

 BODY:
What started as a letter to the editor of Brigham Young University's student newspaper has turned into a small crusade by two professors to send money and food to hard-pressed Soviet citizens.
Early last month Prof. Alan Keele wrote to the paper, The Daily Universe, citing food shortages and other hardships in the Soviet Union and the help that country was receiving from Germany. The letter inspired an editorial applauding the Germans' efforts and calling upon Americans, especially students and faculty and staff members of Brigham Young, to become involved in similar activities. 
 "Let's send food to the Soviet people ourselves and urge our Government representatives to develop a more enlightened national policy to do the same," Professor Keele wrote.
Residents of the Provo area responded by getting in touch with Professor Keele and asking what they could do. Don Jarvis, a fellow professor in the Germanic and Slavic languages department, said: "People kept asking what we can do, who we can donate to. It was silly to stand around and wait for someone to do it."
 
$5,000 Collected>
 The week before Christmas the two professors began collecting donations from the community and started the Russian Relief Fund to handle them. So far they have collected about $5,000.
Professor Jarvis then talked with another colleague, Gary Browning, who is serving as a mission president for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, based in Helsinki, Finland. Mr. Browning, a professor of German and Slavic languages, is on leave from Brigham Young to direct the activities of missionaries from the Mormon Church who are based in the Soviet Union. The missionaries are distributing the donations.
Last month, Professors Jarvis and Keele wired $4,000 to Professor Browning for food and other needs of Soviet citizens. "You've got one of the most powerful nations in the world facing the enormous task of changing a dictatorship to a market economy," Professor Keele said. "We have to do what we can to say: 'We are your friends. We want to support you.' "
Professors Keele and Jarvis are working with Utah business executives and church and government leaders to increase the donations to the Soviet Union and to coordinate such efforts as transporting food by plane.
Peter Serdiukov, a visiting Soviet professor from Kiev who is teaching Russian, said: "The hardest-hit are senior citizens, children and the handicapped. I'm very thankful for the American people's willingness to help people they don't even know."

Student-City Relations Strained over Taxes

DATELINE: LEXINGTON, Va.

 BODY:
Students from Washington and Lee University and city officials are holding meetings in an attempt to resolve their differences after students threatened to boycott businesses in downtown Lexington to protest a personal property tax the city intends to levy on students' cars.
The dispute is over a state law that enables cities to collect taxes on personal property that is kept in the city for more than half the year. Until recently, the city had never enforced the tax on student-owned cars, but Mayor H. E. Derrick said the city had decided to "get the Commissioner of Revenue to collect all the taxes due." 
 Bills for the 4.25 percent tax on cars' assessed value have not yet been mailed, but Lexington's Commissioner of Revenue, Courtney Baker, said, "As far as I know, we will proceed."
Mayor Derrick contends that the city is not "going after student money" but will only be enforcing a state law that is already on the books. "This isn't a new tax or a city tax or the imposition of a tax," he said.
 
Indefinite Postponement
 Because Washington and Lee and Virginia Military Institute are both in Lexington, more than 60 percent of the city's land cannot be taxed, the Mayor said.
V.M.I. has released to the city the names of students who own automobiles, but Washington and Lee's president, John D. Wilson, has refused to do so, saying that a Federal law that protects student records precludes him from releasing the names.
Last week, the Student Executive Committee, along with other student organizations, endorsed a measure that urged students to boycott local businesses for one week "to remind the City of Lexington of the crucial role students play in the city's economy, as well as students' contributions to city coffers through indirect taxation." The boycott has been postponed, though, pending the outcome of negotiations with the city.
The resolution cites a recent study that claims the university generates at least $18.5 million annually for the city's economy. It says student expenditures account for 55.6 percent of this total.
 
'No Other Recourse'
 "I was surprised to see how scared many of the merchants were of the boycott," said Raymond Welder 3d, a senior in European history and geology from Beeville, Tex., and vice president of the student body. The point of the boycott, he said, would not be to harm merchants, but rather to get the attention of the City Council.
"I don't want to go after the man who owns the bike shop or the family who runs the ice cream store," he said. "A week of no business would hurt them, and that's unfortunate, but I feel we have no other recourse."
Mayor Derrick said he was not so sure that a one-week boycott would hurt businesses. "When students go off on break, do they think the town just folds up?" he asked.
But Jay Melvin, who owns one of only two dry cleaners in town, said he would definitely feel the effects of a boycott. "It probably wouldn't be devastating, but it would definitely affect my business," Mr. Melvin said.
Mr. Derrick said a boycott would poison already tense relations between students and local residents. "The end result would be to destroy student relations with the merchants."
The Virginia State Legislature is considering a bill that may affect Lexington's ability to tax the college. House Bill 514 states that "if the owner is a student attending an institution of higher learning" any taxes and license fees should be paid in the owner's place of permanent residence. However, Mayor Derrick said he did not feel the regulation would apply to Lexington's tax efforts if enacted because the bill would amend a section of the Motor Vehicle Code dealing with the registrations, not with personal property taxes.
Campus organizations, like the Interfraternity Council, the Panhellenic Council and the Student Bar Association, have endorsed the boycott. Mr. Welder said the only group he had heard openly criticize the boycott proposal was the student newspaper. In an editorial last week, the paper called the boycott "a temporary solution to a perennial problem."

HEADLINE: Oil's Inconvenient Bonanza

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
In almost any industry, a batch of quarterly earnings reports heralding huge profit gains would bring on buoyant appraisals from gleeful executives. But not Big Oil. Despite vigorous profit gains in the fourth quarter announced last week by several oil giants, few industry executives were celebrating.
In releasing 1990 results, leaders of the nation's largest, international oil companies took pains to stress that their stunning profits from the last three months of 1990 were a solitary event, a bonanza from high oil prices that was unlikely to be repeated anytime soon. 
 Oil prices have indeed dropped since war broke out in the Persian Gulf and an oversupply of crude is expected to depress prices further when the conflict ends, taking oil industry profits with them.
And oil companies say their earnings from the last quarter were dramatic in large part because the corresponding 1989 period against which they are compared was the worst in a decade for the industry. Analysts expect the fourth-quarter operating profits for the 12 largest oil producers to increase by an average of 70 percent over the same period in 1989.
The oil executives' somber tone is intended in part to blunt populist opposition in Congress. Given the public anger over high prices at the gas pump since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait last August and the anticipated wild increases in oil company earnings, some representatives drafted bills earlier this month proposing that oil companies be taxed on windfall profits made from the high price of crude.
The breathtaking collapse in crude prices immediately after war flared in the Persian Gulf on Jan. 16 -- prices fell by $10.56 a barrel the next day -- may help muffle opposition on Capitol Hill for now. The closing price on Friday for the March contract of domestic light, sweet crude, was about $21.35 per barrel, far below the average crude price of nearly $30 a barrel in the fourth quarter.
But some longstanding adversaries of Big Oil may not back off so readily. "It is very disturbing to conservationists that the oil companies have profited so greatly by the war and the runup in oil prices," said Sharon Newsome, vice president for resources conservation at the National Wildlife Federation, one environmental group urging the oil companies to put profits into alternative energy sources.
The airline industry, which consumes huge quantities of jet fuel to power its 19,000 flights a day in the United States, is also up in arms and has appealed to Washington for help. It suspects that oil companies kept jet fuel prices high in the last months of the year to recapture profits lost when competition stiffened and demand lapsed in gasoline sales after the initial jump in prices this fall.
While the price of jet fuel was 8 cents a gallon below that of wholesale gasoline when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, it has ranged between 9 and 40 cents per gallon above gasoline since mid-August, according to the Energy Department.
"We have borne far more of the crude-oil price increase," said Edward A. Merlis, vice president of policy and planning at the Air Transport Association, the airlines' trade group in Washington.
Expecting newspaper headlines telling of huge, fourth-quarter profit increases that would soon appear, Kenneth T. Derr, Chevron's chairman, two weeks ago told reporters : "I would hope that we don't end up with a major political problem over a quarter that I would refer to as an anomaly. Today, we are earning at a significantly lower rate than the fourth-quarter average."
The quarterly gains reported by Exxon, Mobil, Texaco, Chevron, Amoco and Shell -- the nation's six largest companies ranked by sales -- were nevertheless dramatic. Net income for the world's largest oil company, Exxon, soared more than threefold, to $1.56 billion. Mobil's profit rose 45.6 percent. Texaco was up 35 percent, and Amoco, by 68.6 percent. Chevron earned $633 million, after a loss of $883 million in the period a year ago, which was caused by write-offs and other charges totaling $1.2 billion. Shell Oil's earnings jumped by 68.9 percent.
In fact, these quarterly profits might have been much larger. But each of the top five lowered their reported profits with bookkeeping tactics that oil giants often employ legally to pare taxes in periods when profits -- and public resentment -- are on the rise.
The five companies settled legal and tax disputes, wrote down the values of aging or unwanted oilfields, tallied losses from jettisoned refineries and plants and added millions to reserves for cleaning up oilfields and refineries.
But the oil companies point out that the write-offs were even heftier in last year's final quarter, another reason the final 1990 quarter appeared so prosperous. Exxon, for instance, wrote off $800 million in the last quarter a year ago for costs to clean up the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. With that expense removed, Exxon's profit in the quarter a year ago was $1.29 billion, and its percentage gain in the 1990 fourth quarter was 21 percent, not 221 percent.
In the fourth quarter of 1990, all of the majors reported spectacular profit increases in their exploration units because crude prices in the averaged about $10 a barrel more than in the last three months of 1989. Mobil's profit in its domestic exploration unit rose more than fivefold, to $68 million, and in its larger foreign unit by 72 percent, to $505 million. The average global price for its crude was $27, compared with $17 in the similar period a year ago.
Because the five companies each refine much more crude oil than they produce, they must buy vast supplies on global crude markets. Exxon, for example, refined an average of 3.3 million barrels of crude a day in the fourth quarter, while producing half as much from its own oilfields, or an average of 1.6 million barrels a day.
Because the price of crude was falling for most of the quarter while retail prices remained steady, profit margins rose for refining operations in most companies. Crude costs moved lower through November and much of December, after rising the previous quarter, and that cut refiners' expenses. Profit margins increased because prices for wholesale and retail gasoline prices drifted lower at a slower rate than crude prices. Those condition were ideal for refining units of most big oil companies.
Despite the spectacular final quarter, the profit picture for all of 1990 was mediocre. That is because world oil prices averaged about $20 a barrel in the first three months of 1990, before slipping below $16 a barrel in the spring quarter. Analysts estimate that year-to-year gains were in a range of 10 percent to 12 percent. Exxon's net income, excluding the huge Valdez expense, rose 7.6 percent. Mobil's profit rose 6.7 percent and Amoco's, by 19 percent.
And contrary to a survey by Chevron showing that most Americans believe oil is more profitable than most businesses, the oil industry has been a weak sister. The industry earned an average of about $12.50 on every $100 of capital invested during the last 20 years, compared with $13.40 for the average industry. Several industries like software, beverages, pharmaceuticals, hotels, gaming and publishing did much better during the 80's.
The surge in crude prices in the last half of 1990 pushed Chevron and Exxon to a rate of return on equity above $15 for every $100. In Chevron's case, it was the first time since 1981.
But that kind of return may be short-lived. The world is awash with oil, a result of rising output, mainly from Saudi Arabia since the Persian Gulf flare up, and slumping demand for crude. And Saddam Hussein has not appeared able to disrupt supplies: Tankers have moved safely from Saudi loading ports on the Persian Gulf since war erupted, apparently out of the reach of Iraqi forces.
"The world has ample crude inventories now, and it is going to have more," said Richard J. Kruizenga, Exxon's vice president for corporate planning. He said global crude supplies amounted to 150 million barrels, and that the surplus was rising by 500,000 barrels a day. Consumption outside the Soviet Union is 54.1 million barrels a day.
Analysts agree that if it were not for trader fears about Saddam Hussein's potential for havoc on oilfields in the Middle East, crude would be selling for far less than $20 a barrel. Dillard P. Spriggs, president of Petroleum Analysis Ltd., in New York, said crude prices could easily fall below $15 if the war ends in a few months.
William L. Randol, an oil analyst at the First Boston Corporation, said oil prices should average a little more than $20 a barrel in 1991 if war ends before summer -- a prospect that means the industry's quarterly gains would not be nearly as spectacular as for the last quarter of 1990.
"It is impossible to forecast what conditions we may face," Mr. Derr of Chevron said this week.
 
 
THE OPTIONS IN ENERGY PATHS
 The prospects of bloodshed in distant oilfields vital to the American economy is certain to intensify the call from Washington for reduced reliance on Middle East oil.
Large oil companies say they want new supplies, too, but will be unable to find them without improvements in profitability, which despite impressions to the contrary, have lagged behind other manufacturers.
A Texaco-sponsored survey showed that the public opposes the use of taxes to finance the search for oil and natural gas in places other than the Middle East, as well as other forms of energy like geothermal, synthetic fuels and methanol, according to a William K. Tell Jr., a company executive. "They want to see the money come from industry investments," he said. "But I don't see how they can expect that if they are critical of the earnings of an industry that is looking at such moderate rates of return."
Many environmentalists fault oil companies for devoting most of their capital budgets to extending their search for oil, preferring that they spend more on renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. "Oil companies have resisted those changes," said Sharon Newsome, of the National Wildlife Federation. "Their alternatives to oil, like oil shale, coal gasification and synfuels, are damaging to the environment and have an enormous impact on global warming."
Yet environmentalists and oil executives have found some common ground in recent years by promoting a cleaner-burning fuel: natural gas. The United States is nearly self-sufficient in natural gas, with known reserves much larger than for oil.
The problem is raising billions of dollars needed to shift a gasoline-reliant economy toward using more natural gas.
Some oil companies have formed partnerships with natural-gas distributors. "If they make a profit doing so, so be it and more power to them," said Jeffrey Seisler of the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition in Washington. "In terms of national security and energy security, this is a very positive move forward."

War Plays Bring Their Own Dangers

BYLINE: By Alison Leigh Cowan

 BODY:
As long as there are wars, there will always be a profit-minded few whose fortunes are made by ministering to the needs of war. The 12-day-old war in the Persian Gulf is no exception.
The Raytheon Company, the defense supplier whose Patriot missiles stole the show early on by intercepting several of Iraq's deadly missiles in midair, is only the latest example of a company whose business outlook has fundamentally improved because of the war's progress in the Persian Gulf. 
 But for every Raytheon, whose stock has risen nearly 10 percent since the war's outbreak, there are wartime wannabes, pretenders that would like to latch on to the huge stock-market rewards available to those who are seen contributing to the war effort, or benefiting by it. The opportunists range from the outright swindlers, whom investors should avoid altogether, to the overzealous, who may receive some windfall from the war but whose premature hype investors should greet skeptically.
Take Sunrise Medical Inc., an otherwise attractive stock that closed Friday over-the-counter at $22.75 a share. The Torrance, Calif.-based company makes beds and mattresses for hospitals and nursing homes and custom wheelchairs and crutches for the retail market.
No sooner had war erupted than the company's public relations firm in New York was calling reporters, breathlessly pitching the company as a war play, one whose fortunes could rise dramatically with events in the Middle East. "This company will not be stymied by a recession and also would benefit from any war situation because it's in the wheelchair and crutches business," said Anthony J. Russo, the chief executive of Noonan/Russo Communications Inc., the public relations firm. Of course, he added, that scenario, "is all contingent on how many casualties there are."
Richard H. Chandler, the company's chairman, admitted that he was a little uncomfortable with Mr. Russo's sales pitch. "These are heroes, and we don't like to be connected with profiting from other people's misfortunes," he said.
But he added that to the extent war would increase the number of disabled Americans, his company would do its part to help out. "Our war wounded don't have to experience the haunting images of 'Born on the Fourth of July,' " he said. "Just like high-tech weaponry is different than in Vietnam, you've also got high-tech products for the disabled that can make a difference in the quality of life."
The company's stock has soared 17.4 percent since the war broke, about 7 percentage points more than the Nasdaq Composite Index over the same period. Some of the run-up is probably because second-quarter earnings are expected to be up nearly 50 percent when they are announced on Tuesday.
Nonetheless, investors should be cautious about factoring any war windfall into their calculations about Sunrise's future worth. Military and securities experts point out that there are several reasons why it may be harder for companies and investors to cash in on the crisis in the Gulf than they may realize. For one thing, the war is going fairly well. With inventories flush and few allied planes being shot from the sky, the military may not have to go shopping anytime soon.
In that light, obvious war plays may look less alluring once investors run the numbers. OEA Inc., a Denver company that makes explosive devices, would have been a logical beneficiary of the war. After all, its devices not only go into the air bags found in cars, but also into the ejector seats in fighter planes.
Has it been? "At most, you're talking about a one-time contribution to earnings of a penny a share," said Ronald Glantz at Dean Witter Reynolds in San Francisco.
Even the companies that have landed huge contracts to supply everything from lip baum to Gatorade to the troops may see little, if any, long-term impact on profitability. A spokeswoman for the Defense Personnel Support Center, an arm of the Defense Department, said the military has awarded $1.9 billion worth of contracts since Desert Shield began in August.
Those dollars, earmarked for food, medical supplies and clothing, are spread over some 300 vendors, and have generally not altered the thinking of Wall Street analysts about the earnings potential of any individual companies. The contracts may not be priced as attractively as commercial contracts. And assuming the war ends shortly, they also may turn out to be one-time contributors to income -- not the sort of earnings that the market tends to notice.
"Wall Street pays for earnings that come from a sustainable trend," said John McMillin, a food analyst at Prudential Bache Securities, "and maybe this is going to be a sustainable trend. But one would hope that we'll get the boys back and this will not be the next Vietnam. That's why I, for one, am not jumping up and down about these sales."
Geo A. Hormel & Company is a good example. It won a $44.4 million contract to sell 25 million entrees to the troops. Mr. McMillin figures that the contract might generate $3 million in after-tax profits, given the product's usual margins. That would add 4 cents to the $1.20 a share that the company is already expected to earn. "It might give them a little kick," said Mr. McMillin. "But you've got to question the sustainability of the business. Nobody will pay a big multiple for one-time events."
And investors should pay nothing at all for the dubious wares being hawked by unscrupulous promoters who spring into action anytime market sentiment shifts. The North American Securities Administrators Association warned consumers in August about telephone solicitations pushing phony oil and gas partnerships or precious-metal investments.
"Almost always, they latch on to what's hot," said John Perkins, the president of the Washington group. "It's their form of advertising."

Now, Almost Everyone Has Become Energy-Dependent
 
Even our modern-day Newcastle has to bring in some fuel. Saudi Arabia, the world's second-largest oil producer, has imported 8 million barrels of diesel and jet fuel to power the attack against Iraq. American forces guzzle gasoline faster than the rush-hour crowd on the Ventura Freeway; some tanks get only about 3,000 feet to the gallon. The shortage comes not in crude oil, but in end products. "The quantities used are enormous and the refinery capacity is elsewhere," said Robert G. Neumann, director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. The situation is worse in Iraq, which has banned fuel sales to civilians. And in Kuwait, the Iraqis set wellheads and refineries on fire last week. Christopher Flavin, an energy specialist at the Worldwatch Institute, said it might take Kuwait five years to rebuild. In his view, the United States will be as vulnerable to energy shortages as ever in the coming decade. "Future crises are all but inevitable," he said.

 Those Embarrassing Oil Profits
 
They marked down assets likely to be sold. They reduced their earnings to account for environmental costs. But still, the oil companies had to admit that they had a darned good fourth quarter. Exxon's earnings tripled, Amoco's rose by more than two-thirds, Texaco's by more than one-third and Mobil's by nearly half. Their executives did their best to avoid celebrating or even cracking into smiles. Instead, they churned out press releases about how unlikely their strong earnings were to recur. Maybe so, given the volatility of oil prices. Still, what oil company wants to be caught profiting from the belligerence of Saddam Hussein?
 
Who's to Feed the Soviets?
 
Leningrad residents, startled to see chicken legs in the stores, call them nozhki Busha -- literally, legs of Bush -- assuming they came from the United States. But President Bush is under strong pressure from Congress to reduce assistance and postpone a summit meeting planned for next month. The European Parliament held up approval of $1 billion in food aid last week to protest Moscow's attack on independence groups in the Baltic republics. The United States has offered as much as $1 billion in credit guarantees for Soviet purchases of food. President Bush, relying on the Soviets to support his attack on Iraq, has so far shown little inclination to cut Soviet off food supplies at the legs.
 
A Foreign Boost for Airlines
 
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner has a new foreign aid program for the nation's airlines. On Wednesday, he announced that non-American carriers could buy as much as half the equity in United States airlines, up from 25 percent, as long as they held no more than 25 percent of the voting stock. Mr. Skinner's ruling allows the Dutch airline KLM to keep its 49 percent interest in Northwest Airlines, acquired in a complicated transaction. Several of the nation's airlines, which lost an estimated $2 billion last year, are hungry for foreign capital.
 
Whither the Price of Oil?
 
Iraqi missile attacks on Israel and apparent arson at Kuwaiti oil fields aroused second thoughts last week about whether oil should sell for less than $20 a barrel. After a dramatic fall to $19.25 during the week war broke out, prices stabilized and closed last week at $21.35.
 
Soviet Ruble Recall
 
If wealth in the Soviet Union is almost a crime, then only criminals will have wealth. This, anyway, is one likely outcome of the sudden declaration last week that 50- and 100-ruble notes will become worthless except for the limited amounts that can be exchanged for smaller bills. Aides to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev argue that black marketeers have piled up their earnings in the higher denominations. But state workers, new entrepeneurs and the retired are the ones saving rubles. Most anyone who plays the black market has also found ways to convert rubles into dollars, stereos and jeans. Herbert S. Levine, a Soviet specialist at the University of Pennsylvania, called the ruble recall a bureaucratic mess, unlikely to shore up the currency's value as long as the Government keeps printing more money to paper over its budget deficits. "It's a confiscatory currency reform," he said. Four Soviet republics, including Russia, challenged the plan by allowing more time for the exchange of large bills.
 
THE ECONOMY

 
More Gloomy Numbers
 
The nation's output fell at an annual rate of 2.1 percent during the last quarter of 1990, the worst showing since 1982. The nine-tenths of 1 percent growth rate in the 1990 gross national product was also the worst in eight years. Economists were initially impressed -- many had feared worse, and a weak auto industry accounted for all of the quarter's decline. But then some remembered that Friday's figure is subject to revision. Alan C. Lerner, an economist at the Bankers Trust Company, said that other indicators have reflected "much more widespread weakness."
 
Another Bailout?
 
The fund that insures bank deposits could be insolvent as early as next year and $23 billion in the red by 1995, the White House has said. The projection, in a budget request, raises the prospect of another huge taxpayer bailout. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is also likely to raise the premiums that banks pay to the fund. After three years of losses, the fund is already in its worst shape since it was created in 1934.
 
Points of Light Grow Dim
 
Economists looking over statistics on charitable giving say that Americans have become less inclined to share their wealth. Reduced tax rates in the top brackets account for some of the stinginess, as the potential tax savings from charity diminish. But the gains in giving that were expected as Americans have grown wealthier since the 1950's have never materialized; contributions still represent about 2 percent of G.N.P. Republicans might point to over-reliance on the welfare state, while Democrats decry the other party's faith in enlightened self-interest. Edward O. Wilson, the sociobiologist, has noted that ants share food even when hungry; among Americans, plenty seems to merely create an appetite for more.
 
Columbia Savings' Turn
 
Federal regulators seized the Columbia Savings and Loan Association, the industry's largest buyer of "junk bonds," on Friday. The Beverly Hills institution, closely allied with Drexel Burnham Lambert and Michael Milken, bought more than $4 billion worth, now probably worth less than two-thirds as much.
 
 
COMPANIES

 
General Cinema's Synergies
 
Imagine the synergies that could result if the General Cinema Corporation, which controls Neiman Marcus, completes its acquisition of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich: When designers have a passion for purple, Neiman's could offer their fashions along with Alice Walker's most famous book. On a counter displaying chunky Mexican silver, the store could stack some novels by the Nobel laureate Octavio Paz. Analysts had thought that General Cinema was happier serving up Hollywood mayhem and mirth than the doings of Georges Simenon's Inspector Maigret. The $1.4 billion bid that Harcourt accepted on Thursday would rescue a publisher suffocating in debt. But some Harcourt bondholders might object to a deal giving them far less than full value.
 
G. Heileman and Its Bondholders
 
Used to be that a bankruptcy filing was a company's last exit. But these days, it's more like a highway tollbooth. The G. Heileman Brewing Company asked for bankruptcy protection Thursday in a New York court often regarded as favorable to debtors. The company. based in Chicago, was inundated with debt when Alan Bond of Australia bought it out in 1987. Executives acted as giddy last week as if they had downed several six-packs of their Colt .45 and Carling's Black Label products. They announced plans to continue business as usual, with no layoffs, no production cuts, but the likely slaughter of their bondholders. As a spokesman boasted about the bankruptcy process, "This forces a negotiation with the unsecured bondholders so that a package can be wrapped up."
 
Air Travel and the Free Market
 
Up, up and away: Eastern Air Lines might be permanently grounded, but its competitors' fares are soaring. No more $158 round trips between New York and Florida; for some airlines, the price will go to $279. Other destinations in the South can cost more than a round trip from New York to London. "The loss of one or more airlines will not necessarily mean less competition," Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner assured travelers last week. He explained that higher fares mean healthier airlines which mean more competition which just might mean better bargains in the long run. But so far, free, deregulated enterprise is working better in the abstract than in the air.
 
Pepsico's Super Bowl Punt
 
After a long huddle with the Federal Communications Commission, Pepsico Inc. decided to punt. The company dropped plans for a Super Bowl commercial that might have tangled the nation's telephone system. Pepsi had planned to flash a toll-free number, then give $1 million to each of three randomly chosen callers. Federal officials and telephone company executives warned that as many as 50 million would try to call. The resulting delays in completing other phone calls could slow the dispatch of fire engines, ambulances and police. "It would have been as if everyone in New York City decided to flush their toilets all at once," said a spokesman for an association of local phone companies.

HEADLINE: Novo-Nordisk Rides the Enzyme Tide

BYLINE: By ISRAEL SHENKER; Israel Shenker is a former reporter for The New York Times who now lives in Scotland.

 BODY:
Copenhagen's Assistens Cemetery is one of the burial sites established after the plague of 1711.
Upon visiting the cemetery -- centuries after that plague -- Otto Andresen surreptitiously scraped samples of soil from the graves of Soren Kierkegaard, Denmark's most illustrious philosopher, and Niels Bohr, the nation's foremost physicist. 
 Hans Christian Andersen, the great storyteller, is buried in the cemetery, but where? Mr. Andresen did not find the grave, but he took a sample from a rotting heap of leaves.
Back in his lab, he got nowhere with the soil from the two graves. But the compost heap yielded a bacillus that produced an enzyme that could break down proteins. Dubbed Esperase, the enzyme is now marketed as a key ingredient for detergents by Denmark's Novo-Nordisk, where Mr. Andresen is a research scientist.
Foraging in places like burial grounds and Malaysian jungles for molds and fungi that might contain enzymes useful to the industrial world is all in a day's work for a world-class enzyme-maker. Today, Novo-Nordisk produces half the world's industrial enzymes -- those that are mass produced in a factory for commercial use. Many of them, used for everything from wine making to breaking down barley so that it is digestible by chickens -- were developed as serendipitously as was Esperase.
On the horizon are enzymes for everything from treating toxic waste to turning undigestible plant cellulose into digestible sugar. There indeed is plenty of room for Novo-Nordisk, which now derives about 30 percent of its revenues from enzymes, to grow. Of the thousands of naturally occurring enzymes, fewer than 50 have been isolated for commercial use.
The company is also an important force in the medical market, making almost half the world's commercial insulin supply and a broad array of enzyme-based pharmaceuticals. In fact, Novo-Nordisk is the result of a merger in 1989 of two world leaders in insulin development production -- Novo Laboratories and Nordisk Gentofte.
"Almost all insulin innovation has come from these two companies," said Mads Ovlisen, the managing director of Novo-Nordisk. "That's the only reason they have managed to stay alive while others fell by the wayside."
The combined company had pretax profits of $121 million on sales of about $845 million in 1989. More than 90 percent of those revenues came from abroad. In the first nine months of 1990, sales were running comfortably ahead of year-earlier results.
With research laboratories in five countries, Novo-Nordisk employs 7,500 people and has four large factories in Denmark and others in Switzerland, France, Japan, Brazil, South Africa, Canada and the United States.
Enzymes -- from the Greek word for "in yeast" -- are catalysts, chemical tools that trigger or accelerate a biochemical reaction and survive unchanged, ready to work their magic again. In the body, enzymes break down starch, protein and fat during digestion so that cells can absorb the nourishment. This degradation also occurs throughout nature. When a tree topples, it decays because of enzymes in microorganisms. A compost heap, like the one at Assistens, is nothing more than a living factory seething with enzymes.
"I'm a chemical engineer," said Mr. Andresen. "What I know about microbiology I've learned since I came to Novo."
In fact, he was able to isolate the microorganism that led to the discovery of Esperase largely because of his orientation. "If I'd trained as a microbiologist, I probably would never have discovered the microorganism," he said. "I performed the screening at high pH [high alkalinity], and microbiologists wouldn't be likely to do that, since they are taught that microorganisms rarely survive at high pH."
Mr. Andresen was instrumental in another finding. He showed his father, Paul Andresen, a physician, how to take soil samples, before the doctor went off to visit a distant relative, the Sultan of Johore, in Malaysia. While in tiger and monkey country, Dr. Andresen used a small wooden tongue depressor to scrape jungle soil into plastic bags.
He eventually delivered the soil samples to his son. "The sample from the tiger area didn't lead anywhere," Dr. Andresen said. But the sample from the monkey reserve yielded an enzyme that Novo-Nordisk now calls Promozyme, used in degrading starch to sugar.
Another Novo adventurer, Knud Aunstrup, returned from summer holiday some years ago and found that his brother-in-law had mowed the lawn for him. That made a heap of clippings, and in the humid weather the microbes inside heated up this compost heap. Mr. Aunstrup took samples from the center of the pile, isolated fungi, and tested for enzymes. When he added milk to one fungus the milk promptly coagulated. Mr. Aunstrup -- and Novo -- now had the microbial source for Rennilase. That is an industrial enzyme that now replaces rennin from the stomachs of lambs and calves in making cheese, including such pedigree products as Camembert, Cheddar, Edam, Emmental and Tilsit.
One primitive, but effective technique to unearth an enzyme for breaking down a particular compound is to pour a bit of the compound on the ground -- and then examine the soil and find the microorganisms that have degraded the chemical. "Some people will know what microorganisms will do just by looking at them," said Mr. Aunstrup.
Looking at microorganisms was crucial for Japan's Lion company, an industrial concern, three years ago. Its competitor's Attack detergent was conquering all rivals. Threatened with defeat in the battle for customers, Lion called for a "counter-Attack."
No one had managed by then to produce an economic commercial enzyme that overpowered fat and grease while withstanding protein-destroying enzymes. Novo had been seeking just such a product for years, but at the urging of Lion, it took an even closer look.
After screening hundreds of fungi at its lab in Japan, Novo produced a white, fibrous fungus. Then, at its headquarters in Bagsvaerd, outside Copenhagen, a genetic engineer transferred one of the genes of the white fungus to a strain of Aspergillus, a fungus adept at reproducing itself and producing proteins. A flask containing the modified organism was then fixed in the embrace of a machine which for five days shook it to a fare-thee-well. On Sept. 10, 1987, a small quantity of olive oil was added to the cloudy, brownish mass. Ten minutes later, chemical analysis confirmed the triumph.
Novo had an enzyme that could be incorporated in detergents to break down stains produced by frying fats, butter, salad oil, sauces, lipstick, shoe polish and body grease, as well as eliminate stubborn dirt on collars and cuffs. Jubilant scientists celebrated with lots of another enzymatically assisted product called beer.
But Danish regulation of genetic engineering is draconian, and Novo would have had to wait months for government approval of industrial production. So Novo flew a tiny vial of about a thousandth of a liter of the wondrous substance -- capable of producing the enzyme called Lipolase -- to its Japanese factory on Hokkaido. The Japanese worked quickly, granting permission to produce that Dec. 13; work began the same day.
The first batches of Lipolase were ready by Christmas, and in January Lion began cleaning up with enriched Hi-Top. Danish production permission for the enzyme eventually came through the next summer.
Enzymes have also been put to work at other nasty tasks. Since ancient days, dog or pigeon dung, for example, had been used to soften leather. The job is now done with trypsin, an enzyme from a pig's pancreas.
Trypsin has worked overtime in the unlikely field of Egyptology. With X-rays, researchers could see -- but not read -- an ancient text written on papyrus covered with plaster. A biochemist used trypsin to separate the plaster from the papyrus and fully reveal a text that goes back to the third millenium before the Christian era.
Copenhagen's National Museum has about 13,000 artifacts of amber, a soft, semiprecious gemstone. To preserve the relics, a conservator at the museum prescribed a coating of glycerin mixed with gelatin -- glycerin for luster, gelatin for binding. But as the gelatin dehydrated, it contracted and cracked the amber. To remove the gelatin and prevent further damage, conservator Dorte Gramtorp used an enzyme called Neutrase.
Starch-bearing crops such as corn, wheat, sorghum and rice produce high-fructose syrup and may free people from dependence on traditional sugar sources. High-fructose syrup provides the sweetness in colas. In baking bread and cake, enzymes increase volume, softness and shelf life. Pizzas and bagels are improved by enzymes.
Industrial enzymes efficiently extract oils, coffee, tea, proteins and starches from seeds, fruits, leaves or roots. Baker's yeast yields the enzyme required to make chocolates with liquid centers. And enzymes can give jeans their fashionable faded look.
Enzymes are playing increasingly vital roles in improving the environment, and in detecting, analyzing and treating disease. More than 125 human diseases stem from enzyme deficiency, and medical scientists are using commercial enzymes to attack these diseases.
The possibilities make for a promising future for Novo-Nordisk. Noted Mr. Ovlisen, its managing director: "We're not going to go out and buy a dance school or an airline because we don't know anything about them. What we will do is stick to what we know and can do best."

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
Using Zeros as a Safe Harbor

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
Playing the financial markets these days is like hopping a ride on a rogue freight train: You may reach your destination or your investment may be completely derailed.
Given today's volatility, the idea that investors can know exactly what they will have in hand several years down the road is gaining popularity and "target maturity" funds -- basically, packages of zero-coupon bonds -- have taken off. In 1985, there were five, with $10.5 million in assets. Now there are eight, with assets of $711.2 million, according to Morningstar Inc., a Chicago-based mutual fund consulting firm. Most of the explosive growth came in the last two years. 
 Zero-coupon bonds have been around for years. They are sold at a steep discount to their face value and when held to maturity pay a predictable rate of return. The downside, of course, is that if the market rises sharply, you don't benefit from potential gains. Zeros become more volatile investments if you don't hold them to maturity, and some short-term investors use them as interest rate plays. But their main attraction these days is the rate of return guaranteed at maturity.
Two big fund companies have set up mutual funds to capitalize on their popularity. The biggest forces in the market are the Benham Capital Management Group, based in Mountain View, Calif., and Scudder, Stevens & Clark, based in New York. The Benham and Scudder funds are portfolios of zero-coupon United States Treasury securities that mature in five-year increments.
 Should these funds be in your portfolio? That depends on what you want them for. Benham and Scudder pitch their funds as tools to meet future investment goals, "college tuition, for example, a vacation home or retirement," the Scudder brochure suggests. The lure is powerful: high-quality holdings, predictable returns.
But there is a problem. The price for the convenience may be too high. Benham's expense ratio -- the ratio of fund expenses to average net assets -- is .70. Scudder charges even more; its expense ratio is 1.0 percent. The funds, however, are simply packages of bonds and not actively traded like other types of bond funds. They simply manage the cash flow when investors buy or sell in or out of the funds. As a result, the funds "are not doing a heck of a lot for their money," said Lewis J. Altfest, who runs an investment advisory firm in New York.
Still, the sharp increase in assets under management at these funds shows that investors seem to believe advantages outweigh disadvantages. Funds make sense for small investors because they require only a $1,000 minimum investment. By contrast, to get competitive interest rates, investors buying zeros directly would have to spend at least $4,500 to $5,000; that would buy a zero with a face value of $10,000.
Another advantage of buying zeros through a fund instead of directly is that the volume discount given to large buyers raises returns. Recently, for example, the annualized return for investors who bought $1 million lots of zeros and held them to maturity was 8.3 percent; investors with lots of $10,000 got only 7.94 percent.
But if you buy zeros directly and do not plan to hold them until maturity, the numbers change. Let's say you bought zeros with $10,000 face value directly and sold them after one year. Because of the transaction costs, your return would drop to 4.88 percent, from 7.94 percent. Each year you hold zeros, you lose less as the bond appreciates. After four years, the return is 7.33 percent. That's roughly equal to what you would get from the Scudder funds, which bought $1 million lots for an anticipated one-year return of 8.33 percent, after you subtract the expense ratio.
Mr. Altfest's rule: If you plan to sell before four years or so, buy through a fund. But if you plan to hold zeros until maturity, buy them directly because, over time, the annual expense ratio eats into the return.
Because of the price volatility that comes from selling zeros before maturity, zeros make sense for investors who want to play interest rates. The consensus among market analysts calls for falling rates over the next several months or so. Given an identical drop in rates, a five-year zero will be worth more than a five-year coupon bond. So it can pay to own zeros for a short time -- say, six months to two years -- to reap benefits of falling rates. In this case, it makes sense to buy them through a fund because there are no fees for buying or selling fund shares.
For some investors who want to make interest-rate moves, though, there are better alternatives than target maturity funds, says Kenneth E. Gregory, a partner in Litman/Gregory, San Francisco-based investment advisers. He says the Benham Target Maturities Trust 2000 responds to changes in interest rates in roughly the same way as a 30-year Treasury bond. For interest-rate plays, he likes the Vanguard U.S. Treasury Fund, with an expense ratio of .36 percent compared to Benham's .70 percent. Similarly, the Target 1995 Fund is about as volatile as the Vanguard Bond Market Fund, which costs about one-third of the Benhamfund.

BYLINE: By Enid Nemy

 BODY:
As far as spending is concerned, whoever came up with the phrase "we've gone from an era of swashbuckling to one of belt-buckling," had it down pat, although perhaps belt-tightening might have been more apt. The fact is that even the people who are not worried about money or affected by the economy are cutting down, watching what they spend and thinking several times before they do it. It's not only that untrammeled extravagance is now beyond bad taste; it's a general feeling that restraint is both in and desirable.
For many people, this new climate is almost a relief, freeing the mind from a lot of trivia that once seemed if not important at least expedient and conserving both energy and hours that were often spent on unnecessary and frequently self-indulgent activities. If this is not yet (and, indeed, may never be) an era of complete stripping down, it is at least one of contraction in varying degrees. 
 Perhaps the greatest indication of change in attitude is the willingness of most men and women to talk about the ways they have cut their spending or, from the other point of view, methods they now use to save money.
The smallest in terms of savings, but possibly one of the biggest changes, is the number of people who now clip and use coupons when grocery shopping. It's not that coupons weren't always widely used, but the current economic unease has converted many other people, career fast-trackers who once claimed that the time involved in coupon-clipping outweighed the saving.
It has been documented that many restaurants, particularly the more expensive, are suffering. But in addition to seeking more reasonably priced meals, a considerable number of diners are changing the way they order. Some who once chose three courses have cut out appetizers; others have eliminated dessert and a smaller percentage are settling only for the main course. And as a result of a development that combines money-saving and what appears to be a change in eating patterns, more than a few diners are choosing two appetizers instead of an entree.
Dorothy Leeds is one person who now eliminates at least one course when she eats out and frequently bypasses the main course in favor of two small appetizers. She's also taking a further step. "This is a good time to eat less, to diet," she said. "I'm doing it, but I'm trying to make it fun."
Ms. Leeds, president of Organizational Technologies Inc., a management and sales consulting organization, said her attitude was that economizing should be looked on as a challenge and so far, she hasn't found any of it too difficult or upsetting.
"I walk more," she said. "If I have an appointment within 20 or 25 blocks, I don't take a bus; I stand in the half-price ticket line for the theater; I turn off lights when I leave the room; I let my haircuts go a little longer."
Although she has always bought some of her wardrobe through catalogues, "I used to buy whatever I wanted," she said. Now she marks what she wants, goes over the list a day later and eliminates some of the items, leaves it another day and cuts out some more. By the time she sends off her order, it is usually only 25 percent of what she originally marked.
"I ask myself more questions before buying and ordering," she said.
John Barman, an interior designer, isn't canceling a planned ski trip but, other than that, he said, "I'm postponing all pleasure travel."
Mr. Barman said he has found his clients "really concerned about costs, even if they have a lot of money." He frequently suggests reupholstery, rather than new furniture, cleaning and refinishing instead of discarding, and freshening up a room with new wallpaper, rather than redoing the whole thing.
Janet Odgis buys clothes for her 2-year-old son, Ivan, at end-of-season sample sales and is doing more of the same thing for herself. She is also buying more accessories and fewer larger items and she visits the shoemaker more often rather than buying new shoes. She has found, too, that renting videos is not only cheaper than going to the movies but, she said, "it also saves a baby sitter."
Not too long ago Peter Higgins, an owner of the Hudson River Club, didn't think twice about taking a $13 taxi ride from midtown to his downtown office. "It's out of the question now," he said. "I take the subway."
Mr. Higgins is yet another person getting more repairs and alterations done to his current wardrobe, and although he still belongs to a health club, he doesn't sign up for any extras.
"The whole period of self-indulgence has ended very quickly," he said.

HEADLINE: About Cars;
New Technology Chips Away at Noise

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
There is such a thing as gee-whiz journalism, and I will admit to being a sometime practioner. But how can you not be excited about the likes of Acura's NSX supercar? Or antilock brakes, which prevent skids and save lives?
And how can you not think this latest technology is amazing, not to say magic?
Since the early days, one element of automobiles has been neglected by the inventors. It has been that simple but annoying factor, noise. But now, one man has gone after it, cornering patents and making deals with Fiat and other multinational companies, all in the aid of silence. 
 His name is Thomas H. Hesse. He is a 54-year- old native of New York, a graduate of Brooklyn Tech. He is a former Air Force computer analyst, a 22-year veteran of I.B.M. and the former North American sales director of I.T.T. He loves New York but he lives in Phoenix, Ariz., where he says it is hot but you don't have to shovel it, and he is now the president and major stockholder of a company that has its finger on the world's thumping pulse.
His company is called Active Noise and Vibration Technologies Inc., a properly unmelodic name since it threatens to hush the song of engines everywhere.
"There is not one car manufacturer in the world that is not talking to us or to the people we work with," Hesse said modestly. "We now have acquired about 300 man-years of work and about $30 million worth of research."
See? Is that worth being excited about or what? But you still don't have a handle on what I'm talking about, and that is either major gee-whiz or pretty bad editing. So let's get to it.
What Hesse and company are proposing is an electronic solution to noise. And, put simply, it uses the microchip to break down sound waves and then to produce antiwaves that are exactly the same but 180 degrees out of phase, rendering the original cacophony soundless. In other words, loud from loud is zero.
"As an example," he said, "we have done some things with the military where they didn't want to be able to hear a vehicle. And we can get it so that when a 1,600-horsepower tank is rolling across the desert, you can't hear it."
That has advantages, obviously, not only for stealth in a military sense but for buzzy boats and helicopters and civilian factories. And cars.
"There are four primary automobile applications, and we are focusing on them in a joint venture with Fiat," Hesse said. "They are electronic muffler systems, in-vehicle quieting systems, electronic motor mounts, and electronic headrests which would replace normal headrests to quiet certain zones around the driver."
Hesse likes the term "zone of silence," and he admits to being a fan of the old Maxwell Smart television show, in which Max and the Chief routinely conferred about spy stuff under a Cone of Silence. That, essentially, is what you can have in an automobile's interior with the "in-vehicle quieting system," which uses the radio to counteract unwanted external noise.
"I talked to the head engineer at Porsche," Hesse said. "He said buyers liked to hear the engines in their cars, and I asked him if they wanted to hear the engine when they were trying to listen to the radio. The answer was no, and he asked if I could cancel the noise only when the radio was on. I said 'Why not?' "
In this application, the radio has a built-in microphone which feeds ambient sound to a computer. The computer measures the noise and generates antinoise through the same speakers that are playing the music. Hesse's company is working with a Japanese radio producer to come up with an after-market version.
Even with the radio off, though, the headrest option can make a car fairly silent. In this case, the headrest uses two speakers to emit an antidote and cancel the differing sounds that assault a driver's left and right sides. The headrest is particularly useful in eliminating wind noise, one of the company's more difficult challenges.
"The problem is what to do when you have an open convertible or a boat or a helicopter," Hesse said. "The answer is to cancel sound only where the operator's head is, so you use two electronic cancellors, one on each side of the head because the noises are different, and you transmit independent zones of silence."
Uh huh. But the automotive applications that promise more than just quiet and a lack of driver stress are the electronic exhaust system and motor mounts.
With the computerized muffler (and it's hard to believe such a phrase is possible), a straight- through exhaust system terminates in a microphone that feeds the sound to a chip. The processor reads the tone and sends an out-of-phase image to speakers that cancel all sound. Voila, no burble!
"The result with the straight-through exhaust and lack of back-pressure is that you get an 8 to 10 percent increase in performance and fuel economy along with a cleaner burning engine," Hesse said.
But perhaps even more amazing are the company's engine mounts, which remove vibration and lend a hush to the passenger compartment. In a conventional rubber mount, the material compresses as the engine throbs. In the compressed mode, vibration transmits to the car's structure, and that translates into noise for the occupants.
"We place an electronic device inside the rubber mount, which is then controlled by the computer," Hesse said. "That takes the dynamic vibration out of the mount, cancelling it before it goes into the structure."
At idle, he said, a conventionally mounted engine may turn at 750 r.p.m., which would be its optimum for reasonable smoothness. "And it burns gas at that rate," Hesse said. "But if I put electronic engine mounts on the car, I can get the engine to turn at 200 r.p.m., and that means a big improvement in fuel economy."
He is proving all this, he said, in work with Honda and with test vehicles that include an AMC Jeep, a Ford Thunderbird, a Mercury Sable, a new Chrysler and a large cab-over truck. In Europe, the company is working with Renault, Peugeot and Fiat.
Sure sounds like gee-whiz to me.

HEADLINE: Newark Arts Center: Other Opinions

 BODY:
Re: "Arts Center's Impact on Newark Debated," Dec. 16: The construction of a cultural center at the cost of $200 million (read $300 million before it is finished) in poor, dirty, old, tired and mismanaged Newark will not aid its 325,000 residents. We must learn from history. Ancient Rome died because the leaders sponsored circuses instead of providing for basic human needs.
Newark decorates its light posts in the downtown area with banners, which are changed four times a year at a cost of $100,000. That amount paid in salaries for in-house management of some of the now abandoned housing, including the old Military Park Hotel, where the arts center is supposed to go, would begin to solve one of the basic needs -- shelter for the low-income and homeless people of the city.
The managers would also be teachers. Basic trades to maintain the buildings, like painting and plumbing, would be the responsibility of the residents.
If performance is to be used to judge a city before an investment is made in it, Newark strikes out. This theme is reinforced in the article by the statement of George Sternlieb of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers. He believes that people "will still be afraid to go there," and he doubts "whether the people of Newark really want it."
I can go a step beyond this. The Mayor and other leaders of the city do not want guests. Evidence of this is readily visible.
I visit Symphony Hall at the southern end of Broad Street when the New Jersey Symphony is in session. Hundreds of dedicated people, most elderly, are not provided with safe crossing on Broad Street after they park their cars at one of the costly lots. Traffic on the street is fast because it is a wide, open thoroughfare. But police control is sporadic. Surely many subscribers, including me, will think before renewing subscriptions.
From the suburbs, many dedicated attendees use chartered buses to get to concerts. One might think there would be drop-off space at the curb for the safety of these folk -- again, mostly elderly. Not in Newark.
Symphony Hall, owned and operated by the city, does not get the tender loving care so badly needed in this fine old building. I have found fire exits blocked and doors jammed. Lighting and cleanliness are neglected. Newark's citizens and their leaders make little or no effort to entice visitors to the hall. We cannot expect this to change.
A direct indicator of lack of interest by Newark, and the management of the New Jersey Symphony, in cultural affairs lies in the fact that at each concert there are a few hundred vacant seats. These are in the mezzanine area. Why are these seats not provided at a nominal cost (perhaps $3 to cover transportation) to the students in Newark and surrounding communities? With leadership by school officials, especially music teachers, hundreds of music-hungry children could hear and see a fine orchestra.
Newark is an Urban Aid city. All New Jersey taxpayers underwrite funds to keep it afloat. But if my observations are an example, the money is wasted in trying to develop image and in poor managerial performance.
I am willing to allow my taxes go to the city. People need shelter, water, sewers, fire and police protection and health-care facilities. A handful of zealots are attempting to "help" the city via the cultural center plan, saying there will be jobs during the construction and for operation of the project. A few million dollars have already been spent in planning and propagandizing the idea.
It should be stopped immediately. Until such time as Newark displays genuine interest in basic needs for all its residents, all public and private funds should be curtailed.
My roots are in Newark. I want to see it restored to health. I invite all to join all programs to rebuild from the ground up while voicing opposition to wasteful, pie-in-the-sky imagery like the cultural center plan.

HEADLINE: Lest We Forget the Battles on the Home Front

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Iron Medal" by Tom Wicker (column, Jan. 9) offers some sobering statistics about the social and economic costs of the country's drug-control policies. Since I hold several jobs in fields related to criminal justice, I have several perspectives on the problem. The composite picture they present is not encouraging. 
 Four days a week, I work with at-risk youths in foster care in New York State. None of these teen-agers believe that prison or homelessness is in their future. Unfortunately, their optimism is unrealistic. Many will fail to obtain a high school diploma or general equivalency diploma, and for only a small minority does gainful employment lie ahead.
Three mornings a week, I interview criminal defendants in Westchester County to determine their suitability for pretrial release. Few qualify for consideration, because of previous conflicts with the law and irretrievably broken family ties, typically the result of unchecked drug abuse. While many detainees express a desire to participate in an inpatient drug-treatment program, this must be evaluated in light of their chronic homelessness as well as their wish to get "clean." Often, they have no stable address to return to.
Two evenings a week, I teach word processing to former offenders at the Fortune Society in New York City. These people are the survivors -- the ones who have made the decision to break the cycle of street to prison and back again. They are serious and dedicated students who realize how difficult it is to compete in today's job market and are willing to put forth the effort to learn new skills. Unfortunately, many of their peers will have given up and become the statistics cited by Mr. Wicker.
We need a great deal more public debate on the demographics of incarceration, and the social and legal policies that lead up to imprisonment. Despite the important events taking place elsewhere in the world at this time, we must not lose sight of what amounts to a war on a large segment of our own population right here at home.

HEADLINE: Business Groups Urge New Farm Trade Talks

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26

 BODY:
Business groups from throughout the world, at an unprecedented meeting here Thursday and Friday, pushed for a resumption of the trade talks that broke down last month in Brussels over the European Community's refusal to negotiate farm policies with the United States and other leading food-exporting nations.
While the war in the Persian Gulf has cut chances for reviving the stalled global trade negotiations in time to meet a March 1 deadline for presenting a completed package to Congress, lawmakers say the outbreak of the fighting may have improved the prospects for the extension that President Bush is expected to seek in a few weeks. 
 "Congress would tend to be more sympathetic on grounds of war solidarity, and if members can be convinced that gains are substantial enough, then I think it reasonable to assume that extension is appropriate and achievable," said Senator Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska, a senior Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
The impasse on the farm issue has blocked broader efforts to liberalize world trade under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
"Business in the U.S., Europe and Japan is just not satisfied to see governments say we tried, but we didn't succeed. That's not good enough," said R. K. Morris, director of international trade for the National Association of Manufacturers.
The 13,500-member association is the chief sponsor of the meeting, which included the Keidanren, the No. 1 Japanese business group; the Union of Industrial and Employers Conferations of Europe, the business federation of the 12-nation European Community, and a number of national organizations like the Bundesverband der DeutschenIndustrie, the Confederation of British Industry, the Conseil National du Patronat Francais and others.
The organizations at the meeting represent companies doing 75 to 80 percent of world trade and employ nearly 300 million workers.
 
Wider Benefits Are Seen
 The business organizations say they are trying to convince political leaders that a compromise on agriculture could bring about the wider benefits of liberalization in manufacturing and services, which provide most of the industrialized world's jobs and income.
A joint statement issued at the end of the two-day meeting said the need for a positive outcome of the farm trade negotiations was more urgent in light of the war in the gulf, the serious difficulties besetting the movement towardpolitical and economic liberalization in Eastern Europe, and the economic downturn in the United States and other large economies.
The statement warned that if the negotiations failed, international business relationships and prospects for world growth could be endangered.
While the European Community has yet to present any concrete offers, it is strongly signaling that wants to break the deadlock and is preparing for radical and highly controversial changes in its farm policy.
American and European officials believe the changes, which have been forced by the expensive rebuilding of food stocks in Europe, could be the basis for a compromise in the trade talks over coming months.
"It's the beginning of a process, and is likely to take some time," said theDeputy United States Trade Representative, Julius L. Katz.
"Realistically, we couldn't finish the negotiations by March 1," Mr. Katz said in an interview. "But we're still hoping to be able to report enough progress to justify an extension of time."
Andreas Van Agt, the European Community's Ambassador to Washington, also waved an olive branch by speaking of the "bold policy review" now under way in Brussels "to realign the community's agricultural policy and bring it in line with its responsibility as the world's largest food importer."

HEADLINE: ECUADOR FIGHTING TO AVOID DRUG LINK

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador, Jan. 20

 BODY:
Sandwiched between Colombia, the world's largest cocaine refiner, and Peru, the world's largest coca leaf grower, tiny Ecuador is fighting to keep out of South America's drug trade.
For the moment, the tranquillity of this Pacific Coast country contrasts sharply with the violence of its big neighbors. 
 Well-heeled American tourists clog hotels here on their way to nature tours of the Galapagos Islands. Without bodyguards, businessmen and politicians travel freely around this city, the nation's economic capital.
But reminders are frequent that the multi-billion-dollar drug business is at Ecuador's door.
 
500 Pounds of Cocaine Seized
 Acting on a tip last month, policemen descended on the docks of this sweltering port and seized 500 pounds of cocaine hidden in a shipment of wooden doors bound for the United States. A busy container port, Guayaquil was cited as the port of origin for about 20 cocaine shipments seized last year in ships around the world.
"Ecuador's ports are second in importance in Latin America to those of Colombia," said a recent Interpol report on cocaine trafficking.
A Guayaquil Congressman conducted an inquiry last month that concluded that the amount of drug money laundered in Ecuador virtually doubled last year to $700 million, a huge sum for a $12 billion economy.
Farmers complain that cash-rich Colombian investors are bidding up farmland in border areas, sometimes paying three times going values. One town, Santo Domingo de los Colorados, has received so much Colombian investment that locals jokingly call it "Santo Domingo de los Colombianos."
"The drug business is coming to Ecuador, almost though osmosis because of its geographical position," said Jose Ulloa Vernimmen, an editor of Guayaquil's largest newspaper, El Universo. "There is a sudden growth of people in this city, who previously were unknown but who are buying mansions and driving around in Mercedes."
 
Too Strong for Governments
 Many Ecuadoreans are worried that by the experiences of their neighbors where drug trafficking apparently has grown too large for governments to confront directly. Colombia's Government, tired of the drug war, is negotiating a truce with the traffickers. Peru's Government is unwilling to confront coca leaf growers for fear of feeding an ongoing guerrilla war.
"We need a strong hand to cut out the problem at the start, otherwise it could get as big as in Peru, where the Government can't handle it," Jaime Nebot, a center-right presidential candidate, said in an interview here.
Ecuadoreans have in the past moved decisively on the drug problem. In the mid-1980's, when coca leaf plantations started to proliferate, the Government started an eradication program, cutting the harvest from 4,000 metric tons in 1984 to about 300 tons today.
As trafficking increased, the police stepped up surveillance, using for coastal and river patrols eight boats provided by the United States.
Last year, policemen at Ecuador's international airports arrested smugglers almost daily. About one metric ton of cocaine was seized nationwide from the traffickers, including 15 Americans. But the United States State Department estimates that 30 to 50 tons of cocaine annually slips through Ecuador to consumer countries.
 
New Law Stiffens Penalties
 In September, a new drug law stiffened penalties for people who smuggle cocaine or the chemicals used to produce cocaine. In 1989 Ecuador's economy grew by 2 percent, but chemical imports jumped 30 percent.
"There are coca leaf plantations on the Colombian sides of our border rivers," Col. Gustavo Gallegos, executive director of the Ecuador's anti-drug police, said, referring to the destination of the chemicals.
A Government crackdown on the sale of chemicals to Colombia has slowed the trade, but at a price. On Oct. 10, the day after Ecuador Army soldiers seized 70 barrels of acetone and 20 sacks of caustic soda, guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ambushed a river patrol, killing four soldiers and wounding six. In the area of the attack -- the Colombian sides of the San Miguel and Putumayo rivers -- the guerrillas control coca leaf plantations and refining laboratories.
In a new effort, Ecuador's Congress is seeking to control money laundering -- the conversion of illegitimate cash assets earned by traffickers into seemingly legitimate bank accounts.

HEADLINE: Hickel Wants New Alaska Gold Rush

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JUNEAU, Alaska, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Flush with oil money gained since the start of the Persian Gulf crisis, Alaskans are once again dreaming aloud of grand schemes to extract riches from the nation's largest and least developed state.
Leading the charge is Alaska's new Governor, 71-year-old Walter J. Hickel, who was elected in November as an independent representing a party whose platform called for seceding from the Union. 
 Mr. Hickel disavows that particular plank of the Alaskan Independence Party. But Alaska's revived oil wealth has given him new impetus to pursue old dreams.
This week, in his State of the State Message before the Alaska Legislature, Mr. Hickel called for oil drilling in North America's biggest wildlife preserve, urged construction of an $11 billion natural gas pipeline down the length of the state and proposed laying railroad tracks across the tundra in central Alaska and building roads into towns that are currently unreachable by cars and trucks.
 
Water Pipeline to California
 He also envisions exporting fresh water, through an ocean pipeline, from Alaskan rivers to drought-plagued Southern California. The Governor's proposals have attracted so much attention that people here are referring to the grand design as "Wally World."
Some of these ideas were first promoted by Mr. Hickel more than 20 years ago, when he was Governor for two years until President Richard M. Nixon named him Secretary of the Interior in 1969. But even though Mr. Hickel began his second term after winning only 39 percent of the vote in a three-way race, he says he represents the larger-than-life temperament that has long epitomized Alaska.
While critics deride Mr. Hickel as one of the last of the "boomers," as the pro-development forces in Alaska are known, the idea of using billions of dollars in oil money for big projects is welcomed by many in this land, which came of age in an epic gold rush and has been enriched by the continent's biggest known oil field.
"Sure, I'm a dreamer; that's what Wally Hickel is all about," the Governor said in an interview. "Our goose that laid the golden egg, the North Slope oil, is running out, so we've got to build more geese."
 
Some Significant Opposition
 Mr. Hickel's ideas have run into significant opposition from Alaskan Eskimos, Aleuts and Indians, environmentalists and legislative leaders in both the Democratic and the Republican parties.
The Federal Government, which owns about 60 percent of Alaska's land, would have to approve many of the projects, particularly any oil development in the 19-million-acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. In recent years Congress has passed Alaska land legislation over the objections of the state's pro-development political leaders, a pattern that fuels secessionist talk, most of it in jest.
But with projections of a $2 billion surplus in the state budget this year, Mr. Hickel's enthusiasm is contagious here in Alaska's capital, even though he was elected with the support of neither major party.
"We don't want to spend money on pyramids," said Ben Grussendorf, a Democrat from Sitka who is Speaker of the State House of Representatives. "But when Governor Hickel says civilization needs big projects to grow on, everybody around here is interested. We just have to make sure we don't end up with something that's only good for looking at."
 
Annual Dividend Checks
 Alaskans pay no state taxes. Instead, every resident receives an annual dividend check from the Permanent Fund, an $11 billion trust made up of royalties earned by oil pumped from the North Slope region of northern Alaska. Last year the checks were nearly $1,000 for each of the 512,000 men, women and children who had lived in the state for at least a year.
As oil prices fell in the 1980's and the volume of crude pumped through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline started to decline, state revenue dried up. With 85 percent of its budget dependent on oil money, Alaska was facing a $300 million deficit last summer, and looking at cutbacks in services, dividend checks and dreams spawned by the price of oil.
For the first time in years, Alaska politicians were talking seriously about trying to reduce the state's dependence on oil. Such talk became even more urgent in March 1989, when the tanker Exxon Valdez struck a reef in Prince William Sound and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil, the largest spill in the nation's history.
But last August, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, oil prices shot up and Alaskans found themselves in the position of benefiting enormously from the crisis.
"I think we are all very sensitive to the fact that the state is getting rich off what's going on in the Persian Gulf," said Chuck Logsdon, a state petroleum economist.
 
Increase in Oil Output
 In response to President Bush's call on oil suppliers to increase production, the Alaska pipeline, which provides 25 percent of the nation's domestic oil, raised its daily output by more than 100,000 barrels, to 2.1 million barrels. As long as oil remains above $15 a barrel, a price that has not been seen since before the gulf crisis, the state surplus rises by millions of dollars a day.
Mr. Hickel says most of the surplus should be used on his plan to "let Alaska recapture its glory." With the Federal Government controlling vast tracts of national park land and wilderness, he said, "the state has been on the brink of colony status once again."
In his state of the state speech, the first major public statement of his administration's intentions, the new Governor said, "We will not tolerate further insults born of ignorance in Congress, the national media or national interest groups." He was referring to statements in Congress and the press implying that Alaskans have not always been the best stewards of their natural resources.
Mr. Hickel moved to Alaska from Kansas in 1940 -- arriving, he said, with 37 cents in his pocket. After taking odd jobs ranging from bartending to logging, he became a developer and builder in World War II, and was so successful that he spent $750,000 of his own money getting elected last year.
 
Themes From the Old West
 In keeping with his self-made status, Mr. Hickel evokes the themes and heroes of the 19th-century American West. He favors railroad development, even at a construction cost estimated at $3 million a mile, because that was how the West was developed. He says the state's Eskimos, Aleuts and Indians, which make up 15 percent of the population, should have no special hunting or fishing rights. And he loathes having vast tracts of land designated as official wilderness, because of the restrictions that go with it.
"When Lewis and Clark went across the country, they didn't do it on a National Scenic Road," he said. "We Alaskans must be allowed to catch up. We're young."
Environmentalists are counting on a change in attitude, brought on in part by the Exxon Valdez spill, to generate opposition to many of Mr. Hickel's plans.
 
An Unpredictable Politician
 "Walter is stuck in the past, giving us these Gilded Age pronouncements as the last great leader of the boomer school," said Jack Hession, the Alaska representative of the Sierra Club. "I think he'll find there has been a great change here. People see Federal protection as a good thing. They protect some of the most valuable areas in the world."
Mr. Hickel is unpredictable. As Interior Secretary he fought oil companies over their environmental records, and was dismissed in 1970 after disagreeing with Mr. Nixon on the Vietnam War. Since then, Mr. Hickel has built an empire of hotels and shopping malls, run from his headquarters in the Captain Cook Hotel in Anchorage.
Congress is not likely to approve oil drilling in the wildlife refuge any time soon, leaders of the House Interior Committee say. The natural gas pipeline, an 820-mile project that was first proposed by Mr. Hickel as an investment for his company, the Yukon Pacific Corporation, is not feasible in current market conditions, economists say.
The proposed railroad, an extension that would open up some of the state's harshest terrain, is opposed by wildlife advocates. They note that trains on the Alaska Railroad, which runs 525 miles from Fairbanks to Seward, are one of the biggest killers of moose in the winter.
And, because many Alaskans delight in their isolation, the new roads proposed by the Governor are getting a cool reception by some people in the very towns that would be connected to the outside world by them.
Despite the odds, Mr. Hickel says all his dreams will eventually become part of Alaska's landscape. "These are not idle visions," he said. "They are the keys to our independence."

HEADLINE: U.S. Plan on Child Care Is Reported to Be Stalled

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio

 BODY:
For almost a year, Nicole McDaniel has worked nights and weekends as a registration clerk at St. Anthony Medical Center here. With the help of a state subsidy for child care, she can leave her daughter, Stacie, at Northside Child Development Center, one of a handful of such centers in the nation that are open seven days a week, 24 hours a day.
In addition to working unusual hours and days, Mrs. McDaniel, 23 years old, recently separated from her husband. Without the subsidy, she might easily slip out of the work force and onto the welfare rolls. "I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't leave her here," she said. 
 It was to help families like hers that Congress passed and President Bush signed a two-part child care measure last year that is the Federal Government's largest commitment ever to child care programs. The promise was to help low- and middle-income families find decent child care they could afford. One part of the plan committed the Federal Government to $2.5 billion in block grants to states over the next three years and the second to $1.5 billion in matching funds over the next five years.
 
Dispute Over Running the Plan
 But now advocates say the Bush Administration is dragging its feet in writing the regulations for the block grant program that will be needed to put it into effect by its scheduled starting date of Sept. 7. They also say the Administration is already off to a bad start, having designated a welfare agency rather than a child development agency to run the program.
The Administration replies that the regulatory process is on schedule and that the Family Support Administration, which operates programs like Aid to Families with Dependent Children, is the appropriate agency to administer the child care program. "The law was only passed recently," said David H. Siegel, a spokesman for the Family Support Administration.
Still, state social service officials say they need Federal regulations soon if they are to coordinate the program with their existing services. Most states have a dozen agencies that handle child care programs, from education to social services and welfare departments, and their administrators say they need time and flexibility to put the money to work.
 
Eligibility a Major Factor
 "We're hopeful that people can light a fire under the Federal Government and they'll promulgate these regulations quickly and release the funds," said Michael Werner, senior legislative analyst for Gov. William Donald Schaefer of Maryland. And Henry Jenkins, an official with the Ohio State Human Services Department, said that unless care was taken in the flow of funds from Washington, families who are now eligible for child care assistance might find themselves ineligible under the Federal regulations.
Some child care advocates also fear that state governments desperate for cash may try to use the new Federal funds to pay for state child care programs already in existence, which is prohibited by the legislation, or to cover shortages in other programs.
"Child care is really an economic development issue, but many states see it as a social service, one of the first things to go in hard times," said Barbara Riceman, executive director of Child Care Action Campaign. "Child care is as essential for getting people to work as public transportation."
 
Plan Reflects Compromises
 The child care program involves a variety of approaches, reflecting political compromises reached after a four-year fight in Congress and a decade of discussion about the wisdom of involving the Federal Government in the issue. The $2.5 billion program will supply grants to the states to provide child care services for families of different incomes and eligibility requirements, with some money set aside for things like early childhood education and after-school child care. Its supporters say it will serve 750,000 children.
Preliminary regulations have already been issued for the second part of the child care package, which will provide $300 million a year in matching funds over the next five years. This money will be available for child care programs that would help families get off welfare as well as help families stay off the welfare rolls.
Here in Columbus, Tom and Vivian Rice, who are in school to improve their job skills, hope the new money will provide after-school care for their three children. "We tried to separate our classes," said Mrs. Rice. "That way, one of us would be home to be with the children. But this quarter, we're both going to be in school when the children get home, and we haven't figured out what to do."
Child care advocates and administrators say they fear the Bush Administration may interpret the law so narrowly as to thwart the intent of Congress. They had hoped that the program would be administered by the Administration for Children, Youth and Families, the agency in the Health and Human Services Department that handles Head Start and other child development programs. Instead, the Administration has designated another agency, the Family Support Administration, which handles welfare programs.
Mr. Siegel, of the Family Support Administration, said his agency had the necessary experience in licensing and child care to "effectively operate the child care and development block grant program."
 
Will Program Be Stigmatized?
 But state officials say administering the legislation as a welfare program could lower the child care standards, limit beneficiaries and stigmatize the program in the eyes of potential recipients and providers.
For example, the officials say, the family support agency reimburses child care services at such a low rate or so slowly that many centers are discouraged from participating. Health and safety standards of child care centers in the agency's programs are not as strict as those outlined in the child care legislation. And the child care program is not a welfare program, advocates say. Under the child care law, families are eligible for assistance if their children are younger than 13 years old and their family income is less than 75 percent of the state median income, which includes families well above the poverty level.
Debates over the program may take on new urgency from the war in the Persian Gulf as reservists pour into states where military bases are concentrated. Karen Thelin, a member of the Iowa Child Care Alliance, put it this way: "We're sending middle-income guys to Kuwait, so the women have to work. That means they have to find child care."

HEADLINE: Eastern Workers Line Up at Unemployment Office

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
For Robert Fanfauzzi, who had been a ramp worker at La Guardia Airport for Eastern Airlines for $6.75 an hour, the shutdown of the carrier over a week ago was not a big deal.
Since being hired last July he had few illusions about Eastern's chances of surviving. "I was looking for other jobs while I was there; I knew it would probably go bankrupt," he said as he waited with about 100 other people to fill out unemployment insurance forms at a New York State Department of Labor office near the Queensboro Plaza station on the Flushing line. 
 But for Ruby Stocker, who had been a flight attendant for Eastern for 30 years, the shutdown was a blow that still hurts. "I just don't know what I'm going to do," said said, covering her feelings with a smile.
 
'Going Back to Training School'
 Miss Stocker said she would like to get another flight attendant job because she enjoyed her work. "It means going back to training school and starting at the bottom," she said, and that would mean sitting through classes to learn things she already knows, to receive a salary that would probably be half of what she had earned at Eastern.
All week long, some of the 1,350 Eastern employees at La Guardia who lost their jobs in the shutdown on Jan. 18 have been going to the unemployment office near Queensboro Plaza, as well as to offices in Jamaica and Flushing. There they have sat in metal chairs waiting to hear their names called to receive their forms and booklets.
Most of the workers live within easy commuting distance of the airport, where Eastern was once a dominant carrier.
Another 350 workers lost their jobs at Newark International Airport, part of the 18,000 people nationwide who will be out of work because of the shutdown. Other businesses have been affected, too. One is Chelsea Catering, a kitchen owned by Continental Airlines that had the contract to supply meals on Eastern flights at La Guardia. Art Kent, a spokesman for Continental, said 95 new probationary workers for Chelsea and 50 regular workers had lost their jobs.
 
Bitterness All Around
 Behind the lines at the unemployment offices lay the 22-month strike that tore Eastern apart, and the bitter feelings on all sides over the fact that the jobs the workers lost were jobs they had taken from the mechanics, flight attendants and pilots who had struck and stayed on strike.
The strike by the International Assocation of Machinists and Aerospace workers, which began on March 4, 1989 and quickly gained the support of the pilots' union, crippled Eastern's operations. Most machinists' union members and pilots honored the picket lines. Five days after the strike began, Eastern filed for protection under the bankruptcy laws. In the summer of 1989, Frank Lorenzo, then the chairman of Texas Air, Eastern's parent company, began to rebuild Eastern by hiring new pilots, mechanics and flight attendants at much lower wages.
By that fall about 60 percent of the airline was operating, staffed mostly by new workers, many of whom were heckled by pickets. Many pilots and flight attendants who had supported the strike also went back.
During this period Miss Stocker decided to go back herself, she said, because the union's cause seemed hopeless.
 
Machinists' Union Fought On
 By November the Air Line Pilots Association and the Transport Workers Union, representing flight attendants, decided to call off its strike. The only union to fight on was the I.A.M. -- the machinists and aerospace union -- which once had about 12,000 members at Eastern.
And only last Thursday, almost a week after the shutdown, did the I.A.M. leaders call a halt to the strike. Most of its members had already been forced to find other jobs. Others, unable to find enough work, have suffered severely, losing savings and even houses.
The hostility toward workers like Mr. Fanfauzzi who were hired during the strike still runs deep among some I.A.M. members. There were cheers among I.A.M. pickets when Eastern announced it was shutting down after operating since 1928.
In interviews after the shutdown, some former pickets said that the workers who had helped break the strike would also be on the street.
One replacement who felt the hostility was a young mechanic who had been hired in December 1989. He spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying he still feared that other I.A.M. members might harass him as he looked for work at another airline. "The I.A.M. is a pretty strong union," he said.
The worker said that even though some airlines are cutting back to cope with the higher fuel costs and the drop in traffic caused by the gulf war, he believes the training that he received at Eastern will help him get another job as a mechanic.
 
Lower Salaries Are Likely
 The outlook for others, however, is not as promising.
Phil Stroh, the manager of the Queensboro Plaza unemployment office, said an "airline career center" had been set up at Kennedy Airport to help workers at Eastern and other airlines, like Trans World Airlines, which recently furloughed 2,500 employees.
But the pay for new airline workers is very low, since most carriers have adopted two-tier pay scales, in which senior workers can keep their usual salaries.
Eastern's baggage handlers, for example, were paid $15 to $16 an hour under the old scale. Mr. Stroh said that the starting wage for that kind of work now is $6.50 an hour, lower than before, and that new workers would probably never receive $15 to $16. He said the job center had openings for reservation agents at $4.40 an hour and for flight attendants at $9.40 an hour.
"It's a very tough time for someone in the airline industry," he said.

HEADLINE: The Daily News Strike Tests The Will of Weakened Labor

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN

 BODY:
Though small and in some ways parochial, the strike at The Daily News has become an important trial for an American labor movement that has been losing ground for decades.
Because of the attention that the paper attracts, being in the nation's media capital and in a city with strong labor traditions, the strike at The Daily News has galvanized organized labor's drive to stop management's use of a weapon -- the permanent replacement worker. Unions maintain that it blunts their mightiest weapon: the strike. They say the use of permanent replacements, to whom strikebound employers promise permanent jobs, underlies much of labor's waning influence. 
 "As long as workers can be replaced when they go on strike, the right to strike is taken away," said Juan Gonzalez, a Daily News columnist and strike leader for one of the unions, the New York Newspaper Guild. "The strike cannot be resolved until that's resolved."
 
Special A.F.L.-C.I.O. Aid
 Unions represent only one in six of the nation's workers today, but in New York City the figure is at least 40 percent. This fact, combined with the replacement worker issue and the newspaper's fame, has focused unusual labor attention on a strike involving only 2,300 workers.
"We're dealing with one of the world's most visible newspapers," said Thomas Donahue, secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "The Daily News has made a high art of using replacements. We think the issue has matured to the point where we believe Congress will do something about it this year."
Mr. Donahue said the federation had singled out the strike for special assistance, including the full-time support of three staff members, outside legal and public relations help and $300,000 to underwrite strike activities.
Mr. Donahue and other leaders have met in New York to help organize the strike. Unions like the United Mine Workers and the Steelworkers have offered financial and organizational help. They have also helped set up a nationwide campaign against the Tribune Company, urging people in Florida, for instance, not to subscribe to the company's papers there.
In November, members of 25 unions in New York canvassed neighborhoods in Queens to ask Daily News subscribers to cancel home delivery.
And the labor federation has mounted a lobbying offensive in Washinton. Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, and Representative William L. Clay, Democrat of Missouri, have reintroduced legislation to ban employers' use of replacement workers. Despite wide support among Democrats, their bills were crowded out of Congress's agenda last year. "This is the single most important issue before us now," said the chief lobbyist for the United Steelworkers, Jack Sheehan.
A senior Labor Department official said the Bush Administration had yet to take a position on the legislation. But the Administration has opposed most other labor objectives, and he implied the Administration would oppose a replacement-worker law because "we might get more strikes and more labor strife."
 
 Reagan's Action In '81 Sets Precedent
 Employers have always been free to try to keep their businesses going in strikes with temporary workers, or scabs, as unions call them. And since a Supreme Court ruling in 1938, they have been free to hire nonunion workers during strikes over wages, benefits and working conditions and keep them on the job, often leaving the strikers and their unions permanently on the street.
But until 1981, when President Ronald Reagan used permanent replacements to break the illegal strike of 12,000 air traffic controllers, employers hardly ever resorted to them, perhaps for fear of public rebuke for union busting. "But any businessman could then say, 'The President did it so it must be O.K.,' " said Richard L. Trumka, president of the United Mine Workers.
When permanent replacement workers are used, strikers regain their jobs and accrued pay only if courts find that employers engaged in unfair labor practices. Otherwise the strikers' sole right is first claim on the jobs after the replacements retire or move to other jobs. The nine unions representing The Daily News's 2,300 strikers have filed unfair labor practice complaints with the National Labor Relations Board, but rulings typically take several years, and by then the paper may have collapsed.
Labor experts say the air traffic controllers' strike coincided with the slow decline in union membership, from 24 percent of all workers in the early 1950's to 16 percent today, and waning public support of unions. "It was a sign that the American public was not going to look at labor relations as it did in the heyday of organized labor -- that a person is entitled to a job almost as a property right," an official of the National Labor Relations Board said.
 
Managements Shift To Replacements
 Since the air traffic controllers' strike, several major companies have permanently replaced strikers. They include Greyhound Lines, which last year replaced nearly all 6,000 striking drivers; Continental Airlines; the International Paper Company; Boise Cascade, another paper company, and six years ago The Chicago Tribune, flagship of the Tribune Company, owner of The Daily News.
Many other employers, including the Pittston coal company in Appalachia and Delta Pride Catfish Inc. in Mississippi, the nation's largest catfish processor, threatened to replace workers during their recent strikes but dismissed the replacements upon settling with their unions. The Ravenswood Aluminum Corporation in West Virginia says it has given permanent jobs to 400 replacements for 1,800 members of the United Steelworkers of America now on strike there.
No one keeps a tally of all the strikes that unions wage, much less the numbers involving permanent replacements. But industry's willingness to hire them seems to be spreading. In a poll of 132 companies that experienced strikes in 1985, the General Accounting Office, Congress's auditing agency, found that 15 percent said they would use permanent replacements. Four years later, 23 percent said they would. In each year, 15 percent actually did so.
Their use would be far greater, unions assume, were it not for a sharp decline in the number of strikes, which unions attribute in part to the threat of permanent replacement. In strikes involving 1,000 or more workers since World War II, the Bureau of Labor Statistics recorded the most strikes ever -- 470 -- in 1952 and almost as many -- 424 -- in 1974. But the number fell precipitously in the 1980's, to 40 in 1988, to 51 in 1989 and to 44 last year.
 
Added Pressure In Time of Recession
 The recession lends some urgency to organized labor's campaign to ban use of the replacements. Companies normally pay the replacements less than unionized workers. And with unemployment rising, employers have access to a growing pool of willing workers.
At The Daily News, management maintains that rather than tip the balance of power in a strike its way, the use of replacements merely rights the balance. James Hoge, the publisher, argues that the paper lost $160 million from 1979 through the first nine months of last year, before incurring large additional strike-related losses, because of the costs in excessive overtime and overstaffing that management accepted "with knives at their throats" in settling earlier strikes.
Mr. Hoge has threatened to close or sell the paper unless the newspaper obtains $70 million in annual savings. "The only real thing that strikes have produced in New York," Mr. Hoge said, "is the death of one newspaper after another." With permanent replacements of strikers, he said, "we have the hope of rectifying a major imbalance."
Mr. Hoge is deliberately ambiguous about his commitment to the 800 replacements he has brought aboard. Unlike Greyhound, for example, which has been unequivocal in assuring permanent jobs for its replacements, Mr. Hoge said, "By law we're open to discussions and negotiations." He has required the replacements to sign a release giving management the right to dismiss them at will, and in bargaining sessions with the unions his negotiators have said only that the replacements are secure in their jobs "at this time."
 
Epithets Shouted Across Picket Lines
 By using replacements, The Daily News is the first New York newspaper to continue printing during a strike, and the use has turned the company's normally hostile labor relations white hot. At the entrance to the main printing plant off Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues in Brooklyn one night, six big, graying white men stood encaged within a fence of police barricades.
The men worked in the plant until 60 of them walked out on Oct. 25, precipitating the strike. This night, like others, the men in the cage hurl epithets, including racial slurs, at the workers, many of them black, hurrying through the door.
Many of the replacements themselves believe they are safe in their jobs. Inside the printing plant, the company's production manager, Richard Malone, said he is printing the paper and printing it better with 5 or 6 replacement workers for each of the 12 presses, compared with 13 to 15 regular workers.
The plant is a 70-year-old industrial artifact with rows of heavy, dark-metal Goss presses, dark floors and windowless dark walls that soak up the fluorescent light, creating expanses of Dickensian gloom. Mr. Malone said the company planned to abandon the plant eventually and build a new one on Long Island. For the first time ever, the company is painting the presses, bright blue with yellow trim.
 
Theme of Unions: Settle, Sell or Sink
 A replacement pressman who declined to give his name for fear of attack by strikers said he is paid $12 an hour, more than he made in his last job as a security guard but about half the pay of the unionized pressmen. "I have been hired for good," he said. "That's what I was told when I was hired. I believe them."
Another pressman is Cedric Noah, 30 years old. He applied for the job last February, when The Daily News was advertising for replacements in anticipation of a strike, and was given four weeks' training at a smaller plant in Kearny, N.J. His pay, about $40,000 a year, is close to a regular pressman's pay and $12,000 more than he said he had earned as a restaurant manager. "I expect this to be a permanent job," he said, "but they still have the right to release me."
Both sides in the strike seem to be flirting with suicide. In retaining replacement workers, management has alienated union members to the point that they have no stake in the company and no alternative to driving away advertisers and intimidating newsstand operators. The paper's 1.1 million circulation has been cut in half and all the major advertisers have disappeared.
For many of the unionized workers, who have made "settle or sell" the theme of the strike, closing the paper is becoming a strong third option, even though that spells the end of their jobs.
They say hundreds would lose their jobs anyway as part of a settlement to drive down production costs, and far more would be lost if management insists on retaining the replacements in a settlement to keep the paper open. Settling, they say, would send a message to employers that even in a big union city like New York management can ignore its unions.
"You have to draw the line," said Nicholas Bianca, 45 years old and a driver who started working for the paper when he was in his teens. "I would want the paper to close, absolutely." Mr. Trumka, head of the mine workers' union, said, "You've made it in the strikers' interest to say The Daily News should fold."
In sacrificing their jobs by forcing the paper to close, the Daily News unions would send other employers a message. "The lesson is that the strike weapon can still be effective," said Robert M. Baptiste, a lawyer in Washington who represents unions. "Workers who stick together, no matter how tough it gets, can force employers to negotiate -- or go out of business."

HEADLINE: Suffering in the Cities Persists As U.S. Fights Other Battles

SERIES: Missing Agenda: Poverty and Policy/First of three articles.

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26

 BODY:
Nearly three decades after the Great Society, and after eight years of record economic growth, urban poverty remains an entrenched force in American life and an increasingly destructive one.
Homelessness, underclass, crack, AIDS -- the past decade has challenged dictionaries to keep pace as it redefined city suffering. Some wonder whether such words spell a permanent change in the definition of America itself. 
 Programs and policies have failed to halt this sinking spiral even in a decade of relative prosperity like the 1980's. Some Administration officials have been urging President Bush to use his State of the Union Message on Tuesday to announce a sweeping new policy to tackle the problem. But as the country wages war and sags into recession, there is even less reason to believe it can summon the will or the wallet to fight this internal enemy.
 
'Not on the Agenda'

"Very few people in a responsible position are dealing with, or even debating, what to do," said Representative John Lewis, the Georgia Democrat who was an early leader of the civil rights movement.
"It's not just this Administration," he said. "In the Congress or in the private sector, the problems of the poor are just not on the agenda. They're becoming more visible and yet invisible."
And just as Vietnam stalled the war on poverty of the 1960's, Mr. Lewis said, the Persian Gulf war will leave even more domestic problems unattended. "You cannot spend $1 billion a day to fight a war and still deal with the problem at home," he said.
The explanations for America's policy failures are complex, numerous and hotly contested. Some say the nation has spent too little; others say it has spent too much. Some argue that ideas are lacking; others say commitment is what the country needs most.
 
A Worsening Problem
 Race, too, is a complicating factor, as the problems of the inner city fall disproportionately on minorities.
Whatever the causes, an overwhelming majority of the American public says that urban poverty is growing worse and that President Bush has done little to improve the situation.
Seventy-two percent of those interviewed in a New York Times Poll said poverty and its related problems were worse today than 10 years ago, while only 4 percent said the problem had become less pressing. And when asked to choose from description of Mr. Bush's attempts to address the problem, 77 percent answered "not much" or "nothing at all."
The poll of 1,028 adults, including 93 blacks, was conducted Dec. 12 to 14 and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points over all, and 10 points for blacks.
Over the past two years, there have been some signs that poverty has been inching up the nation's list of priorities. Despite the climate of austerity, Congress last year voted to expand tax benefits for the working poor by $18 billion over five years, and added several billion for Medicaid and Head Start.
Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp, the Administration's chief antipoverty strategist, has written Mr. Bush, urging him to use the State of the Union speech to offer "audacious" solutions to the problems of the poor. Six months ago there was even talk of a "peace dividend" that might make money available for social spending.
But now, with the recession and the war dominating the nation's attention, many believe that this modest momentum will produce little.
"We will lunge at these international problems, but we have stopped trying to solve domestic issues," said H. Ross Perot, the Texas entrepreneur who was a force in that state's efforts to improve its educational system several years ago. "Let's say you're President and you're concerned about rape, plunder, and pillage. You don't have to go to Iraq; you can find it in New York, Detroit and Chicago."
Mr. Perot added, "The thing we lack in this country more than anything is Churchill's dictum: 'Action this day.' "
 
The Effects
All of Society Pays a Price
 In the past decade, two words have become central to discussion of American cities: homeless and underclass. They can be hard to define and the groups they describe harder to count.
But both have implications beyond their size. They suggest a second, separate America, a nation within a nation whose health, welfare, and social mobility evoke the Third World. Indeed, visitors startled by the rows of homeless lying in Grand Central Terminal in New York strain for analogies and produce the word "Calcutta."
When speaking of an underclass, researchers are not simply talking about poor people, which America has always had in abundance. They are talking about a development more alarming, something many regard as a new and hardened population of poor people, disproportionately black, who live in subcultures where unemployment, female-headed families, welfare dependency, violence and drug abuse flourish.
Part of the reason the very concept has been so controversial is that its implication of permanent classes rubs raw the notion of equal opportunity.
 
Deep Change in Cities
 Estimates put the number of the underclass at less than 10 percent of the 31.5 million Americans whose incomes are below the Government's poverty line, $12,675 a year for a family of four. And some argue that the problems are most apparent in New York and a few other large cities in the Northeast and Midwest.
But Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who is Congress's foremost expert on urban poverty, says such figures underestimate the depth of change in cities.
From the seas of available statistics, Senator Moynihan fetches one to announce his dismay. In a study by the University of Michigan, researchers found that 72 percent of the blacks born in 1967 spent at least a year on welfare before their 18th birthday. The figure for whites was 25 percent.
"When three-quarters of your children are on welfare, do you have any idea what that means?" he said. "It's almost a complete collapse."
He added: "When you're on welfare, you're a pauper. Your whole life is broken up. You're dealing with brain-dead, artery-clogged bureaucracies that hate you."
 
Effects are Widespread
 No one suffers more for the decline of the inner city than the people who live there, but the rest of society pays a price as well, in ways both obvious and subtle. Among the tasks facing modern urban parents is explaining to innocent young minds why so many men and women sleep in American streets.
Moreover, urban disintegration brings economic consequences for all: in laborers removed from the work force and the government costs of prisons and programs.
Beyond economics, the poverty and disorder of the inner cities lacerate a larger civic fabric, driving people from shared institutions like subways, buses, parks, schools and even cities themselves. For example, in 1960, families within New York City had 93 percent of the median income of families in the suburbs. But according to the Census Bureau, by the mid-1980s, that figure had fallen to 55 percent, a trend that could also be seen in city after city.
The increasing concentration of urban poverty undermines faith in Government as the instrument of the popular will, producing an epic tale of governmental breakdown told in terms of crowded clinics, failing foster care, ineffective law enforcement and burdened or neglected social services.
Perhaps most damaging of all is the effect that urban poverty has on race relations. It is like a poison in the national ground water that is producing a thousand deformed fruits, from race-based campaigns for public office to taxicabs that do not stop for black men at night.
White politicians like David Duke, the Louisiana State Representative and former Ku Klux Klan leader, seize on the inner city to conduct entire campaigns denouncing welfare and street crime. Black newspapers look at the same neighborhoods and ask whether whites are plotting to kill them. Last year, when the Black Entertainment Network inaugurated a public affairs program on cable television, producers said they built their first show around a topic on black viewers' minds. They titled it: "Black Genocide: Myth or Reality?"
In The Times's poll, 52 percent of blacks said it was harder today than 10 years ago for a black person to get out of poverty by starting poor and working hard, and 40 percent said it was easier. Among whites, only 29 percent thought that a black person would have a harder time now than 10 years ago and 57 percent thought it was easier.
"The nation pays a huge price for the existence of the underclass," said Nicholas Lemann, author of "The Promised Land," a book on black ghettos to be published by Alfred A. Knopf in March. "It makes the whole atmosphere of the country more sour."
 
The Policy Failures
Promises Yield Limited Results
 How did America get this way?
Discussion of future offensives against urban poverty inevitably turn to the lessons of efforts past.
In effect, the deepening of poverty has defied the promises of two Presidents. The most famous was Lyndon B. Johnson's 1964 announcement of a war on poverty, which Ronald Reagan answered with a frequent quip: "poverty won." Mr. Reagan made his own antipoverty promise when he promoted his economic policies by saying that "a rising tide lifts all boats" -- and saw the inner cities continue to sink.
But the fault was shared among ideologies, said Theda Skocpol, a Harvard University sociologist who is writing a history of American social policy. "Neither liberals nor conservatives, as they battled from the 60's to the 80's, adequately conceptualized the problems of the ghetto poor," she said.
Some experts argue that past policies accomplished more than current discussions typically acknowledge, and offer a base of encouragement.
"If Johnson had said, 'We're going to cut poverty in half within 10 years,' then he would have been wildly successful," said Sheldon Danziger, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan. Noting that the percentage of Americans below the poverty line dropped from 22.2 percent in 1960 to a low of 11.1 percent in 1973, he added, "But he overstated it; he said we're going to eliminate it."
The poverty rate then rose to its recent high, 15.2 percent, in 1983 and has been slowly declining since, to 12.8 percent in 1989, the latest year for which figures are available. The Government's poverty line arises from a crude measure established in the 1960's that simply multiplies a family's minimum food budget by three, adjusting it for inflation each year.
Social spending in the past 25 years has gone disproportionately to programs for the elderly, most prominently Social Security and Medicare.
In 1990, for instance, the Government spent $353 billion on Medicare and Social Security, but only $100 billion on things like food stamps, school lunches, tax credits, Medicaid and welfare that help the non-elderly poor.
For the elderly, the spending has made a difference. The poverty rate for the elderly dropped from 35.2 percent in 1959 to 11.4 percent by 1989. As it fell, it crossed the poverty rate for children, which has risen from 15.1 percent in 1970 to 19.6 percent in 1989.
"The war we did fight, we won," said Senator Moynihan, "and the war that wasn't won, we didn't fight."
Professor Christopher Jencks, a sociologist at Northwestern University, carries the observation further. Not only does most social spending go to the elderly, he said, but most of the remainder goes to programs like food stamps or Medicaid that aim only to smooth poverty's rough edges, rather than to programs like job training that aim to end it.
But many conservatives argue that billions have been spent on inner-city problems, with results that have been limited at best.
Where liberals and conservatives increasingly agree is that earlier antipoverty efforts failed to envision the complex problems of behavior and motivation. "They both assumed the poor were straining on the leash, striving to get ahead," said Lawrence Mead, a political scientist at New York University.
Eleanor Holmes Norton, just elected to represent the District of Columbia in Congress, noted, "These are the discouraged poor who have sometimes lost the incentive to rise out of poverty in traditional ways, and therefore sometimes take ways that are most available -- the drug culture, the underground economy."
 
The Political Failures
Lack of Direction And Lack of Will
 The problem is not just one of policy but also one of politics. A minority of members of Congress come from districts directly affected by urban disintegration. The poor have few PAC's.
And sweeping initiatives like Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal and Johnson's Great Society are the exception in American life. "We always have an incremental, do-some-of-this, some-of-that approach," said Richard P. Nathan, a domestic policy expert at the State University of New York in Albany.
Moreover, the public image of the disadvantaged has changed in ways that cost much American sympathy.
The civil rights movement had provided a barrage of sympathetic images: young men in ties sitting at segregated lunch counters, children willing to face fire hoses. But in the decades that followed, argues Douglas Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute, the dominant image of America's social problems turned more toward idleness: young men standing around empty oil barrels, welfare mothers whiling away their days in front of televisions.
"I think the public draws a clear line between the deserving poor and the undeserving poor, between adults who work and those who don't," he said.
 
A Delicate Balance
 What many experts think has been missing from the poverty debate for many years is a language that is frank while also being empathetic.
"Liberals have been terrified that if you're saying there's a behavioral problem, you're saying it's the poor's fault and the hell with them," said Mickey Kaus, an editor at The New Republic who is writing a book on poverty. Republicans, he said, "have been unwilling to spend the money."
Would the country know how to spend more antipoverty money, even if it wanted to? The question is complex, and produces qualified answers.
Certainly some antipoverty programs produce consistently good results. And the country spends large sums on many other programs, like fighting drugs or building weapons, whose success is no more guaranteed. Today's urban poverty has indeed proved more vexing than that of the past, yet a wealth of research has produced many proposals that experts say are promising. And despite budget deficits and past disappointments, there is considerable public support for new efforts and confidence that they could succeed.
The Times poll found that twice as many people believed that the nation's fight against urban poverty was limited more by lack of concern than by lack of money, with 42 percent saying lack of concern was the problem and only 21 percent saying lack of money. Thirty-two percent said the country most lacked know-how.
Almost two-thirds of those surveyed said a major Government effort to fight poverty was likely to have some success, with 13 percent saying success was very likely and 51 percent saying it was somewhat likely. Twenty-two percent said success was not too likely and 11 percent said it was not likely at all.
 
The Lessons of History
New Complications To an Old Problem
 Today's alarm over the inner city may be widespread, but it is not without precedent. American history contains many examples of middle class fears about an urban population whose poverty was seen as intractable and whose values and behavior were considered at odds with the norms. Yet the country has repeatedly innovated to accommodate those who seemed destined to be permanent outsiders.
At the turn of the century, for instance, New York City slums were filled with European immigrants whose presence inspired fears. "There were plenty of people at the turn of the century who thought the problem of poor people in urban neighborhoods was intractable," said Roy Rosenzweig, a historian at George Mason University who is completing a history of Central Park.
Mr. Rosenzweig said he sees similarities in attitudes toward the inner city today. "People saw it as a moral failing on the part of the poor," he said. "They drink; they're not responsible; they're morally lax."
Among historians, opinion is divided on whether today's urban problems pose a more daunting challenge than those of the past. Most agree there is less actual physical need: less hunger and malnutrition, more government support in the form of various safety nets, however imperfect.
On the other hand, many argue that today's economy is less accommodating to the unskilled, that the drug economy is more captivating and violent and that today's poor are more physically and culturally isolated from the rest of the city.
In addition, many analysts say the racial composition of today's inner cities is cause for further pessimism. They argue that blacks have traditionally faced fiercer barriers to advancement than other ethnic groups.
"It's helpful to know that in the past we've felt so terribly low about minorities entering cities and being impoverished," said Prof. David Ward, a historian at the University of Wisconsin. "But I think the conditions today are very different. I don't think past comparisons offer much hope."
One person undaunted by the look back is Mr. Perot in Texas. "Would you want the challenge of solving this problem or of getting the United States out of the Depression?" he said. "This is a piece of cake."

The Tough New Leaders in Moscow Have Kremlinologists Up and Guessing

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
THE classic Kremlinologist, a veteran practitioner of the trade once noted, divides knowledge about Moscow roughly into two categories: secrets and mysteries.
For a few golden years, perhaps it was not so, or at least it didn't seem that way. Glasnost lifted the shrouds of secrecy a notch and real information flowed forth. Mikhail S. Gorbachev's closest advisers actually dipped into the cocktail circuit, politics could be discussed in the streets, the United States ambassador actually paid a courtesy call on the director of the K.G.B. 
 But the sharp turn to an older, chillier agenda that the last three months have seen has restored much of the mystery and secrecy, prompting old Kremlinologists to blow the dust off their binoculars and once again to pore over the tidbits floating down from the Kremlin ramparts.
That the direction has changed is obvious. In recent days alone, the Government has followed the bloody crackdown in the Baltic republics with the chilling announcement that armed soldiers will patrol the streets with the police and with a decree authorizing the K.G.B. to search any business, ostensibly to uncover economic crimes that deprive the citizenry of goods.
Even before that, Eduard A. Shevardnadze's dramatic warning that a dictatorship is coming, the shelving of the "500-day plan" of radical economic reform, the tough speeches by the K.G.B. and defense chiefs, the departure of virtually all the old advisers -- these and many other developments over the past four months seemed to plot an inexorable shift toward a tough and often crude reimposition of central authority.
The change, however, poses some intriguing questions: Did Mr. Gorbachev personally decide to change course, acting out of determination to maintain the unity of the Soviet state, or was he coerced by the military, the K.G.B. and the Communist Party? Who then is really in charge, Mr. Gorbachev, or the rough chiefs of the military, the K.G.B., the police and the Communist Party?
There is ample evidence for both versions. If it was the former, it can be argued that the lovable "Gorby" of Western magazine covers was really a Western concoction born of a keen desire to believe; that the real Mikhail Sergeyevich is pragmatic, intelligent, urbane and politically brilliant -- but still a Soviet Communist, for whom the basic principles, including the integrity of the Soviet Union and state control, are sacred.
Under this scenario, Mr. Gorbachev returned from summer vacation and sometime in September concluded that the "500-day" plan was untenable until order was restored to the streets and to the country, and until the renegade republics quit trying to break up the union. So he turned loose the traditional forces of security.
Alternatively, it may have been the security forces who came to Mr. Gorbachev and said, in effect, either let us restore order or be gone. A mysterious movement of troops around Moscow in September might have been a warning to the President.
In any case the rollback quickly gathered speed. Arms-control negotiations slowed. Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov and the K.G.B. chief, Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, issued tough public statements. A new breed of people began filling key offices: Gennadi I. Yanayev, a colorless party functionary, became vice president; Boris K. Pugo, hard-line party chief in Latvia, became Minister of the Interior; Valentin S. Pavlov, an economic apparatchik, became prime minister. With the crackdown in Latvia, the state television moved distinctly backward to the Kremlin.
At the same time, Mr. Gorbachev's liberal guard began to abandon him. The most dramatic exodus, of course, was Mr. Shevardnadze, who left Dec. 20 warning that a dictatorship was coming.
One intriguing side question now is whether the order to put armed soldiers in the streets, announced last Friday but dated Dec. 29, may not have been the last straw for Mr. Shevardnadze, who surely knew about the order before he resigned.
The brain trust of perestroika -- Aleksandr N. Yakovlev, Stanislav S. Shatalin, Nikolai Y. Petrakov, Vadim V. Bakatin -- all walked off. About the only liberal left is Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, Mr. Gorbachev's new Foreign Minister.
Who then runs the country? "In principle," as Russians say when the obvious answer is not the whole story, it is Mr. Gorbachev, who has assumed huge powers as President. In principle, he can rule by ukaz -- by decree -- much as the czars used to. Also in principle, the Supreme Soviet, or parliament, can veto his decisions.
In fact, nobody really knows how decisions are being made now in the Kremlin or who is really calling the shots, just as nobody knows who really ordered the troops to move in Lithuania or in Latvia.
Mr. Gorbachev denied he knew anything about it in advance, but he made no effort to chastise the troops or to denounce the shadowy and blatantly illegal "Committees of National Salvation" that purportedly called for help.
That sort of mystery is perfect grist for the de-mothballed Kremlinologists. The crackdown in the Baltics, they would argue, did not have Mr. Gorbachev's stamp to it -- the phony pretexts, the hasty appeals from the anonymous committees, the brazen challenge to public opinion abroad -- all these were far too crude for a man who has demonstrated considerable political finesse.
Does that mean then that Mr. Gorbachev, by choice or coercion, agreed to give the security chiefs a free hand, and that these crude apparatchiks reverted to form, reviving the brutally simple methods used to subjugate Eastern Europe and the Baltics after World War II?
Or is Mr. Gorbachev deliberately trying to look crude to drive home his warning?
Such questions could become increasingly critical as the new line takes shape. So far, Mr. Gorbachev and his tough new advisers seem in agreement at least on their readiness to use force to prevent the breakup of the Soviet Union and to restore order.
What is still unclear is how many of the achievements of the years of glasnost the new team is prepared to keep. Mr. Gorbachev insisted in a statement that he personally read to the foreign press last week -- questions were not allowed -- that his basic goals remain unchanged.
But the men around him are not known for their infatuation with free markets or free speech, and neither the military crackdown nor the forceful currency reform, with its open hostility to anyone who has amassed capital, were likely to encourage entrepreneurs at home or abroad.
Perhaps Mr. Gorbachev wants to believe that once stability is restored he can resume the road to perestroika. But having tied himself to the old institutions, would he be able to break free once again? For the answers, unleash the Kremlinologists.

For Some, a U.S. Victory Would Be the Third World's Loss

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: NEW DELHI

 BODY:
IF the war against Saddam Hussein has closed a gap between East and West, it has opened a chasm between North and South -- the developed nations and the third world.
On this side of the international poverty line, there is not much rejoicing that an American-led war machine is hammering a tyrannical aggressor. There is, instead, apprehension that an unambiguous victory for the United States would usher in an age of unbridled American power in which Washington would enforce its economic and strategic policies worldwide. 
 A generation raised on 35 years of rhetoric from a nonaligned movement that more often than not hewed to Moscow's cold war interpretation of international affairs finds it hard to shake the instinctive fear of "American imperialism." There is a widespread though vaguely defined assumption that from now on the rich will call the shots and the poor can only get poorer.
"We are very uncomfortable with the thought of a Pax Americana," a scholar in the Indian city of Hyderabad said last week. He admitted that he had no logical explanation for this, only the sense that the least developed nations would probably be exploited or overlooked in a "unipolar world," a phrase that is heard everywhere here.
Feeling abandoned, third-world Communists are criticizing Moscow for siding with the United States in the Persian Gulf. There is also widespread frustration that no nation or group of nations among the remnants of the nonaligned movement has been able to forge a countervailing consensus on the use of force. Ad hoc efforts at peace plans, too vague and too late, are merely brushed aside at the United Nations, even now that India, a leader of the nonaligned, holds a Security Council seat. Also going unheard are other Asian voices asking why Americans fight for the rights of Kuwaitis but reject calls for self determination in Tibet or Kashmir.
Many South Asians are already suffering from higher energy prices and lost jobs because of the war. They are threatened with environmental devastation if Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil wells, not far away on the prevailing winds, continue to burn or if crude oil, already being dumped into the gulf, drifts to their shores, further fouling an environment that cannot now support its populations. And they blame the Americans, not the Iraqis, for economic dislocation.
Officials here say that Washington has failed to make the point to the third world that the defeat of Iraq would in fact lead to falling oil prices. Preoccupied with the war, a NATO diplomat said, the United States has apparently not had time for public relations south and east of Suez.
"Among the alienated masses, the whole argument about this war has turned on the poor versus the rich," an Asian ambassador said. "Saddam Hussein is supported by and large by the poor people, and the intellectuals who thrived on a nonalignment that was in reality guided by the Soviet Union. Kuwait is the rich neighbor, supported by rich friends."
 
How to Respond?
 "To many people now, Saddam is a courageous man standing up to the wrath of 28 nations," said Cho Ramaswami, editor of the political magazine Thuglak in Madras. But he added that he believed there was a sharp difference of opinion in India on the issue of how to respond to the gulf war.
Some of this may be regional. Myron Weiner, a political scientist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a writer on India who has been traveling in the southern part of the country, found more grassroots support for the resistance to Mr. Hussein than is evident in the north. Many southerners, better educated than northerners, were employed in Kuwait in professional jobs.
Moreover, in the richer nations of Southeast Asia, there is less spontaneous, emotional support for Iraq, according to Hadi Soesastro, a political economist who is executive director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta. In both Indonesia and Malaysia, countries with Muslim majorities, he said there is general backing for the United Nations resolutions that set the stage for attacks on Iraq -- although there are also demonstrations backing Mr. Hussein.
 
The Price of Oil Prices
 Mr. Soesastro, an energy analyst, said that Indonesia believed oil prices would fall with an American victory in the gulf -- not a positive factor in a country heavily dependent on income from petroleum. But he said the country was prepared to cope with this, and that the prospect of Iraqi-supported higher prices was not a reason to support Baghdad. This measured view is not often articulated among South Asian intellectuals.
Perhaps most astonishing to American audiences operating on the assumption that Iraq is the transgressor in the gulf would be the growing public opinion in India and Pakistan that morality and principle are not on Washington's side.
"Morally, the war waged against Iraq and its people is impossible to defend," wrote N. Ram, a leading Indian investigative journalist who is associate editor of The Hindu newspaper and editor of Frontline, a news magazine. Arguing that sanctions were beginning to bite, and that the United States ignored this and moved to an assault out of all proportion to the problem it faced, Mr. Ram wrote in The Hindu that President Bush had exceeded the definitions of a "just war."
"It should not be difficult to see how this principle stands in relation to the war that Mr. Bush has unleashed in order to punish Mr. Saddam Hussein's aggression and defiance," he said. "Nasty rounds of surprises and enormous suffering and cruelty seem guaranteed."
He added: "The idea of a just war against Iraq on Kuwait is a fraudulent construct which will not stand any serious political or moral scrutiny."

Between War And Slump, A Little Room For Congress

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN years past, Presidential State of the Union Messages often laid out legislative agendas as Congress convened. Nobody is sure whether that will happen when President Bush gives his speech to Congress and a national television audience on Tuesday. For, even without the war in the Persian Gulf and the Soviet troubles in the Baltics, two likely topics, Mr. Bush has shown little inclination to develop a substantial domestic program.
In fact, the television audience might hear more about domestic legislation in the brief response from the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, than it hears from the President. 
 Of course, the war will concern Congress directly. A supplemental appropriation bill to pay for it might be the main occasion for Congress to look at the conduct of the conflict and for arguments about how much help other countries are providing.
In the end, voting the money will be relatively easy. But the issue of how to pay for it, through taxes, borrowing or stringency elsewhere, will be harder. The recession could be made worse by higher taxes, and paying for the war by borrowing would deepen the deficit, making it especially hard to launch any major initiatives in areas where Democrats crave action, like health care.
But Congressional leaders hope for more to do than pay bills and cheer for the war. "I hope and expect that it will not divert us from other serious national problems," Mr. Mitchell, a Democrat, said last week. "If we're going to be strong, these challenges are just as important as the challenges we face in the Middle East," said Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, the Democratic chairman of the Education and Labor Committee. "There's a real concern that we're just standing around and not doing anything to get us out of the recession," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, the House majority leader.
But the war is an immense distraction. Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House Republican minority leader, is anxious to renew efforts to pass campaign finance reform, a bill that requires early action if a House-Senate conference is to have any hope of reconciling different approaches in time to affect the 1992 elections.
Both houses are likely to pass bills similar to those they voted last year. The Senate sought to bar contributions by political action committees, while the House only tried to limit them, and in general the House bill was not as stringent as the Senate's. In both chambers, the burden of fund raising and the insistence of editorial complaints are spurs to action. But, Mr. Michel said, "It's hard to get anyone to focus, with this doggone war."
The distraction is general. "We're sort of on automatic pilot, beginning necessary hearings," said Senator Wyche Fowler, an assistant Democratic whip. "I don't think you'll see anything of any moment until the war is over." If the country isn't paying attention and pressing for action on Capitol Hill, he said, then lawmakers are less likely to cast tough votes.
There are a few familiar, off-the-rack items that may see action sooner than that. The family leave bill, which would require employers to provide unpaid leaves of absence for employees to provide for births and illnesses, is likely to get out of Mr. Kennedy's committee quickly and then win passage in the House, too, before another Presidential veto and a new attempt to override.
That isn't the only important bill that doesn't need to be made to measure. Just about every argument has been made on either side of the civil rights bill that Mr. Bush vetoed last year. The legislation was intended to reverse Supreme Court decisions making it harder for minority members and women to prove job discrimination. One last effort might be made to find common ground with the White House before that one goes forward again.
 
Education and Handguns
 In the Senate, Mr. Kennedy might push ahead with a bill designed to formalize education goals set by the nation's governors and to establish an independent authority to measure success in meeting them. In the House the Brady bill, a measure that would require a one-week waiting period before handgun purchases, is likely to come to the floor before Easter. It's not clear whether the votes are there to pass it; nor is it clear what the Senate would do if the House acts.
Then there are a range of important measures that will take time and whose eventual shape will be affected by the cost of the war and the depth of the recession.
The reauthorization of highway, bridge and mass transit programs is one major task, and money is a big issue. Even if there had been no distraction from a war in the gulf, it could easily take two years to renew the 1986 Higher Education Act, as Democrats seek to provide more help for middle-class students.
With these bills, as with legislation to restore the health of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in an era of shaky banks, Bush Administration views will affect but not control the eventual laws, and those recommendations are not yet in.
Clean water, garbage and pesticide legislation constitute an environmental agenda. But they could all be delayed because some of the same Congressional committees deal with energy, and the Middle East troubles are a reminder of the need to be more self-sufficient, whether through conservation or by drilling in places like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
It is clear that there is concern about the recession, but just what measures, if any, are likely to emerge is anything but clear. Mr. Kennedy talked about lowering payroll taxes and bolstering unemployment compensation. The longer the downturn lasts, the more likely it is that Congress will act.
And there is one other priority area, legislation to help troops and veterans. Last week, with no dissenting votes in either chamber, Congress passed bills easing the income tax burden for Persian Gulf troops and providing a cost-of-living allowance on veterans' pensions.
But the war might, in the long run, have more effect on the Congressional agenda than serving as a distraction and a check on spending.
David Obey, a veteran liberal Democrat from Wisconsin, said that the short-run impact, while troops are dying in the gulf, would be that "it's going to be excruciatingly difficult to make people aware of the pain other people are suffering in the economy."
But later, he said hopefully, the sacrifices of the war might make it easier to muster support for domestic measures, as people ask, in Mr. Obey's words, "Is government willing to do for Americans what it did for Kuwaitis?"
Representative Newt Gingrich, the House Republican whip, offered an even more intriguing postwar legislative theory. Noting that Mr. Bush's approval ratings in polls already match Franklin D. Roosevelt's after Pearl Harbor, he predicted that if the war went well, the President would come out of it with "dramatically more authority than any President since Eisenhower."
That authority would not last forever, he said, but Mr. Bush would have three or four months at least to push for a conservative domestic agenda and to achieve much of it. To skeptical conservatives at a luncheon on Friday, the optimistic Georgian said he was sure that was where Mr. Bush's heart was, and he invited them to watch carefully.

HEADLINE: The World;
Japan Counts the Costs Of Gulf Action -- or Inaction

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
AS surely as it is for the United States, Japan's response to the gulf war is seen increasingly as a defining moment for Tokyo in the post-cold-war world order. That response so far has been marked by anguished debates about what Japan's role should be, with its actions until now limited to some financial aid and the promise of more. But perhaps the most striking aspect of Japan's behavior is the growing perception that the Japanese see little at stake for themselves in the war's outcome, despite their dependence on Middle East oil.
On the surface, as usual, the arguments in Japan revolve around the constraints arising from Tokyo's postwar pacifist tradition and its constitutional renunciation of the use of force. Constantly fearful of generating hostility among its Asian neighbors, Japan clings more tightly than ever to these pillars of its identity in a post-cold-war environment. 
 But at the same time, a much deeper struggle over the war is under way. It is one in which Japan is trying to balance public anxiety over involvement against the widespread fear of angering its longtime patron, the United States.
To be sure, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has repeatedly denounced Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and there is some discussion here of the rightness or wrongness of fighting aggression. But many more Japanese are behaving according to the dictates of an old folk phrase that has gained currency as a description of this war, "taigan no kaji" -- fire on the other side of the river. And resentment that Japan is being drawn in is starting to show.
Last week, Mr. Kaifu announced his intention to add $9 billion to the $4 billion package of economic and quasi-military aid appropriated so far. The United States welcomed the pledge, but there were concerns. Legislative approval is not a sure thing. And less than half the funds set aside so far have been disbursed, partly because of strings attached by Tokyo. None of the aid is supposed to be used for anything related to combat, for instance. The United States is appealing to Tokyo to lift the restrictions -- so far to no avail.
Lately, internal critics of Japanese slowness of action have become harsh in their judgments. "If I were an American, I would see Japan as not reliable as a friend," said Masashi Nishihara, professor of international relations at the National Defense Academy. "When I saw the faces of the P.O.W.'s on television, I thought, 'My God, the Americans must be thinking very critically of the Japanese writing their checks and not suffering along with them.' "
The proponents of a Japanese role argue not so much that the cause is just, but that Tokyo must do something to avoid criticism. Typical was the blunt warning of Michio Watanabe, a leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, that Japan risked becoming an international "orphan" before world opinion if it ignored appeals for help. "The Japanese people don't want to shed their own blood or sweat themselves," he said. " 'Let's have the foreigners do it' -- that's what they think."
In addition, there appears to be rising public opposition, particularly from business and consumer groups, to Mr. Kaifu's plans to raise the cash by issuing a bond and repaying it with a new tax, perhaps on energy.
 
Roadblocks for Aid
 Despite repeated American requests for a direct role in the gulf, Tokyo has shied away. Mr. Kaifu's initial proposal to send 1,000 military men in noncombat roles was killed last year by a public outcry. Last week, he ordered "preparations" for military planes to airlift refugees from the war zone, but some officials doubted the initiative would get anywhere. Many in the Government are afraid that if it did, opposition parties whose votes are needed in Parliament would withdraw their support of the money package. Others fear that Japanese businessmen and diplomats abroad would be subjected to terrorism.
As Japan has temporized, it has become increasingly clear that it has developed a policy that actually serves its sense of self-interest. This, in turn, has dismayed many experts, including the United States Ambassador, Michael Armacost, who reminded Japan recently that "impressions forged in a major international crisis like this one do tend to have a durable lasting effect."
Before war erupted, for instance, Japanese officials said the one thing they wanted to avoid was the impression that Japan was capable of acting only under United States pressure -- an impression current last fall. Then the war broke out, and Japan became paralyzed over what to do. It sent Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to ask the United States what it wanted, and only then did Japan come up with a sum of aid to supply. No matter how hard they try, the Japanese seem to end up looking as if they are acting in response to pressure.
The idea that Japanese do not see that they have much at stake in the gulf, other than preserving ties with the United States, might seem to contradict the fact that Japan, more than any other country, depends on Middle East oil -- in fact, for 70 percent of its supplies. But since the Iraqi invasion last August, Japanese have been hearing cautious but bullish reports from their economic mandarins about the prospects for weathering the storm. And in recent decades, Japan has gained quite a lot of experience dealing with Middle East countries -- not through its political and diplomatic establishment, but through its trading companies and other business arms of Japan Inc. No one has come out and said it bluntly, but businessmen privately express the view that it makes little difference which sheiks or dictators own the oil fields; they all have to sell their oil somewhere.
Even Japanese diplomats complain that there is no historical tradition of Japan standing up for a set of values, so it is not surprising that the blitzkrieg in Kuwait did not move people here. In any case, there is also a feeling that Washington has met the problem with too much force.
There are those in Japan who see the entire paralysis as a function of the current weakness of Prime Minister Kaifu, a politician without a power base of his own who is beholden to a handful of power brokers jockeying among themselves. But this too assumes that inside the bloated and inactive Japanese system is a lithe and aggressive foreign policy that is somehow struggling to get out. Perhaps it is time, then, to see that Japan's aloofness toward the gulf is in fact the policy most people want.

HEADLINE: The Region;
The Next Battle in Yonkers Will Be Over Power

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

 BODY:
EARLIER this month, in a windowless 35th-floor office of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development in Manhattan's Federal Plaza, signatures were affixed to a document that was the product of five years of civic and political strife and an estimated $12 million in lawyers' fees.
The document was a contract between the Yonkers Municipal Housing Authority and DeLuxe Homes Inc. for the court-ordered construction of 142 units of low-income housing on five sites in the city's mostly white neighborhoods, remedies for what a Federal judge decided in 1985 were 40 years of segregated housing of blacks. 
 To those in Yonkers who had urged the city to comply with the housing order so they could get on with long-delayed development, the contract represented a major advance. To those who have been fighting the subsidized housing as a potential threat to community standards and real estate values, the contract was just another setback.
Either way, the signing ushered in what could be a portentous year for this hilly suburban city, New York's fourth largest. The modular homes, the first of 1,000 subsidized units planned under the court order, might be completed by Election Day, when voters will select their first strong mayor under a change in government structure.
The two events are related because the most prominent of a half dozen potential candidates for the newly strengthened post of mayor is the incumbent, Henry J. Spallone, who has been the most outspoken opponent of the housing order. Mr. Spallone's fierce resistance to the integrated housing plan helped catapult him from the City Council to the mayor's office in 1989.
That same election saw Yonkers voters approve a referendum discarding the council-manager form of government that has been in use here since the 1930's in favor of a system that will give the new chief executive the power to make high-level appointments, draw up budgets and veto City Council actions. The position of city manager will be abolished, thus ending the Council's influence on that executive's policies and actions. Currently, the Council appoints the manager, and in the case of Yonkers that has been done frequently. The city of 188,000 has had 11 managers in the last 20 years, which averages out to a tenure of 20 months, compared with the national average of nearly six years. Under the new plan, the mayor will serve for four years instead of two.
A City Council president, elected citywide, will assume the mayor's present role, presiding over the Council, which will still have six other members elected from districts. Council approval will still be required for the budget and top-level appointments, although the new Mayor will have veto power.
 But who will be wielding this power? Some, even among Republicans, hope it will not be Mr. Spallone.
The Mayor speaks of Yonkers in rosy terms, describing a $9 million surplus from the 1989-1990 fiscal year that brings the accumulated surplus since 1985 to $64 million. But Yonkers's fiscal experts say any surplus is illusory. All but $700,000 of the $64 million, they say, is earmarked in the four-year plan required by an Emergency Financial Control Board, which was imposed by the state when Yonkers faced default.
Mr. Spallone, a former New York City policeman, talks about about Yonkers as a potential center of global trade "with a market of 35 million people," phrases civic leaders recall from his 1989 election campaign. The City Manager, Neil J. DeLuca, has described Mr. Spallone as an "utter fool" who has "no idea what's going on."
The Mayor, in the meantime, has vowed to continue fighting the housing plan. "We will take them to court on every issue," he said last week. "Every violation of any city regulation will be challenged. I don't think it will be built." He has denounced the judge, Leonard B. Sand, for "social engineering."
"It just hasn't sunk in," said John R. Zakian, executive director of the Yonkers Industrial Development Agency, "that the housing will be built." The plan ordered by Judge Sand, which has been challenged all the way to the Supreme Court and was endorsed by the city under threat of contempt, includes 200 units of low-income housing on seven sites and designed as town houses to blend into middle-class neighborhoods in East and North Yonkers. H.U.D. will pay for the units, which will be on city land.
Another 800 units of affordable housing are to be built by private contractors who would be granted incentives to include the apartments in market-rate developments totaling 4,000 units. So far, no one has come forward.
"Housing has overshadowed everything in this city," Mr. Zakian said. "If we didn't have the housing issue, the magnitude of changes we can expect in city government, a possible turning point for this city, would be more on people's minds."
Mr. Zakian, among others, says he believes that Mr. Spallone's re-election is far from certain. At its winter meeting two weeks ago, the executive committee of the city's Republican Party withheld its endorsement, which is highly unusual in the case of an incumbent who has declared his interest in running again. The next meeting isn't until April.
Other possible Republican candidates include Peter V. Chema, the majority leader of the City Council, and Angelo R. Martinelli, a former Mayor who is now a publisher.
Democrats being mentioned as possible candidates include James Mannion, a restaurateur who appears to have the endorsement of the city's Democratic leader, Ralph Arred, State Assemblyman Terence M. Zaleski and former Mayor Nicholas C. Wasicsko, who supported compliance with Judge Sand's order and lost the election to Mr. Spallone.
"The preoccupation with the housing issue has been terribly harmful to the city," said Mr. Wasicsko, who was instrumental in forming the commission that recommended the change to a strong mayor. "We missed the economic boom of the 1980's, and now with the economy contracting our failure to expand will be more acutely felt."

HEADLINE: Soviet Doubts Before Talks

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 26

 BODY:
Before leaving for Washington today, Foreign Minister Bessmertnykh underlined the Kremlin's displeasure with the United States Congress for linking American economic aid with the harsh new military drive against the Baltic republics' attempt to regain independence.
"I hope I will be able to clarify what's going on there," he declared, stressing that "it would be extremely dangerous" if the improved Soviet-American relations of recent year were reversed or seriously changed. 
 Senior Bush Administration officials said Friday that the Soviet Foreign Minister would be informed that the meeting between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev had best be "postponed" indefinitely because of the Soviet crackdown in the Baltics.
 
No Apology on Baltics
 In his departure remarks, Mr. Bessmertnykh offered little to reverse such pessimism in Washington. The burden of his comments was to express greater sympathy for Iraq in the war and to offer no apology for the Gorbachev Government's severe steps in the Baltics, in which 19 civilians have been killed by soldiers in the last two weeks.
Mr. Bessmertnykh, previously the Soviet Ambassador in Washington, left on his initial mission as Foreign Minister with the Bush Administration increasingly concerned that the now rapid reversal of President Gorbachev's democratization promises would next be reflected in Soviet-American relations. These had been buoyed by several years of historic disarmament progress, culminating in the declared end of the cold war.
But today Mr. Bessmertnykh reflected a different tone, saying that "not all is well" in such pending disarmament issues as conventional weapon reductions.
 
A Warning by Shevardnadze
 The world was dramatically alerted to the reactionary changes in Mr. Gorbachev's Kremlin by Mr. Bessmertnykh's predecessor, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who abruptly resigned as Foreign Minister last month, warning that fresh dictatorship was looming.
Since then, Mr. Gorbachev has issued a series of presidential orders and personnel changes, confirming a rapid shift back toward the Kremlin's traditional hard-line, centralized state methods and away from his own promises of liberalization.
In a matter of days, the Soviet leader has defended troop attacks on Baltic civilians, proposed crimping the press freedoms he pioneered, and, in the name of ferreting out economic crime, authorized broad new police powers for both the K.G.B. and the army.
On the Persian Gulf war, Mr. Bessmertnykh said that while the Kremlin still abided by the United Nations' resolution approving the military action against Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, it now saw a need to "see to it that actions in the area do not exceed limits" on the United Nations mandate.
"There are apprehensions that we are entering the second serious phase of the conflict, when, in addition to the task to liberate Kuwait envisioned in Security Council resolutions, there is a growing threat that Iraq is subject to very grave damages, there is a growing danger for the country's civilian population," he declared. "Naturally, this is a cause for our concern."
 
'Wrong Interpretaion'
 The Foreign Minister said he would work to dispel the Americans' "wrong interpretation" and "emotional perception" of what has been occurring in his country.
"I have to admit that difficulties have emerged at present, especially in the U.S. Congress, which tries to link this sphere to events in the Baltics," he told reporters.
Both the Senate and the House have approved nonbinding resolutions calling on Mr. Gorbachev to halt his use of force in the Baltics and urging President Bush to freeze or review a range of economic help planned on the basis of previous summit meetings.
"The linkage on the Congress's part is a fact," Mr. Bessmertnykh conceded. "I want to find out what the Administration, the President and the Secretary of State think on the issue."

HEADLINE: Lithuania's President a Genuine Democrat

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Over the last few days, we have observed a rapid fallback of the Soviet authorities to the rhetoric of the cold war period. The representation of events in Lithuania and of its President, Vytautas Landsbergis, is a perfect example of this. 
 After the invasion of tanks in Vilnius, the Soviet sources, controlled by the Kremlin, put to work the old propaganda machine, portraying President Landsbergis as a "fascist," an "extreme nationalist" and an "imperialists' accomplice," who is trying to bring back the "bourgeois dictatorship." They did not bother to support these accusations with facts or evidence. Who, indeed, are these imperialists? Could it be the Americans or the Germans who rushed to provide economic help to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's (and not Mr. Landsbergis's) Government?
I know my friend and colleague Vytautas Landsbergis very well. Over more than 20 years, I have maintained professional and personal relationships with him. This intelligent, calm man with a businesslike approach and a great sense of humor is one of the most extraordinary and intellectual people I know. A musicologist and an art critic, a pianist and a music professor, he personifies the cream of the crop of the rich and diverse Lithuanian culture.
Vytautas Landsbergis comes from a remarkable family of intellectuals. His father is a well-known architect, and his grandfather's writings are recognized as classics of Lithuanian literature. His wife and daughter are also musicians, and his son's goal is to become a film maker.
There is nothing more absurd and vile than calling Mr. Landsbergis a fascist. As a Jew who lived in Moscow, I had many friendly talks with him about the ethnic and political problems in relations among Lithuanians, Russians and Jews both past and present. He is a genuine democrat in his convictions and his actions.
Recently President Gorbachev spoke disdainfully of "musicians who govern Lithuania." Yes, indeed, President Landsbergis is a musician. And President Lech Walesa of Poland is an electrician, and President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia is a playwright. And it is not they who send tanks to suppress people fighting for their freedom.

In Search of Short-Order Chips

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

DATELINE: STANFORD, Calif.

 BODY:
Amateur photographers once sent their film for developing to huge plants that took days or weeks to return the finished photos. Then film processing machines were built that were small and inexpensive enough to be used by small shops that could deliver the film in an hour.
"It has revolutionized photography," said Krishna C. Saraswat, a professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University's Center for Integrated Systems. 
 Professor Saraswat and a growing number of other experts believe the semiconductor industry is sorely in need of a similar revolution to help it compete internationally.
The cost of building a computer-chip fabrication plant, a "fab" in industry lingo, is rising to the point that many companies cannot afford them. A large advanced fab now goes for about $300 million, and in a few years is expected to approach $1 billion. The high costs are very troubling to American semiconductor companies, which lack the resources of their larger Japanese competitors. Most small American companies now contract out manufacturing because they can't afford to build their own fabs.
The mega-fabs are generally used for only high-volume chips like dynamic random access memories. But high costs also makes it difficult to produce small volumes of specialized chips, just as it is uneconomical for a Boeing 747 to make short trips.
Professor Saraswat's group at Stanford, then, is helping Texas Instruments to design small, inexpensive micro-fabs that could indeed do for semiconductor manufacturing what the one-hour photo shop did for photography. The micro-fab is just one of several ideas that are being tried to help take the semiconductor industry off what is otherwise bound to be an economically suicidal course.
Capital costs are rising because chips are getting more complex. To get more transistors on a fingernail-sized piece of silicon, the circuit elements must be made smaller, to the point where circuits are only one-hundredth the width of a human hair. Making such small circuits requires extremely sophisticated equipment.
Moreover, as circuit elements become smaller, the requirements for keeping the factory clean become more stringent and more expensive. An invisible speck of dust falling on a chip has the same effect as a boulder falling on a road. Semiconductors are made in "clean rooms," in which the air is extensively filtered and workers are covered from head to toe in "bunny suits" to keep dust from their clothes or flakes of their skin from ruining the chips.
One seemingly simple cost-cutting idea is to clean only the air right around the silicon wafer rather than the entire roomful of air. "We're spending millions and millions of dollars cleaning up the room," said Paul Castrucci, a consultant in Boston and the former chief operating officer of Sematech, a consortium of computer chip producers. "It's completely asinine."
Asyst Technologies, a company in Milpitas, Calif., makes equipment to create a micro-environment around the silicon wafer. Each piece of chip-making machinery is surrounded by an enclosure in which the air is kept very clean. The silicon wafers are carried from machine to machine in a sealed box called a standard mechanical interface (Smif) pod. The wafers are always either in the pod or in the enclosures around each machine. They never get exposed to the air in the room, so the requirements for cleaning the ambient air are reduced.
While micro-environments can cut the cost of cleaning the air, they do not reduce the biggest element of cost -- the sophisticated machinery needed to make chips.
Texas Instruments, with help from Stanford, aims to tackle that problem. The Air Force and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in 1988 awarded T.I. a $113 million contract for the project.
In another three years, the Dallas semiconductor company is expected to have completed a prototype factory able to produce low volumes of chips inexpensively. "It's an affordable chunk that you can put in for going after quick turnaround business," said Pallab Chatterjee, director of the company's semiconductor process and design center.
One way to produce low-cost chips in low volumes is to build small machines that can do more than one step in the manufacturing process, rather than have separate machines for each step. At Stanford, researchers have designed a prototype machine that does some of the common steps, like cleaning the wafer and depositing material on it.
Another approach is to design small modules for performing different steps and to cluster the modules around a central chamber. A robot arm inside would move the wafers between chambers.
While existing semiconductor manufacturing equipment now processes large batches of wafers at a single time, the micro-fab would work on a single wafer at a time. The computerized micro-fab would be capable of switching quickly from one product to another.
The micro-fab industry is already moving toward such clustered systems. Applied Materials, one of the largest producers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, has since 1987 sold a machine that processes a single wafer at a time with multiple chambers for different processes.
Companies are also trying to arrive at standards to make it easier to hook each other's production modules together. Right now, each company making a piece of equipment must design its own robot for handling wafers and its own system for handling gases. If there were industry-wide standards, the cost of equipment could come down.
If the micro-fabs catch on, companies that make semiconductor manufacturing equipment might be able to make many small modules instead of a few big machines. That could allow them to use cheaper mass production techniques to roll out the fabs instead of building them, essentially, by hand. Now, "the equipment is made like they used to make Ferraris," said G. Dan Hutcheson, president of VLSI Research, a San Jose market research company. "A run of 100 is a big run for the equipment industry."
Still, Mr. Hutcheson is skeptical about micro-fab idea working. "When you try to link everything together and automate it, you make it more complex and usually make it more costly," he said.
But others say, that micro-fabs are the best hope for capital-short American companies. As T. J. Rodgers, president of the Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, a chip maker in San Jose, Calif., put it: "A fab that allows the garage shop to become a viable wafer manufacturer again is a super idea."

The War's 3d-World Reverberations

BYLINE: By Joel Kurtzman

 BODY:
What will be the economic and political effect of the gulf war on other countries? Benjamin Weiner, president of Probe International, a political risk-analysis firm in Stamford, Conn., is telling his corporate clients that much of the Middle East and the third world will be affected. The Philippines, Egypt and perhaps even Saudi Arabia may grow unstable as the war continues. Mr. Weiner discussed his views with Joel Kurtzman of the New York Times. 
 Question: What effects will this war have on the countries and economies of the region?
Answer: The third world is going to suffer grievously if this war continues. First, they've suffered from higher oil prices, and if oil prices go up again, they will suffer again.
But they will also suffer because so many of their nationals work in the gulf and have had to leave. In Kuwait, as of Aug. 1, the day before the invasion, there were 3 million foreign workers primarily from the third world. There were 1.6 million Egyptians, 190,000 Indians, 500,000 from the Philippines, 150,000 Sri Lankans and lots and lots of Palestinians. There were also lots of foreign workers in Iraq from these same countries as well as from others, and they had to go as well.
The people who work in the gulf have been extremely important economically to their countries. They sent home their paychecks, which were paid in hard currencies. These payments benefited their home countries as a whole. And by working in the gulf, these people weren't contributing to unemployment at home. Now, with these people unemployed, the money has stopped flowing in and unemployment is growing.
Take Egypt. About 16 percent of its total work force was working in the gulf. Losing that income will give the the Egyptian economy a big jolt. It could even make Egypt unstable. All these people coming home with nothing to do and with no incomes could contribute to instability. The fundamentalists in Egypt could get a boost.
Take the Philippines. The Philippine army is now on alert. There is no martial law, but it could come to that. As soon as their workers left Kuwait and Iraq, they tried to go right back on planes to go to Saudi Arabia. They have nothing to come home to, no incomes and nothing to do.
Q. What impact will this war have on Saudi Arabia?
A. I worry about Saudi Arabia. There are lots of experts who say Saudi Arabia is stable, but I have my doubts. The political and economic structure of Saudi Arabia is based on foreign input -- foreign scientists, foreign engineers, foreign administrators, foreign labor and even foreign soldiers from Pakistan. I don't see the country running well without these people and if war spreads to Saudi Arabia, with ground fighting and frequent bombings, the foreign workers might leave. That can be a real problem for Saudi Arabia.
In addition, you know there is opposition in Saudi Arabia to the United States and its involvement in the gulf. There is a split within the royal family. And all this time during the buildup and war, I have been wondering, where is the Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah? He is the head of the Saudi National Guard and the First Deputy Prime Minister. The National Guard is a tribal organization and more closely aligned with the royal family than the army, which has universal conscription. The Crown Prince has dropped out of sight. He is less amenable to American and Western influence than King Fahd. Is he opposed to American involvement in the Gulf? Was he gotten rid of? What does it mean that he's not around?
Q. What does it mean?
A. I don't know. It could be as simple as some people say -- that he is in Morocco with his mistress. But I am concerned because the country is divided between Westernizers and those who are very conservative, and the royal familiy is split along these lines as well. So it bothers me that the country's No. 2 man is not anywhere around.
Q. How real is Saddam Hussein's threat to attack the interests of America and its allies?
Q. Saddam's attempt to turn this into an Islamic holy war will have no success. First, most Moslems are not Arabs. Malaysian, Indian and Pakistani Muslims are not necessarily going to find solidarity with Iraq. And then among Arabs pan-Arabism just isn't a realistic possibility, let's face it. Twice, Egypt tried to unite with Syria -- unsuccessfully. Then Egypt was an outcast after the Camp David accords. Now Jordan is an outcast member of the Arab family. And among the Arabs, some countries favored Iran and some Iraq during their recent war. There is, of course, always the possibility of Libya or Iraq funding existing groups of terrorists, but we will not see any general uprising of Muslims or of Arabs uniting over this.
Q. Where will the Palestinians and Jordanians come out after the conflict is over?
A. The Palestinians are on the outs right now with the wealthy gulf states for throwing their support to Saddam Hussein. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait contributed large sums of money to the Palestinian cause. But the Palestinians have painted themselves into a corner before and emerged from it. I don't think this will be any different. In time, they will emerge and maybe even get funds once more from Saudi Arabia. The Jordanians are the same. They will emerge from this.
Q. Will the fires Iraq set to some Kuwaiti oil wells do much economic damage?
A. No. This doesn't worry me too much. As long as they haven't destroyed the refineries, damage to the wells is not a problem. Some of the Saudi wells even have cutoffs so that if someone tried to destroy them they could only destroy them so far down the hole. The question is the refineries. These take longer to fix. So far these have not been hurt.
Q. While attention is focused on the gulf, do you expect other areas to heat up?
A. Yes. This will be a time for settling some old scores. We have already been seeing the crackdowns occurring in the Soviet Union as the war escalates in the gulf. The Chinese Government in the north is increasingly eyeing the more reform-oriented south with suspicion. Another old score is along the India-Pakistan border. India fears the Pakistani nuclear bomb program and would love to take out the Pakistani reactor near Islamabad.
And then there is Muammar el-Qaddafi. Why has he been so quiet? He has Chad, Algeria, Niger, Egypt, Tunisia and the Sudan on his borders -- none of which he likes very much.

HEADLINE: Cracking the Whip

BYLINE: By Michael R. Gordon; Michael R. Gordon covers national security issues for The New York Times.

 BODY:
SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE the United States went to war with Iraq, Dick Cheney took a break from the final preparations for battle to discuss the crisis, the Pentagon and his improbable career. Toward the end of the conversation, he was asked about his visits to American troops in the desert.
"It is something that I will live with for a very long time," the Defense Secretary said, referring to his encounters with the soldiers in Saudi Arabia. The comment cracked open a window on the emotions of the man who has guided the largest American military operation since the Vietnam War. 
 And then the window closed. "I think that is all I am going to say on the subject," he said. "It is personal."
The television in his office overlooking the Potomac flickered with the latest reports of the failed meeting that day between Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Iraq's Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz.
There was a long silence. Our hourlong conversation was over.
From the very beginning of the crisis in the Persian Gulf, the 49-year-old former Wyoming Congressman was an Administration emissary to the Arabs and a trusted spokesman, valued for his cool demeanor and measured testimony. He repeatedly reinforced the President's gut instincts for military intervention and helped to translate them into a deployment of 425,000 troops by mid-January.
On Aug. 4, two days after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the Defense Secretary pushed for use of American troops to protect Saudi Arabia. In October, with Saddam Hussein not budging, Cheney recommended that the President send reinforcements to provide a credible "offensive military option." The aim was to intensify the pressure on Saddam Hussein to withdraw and lay the groundwork to defeat him in battle if he didn't. Cheney later told Congress that only military force, not economic sanctions, could insure that Iraqi troops would leave Kuwait.
The Defense Secretary, who never served in the armed forces, took a more hawkish stand than several of his predecessors and many military officers. Harold Brown, James R. Schlesinger and Caspar W. Weinberger, the hard-line Reaganite, all argued that sanctions be given more time before any military attack began. That was also the public position of Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the American commander in the Persian Gulf.
"I would not go so far as to say Cheney is egging the President on, but he is on the same wavelength," a senior Administration official said in December. "Much of the military seem more reluctant. They are way behind Cheney."
Why is he such a hawk? The answer rests partly with his innate conservatism and partly with his loyalty to George Bush.
If Cheney had doubts about the United States march toward war, he contained them behind his iron reserve. He gave no hint of the worries openly voiced by military experts like Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who favored the sanctions approach and warned before the American strike on Iraq that Washington might be caught in a prolonged, costly and unnecessary war.
On Sunday morning news programs, week after week, Cheney coolly presented the Administration's case. And at press conferences before and during the war, he and Army Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made a stoic team.
"He is calm inside," Lynne Vincent Cheney, his wife of 26 years and chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, said of her husband's mood a few days before the United States launched its attack. "He is a man with a deeply held conviction, and he does sleep well. But he is not dispassionate. He never talked much. But he is even quieter now. He is quieter and thinking more."

FIGHTING IN THE Persian Gulf was about the last thing anybody expected when Cheney came to the Defense Department in March 1989. In the months that followed, it looked as if his main challenge would be to scale down and reorganize the post-cold war military in line with new White House policies toward Moscow. Change in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe was overturning decades-old precepts of strategic planning. When Defense Department officials weren't on Capitol Hill, they were worrying about third-world trouble spots like the Philippines and Central America.
The defense of the Arabian oil fields, a priority that had long been second only to the security of Europe, was suffering from benign neglect in light of the cease-fire between Iraq and Iran and a perceived lessening of the Soviet threat to Iran. The Persian Gulf was mentioned only in passing in National Military Strategy, a classified report issued in August 1989 by Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The report mentioned protecting the gulf in the same breath as maintaining access to the "critical natural resources of South American and Africa."
Before August, the Defense Secretary's chief accomplishment -- with help from General Powell, his trusted ally -- was a plan for reducing the military by 25 percent. The Defense Secretary has also been credited for his efforts, belated though they were, to shake up the Pentagon's procurement bureaucracy. His cancellation of the Navy's $57 billion A-12 Avenger attack plane this month followed complaints that military contractors misled him about the cost and progress of the project. Nonetheless, his decision stunned the weapons industry, which had grown accustomed to cost overruns and Government bailouts.
One of Cheney's first tests as a crisis manager was the American standoff with Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega of Panama. In 1989, he plucked a hard-charging Army general, Maxwell R. Thurman, from the verge of retirement, installing him as the head of the United States Southern Command in place of Gen. Frederick A. Woerner Jr., who opposed American intervention in Panama. More important, Cheney recommended the appointment of General Powell as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, rejecting Admiral Crowe's chosen successor, Gen. Robert T. Herres of the Air Force.
General Powell, who had been President Reagan's national security adviser, was more open to military intervention than Admiral Crowe. Generals Thurman and Powell moved quickly to rework plans for invading Panama, laying the basis for Bush's decision to send troops after Noriega in December of that year.
Only in Soviet relations did Cheney appear to be out of step with the White House and State Department. He advised caution in discounting the Soviet threat, and expressed skepticism of the permanence of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms. With the recent resurgence of military influence in the Soviet Union and the crackdown in the Baltics, his deep-seated doubt has lost its taint as the anachronistic mind-set of a cold warrior.
But the Defense Secretary, along with Powell, will be measured primarily by one standard: his skill in supervising the war in the Persian Gulf. That indisputably has made Cheney the most important Pentagon chief since Robert S. McNamara during the Vietnam years. Starting as a Secretary for Peace, he became a Secretary for War.

THE LAST TIME THE United States was at war, Cheney was studying for his doctorate in political science at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. Protests against the Vietnam War disrupted the campus in the 1960's, but Cheney, who was working part time for the Republican Governor of Wisconsin, was not swept up in the turmoil. He says he was "generally supportive" of the war and opposed the demonstrators. He had a deferment and was able to avoid military service. "As did most other Americans, I watched the war from afar," he says.
Born in Lincoln, Neb., Richard Bruce Cheney was raised in Casper, Wyo., where his father worked for the Agriculture Department. It was "an 'American Graffiti' kind of place," says Lynne Cheney, who was his high school sweetheart. "The big thing to do was to drive cars up and down, and go from one root beer stand to another," she recalls. "Dick never did that, which was a great disappointment to me. He worked. He always had a job. He read a lot." He had his own idea of fun; he was the captain of the football team and an outdoorsman.
Cheney went to Yale on a scholarship, but dropped out in his second year because of poor grades. "He probably did a few things I'd just as soon not read about in The New York Times," his wife says.
He rambled around the Western United States for a while, working for an electric company laying power lines, before settling down at the University of Wyoming. There, the Ivy League dropout bore down, earning bachelor's and master's degrees in political science and marrying Lynne Vincent. He then entered graduate school at the University of Wisconsin and, at 27, was selected for a one-year internship in the Capitol Hill office of Representative William A. Steiger, a Republican.
From this launching pad, Cheney began his meteoric career in Washington. When President Nixon chose Representative Donald H. Rumsfeld of Illinois to head the Office of Economic Opportunity, Cheney brashly sent Rumsfeld a 12-page memo on how to run the agency. Rumsfeld liked what he read, and the college intern became the director of Congressional relations for the agency, never returning to Wisconsin to finish his studies.
For much of the next decade, he lived in Rumsfeld's orbit, one of the legion of Washington special assistants who hitch their fortunes to a political star. It was a career marked by total loyalty, dedication and a certain subjugation of ego -- qualities that he still exhibits and demands of his subordinates at the Pentagon.
When Gerald R. Ford became President, Rumsfeld was named White House chief of staff and Cheney assumed his familiar role as Rumsfeld's deputy. When Rumsfeld was appointed Defense Secretary, his loyal lieutenant, then only 34, replaced him in the White House.
President Ford's loss to Jimmy Carter in 1976 was a turning point for the quintessential Washington staff man. Deciding that it was time to create his own political identity, he returned to Wyoming and ran for Congress.
Kenneth L. Adelman, former director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and a friend of Cheney's from their days together at the Office of Economic Opportunity, remembers that period: "He had politics in his blood. After leaving the job of chief of staff, he had many lucrative offers but decided to run for an unsure seat. He went from the top of the top in politics, namely chief of staff for the President of the United States, to the bottom of the bottom, a candidate from a minority party running to become a freshman member of the House."
No sooner was his Congressional campaign under way than Cheney, then 37 years old, suffered a heart attack. He briefly considered dropping out of the race. But six weeks later he had quit his two-pack-a-day smoking habit and was back on the campaign trail.
"I finally concluded," he says now, "and this may be a little bit of rationalization, that it was more stressful to contemplate spending your life doing something that was not what you want to be doing and found a cardiologist who believed hard work never killed anybody." (Cheney had two more heart attacks. In 1988, he had a coronary bypass operation, was pronounced fit and now exercises regularly.)
After winning a seat in the House in 1978 as Wyoming's only Representative, Cheney rose rapidly in the Republican ranks. He was elected House minority whip in 1988 and became heir apparent to Robert H. Michel, the House Republican leader. He was seen as a pragmatic conservative who was more conservative than pragmatic, and as a hawk who admitted that he never met a weapon system he didn't like.
Unlike other leaders of the legislative branch, notably Senator Nunn, who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee, Cheney was not interested in protecting Congressional prerogatives from White House incursions. He repeatedly argued for giving President Reagan wide discretion in using military force and making foreign policy.
"He was the guy whom the Administration depended on to defend its interests on the hill," says Tony Coelho, the former Democratic whip in the House. "Part of his demeanor was that he would not be the one to talk to the press on the record about it. If others wanted to take credit, that was fine with him."
With the Senate's rejection of John G. Tower, Cheney quickly became the Administration's choice to be Defense Secretary. For the White House, he appeared to have the right mix of characteristics. A team player, he would not aggressively contest Secretary of State Baker's pre-eminent foreign policy role as Caspar W. Weinberger tried to do with George P. Shultz in the Reagan years. A popular Congressman, Cheney was eminently confirmable.
And his personal life was a contrast to that of Tower, who was accused of womanizing and heavy drinking. Cheney and his wife have not been fixtures of Washington night life, though they have attended cultural functions related to her job at the National Endowment for the Humanities. The couple's two daughters, Mary and Elizabeth, are grown.
On the morning of the vote against Tower, John H. Sununu, the chief of staff, called Cheney and asked him to come to the White House. The ostensible purpose of the visit with Sununu and the national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, was to solicit his ideas on suitable replacements for Defense Secretary. After some desultory conversation, however, Scowcroft asked if he would accept the job ifthe President offered it.
The Congressman wanted a night to think it over. That evening, Baker called to urge him to take the job. The two men, friends since the Ford Administration, consult often on political matters and go on wilderness trips together. (Last November, Cheney and Baker, along with Baker's sons, took a respite from Washington and flew to Wyoming for a hunting and fishing trip.)
When Bush formally asked him to head the Pentagon, Cheney accepted. He arrived in March 1989, seven months before the Berlin wall came down. "I clearly did not anticipate, nor did anybody else, the radical changes that 1989 would bring," he says.

THE SECRETARY'S cavernous office is decorated with old military emblems, as well as signs of the changing world order. On a far corner wall is a framed cartoon from a Florida newspaper of Cheney spoiling a toast between Bush and Gorbachev. In the room's center is an immense wooden desk, first used by Gen. John J. Pershing during World War I.
Cheney says he feels like a wagon driver trying to control galloping horses. It is not so much that the horses are running at different strides, he says, but that the horses "are not all hitched to the same end of the wagon." He has not hesitated to crack the whip. But in the beginning he was better at gathering power than at using it effectively.
In his first weeks in the job, he alerted the military that he was in charge when he reprimanded the Air Force Chief of Staff, Larry D. Welch, for trying to reach budget compromises with Congress without his authorization. Later, when Gen. John T. Chain Jr., then head of the Air Force Strategic Air Command, publicly differed with the Bush Administration's position on nuclear arms, Cheney ordered him to fly to Washington for a dressing-down. After Welch's successor, Gen. Michael J. Dugan, made unauthorized comments last September about Israeli advice on fighting the Iraqis and touted the Air Force as the main instrument for winning a war in the gulf, the Defense Secretary removed him. An open war between Pentagon officials, like one that raged between Navy Secretary John F. Lehman Jr. and Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Thayer during Weinberger's tenure, is unthinkable today.
But in the beginning, Cheney's efforts to use the levers of his power were unsure. After ordering a review of aircraft like the A-12, the C-17 transport plane and B-2 Stealth bomber, the Defense Secretary admits that he paid too much attention to adjusting the weapons projects in light of the receding Soviet threat and too little to managing the expensive programs themselves.
His early moves to reshape the military were also somewhat halting. The Defense Department's report to Congress for its 1990 budget was the briefest in memory and gave little hint of the possibilities opened up by the cold war's end. In fact, the report declared that it was "the worst possible time to contemplate changes in defense strategy."
Cheney and his deputies wanted to buy time to study the changes in Eastern Europe and to put the brakes on the Capitol Hill budget makers who were eager for a peace dividend. But the statement sent a message inside and outside the Pentagon that big innovations were not required.
Cheney's efforts to win support for his budget led to an unnecessary public dispute with the Director of Central Intelligence, William H. Webster. In his testimony to Congress last spring, the C.I.A. chief said the changes in Moscow were "irreversible," a stand that undercut Cheney's argument that Soviet intentions were too uncertain to justify deep reductions in the military.
In a rare display of irritation, the Defense Secretary told CNN that Webster's testimony had been "unhelpful." The remark created the impression that Cheney was trying to stifle an intelligence assessment to protect his budget. (It turned out that the C.I.A. had sent a draft of Webster's testimony to Cheney's top deputy on intelligence matters, but because of a bureaucratic snafu a copy never made it to the Defense Secretary.)
By mid-summer, however, Cheney was ready to act on his own strategic assessments. Working with General Powell and the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, Paul Wolfowitz, he outlined plans to shrink the military by 25 percent, mostly by cutting the Army and Air Force units set up to defend Europe and by emphasizing "reconstitutable" partly manned Army divisions that could be brought up to full strength in a prolonged crisis. Cheney's plan was a major revision of Pentagon thinking: it was now assumed that the United States would have a year or more to prepare for a global war with the Soviet Union instead of the two weeks assumed by war planners for 40 years.
The department planned an elaborate coming-out party for its new blueprint. President Bush was to unveil it in a speech in Aspen, Colo., and Cheney and Brent Scowcroft were supposed to be on hand to brief the press. But Cheney never made it to Colorado. The evening before the trip, the Defense Secretary received a telephone call at his suburban Virginia home from Adm. Bill A. Owens, then his military assistant, who has since been promoted to commander of the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean. Saddam Hussein's forces had moved into Kuwait.

THE INVASION CAUGHT the Pentagon in the middle of updating its strategy in the Persian Gulf. Early last year, Cheney and Powell approved a classified document that stressed the need for more contingency planning for a war in the region and placed the Arabian Peninsula on a par with the Pacific in spending priorities. Cheney gave General Schwarzkopf the go-ahead to work on a new gulf strategy that put more emphasis on defending Saudi Arabia and less on guarding against a Soviet invasion of Iran. But the Defense Secretary did not discount the Soviet threat altogether. "We should retain our capability to defend there against either a Soviet-led or Soviet-supported contingency or a robust regional threat," the document said. It did not specifically mention the prospect of an Iraqi attack on Saudi Arabia.
Though incomplete, General Schwarzkopf's planning aided the Administration in its initial response to Saddam Hussein. By the time of Iraq's invasion, he had finished two parts of a plan to defend Saudi Arabia in the event of an attack. The first plotted the deployment of tactical aircraft; the second detailed the mobilization of ground troops. But General Schwarzkopf was never directed to plan for counterattack. Moreover, the Pentagon had not asked for sufficient funds to support its planning. While Cheney sought billions for "Star Wars" and new strategic nuclear weapons, he never requested money for sealift ships, which speed the transport of troops. Indeed, he wanted to reroute funds already allocated for such ships to other areas. Meanwhile, the Naval Ready Reserve sealift fleet was not well maintained.
"They kept coming to us with less than enough money for the very type of actions in which we are now involved," said John P. Murtha, a Pennsylvania Democrat who is chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on defense.
Caught off guard by the invasion, the White House scrambled into action. The night of Aug. 2, President Bush offered to send a tactical fighter squadron to Saudi Arabia as a demonstration of support. The Saudis turned down the offer.
Cheney pushed the military hard for an assessment of American options. He was quick to accept its view that immediate retaliatory air strikes would fail without backup from ground troops. That fateful judgment set the stage for months of pressure diplomacy, including economic sanctions.
The large number of troops initially envisaged by Powell reflected the military's tendency to err on the side of caution. But that sheer mass of air and ground forces called for in the August plan -- about 240,000 airmen, sailors, marines and soldiers to be based throughout the gulf -- raised the question of Saudi sensitivities to such a huge foreign presence.
President Bush accepted the Pentagon's plan two days after the invasion, and it was left to Cheney and Powell to sell the idea to the Saudis. That afternoon, Cheney asked the Saudi Ambassador, Prince Bandar bin Sultan bin Abdul Aziz, to come to his office.
The Saudi response was not preordained. Not only had the Saudis turned down Bush's offer to send fighter squadrons, but in July Prince Bandar had quietly protested the American decision to send two military refueling planes to the United Arab Emirates as part of an aerial exercise.
The emirates had proposed it after being threatened by Iraq. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt also sent a message to President Bush after the drill, asking the United States to keep a low profile in the gulf. In the Administration, there had been initial disagreement over whether to go ahead with even this small step, and Cheney intervened to overcome early suggestions by the State Department that the emirates be advised to conduct the exercise with the Saudis.
In his Pentagon meeting with Cheney, Prince Bandar seemed stunned by the projected size of the American deployment, according to an account by a Pentagon official. "There was a catching of breath," the official recalls, as Bandar contemplated the problems of such an overwhelming presence in Saudi Arabia. Then the Prince's expression changed. "I guess that means you are serious," he said with a smile. "Now you see why we did not want a tactical fighter squadron. That is enough to get us in trouble but not enough to do anything."
The Prince urged American officials to fly to Saudi Arabia to present the plan to King Fahd. But virtually up to the last minute it was unclear whether the Saudis were prepared to receive Cheney. His departure was delayed twice. Finally, the signal came.
In King Fahd's marble palace in Jidda, he presented President Bush's offer to send more than 200,000 troops to the Persian Gulf. Without such numbers, he argued, Saudi Arabia would risk becoming another Kuwait. Cheney told King Fahd that the troops would stay only so long as they were wanted and that Washington would build up Saudi defensive capabilities -- an allusion to an arms sale.
After the presentation, the King conferred with his advisers in Arabic, which Charles W. Freeman Jr., the American Ambassador to Saudi Arabia and the only American present with any knowledge of the language, strained to understand. There seemed to be some argument, when one Saudi royal official asked whether the Americans would ever leave. Finally, King Fahd said he would accept the troops.
"I was surprised with how quickly he agreed," Cheney said a few days before war broke out. "I anticipated that I would be forced to wait a day or two for an answer. They clearly understood the scope of the problem."
It was the beginning of a long road. In mid-December, as hopes for peace dimmed, the Defense Secretary, wearing cowboy boots, a blue work shirt and jeans, inspected an Air Force unit in eastern Saudi Arabia.
He and General Powell gave speeches of support to the troops, preparing them for battle with Saddam Hussein. "It's far better to deal with him now than 5 or 10 years from now," Cheney said. He also referred to Vietnam. "The only acceptable outcome is absolute, total victory," he said, vowing that American troops will not have "their hands tied behind their backs." Later, on a plane back to the city of Dhahran, he was even quieter and more absorbed than usual.

HEADLINE: Minnesota's Teacher of the Year Is Laid Off in Budget Crisis

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
Cathy Nelson has been a teacher for 15 years, the last 13 of them teaching social studies at Fridley High School, in Fridley, Minn., near Minneapolis. She has found innovative ways to interest students in history, and has found time to earn a doctoral degree from the University of Minnesota.
Along with the admiration of her students, Ms. Nelson has won a number of awards. Last October she was named Minnesota's Teacher of the Year.
The only trouble was, she had just been laid off. 
 The 37-year-old teacher, the third generation in her family to teach, was a victim of budget cuts, a declining student enrollment and the seniority system at the Fridley Independent School District.
"What happened is obvious," said Donald A. Meyers, principal at Fridley High School. "Last hired is the first fired."
 
Laid Off, Again
 Unfortunately for Ms. Nelson, this is the fourth time that has happened. With 13 years at Fridley, she had the shortest length of service among the school's five social studies teachers.
"It was real hard for me to accept the fact that I'd been laid off when I work so hard," said Ms. Nelson, who will learn next month if the district has enough students and money to hire her a fifth time next fall. "But in truth, many good teachers are laid off."
Indeed, teachers lacking seniority have long been vulnerable when schools hit hard times. But many experts in education policy find an unpleasant irony in laying off a widely respected teacher at a time when the quality of teaching is under assault by public opinion.
"I think this is an outrage," said Joe Nathan, a senior fellow at the Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota who is studying ways to improve schooling. Despite economic ills, "school districts need to think about priorities," he said, "and I would like to think that districts could find ways to keep good teachers."
 
No More 'Yo-Yo' Treatment
 The Fridley district did try to keep Ms. Nelson, offering her a part-time job in teaching combined with another part-time job in staff development. But she declined, saying she was weary of the "yo-yo" treatment.
Since the latest layoff, Ms. Nelson said, she has been working as a curriculum consultant, helping local schools design and submit state-mandated plans showing how these school systems plan to make their curriculums more culturally diverse.
She has also tackled the job of representing the state's teachers with zest, As Teacher of the Year, she has addressed about 30 educational, civic and business groups since October, stressing the importance of good teachers.
"I'd go back to the classroom in a minute," said Ms. Nelson, who comes from a family of educators. Her mother, Norma, teaches second grade in Lake Park, Minn., and encouraged her children to pursue education careers. Ms. Nelson's sister, Terri, is a school psychologist, and a brother, Bruce, coaches a high school girls' basketball team. Ms. Nelson's grandmother also taught school.
 
Teachers Don't Often Leave

Norma Nelson maintains that "teaching is a good job," despite what has happened to her daughter. She pointed out that part of her daughter's problem is that teachers with seniority rarely leave their jobs, especially in good school systems like Fridley's.
In each of the last two years, for example, two of the district's four schools have received national citations of excellence from the Federal Department of Education; the awards are based on student test scores, class size, dropout rates and graduation rates.
But Fridley, like many areas, has been hit by shrinking enrollment -- to about 2,500 students now, from about 6,000 in the early 1970's -- and by tough economic times. The recession has forced Fridley for the second straight year to cut $250,000 from its annual budget of about $12 million.
Losing her job for the fourth time "has taken a little of the luster off the plaque," acknowledged Ms. Nelson, who also received $1,000 for winning the state honor.
"I used to say it's unbelievable," she said of her layoffs. "Now I say it's all too believable."

HEADLINE: SUPER BOWL XXV;
Levy Takes Scholarly Path to Tampa

BYLINE: By GERALD ESKENAZI, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla., Jan. 26

 BODY:
In his choice of words (how many head coaches use "oxymoron" in a press conference?), style of dress and preparation, Marv Levy could be standing in front of an eager young collection of students at a prestigious college.
Instead, the young men who listen to him invariably weigh a lot, are possessed of remarkable strength and are so motivated after he speaks that they go out and tackle people. 
 Levy is a rarity, but not unique: highly educated and erudite, and a National Football League head coach.
The terms are not mutually exclusive. Tommy Prothro, a Duke graduate and onetime coach of the Chargers, is an internationally recognized bridge player. Bill Walsh retained the aura of Stanford University, where he coached, although he went to San Jose State.
The Giants' defensive coordinator, Bill Belichick, was an economics major at Wesleyan. Tom Bresnahan, the Bills' offensive-line coach, received cum laude honors in economics and philosophy from Holy Cross, before earning a master's.
 
Following in Footsteps
 At the age of 62, Levy is finally enjoying the sort of success that few coaches, from football factories or ivory towers, achieve: his club is playing in a Super Bowl.
Levy says he doesn't remember if there was a moment, the shock of recognition, when he realized that there was something more important than being Phi Beta Kappa and heading for Harvard Law School.
"I had such wonderful coaches at Coe," he said of his undergraduate football days at Coe College in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. "I idolized them. I got to know their families, I enjoyed the camaraderie. And I thought what a life that is. That's what I want to do with my life."
And so he has.
Levy grew up in Chicago, where his father, who was born in England, was in the wholesale produce business. He remembers him as "a wonderful, supportive man."
After graduating from high school, Levy joined the Army Air Corps, and then entered Coe. He was a halfback, but also a scholar, and he enrolled in Harvard Law School.
"I had prepared for Harvard," he said. "But then I had real doubts. I'd sit in law school and think, I'd rather be coaching."
He called his father, a man, he recalled, "who never told me I couldn't try anything."
"When I told him of my decision, he said, 'Just be a good one,' " Levy said.
 
Change in Plans
 But Levy didn't leave Harvard. The law school had started classes a few weeks before the other graduate schools did.
"I thought a master's degree would be valuable, no matter what I wanted to do," Levy said. Harvard allowed him to switch to the graduate school of arts and science, and he graduated with a master's in history.
There were times the master's might have been valuable, indeed. This is his 14th coaching job.
That number evokes an anecdote from his days at Coe.
"I remember in my senior year they gave a psychological profile to the students," he said. "The dean called me in and said, 'You're the only guy in the class who listed security as the last consideration.' "
Yet just months after he earned his master's in 1951, he took a job at a high school in St. Louis. "I just wanted to be the best high school coach the area had ever known," Levy recalled.
Then he was an assistant at Coe, to his former high school coach, Dick Clausen, at New Mexico, and, finally, head coach at New Mexico, where he was Skyline Conference coach of the year in both 1958 and 1959.
But Levy thought it was possible to coach big-time winning football at a more intellectually oriented school. ("I made a mistake.") He tried the cachet of coaching at the University of California at Berkeley. He thought, "I can outcoach the other guys."
 
Getting to the Pros
 Instead, he was to admit, he ran across "tremendously stringent entrance requirements." Good coaching does not overcome your scholars against the other team's football players.
From there, Levy spent five years at William & Mary in Virginia, and then one as an assistant with the Eagles. George Allen tapped him as assistant coach with the Rams, where Levy became one of the first special-teams coaches in the league, charged with organizing punting and kicking teams. He followed Allen to the Redskins.
In 1973, Levy left for the Montreal Alouettes. In five years in the Canadian Football League his teams won two championships. Finally, he got his first N.F.L. head-coaching job with the Kansas City Chiefs, which lasted five seasons. He was able to land a job with the United States Football League's Chicago Blitz and finally at Buffalo late in the 1986 season.
Levy's wry humor has not been sullied by the pressure of coaching and of constant movement.
"People think that because of his background he's very serious all the time," said the Bills' general manager, Bill Polian. "But he's more like George Burns than George Santayana."

HEADLINE: Fidelity's Secret Agent Man

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
Alfred Fenaughty is the president of Information International Inc. in Culver City, Calif., a publicly traded company that makes advanced computer equipment for the publishing industry. When a pleasant analyst showed up one day in 1987 saying he was from the Boston-based Kelso Management Company, which provided investment recommendations to "the Fidelity group," Mr. Fenaughty was pleased and proud.
Who did Mr. Fenaughty think was at his door? "Fidelity -- the mutual fund people," he said. "In all their communications, they were presenting themselves as advisers to Fidelity. They came in under the same cloak. And their thoroughness, their studiousness -- it all suggested a long-term investor. So we did what we could to encourage them." 
 It was Fidelity -- but it was a little-known side of the financial company's sprawling empire, one that plays hardball under the firm hand of Kelso's intense and aggressive president, Dorsey R. Gardner. And now, three years later, Mr. Fenaughty is fighting for his corporate life. Kelso, backed by Fidelity money, owns nearly 34 percent of his company and is pressuring it to pay out its cash to shareholders and put itself up for sale. Mr. Fenaughty, in short, is convinced that he has been the victim of a brutal ruse, and that Fidelity bears much of the blame.
If he saw the Kelso-Fidelity group buying a big stake in a public company today, he said, "I'd assume it was with the intention of finding the quickest way of exploiting the company and making the quickest buck. I'd prepare for attempted rape."
As Mr. Fenaughty and a growing number of executives at other midsize companies approached by Kelso now know, the investors represented by the management company are not members of the vast family of public mutual funds operated by the Boston-based Fidelity group, a behemoth with $124 billion in managed assets, including $12 billion in the stellar Magellan Fund. Fidelity's public mutual funds typically buy a limited stake in a company and quietly sell if they lose faith in its future.
 
Fidelity's Other Face
 The Kelso investors, by contrast, are members of a far less benign side of Fidelity: a loose collection of private pools of money, in European and Caribbean tax havens, marked by a strong appetite for speculative profits and a willingness to engage in whatever level of boardroom warfare is necessary to achieve them.
Separately organized and legally distinct from the mutual funds, this other operation functions as Fidelity's second, tougher face. It is financed in part by profits generated by the mutual fund business. And it is headed by Edward C. Johnson 3d, chairman of the privately held FMR Corporation, Fidelity's parent company, and shares many other officers with the mutual fund organization. But this group, largely operated by FMR's international arm through management contracts, is run on a day-to-day basis by Mr. Gardner.
Mr. Gardner insists that he tries to make it "very, very clear" to those he deals with that he is independent of Fidelity's public mutual fund operation. "If people let themselves be led astray, it's not our fault," he said.
Over the past decade, Mr. Gardner has used money raised by FMR entities to rewrite the history of more than a dozen corporations, all in an effort, he said, to protect shareholders from the negligence of management.
Representing such little-known investment vehicles as the Integrity Fund and the Domestic Values fund -- and armed with powers of attorney to vote their shares as he sees fit -- Mr. Gardner has been a combative director of at least nine of these corporations, eventually becoming chairman of three. In those roles, he has presided over the sale of three companies and has pushed hard for major financial or managerial changes at five others. Right now, he is openly battling management at four companies, including Information International, and he is quietly building up sizable holdings in at least 10 more.
 
Using a Reputation
 These muscular tactics, of course, are commonplace among "corporate raiders" like Irwin Jacobs and Carl Icahn, who state their mission as "the enhancement of shareholder values." And no regulatory agency has accused Fidelity in any of its permutations of a breach of securities laws.
Nonetheless, numerous executives at companies targeted by Mr. Gardner say that he has used Fidelity's friendly reputation as a smokescreen for his bare-knuckles activities. After all, they say, the Fidelity known to the public carefully projects a straightforward image as a responsible but hands-off investor. The executives say they had no reason to suspect a different agenda when Mr. Gardner came calling, and Mr. Gardner, they say, had an ethical, if not legal, duty to disclose which Fidelity he was representing.
"They don't want to say anything that would tarnish their reputation as long-term investors," said Wendell Hung, chief executive of the Deltak Corporation, an energy equipment manufacturer in Minneapolis that Mr. Gardner helped to push into a leveraged buyout in 1989. "But they're not investors. They're traders. And they have gone completely unnoticed -- that's the cunning part. That's the only difference between them and somebody like Irwin Jacobs."
More than corporate confusion is at issue in these deals, however. The role that Fidelity has played in financing Mr. Gardner's work shows clearly the raw financial power that Ned Johnson and his FMR Corporation have acquired during the mutual fund boom of the past decade -- and how they could use that power to duplicate Mr. Gardner's activism on a grand scale in the 1990's.
"It is important for people to realize that the Fidelity organization is not just a friendly family of open-end mutual funds; it is a complex maze of many different types of investment vehicles," said Don Christensen, editor of the Insider Outlook newsletter in New York and one of the few analysts to keep track of what Fidelity and Mr. Gardner are doing. "What they have done already is simply a dress rehearsal for what they can do in the years ahead."
 
'Never Tried to Hide It'
 Mr. Johnson declined several requests for an interview to discuss Mr. Gardner's work and how the foreign operations he runs fit into Mr. Johnson's vision of FMR's future. Robert C. Pozen, FMR's general counsel, said he could not say whether corporate America was confused about the agenda Mr. Gardner pursues for FMR. "But we've never tried to hide it," he said. "We really can't say how other people understand it."
The company "makes a great effort to explain that this is a completely separate organization," he said, although he could cite no specific steps it has taken to remedy whatever confusion may exist. Mr. Pozen emphasized that the Gardner-run investment pools are not sold to the American public, and that Mr. Gardner's activities represent "a very, very small" aspect of FMR's business. Mr. Gardner does not report publicly on his funds' results. But a review of the record shows that many of his deals have been spectacularly successful while others were major disappointments.
It is true that the partnerships, trusts and other entities that Mr. Gardner manages are small -- about $4 million was raised from private investors for the first one in the early 80's, and $40 million was raised for the most recent one. In all, Mr. Pozen said, Mr. Gardner controls less than $100 million in foreign and FMR corporate money in pools that trace their lineage back to Fidelity's domestic discount brokerage unit in Boston or to Fidelity International Ltd. in Bermuda, which sells public mutual funds and other financial services abroad.
But FMR intends to sharply expand its international business, and its domestic mutual funds provide both the profits and the influence that underwrite that effort. "We have become the dominant force in the mutual fund industry in the United States and the United Kingdom," said Barry Bateman, a Fidelity International executive, in announcing a new set of foreign retail funds last September. "It is our intention to repeat this success on a global scale during the 90's."
If FMR accomplishes that aim, it will also be in a position to expand this much less visible side of its international operations: the private tax-haven partnerships run by raider-style managers like Mr. Gardner.
 
Rising Through the Ranks
 Dorsey Robertson Gardner, who was born in 1942, is a graduate of Yale and the Harvard Business School, and spent several of his student summers as a Fidelity intern. After a brief experiment running his own market forecasting firm in New York -- "I didn't like New York. My wife had nightmares," he said of the experience -- he returned to Boston and to Fidelity in 1970.
In the 70's, Mr. Gardner rose through the ranks at Fidelity, becoming a member of the company's policy committee. He still boasts of his close relationship with the enigmatic Ned Johnson, who took over as chairman of the family-controlled Fidelity organization in 1972. Four years earlier, Mr. Johnson had set up an international unit at Fidelity; in 1980, it was spun off as Fidelity International. The reason, said Mr. Pozen, was that American tax laws deter foreigners from investing through domestic organizations.
Also in 1980, Mr. Gardner resigned from Fidelity to start his own firm, Kelso Management. But the separation seems more symbolic than real. Kelso occupies space in an FMR-owned building three doors from Fidelity's Boston headquarters. A recent request for an interview with Mr. Gardner was handled by Fidelity's public relations staff, and Mr. Pozen sat in on the session, saying he was acting, "in an informal way," as Mr. Gardner's legal adviser. But most revealing is Kelso's client list: The only names on it are FMR and Fidelity International.
As for the efforts Mr. Pozen said FMR has made to clarify its relationship with Mr. Gardner, they seem to consist of detailing the complicated lineage of the various Kelso-run investment pools in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Indeed, on the few occasions Mr. Gardner's activism has drawn news media attention, it has been portrayed as some special role thrust upon him by events. In February 1987, for example, a management buyout proposal at the Purolator Courier Corporation put a spotlight on Mr. Gardner, who had joined the board in October 1986 and then resigned a few months later to seek other bidders for the company. In interviews at the time, Mr. Gardner portrayed his directorship as a rarity. "We normally don't go on boards," he said. "But we were concerned that the company would pay 'greenmail' and we wanted to make sure they didn't."
 
'A Lot of Problems'
 The same theme was struck at the corporate level in August 1989 when Peter Lynch, who was then the manager of the huge Magellan Fund, went on the board of W. R. Grace & Company. At that time, Mr. Pozen described Mr. Lynch's directorship as a rare departure from company policy.
"While we believe strongly in shareholder rights," Mr. Pozen said, "we do not subscribe to the view that institutional investors should be represented on boards. It causes a lot of legal problems." Indeed, Fidelity insisted that Mr. Lynch sell Magellan's Grace shares and not discuss the company's internal affairs with other Fidelity managers.
Yet on the day Mr. Pozen made those comments, Mr. Gardner was on the board of numerous companies and it was Fidelity's muscle as a shareholder that had put him there. Mr. Pozen now says that he intended his statement to apply only to Fidelity's public mutual funds.
Even when Fidelity executives do talk about Mr. Gardner, their responses are often less than complete. For example, a review of dozens of public records in the S.E.C. files shows that Mr. Gardner is the "adviser" or "sub-adviser" of eight investment vehicles -- six foreign entities set up by Fidelity International; the Domestic Values fund, which is simply an account FMR set up with its own money, and the Integrity Fund, a domestic subsidiary of a unit of Fidelity Brokerage Services. Until last year, he also managed two other foreign funds, the Fidelity Discovery Fund and the Fidelity World Fund, both in Luxembourg.
 
Difference in Numbers
 Yet when Mr. Gardner and Mr. Pozen were asked recently how many entities Mr. Gardner managed, they initially mentioned only a group of four Caribbean funds and two of their subsidiaries set up by Fidelity International under the name "American Values." Only after numerous follow-up questions did they confirm the full roster, including the corporate accounts he manages for FMR.
Whatever the scope of Mr. Gardner's duties, several executives who have been approached by Kelso say they misunderstood his mission, at least at first:
* When the funds Mr. Gardner runs first bought their stake in Deltak, "I was somewhat naive," said Dr. Hung, Deltak's chief executive. "I didn't know all the details, but I thought it was Fidelity. I thought it was great to be associated with Fidelity mutual funds."
Later, Mr. Gardner and John R. Kountz, his vice president, demanded seats on the Deltak board and began to insist that the company be sold. They even tried to interest Deltak's chief competitor in buying the company, without the prior knowledge of others on the Deltak board. Finally, after a long and distracting auction, Dr. Hung organized a group to take Deltak private in 1989, buying out Mr. Gardner's clients and other public investors. Today, the company finds itself sailing into a recession with a worrisome level of debt and high interest payments.
"Business people don't always agree on absolutely everything," said Mr. Gardner. "But we were very constructive at Deltak. John and I made a very big contribution."
* Between October 1989 and March 1990, funds run by Mr. Gardner accumulated 11.8 percent of the shares of Nuvision, an optical products company in Flint, Mich. "I recall talking to one or more people about who he was," said Jonathan Raven, the company president. "We understood him to be part of Fidelity -- which we saw as relatively benign and certainly not a raider-type investor. We sure didn't think he was who he ended up being."
Mr. Gardner ended up being a very assertive shareholder. First, he and another money manager, Leopold Swergold, teamed up to try to engineer a merger between Nuvision and D.O.C. Optics, a competitor in which Mr. Gardner also held a large stake. Their matchmaking alliance was not revealed on any of Mr. Gardner's S.E.C. reports, he said, because "these were very preliminary discussions" that he felt were not subject to disclosure. Then, after the merger idea got a cool reception at Nuvision, Mr. Gardner sent a public letter to the company last April to demand that its chairman be removed. Nuvision has so far ignored the demand.
Mr. Gardner defended his actions as being protective of shareholders. "It's a case of a public company acting as if it's a private company," he said.
* Mr. Gardner also used Fidelity's off-shore funds to buy a stake in House of Fabrics of Sherman Oaks, Calif., which owns a large chain of fabric stores. By late 1988, his 8.8 percent stake attracted public and corporate attention. Gary L. Larkins, the company's president, told reporters at the time that he continued to view the FMR group as "passive investors." By January 1990, Mr. Gardner controlled nearly 21 percent of the company, and in February he became a company director.
 
Quiet, Then a Shakeup
 "There is a pattern," said Mr. Christensen, the newsletter editor, to Mr. Gardner's efforts on Fidelity's behalf. "He picks small companies that nobody pays attention to, companies with fairly unsophisticated management. He buys slowly. There's a long period of quiet. And then there is some kind of major shakeup."
One reason that the pattern has gone largely unnoticed, Mr. Christensen said, is Mr. Gardner's use of confusing nomenclature. "It's not just the Fidelity thing -- even the name he chose for his own firm is confusing," Mr. Christensen said, noting that "Kelso Management Company" is very similar to Kelso Asset Management Company, a much larger investment company which is widely known for its pioneering work on corporate employee stock ownership plans.
"He plays little games," Mr. Christensen added. "But what is so interesting is the number of games he plays -- and that he plays them with Fidelity's money."
While Mr. Gardner conceded that Kelso frequently gets telephone calls from executives asking about his status, he said, "Anybody who was reasonably diligent and asked the question would get the correct answer. We've never tried to confuse anybody."
 
 
THE BITTER BATTLE OVER G.R.I.
 What is Dorsey Gardner, Fidelity's abrasive investment adviser, like in battle? Judging by some of his recent campaigns, he is highly aggressive, but not always successful.
For the wealthy investors who finance Mr. Gardner's activities, the spoils of war sometimes have been quite handsome.
But Mr. Gardner also has faced major disappointments, bruising battles that drag on for years without a profit. Few have been messier than the fight over the G.R.I. Corporation, a direct-mail retailer of cosmetics and household products in Chicago.
In May 1988, G.R.I. management proposed taking the company private for $10 a share. Mr. Gardner objected on behalf of his Fidelity investors who owned about 20 percent of the company, saying the price was too low. To block the bid, he formed an alliance with two other large investors: Albert Friedman, a Florida businessman, whose representative on the G.R.I. board was Bernard Zimmerman, an investment banker in Westport, Conn.; and the Minneapolis Employees Retirement Fund, a public pension fund that was represented by its executive director, John Chenoweth.
The trio blocked the buyout and elected Mr. Gardner to the board, where his relationship with David Rubin, the company's chief executive, rapidly deteriorated. On Jan. 13, 1989, Mr. Rubin resigned. Mr. Gardner became the company's chairman and, for the three months it took to replace Mr. Rubin, its president and chief executive as well.
Having taken power, Mr. Gardner turned on his allies. Minutes before a board meeting on Feb. 2, 1989, he abruptly announced a plan to reduce the board's size and eliminate the seats held by Mr. Chenoweth and Mr. Zimmerman, who he later said were "not supportive of my efforts to turn the company around." Defiant, Mr. Chenoweth announced that his fund would vote its shares to re-elect Mr. Zimmerman.
The warfare escalated sharply. On March 28, 1989, Mr. Gardner had the company sue Mr. Zimmerman, charging he had violated antitrust laws by serving as a director of another company Mr. Gardner considered a G.R.I. competitor. (Other G.R.I. executives later disputed that view.)
Mr. Gardner also wrote the Minneapolis pension fund board, objecting strenuously to Mr. Chenoweth's behavior. He flew to Minneapolis, arranged a meeting with Mayor Donald Fraser and complained widely about Mr. Chenoweth's alliance with Mr. Zimmerman.
Mr. Gardner said recently that his complaint to the fund dealt only with Mr. Zimmerman's "conflict of interest." In fact, his letter did not mention that point. "I don't care what the letter says," Mr. Gardner said, after briefly scanning a copy. "That's what the issue was."
The pension board backed Mr. Chenoweth, telling Mr. Gardner that its policies were none of his business. With the fund's backing, Mr. Zimmerman was re-elected to the board on May 11, 1989; embattled, he served until February 1990, when he finally resigned and settled the lawsuit, with G.R.I. paying $44,200 toward his expenses and legal fees.
Mr. Gardner said he sees his role at G.R.I. as being beneficial to shareholders. But under his leadership, G.R.I.'s shares have sunk to about $3 apiece.

 CORRECTION:
A chart last Sunday describing the relationship between the Kelso Management Company and the FMR Corporation, parent of the Fidelity group of mutual funds, omitted crosshatching in some copies, thus failing to indicate Fidelity funds managed by Kelso. The 10 funds currently or recently run by Kelso are those with the "PM" identification.

Winning Seats on Boards
 
Aritech, Framingham, Mass.: On Feb. 12, 1990, Kelso-run Fidelity funds disclosed that they had bought 9.8 percent of this electronics security equipment company for investment purposes. On April 19, Kelso reported that Aritech had complied with its request and added a Kelson executive to its board.
 
Ports of Call Inc., Denver: Representing Fidelity investors, Dorsey Gardner took control of this struggling travel club in June 1989 and liquidated its assets. Mr Gardner continues as president of the company, renamed P.O.C.I. Inc.
 
Primark Corp., McLean, Va.: Mr. Gardner joined the board in August 1989. In April 1990, he stepped down as manager of the Fidelity World Fund. The same month, Primark purschased 996,500 of its own shares from the fund, thereby allowing the fund to sell ist stake without driving down the market price.
 
Quaker Fabric Corp., Fall Rover, Mass.: In April 1989, Mr. Gardner joined the board . Three months later, he helped negotiate the sale of the company.
 
Victoria Station, San Franciso: Mr. Gardner became chairman in 1982, representing Fidelity investors. A diversification plan faltered, and Fidelity sold out in late 1984. The company went bankrupt in May 1986.
 
And Challenging Management
 
Binks Manufacturing, Franklin Park, Ill.: After visiting the company last June, Mr. Gardner announced that the president had told him of a "friendly offer" for Binks. Mr Gardner demanded that the board "form a committee of independent directors to explore the offer which has been made." The president responded that there was no such offer and "there must be some misunderstanding." So far, no offer has surfaced.
 
Crowley, Milner & Co., Detroit: Mr. Gardner bought a 29.4 percent stake from an heir of the founding family in 1988, and has notified the board that Kelso would like to see steps taken to enhance shareholder value. A family adviser said recently that an investment banker has been hired to advise the board.
 
D.O.C. Optics, Southfield, Mich.: Mr. Gardner's funds backed a buyout and then a merger, but both plans faltered. The company bought out Kelso's stake at the market price in a private transaction in October.

HEADLINE: Where Some See Recession, Others See Opportunity

BYLINE: By ANDI RIERDEN

 BODY:
IN August, despite glum economic forecasts for Connecticut, Vivian Blaha decided to start a business. Without any advance advertising, she rented space in a shopping center in Guilford and hung up her handmade shingle: "Thimble Weeds: Tailoring and Alterations for Men and Women." Before long, she said, her rack was filled with garments awaiting new zippers, linings and hems. Lately, she has asked a local seamstress to take care of her overflow work.
"I always do well in recessions," said Ms. Blaha, who has been a tailor for 29 years. "It's the best time to be in business." This is especially so now, she said, because "retail stores that had alteration departments simply cannot afford to run them anymore." 
 Even as the level of economic uncertainty increases around the state, many entrepreneurs say they are prospering. And some attribute their gains to the recession itself. Economic analysts say that among the businesses that are least affected by the current downturn are exporters and others that do not have to rely on the region for their profits.
Overseas demand for American products prompted Roman Roftafis to leave his marketing job to open American Sports Products in Bethel. The wholesale distributor exports sports equipment, from rowing machines and treadmills to golf clubs and soccer balls. Most of the customers for his six-year-old company are based in South America, where demand is highest, he said, but he also distributes to Europe and Japan.
 
Seeking to Build Up
 The decline in the housing market has also boosted business for home repair and remodeling concerns, like the Home Depot chain, which has opened three stores in Connecticut since 1989 and said it plans to open others. "The recession doesn't both us one bit," said Jackie Bryans, an assistant manager in North Haven.
Homeowners are also looking for advice on how to repair, remodel or redesign their homes, said James Lomuscio, assistant editor of Practical Homeowner, a home-improvement magazine published in Fairfield.
"Instead of trading up, people are now wanting to know how to build up," he said, "in hopes that when the market rebounds, their homes will be worth more." Advertising revenues for the magazine increased 55 percent in 1990 from the previous year, he said.
The flurry of foreclosures in the last two years has also generated business for the ailing real estate industry, as banks turn to management companies to oversee commercial and residential properties. "Despite all the negative news, management seems to be the healthiest area within the real estate sector," said Joseph M. Ergolano, vice president of economic development for the Southwestern Area Commerce and Industry Association in Stamford.
But the companies that are gaining the most during the current hard times are those that export, said Matthew J. Broder, director of the international division of the State Department of Economic Development. "These are companies that are able to mitigate the U.S. recession by reaching to the overseas market, where the dollar is weak," he said. "They are definitely our economic advantage for 90's."
According to the department's latest figures, exports contributed $3.8 billion to the Connecticut economy in 1989, a 17 percent increase from the previous year.
Some of the major exporters in Connecticut, Mr. Broder said, include companies that manufacture transportation equipment, like Pratt & Whitney Aircraft in North Haven and Bauer Aerospace in Farmington, along with those that specialize in scientific testing devices, like Gerber Scientific in South Windsor. Several other Connecticut companies have recently started exporting. World-Wide Games in Colchester, for example, began selling to distributors in Japan and Europe almost a year ago, said the company's president, Stephen Lloyd. "Sales have been way ahead of our projections," he said.
The 35-year-old mail-order company initially sold its hardwood games to Boy Scouts and churches. In 1985, it expanded into the adult market and currently mails 3.5 million catalogues annually to consumers in the United States. As a result, sales have tripled, said Mr. Lloyd, who said he expects great results from the overseas market.
"The lower dollar is the big factor," he said. "But foreign consumers are more than eager to get a hold of quality American products."
Mr. Roftafis of American Sports Products in Bethel said he could not survive if he relied on markets in the United States. Without his foreign customers, "I'd be hurting big time," he said.
Several chambers of commerce around the state are helping their members search for overseas possibilities. The Southwestern Area Commerce and Industry Association recently sponsored a conference on exporting attended by business leaders from The Netherlands who discussed potential markets for Connecticut businesses and how to set up a sales office in Europe. "A lot of businesses have been asking for advice about how to export," said Mr. Ergolano of the business group in Stamford. "Certainly, any manufacturer in Fairfield County is a viable candidate."
Some buisnesses have found foreign customers right in Connecticut. The state's Department of Tourism reported that desite a slump some hotels have succeeded in attracting tourists from other countries. Last year at the Simsbury Inn, business increased 13 percent from the previous year, thanks in part to an increase in international clients, said J. Robert Gengras, co-owner of the inn. He said he has directed his marketing to corporations in the region that have clients visiting from overseas. The inn has staff members who speak German, Japanese, French and Russian, he said, and its dining service caters to Continental tastes.
"In tough times," he said, "you've got to be as flexible and accommodating as possible."
Even without relying on foreign customers, some people have succeeded in starting new businesses in this uncertain economy.
 
A Hunch Paid Off
 Denise Mendelsohn said she had reservations about moving to Milford in 1989 and starting an advertising agency. "Here I was, opening up this shop in this new place where I didn't know anyone, and business was clamping up everywhere," she said. "But I simply wanted to take the risk."
Ms. Mendelsohn said she believed that her industry would survive the recession because of an increasing demand for creative marketing, and her hunch has paid off. After winning several assignments from companies in Manhattan and other parts of the country, her company, Metropolis Design and Advertising, increased its sales last year by 150 percent from the year before, she said, adding, "We ended the year feeling rather excluded from all the recession news."
Others planning to start businesses in Connecticut should be aware of the state's changing demographics, said Peter M. Gioia of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association. He and other analysts said they anticipate a rising need for services that cater to the growing population of elderly consumers with disposable incomes and to the increasing numbers of working women with children. Time-saving businesses, from packaged-food companies to cleaning services, will be in demand, Mr. Gioia said.
The path to success has lots of pitfalls, he said, adding, "There's also opportunity, if you're on target."

HEADLINE: THEATER;
An Unexpectedly Moving 'Menagerie'

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN

DATELINE: PRINCETON

 BODY:
EVERYONE expects to be moved by "The Glass Menagerie," but not so unexpectedly as in Emily Mann's exceptional production at the McCarter Theater here.
Unlike the transparent, closed-in representation of an apartment and the tenenment exterior that one customarily associates with Tennessee Williams's first masterwork, the vision of Ms. Mann's production is of vastness. The lamplike fixtures hanging on high appear intermixed with the staged lights and the long narrow corridors that flank Ming Cho Lee's set design extend into the beyond. Even the furniture and objects inside have a spatial relationship. These are simply not the expected living and dining rooms of the Wingfields. At first sight, things seem all wrong. Before long, it all feels right. 
 In her staging, an auspicious debut as the McCarter's artistic director, Ms. Mann may have taken her cue from the narrator's, Tom's, opening lines: "I have tricks in my pocket. I have things up my sleeve." Ms. Mann appears to view the play not in illusory, but in sensible, almost contemporary terms. But fear not. There is no tampering with time here. Since the period specified by Williams is of "a dissolving economy," updating would be redundant. Ms. Mann's trick is that she has grasped the play in new -- yes, unexpected -- and never less than loving ways.
Nowhere is the unexpected more evident than in Shirley Knight's fulfilling performance as Amanda. This is a no-nonsense woman of earthly demeanor and concerns, not one filtered through an ethereal film or adrift in a field of jonquils.
She has a frantic mother's clear priority: to make "plans and provisions" for a daughter who won't ever be able to make them on her own.
Ms. Knight's Amanda is a failed planner, not a dotty dreamer. When she retreats into her memories -- it's her memory play too, not just Tom's -- babbles incessantly or even gets into an outlandish ball gown to greet the Gentleman Caller, the ever-practical Ms. Knight seems to be telling us that, well, people do that.
Amanda's regretful admission -- "I wasn't prepared for what the future brought me" -- permeates Ms. Knight's portrayal. It explains her panic and the tacklessness, bordering on cruelty, that Southern charm cannot conceal.
Through all her maneuvering, the inimitable catch in the actress's voice unfailingly finds -- in a phrase, in unexpected moments -- the lyric wonder of Williams's sensibility. When she recalls her long-departed husband, "the telephone man who fell in love with long distance," one witnesses the momentary transformation that defines poetic acting.
To top it off, Ms. Knight's characterization is shot through with an extraordinary comic sense, most deliriously by the scene on the fire escape landing when Tom tells her the Gentleman Caller is coming.
As soon as that "emissary from the world of reality" arrives, Jeff Weatherford's smooth, easygoing playing and Judy Kuhn's rapturous response as Laura turn familiar moments into newly discovered ones. Ms. Kuhn's final withdrawal, bathed in the glow of Robert Wierzel's lighting, is as ominous as it is unutterably sad.
One could quibble with the program's self-conscious identification of characters: the Mother, instead of Amanda Wingfield; Her son, Her daughter. Their names are embedded in theater legend; why universalize them so obviously?
And Dylan McDermott is an overly gruff, wild, impetuous and showy Tom (the son). When he knocks over one of Laura's ornaments, one could almost say he did it accidentally on purpose.
But in the end, the soul of the play cannot elude even this Tom, as he unexpectedly wipes away a tear in his last monologue. It's likely that you'll be doing the same thing.
"The Glass Menagerie," by Tennessee Williams, at the McCarter Theater, 91 University Place. Performances through next Sunday. Box-office telephone: (609) 683-8000.

HEADLINE: A Singer Sways To Beat From Rio

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN

 BODY:
ONE singer flew in from Paris, one from Bahia and two from Rio de Janeiro. But all Kenia had to do to show up for her star turn in a festival of Brazilian music in Manhattan was take the Long Island Expressway.
It was not until she moved to St. James that, Kenia said, "I began to go back, deeper and deeper, into my Brazilian roots." 
 On Jan. 6, the 33-year-old performer, who was born and raised in Rio, was the opening attraction of the first Brazilian season at the Ballroom at 253 West 28th Street. The festival runs through Feb. 16.
 
29 Artists in All
 In separate appearances, seven women, two of whom live in New York, and their backup musicians -- a total of 29 artists -- display the diversity of the genre, encompassing the samba, bossa nova and a percussive African-influenced sound.
With her soft pop-jazz style, Kenia performs today and next Sunday at 3 and 7 P.M.
Kenia avoids her possible surnames, Acioly, by birth; Gould, by her first marriage, and Ashby.
Her husband, Jay Ashby, is her musical director. At the end of her act, when Kenia introduces the five musicians, whose exotic instruments include the hadgini, a clay pot; caxixi, a shaker full of beans, and a ganza, a sort of tambourine, in addition to drums, guitars and a piano, the singer, who is seven months pregnant, tells the audience that Mr. Ashby is "on percussion, on trombone and on baby."
For a year and a half, the couple and Kenia's 6-year-old son, Thomas, have been renting a house in St. James.
 
An Exchange Student in 1975
 "After a vagrant musician's life," Mr. Ashby said, "this is my sense of stability. I come home and feel it's a place I know, and the car is in the garage. I don't have to get up and switch it from one side of the street to the other."
Kenia first went to the Island as an exchange student in 1975, when she attended Woodmere Academy and lived in the home of Burt and Carol Levy in Lawrence. Kenia calls them "my American parents." Mr. and Mrs. Levy now live in Head of the Harbor, north of St. James.
Kenia's parents, 4 sisters and 10 nephews and nieces live in Rio, where Kenia returned after completing her studies. By 1980, she had left again, this time to live in New York for seven years and in Los Angeles for three. She met Mr. Ashby there.
"It was pretty rough -- a crisis economically and the politics were heavy -- a third world reality," Kenia said about Brazil. "Once you are back, you had to sign a document that you wouldn't return to the United States for two years.
"I was a bilingual secretary there and I got away with a lot of stuff at 20. I was exposed to what democracy really is, and it was hard for me to keep my mouth shut. Luckily, I split before I got into a lot of trouble."
 
New Album Due in Spring
 In her act and on her three record albums -- another is due out in the spring -- Kenia sings in Portuguese and in English. "And I throw in a little romantic Spanish," she added.
At the Ballroom, the material ranges from "Aqui Oh!" and "Ahora" to "Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight" and "Over the Rainbow."
Of the Harold Arlen classic, Kenia said:
"Thomas had a music box that played it, and so I sang it to him in a playful way, with a samba beat, and Jay said, 'It really works.' "
"The songs are about love and freedom, and the freedom to love."
Kenia said of her mellow, sultry delivery punctuated by scatting:
"The more I do it, it's somehow becoming more and more Brazilian. And I end up as a jazz singer. At least that's what they're calling me.
"I don't like tags, and I was never really trained or prepared to be a jazz singer. So it seems audacious, but it's a natural thing for me. I don't think I can do it, but I end up doing it."
"Brazilian music is still a little elitist in a way," the singer said, "but it's catching on. The bossa nova was a craze in the 60's, and in the 70's it was Sergio Mendes. Now the moment seems right for the whole richness of Brazilian music, which is popular all over Europe.
"The American market has been closed to Brazilian music and there's never been a festival like this before. We're just this close to a breakthrough."

HEADLINE: NATIONAL NOTEBOOK: Laurens, S.C.;
Two Boons For Economy

BYLINE: By LYN RIDDLE

 BODY:
TWO large distribution centers -- one under construction and another built two years ago -- have given the economy of this northwestern South Carolina city a jumpstart.
With about 10,000 residents, Laurens and surrounding Laurens County, with 45,000 people, have relied on textile manufacturing since the first mill was built here in the late 1800's. But in recent years, county leaders have sought to diversify because of layoffs and plant closings throughout the South. 
 The success of the new centersdepends primarily on Interstates 26 and 385, which connect Laurens County with Atlanta, 165 miles south of here, and Charlotte, N.C., 98 miles to the north. Another key factor is that undeveloped land suitable for industry is inexpensive -- about $5,000 an acre.
Four textile mills still employ about 1,800 people, and now 1,630 work at the 1.6 million-square-foot distribution center for the Wal-Mart discount chain, built on 140 acres here two years ago, and its new store.
Michelin Corporation recently started a 700,000-square-foot distribution center two miles to the north on I-385. It is to be completed in 1992.
Michelin, with its headquarters in Greenville, about 30 miles away, chose Laurens County because it is convenient to the company's four South Carolina plants, company officials said. The tire manufacturer also operates a proving ground on 2,500 acres in Laurens County.
The Wal-Mart distribution center, a round-the-clock operation, fills 240 trucks a day, shipping to stores in a dozen states.
Despite the heavy traffic in this pastoral setting of rolling hills and lush farmland, many residents say the facility improved their lives.
"Wal-Mart changed the spirit in the community," said Mr. Morton, who now works as a fund-raiser for Presbyterian College in Clinton, S.C., also in Laurens County. "People saw themselves in a more positive light."
He said Wal-Mart, in addition to the large payroll and the $584,473 a year in taxes it pays, also encouraged the opening of other businesses, including three motels, several fast-food restaurants and some stores.
The facility did not bring about a housing boom, Mr. Morton said, because most of the people hired already lived within a 30-mile radius.
"Our unemployment rate was something like 3.9 percent when Wal-Mart opened, a 15-year-low," said Mr. Morton.

Anchor for the Arts Rising in Stamford

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
WHEN the Stamford Center for the Arts opens its new 46,000-square-foot multimedia complex next September, organizers and supporters say, Atlantic Street will take its place as the entertainment center of southwestern Connecticut.
"There is a sense of community building here," said Randall Brion, the center's executive director. "Stamford has become the leisure focus for the entire region." 
 The Palace Theater on Atlantic Street, acquired last year by the center to complement its new theatrical complex, is already fully booked by music and theater groups. Already open on Atlantic Street are a branch of the Whitney Museum and the American Ballet Academy, as well as a dozen new restaurants and nightclubs.
Nearby are several art galleries and Mr. Brion said that the city is considering converting the 30,000-square-foot old City Hall, now partially occupied by municipal offices, into a museum with exhibition space.
Charles T. Lee, chairman of the city's Urban Redevelopment Commission, said his agency has proposed developing the four-acre Columbus Park off Atlantic into an entertainment complex with four movie theaters and new restaurants and nightclubs.
"We have the opportunity to make Stamford's downtown into an exciting entertainment and cultural district," Mr. Lee said.
Some residents have questioned at meetings on various arts proposals whether Stamford could support this type of district, with New York's theaters and galleries so close. But Mr. Brion said that since 1986, when demolition of the old Stamford Theater began to make way for the new theatrical complex and the Center for the Arts began producing shows in the Palace under a lease arrangement, ticket sales have grown from $500,000 to $1.8 million a year.
"New York is New York, and nothing is ever going to change that, Mr. Brion said, "but a city has grown up in Stamford and it has come into its own culturally."
The new center has been supported heavily by Stamford's corporate community, and Christopher P. Bruhl, president of the Southwestern Area Commerce and Industry Association, said businesses hope the arts will vitalize the downtown.
"It's the equivalent of a department store's anchoring a mall -- a center for the arts anchors the pedestrian life of a city," Mr. Bruhl said.
Mr. Bruhl also said that the white-collar businesses of Stamford and the area rely on cultural attractions when recruiting new executives. "People in this area don't stop feeling creative after 5 P.M.," he said.
When the new Center for the Arts structure was first proposed in 1982, it was expected to cost $6 million. The project has expanded considerably in scope, size and cost since then, to $16 million, and it is still growing.
The project has received $3.9 million in grants from the state, and about $750,000 from the city out of a tourism fund financed by a hotel room tax. The rest has come from private and corporate contributions.
The restored Palace, a 1,580-seat, 1926 vaudeville theater, is home to dance, music and theater productions by the Center for the Arts, the Stamford Symphony Orchestra, the Stamford Chamber Orchestra, the Stamford City Ballet, Connecticut Ballet Theater, New England Lyric Operetta and the Connecticut Grand Opera.
Anita M. Leury, director of development for Connecticut Grand Opera, said the arrangement with the Center for the Arts has enabled all the organizations to present reasonably priced, high-quality productions.
"Our goal is to take away the opera's elitist reputation," Mrs. Leury said. In March, the Grand Opera will put on the United States premiers of two French operas at the Palace, Bizet's "Djamileh" and Massenet's "La Navarraise." She said the French Consul General in New York City will attend the opening nights.
THE new theatrical complex, Mr. Brion said, is designed to complement the Palace, not replace it. It will have a 700-seat theater for drama and dance productions, and a 150-seat studio theater for community presentations and educational events.
The smaller theater will also be used to tape productions for Connecticut Public Television, WEDW, which is moving its Channel 49 offices into the new building.
Donald C. Lamy, chief engineer for WEDW, said he does not know of another public television system that is based in a center for the arts.
"It is unusual, but it's a great match," Mr. Lamy said. The new location will allow WEDW to broadcast many of the cultural events live, which officials hope will lead viewers in the area to think of Channel 49, rather than its New York counterpart, as their station, a perennial problem in southwestern Connecticut.
Mr. Lee said the redevelopment commission worked closely with the center and its architect and engineers to design something that would fit into the neighborhood. "The problem was how to make a two-story building, and an unusually shaped building, look monumental and important when you're surrounded by office towers," he said.
The front of the building, facing Atlantic Street and Tresser Boulevard, will rise two stories from the street, with a glass and masonry exterior and a wraparound marquee facing the intersection. The masonry back of the building, housing the theater and mechanicals, will rise to about 75 feet.
The lobby, where art exhibits will be mounted, will have a large glass wall. "It's like the lobby becomes a stage as well, facing out into the city," Mr. Lee said.
Mr. Brion said the new theater will also incorporate as its main entryway an arch from the old Stamford Theater, containing a likeness said to be a cross between the first manager of the theater and a famous early 20th-century dancer who had performed there. The arch was designed by Gutzon Borglum, the Stamford sculptor best known for the Mount Rushmore reliefs.
Mr. Brion said the center plans to announce later this winter what the first production in the new building will be.
"We have already seen tremendous growth, just on the promise of its opening," he said. "There are more restaurants and clubs opening, and there's a sense that there's more to the city than office buildings."

HEADLINE: Towns' New ZIP Codes Bring Pride (Mail, Too)

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
FOR Jerry B. Lucas, Killingworth's First Selectman, the best part about his town's getting its own ZIP code is that his subscriptions will now be addressed properly.
"I don't like to see my Time magazine coming in addressed to Deep River," Mr. Lucas said. "I don't live in Deep River, I live in Killingworth, and it's about time the post office recognized that." 
 Salem, which shares a ZIP code with neighboring Colchester, is also getting a new ZIP code soon, and the First Selectman, Hugh C. Teel, said the issue involves more than just a name on a mailing label.
The state Motor Vehicles Department, for instance, sorts tax bills on car purchases by ZIP code, so Salem's tax bills could be incorrectly routed, Mr. Teel said. And when the town seeks financing for a project, the interest rate is often based on factors like community unemployment, whichthe Labor Department ties to ZIP codes, he added.
 "It leaves the town without any identity as far as state and Federal records are concerned," Mr. Teel said.
 
Five New Codes
 Killingworth, currently ZIP code 06417 and soon to be 06419, and Salem, 06415, soon to be 06420, are among five Connecticut towns that will get new ZIP codes on July 1, under a decision announced last month by the Postal Service.
The others are Bethany (06525, switching to 06524), Oxford (06483, soon to be 06478), and Preston (06360, soon to be 06365), said Philip A. Piccolo, a Postal Service spokesman.
But not every town is excited about the prospect.
"It's such a non-issue. I wasn't even aware of it," said John Ford, First Selectman in Bethany. He added with a laugh, "I guess we're really going on the map now."
 Mr. Piccolo said the service often gets petitions from towns that want their own ZIP code. "It's considered a form of community recognition," he said. When assigning ZIP codes, the Postal Service weighs factors like population and volume because mail sorting machines can only be programmed to handle a limited number of codes.
But some town officials say they cannot understand how the decisions were made.
Mr. Lucas pointed out thatalthough Killingworth is larger, much of its mail carries a Deep River address because it uses the code assigned to Deep River. This is often the case with magazines and catalogues that use computerized mailing systems based on ZIP codes.
 
Cause of Delays
 That did not make much difference when both towns were small and postal clerks knew the addresses, Mr. Lucas said.
"But both towns have grown, and there are streets now that have similar names," Mr. Lucas said. "So it has meant delays in some mail deliveries."
Mr. Lucas, who took office last November, said his predecessors tried for more than a decade to get a ZIP code, mainly by writing to members of Congress.
But he said he appealed directly to the Postal Service.
 "I finally found somebody in a little back room who told me we were going to be getting our own ZIP code in July," Mr. Lucas said. "The 30 people we talked with before him all told us, 'We can't do it, the machines won't handle it.' "
 Mr. Teel related a similar experience. He said Salem was promised its own ZIP code more than two years ago, after it had gotten rid of its rural delivery routes and numbered all its streets.
"After we went to all that trouble," Mr. Teel said, "they told us they were putting in new optical scanning equipment and it would be a while before we could get our own ZIP code."
"Working through the bureaucracy of the Postal Service has been a real lesson in frustration," Mr. Lucas added.
But he said it had been worth it to get Killingworth's own ZIP code. He said he had ordered new town stationery and notified vendors of the change, even though it will not take effect for six months.
"I find it a matter of personal pride in one's community," Mr. Lucas said. "If you live in Killingworth, that's what it should say on your mail."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Many Print Ads Revive 'A Bare and Open Look'

BYLINE: By RANDALL ROTHENBERG

 BODY:
Wide open spaces are returning to American print advertising and publication design.
In newspaper and magazine advertisements for Toyota cars, Royal Viking cruise ships and Aspen, Colo., the gaps between letters, words and lines are growing wider. The mixing of disparate typefaces, which reached a peak in Entertainment Weekly and Spy magazines, is declining. Borders are reappearing around photographs and text that once bled to the edge of advertisements. And the "clutter" and "typographic frenzy" that Print magazine criticized in regional ads and magazines last year are settling down into a plain, no-frills look. 
 "There's been a kind of sea change over the last year," said Martin Fox, the vice president and editor of Print. "There has been a real return to simplicity, to a bare and open look in design. It's a reaction against the dense-looking page, against the mixing of styles, against the sense that design is its own artifact and that direct communication is not the most desired of goals."
 
The 'British Look'
 Some ad agency art directors and graphic designers are referring to the style as the "British look," because the ample spacing, ornate borders and traditional typefaces like Garamond and Goudy are borrowed from English book publishing.
Others, like David Metcalf and Dennis D'Amico, the co-creative directors of the Lowe & Partners agency, argue that the British were only appropriating the direct, open and occasionally witty style made famous by Ogilvy & Mather and Doyle Dane Bernbach in the 1960's.
Wherever the responsibility lies, the "British look" is one of several examples of a new simplicity in visual communications.
"Environmental issues, economic austerity and a state of war exist, so the post-modern design of the 80's no longer makes sense," said Philip B. Meggs, a design professor at Virginia Commonwealth University.
Until the 1960's, type was set on metal blocks that had fixed spaces between them. With the introduction of phototypesetting, art directors could cut type apart and set letters and words much closer together.
During the 1970's, ligatures -- letter combinations that touched -- became more prevalent. Condensed type grew increasingly popular. "Huge, tight, shouting headlines became de rigueur," Mr. D'Amico said.
The look grew even denser in the mid-1980's, when the so-called new wave graphic style, with its uncentered page, mixed typefaces and bright, primary colors attracted many designers. And computers allowed art directors to break apart and distort letters and words in previously impossible ways.
Today, however, "we're coming back to headlines you can actually read on the page," said Bob Cox, the creative director of Cox Landey & Partners, a New York ad agency.
 
'Fairly Ordinary-Looking Stuff'
 Not all graphic designers are entirely taken with the new look in print. Tibor Kalman, who has led the movement to reintroduce classic elements to print design, nevertheless said the new simplicity was "just another attempt to take fairly ordinary-looking stuff and give it class."
And Milton Glaser, the designer responsible for New York magazine and the interior of the A.&P. supermarkets, cautioned that the "British look" was but one of many design options for trend-seekers.
Russian constructivism and social-realist styling have also made a comeback that is most evident in ads for Lowenbrau beer and DHL Worldwide Express, which appropriate the look of New Deal-era posters.
But if anything is crowding American print advertising, it is nothing. Even the forthcoming International Design Conference in Aspen, of which Mr. Glaser is chairman, has taken it as its theme this year. The conference's title is "Bare Bones: Making More With Less."

GRAPHIC: Photos: Advertising agencies are returning to a no-frills design, sometimes called the "British Look." Among the notable new ads are ones for Royal Viking Cruise Lines, above, by Goodby, Berlin & Silverstein; for tourism in Aspen, Colo., top right, by Hal Riney & Partners, and for Toyota, right, by Omon agency (Goodby, Berlin & Silverstein; Hal Riney & Partners; Omon)

HEADLINE: U.S. Policy Increases Abortions in Romania

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The lack of adequate contraceptive resources and services in Romania has forced women to rely on abortion as a primary method of birth control ("Romania Seeks to Reduce Abortions," news article, Jan. 17). Ironically, this tragedy can be partly attributed to United States policies to eradicate abortion. 
 Restrictive United States policies prohibit nongovernmental organizations from receiving assistance if they choose to counsel women about abortion. As a result, two respected and effective international organizations -- the International Planned Parenthood Federation and the United Nations Fund for Population Activities -- are barred from United States assistance. Though both have programs operating in Romania, Congress cannot name either as a recipient of funds to aid the situation in Romania.
Last June, the House of Representatives approved $1.5 million for family-planning programs in Romania. The funds were channeled through the Agency for International Development, which is bound by the restrictive policies. In a June 27 letter to several members of Congress, Ron Roskens, A.I.D. administrator, said A.I.D. could have family-planning programs in place in Romania "immediately." He named four organizations that could begin the programs.
These promises were made more than six months ago, but A.I.D. has not designated an organization to receive the $1.5 million, and no United States-funded programs have been implemented in Romania. Meanwhile, Romania's abortion rate has skyrocketed to 100,000 a month.
Because of our policies, the most capable family-planning organizations in Romania cannot receive United States funds. Instead, we waste our funds trying to replicate these organizations, and Romanian women pay the cost of our inefficiency. Representative Olympia Snowe and I will shortly reintroduce legislation that is aimed at halting these destructive and counterproductive United States policies.

HEADLINE: Herman H. Kahn, 81, An Expert on Securities

 BODY:
Herman H. Kahn, a longtime partner in the Lehman Brothers investment banking firm, died on Friday at the Mary Manning Walsh Nursing Home in Manhattan. He was 81 years old and had homes in Palm Beach, Fla., and Manhattan.
He died of a stroke, his assistant, Ann Finkelson, said.
Mr. Kahn was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, graduated third in his class at the High School of Commerce and was a $15-a-week runner for Lehman while earning a bachelor's degree at night in economics and finance at New York University.
He soon specialized in statistics and security analysis and became a leading expert in private-placement financing -- the sale of securities to selected investors without their having to scramble for it in the open market. He became a partner at Lehman Brothers in 1950, and retired in 1986.
Mr. Kahn's clients included more than a score of the nation's major corporations, and he had been a director of the Allied Stores Corporation, Avco Corporation, Dayco Corporation, Fruehauf Corporation, Microwave Associates and the Seaboard Finance Company. He was a founder and president of the Herman and Ruth Kahn Foundation, which contributes to charitable, educational and cultural organizations.
Surviving are his wife, the former Ruth Schulman; a son, Sidney, of Locust Valley, L.I.; a daughter, Geraldine Karetsky of Aspen, Colo.; a sister, Sylvia Silber of Manhattan, and seven grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Japan Poised for Postwar Boom

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 27

 BODY:
With many countries struggling against slowdowns or recessions, economists are hanging on every development in the Persian Gulf for signs of how much economic damage the war is likely to cause. But few economies appear poised to benefit as much as Japan's in the event of a brief war, or have the staying power to endure a long war with as little strain, a range of experts say.
Japan has been criticized for contributing money but not personnel to help in the allied effort to force Iraq out of Kuwait, even though it is more dependent on Middle East oil than any other industrial country. Now some economists say that in the war's aftermath, Japan may enjoy the greatest economic boost, particularly if the risk of soaring oil prices is reduced.
 
A Difficult Transition
 This is not to say that Japan's economic forecast is entirely rosy. Even before the crisis began, Japan was in the midst of a difficult economic transition. Growth is slowing from its blistering pace of the last several years, a problem in a country that considers expansion of less than 3 percent a recession. The stock market plunged 40 percent last year as interest rates soared, corporate profits are falling, and many are predicting property prices will decline after big increases in the 1980's. The recession in the United States is also threatening to cut into Japanese exports. 
 Most menacing, economists say, are the glaring weaknesses in Japan's financial sector: many fear that a sharp slide in Japan's real estate prices is posing a threat to banks, which have made hundreds of billions of dollars of loans with land as collateral.
The mounting difficulties Japan faces sound similar, in fact, to those in the United States. But there is one huge difference: while America's policy makers are rapidly cutting interest rates and fighting to save banks, protect jobs and stave off an economic contraction, the Japanese Government has deliberately slowed the boom here by tightening its monetary policy and keeping interest rates high.
"The biggest possible cause of a recession in Japan is too tight a monetary policy by the Bank of Japan," said Takao Akabane, formerly the vice minister at the Economic Planning Agency.
Overly easy monetary policies during the latter half of the 1980's, then a severe tightening in the last year, are responsible for the current precarious balance in the markets, economists say.
It is a risky policy, to be sure, because the markets have already shown a tendency to spiral out of control when investors panic in the face of big price declines. But many analysts are confident that Japanese economic managers are skillful enough to succeed, barring a huge external shock.
"Our real fear is outside disturbances like the Persian Gulf, not internal forces," said Yoshihisa Kitai, chief economist at the Long Term Credit Bank. "As for the internal factors, the Bank of Japan has chosen this tight monetary policy so it can avert a collapse if it wants to" by trimming interest rates should the economy slow too much, he said.
Moreover, because of its long-standing budgetary conservatism, Tokyo has the leeway to increase growth with higher Government spending, if that becomes necessary. Japan has already agreed with the United States to increase public investment and could accelerate this program.
 
Revamping the Banking System
 Underlying the tight money is a broader policy goal that could affect Japan's financial system for years: the restructuring of the banking sector. The Finance Ministry wants to encourage smaller banks to merge with stronger institutions, forcing the long-protected institutions to be more competitive.
It was reported Friday in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading economic daily, that the Finance Ministry had even created a special group within the deposit insurance system to handle mergers between small- and medium-sized banks. Ministry officials denied that such a mergers unit had been created, but the report was consistent with comments made publicly and privately by officials for months.
Many worry that this approach may succeed in improving the profitability and innovativeness of a few Japanese banks, while weakening many others and perhaps causing a rash of bank failures because of tight money and a crash in the property market. Any failures or crashes -- which have never occurred in Japan -- could strain the Government's ability to engineer a controlled strengthening of the industry.
 
Unprepared for a Shock
 Susumu Saito, director of the Trilateral Institute, a research and advisory body, warned that few banks were really prepared for another shock to either the stock market, on which they are dependent for capital, or the property market, on which so many of their loans are based. "Many of the banks are assuming that the worst is past," he said.
But Mr. Akabane, the former Government economic planner, said: "A severe economic situation would be an inviting time to restructure. The bureaucrats don't say this explicitly, but I think this is in their minds."
The overall goal is to produce a financial sector that would match in strength the vibrant health of the industrial economy, which was strengthened considerably by Government policies of the last five years. Big corporations used the booming markets of the late 1980's to remove debt from their balance sheets and go on an unprecedented capital spending binge, sharply improving their efficiency.
"There is going to be a shakeout among the regional banks and tremendous pressure on the city banks," said Kenneth Courtis, chief economist here for Deutsche Bank. "The Ministry of Finance clearly believes and says it will use this environment to restructure the sector. The trick is to accomplish this without causing a crash."
What Japan calls a slowdown, of course, would be a solid year in the United States. The economy grew 5.4 percent in 1990, with unemployment slightly higher than 2 percent and inflation close to 3 percent.
Officially, the Government is forecasting a 3.8 percent growth rate this year, as high interest rates begin to bite. The official discount rate for Government loans to banks has been jacked up to 6 percent, from 2.5 percent just 18 months ago.
There have been a rash of real estate-induced bankruptices as a result, not to mention the collapse of stock prices last year. In December alone, the number of business failures rose 45 percent.
 
Few See Doom
 Some economists see growth of closer to 3 percent in 1991, but few accept the predictions of doom that have made headlines in recent weeks.
"The world has seriously mistaken what has happened in Japan," said Richard Koo, a senior economist at the Nomura Research Institute. "The Bank of Japan is trying to slow the economy with every tool they have. This is a policy-led slowdown because it's the only way they can clear out all the excesses of the past few years, when monetary policy was too easy."
Added Susumu Kato, chief economist for Goldman, Sachs (Japan): "There are problems, but they're manageable. We don't see those kind of crash scenarios taking place."
Indeed, hardly a day passes when Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the central bank, does not deliver another insistent sermon on the need to keep interest rates high to bring sky-high property prices down and cool the economy. He has said publicly that he would not mind a decline in land prices of 20 percent, a figure that he also said would not cause unmanageable losses for banks.
"The extreme case is several hundred billion yen in losses from real estate loans for each major bank," said Mr. Kitai. "But I still see the chances of this extreme case as relatively low."
 
Lower Debt Ratings
 Even some of the tougher critics of Japanese banks take this view. For instance, Moody's Investors Service, the credit-rating agency, stunned many here by lowering the ratings of Japan's big banks over the past year, warning of real estate-related difficulties.
But Roger Arner, head of the Tokyo office of Moody's, said his concerns were for the profitability of the banks in a tough environment, not their ability to survive, as is the case with many large American banks.
"You have to remember that their ratings are still very high, on balance," Mr. Arner said. "This is not New York."

HEADLINE: Tool Orders For Factories Rise 43.7%

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The machine tool industry reported a surge in capital spending by American manufacturers in December.
New orders for American-made machine tools climbed 43.7 percent in December from November, to the highest point since September 1989, according to a monthly report by the industry's trade association. 
 New orders for machine tools increased to $291.3 million in December, from $202.7 million a month earlier, the Association for Manufacturing Technology said in a monthly report to be released today.
 
'Spending Plans Are Holding'
 "The continued strong order levels are an indication that capital spending plans are holding firm despite current economic weakness," said Albert W. Moore, president of the association, which is based in McLean, Va. "The mentality of United States manufacturers has changed. Investment is no longer the first thing cut from the budget when a downturn approaches."
Machine tools are power-driven devices that cut or shape metal parts used in products ranging from appliances and vehicles to aircraft and construction materials. The strength of tool orders generally reflects the strength of industrial production, and economists consider patterns of machine tool sales to be important indicators of capital spending by manufacturers.
The increase in orders in December was magnified by the poor showing in November, when orders fell 24.1 percent from October's level. Orders in October had increased only slightly from September. Orders are often volatile at the end of the year because auto makers, which are large buyers, generally shut down production then for several weeks.
For all of 1990, machine tool orders were up 5.4 percent, to $2.96 billion, from the 1989 level of $2.8 billion. The growth in new orders last year was largely attributed to foreign customers, who have found American-made machine tools attractively priced because of the declining value of the dollar. Orders from foreign customers increased 16.8 percent last year from their 1989 level. Orders from domestic customers were up 3.7 percent for the year.
But orders from domestic customers showed particular strength in December, rising 57.3 percent from November's level. Compared with December 1989, all machine tool orders were up 41.2 percent, the report said.
Compared with November's level, shipments of machine tools rose 31.2 percent in December, to $350.9 million. Shipments were up 45.8 percent to foreign customers, and 28.4 percent to domestic customers, from November's levels.
Analysts and executives of machine tool companies said that orders for machine tools from the aerospace industry had remained firm and that orders from auto makers had begun to rebound after languishing for most of the year. Auto makers typically account for more than a third of all orders, and sluggishness in that industry caused machine tool orders to slow for much of 1990.
 
Shifting Money to Production
 "The machine tool industry has been and will be helped by higher orders from the automotive industry for new production equipment," said Eli S. Lustgarten, a machine tool analyst with Paine Webber Inc. He added that because of new clean air legislation "uncertainties have begun to unfold and the auto companies appear to be in the process of shifting expenditures back to their production facilities."

HEADLINE: Many Builders Say Inspectors Expect Bribes

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
The bribing of city inspectors to obtain approval to occupy new or completely renovated apartment buildings is widespread in New York, developers and contractors say.
Sometimes inspectors take money in return for overlooking construction problems in a building, 16 contractors, developers and architects said in separate interviews. 
 More often, they said, builders pay bribes simply to avoid time-consuming delays that can cost tens of thousands of dollars in additional financing, lost revenues and related expenses. The builders said inspectors were commonly paid to push forward the paper work and physical inspections needed to obtain the critical final city approval, a certificate of occupancy. The certificate signifies that construction has been completed and enables an owner to let tenants move in.
 
'The More Weapons They Have'
 "If you are a contractor playing it straight, you can have a hard time getting things done," a housing developer said. "When you help move the process along financially, you don't avoid the legal requirements. But at least you move the process along."
A contractor, who acknowledged that he had paid bribes to avoid inspectors' delays, said: "The layers of rules and regulations just breeds this kind of response. The more things are open to interpretation, the more weapons they have to stymie you."
Those builders, like nearly all of those interviewed, spoke only on the condition of anonymity. They said they feared that if they were identified, inspectors would retaliate by withholding approvals on current and future projects.
Those who conceded that they had paid bribes or paid people to pay bribes were unwilling to say so publicly because those are crimes.
 
Four Months for a Certificate
 City officials said that some inspectors did accept bribes, but that corruption was not nearly as pervasive as most people in the housing industry believed.
An experienced developer in Manhattan, Norman Segal, said it took him four months to obtain a certificate of occupancy after his crews had reconstructed an abandoned six-story apartment building in Harlem last June. It usually takes four to six weeks for the certificate, many developers and contractors said. Mr. Segal said that he would not pay bribes and that he suspected that was why the approval took so long. He added that no inspector directly solicited a bribe, but that he thought inspectors' actions demonstrated that they were punishing him for having failed to offer money.
There were no major problems in his building, at 241 West 113th Street, Mr. Segal contended. The reconstruction was financed largely by the city to create subsidized housing affordable for working people.
Responding to the broader questions raised by Mr. Segal and the other developers, contractors and architects, Buildings Commissioner Rudolph J. Rinaldi said some corruption undoubtedly existed. But he also said it was not as pervasive as many people thought.
"Most of the people are honest," Mr. Rinaldi said of his department's 300 inspectors. Sixty-two examine basic construction. The rest conduct more specialized inspections, like those for plumbing or electricity.
 
'To Encourage You to Offer'
 The final approval for his building was held up, Mr. Segal said, by a series of bureaucratic obstacles, including many missed appointments and paper work that was lost by inspectors, and the continual raising of minor objections after previous objections had been satisfied.
"The problem is that the system is administered by the supervisors to encourage you to offer money," Mr. Segal said. "The regulations are used only to prevent you from doing something, not to expedite it."
Mr. Segal said the delays cost him $40,000 in lost rentals. It undoubtedly would have been cheaper, he said, to have paid a bribe. He said he did not know how much he would have had to pay for his relatively small building, which has 24 apartments.
 
'City Spent a Fortune'
 "But the larger issue," Mr. Segal said, "is it was three or four months that people couldn't live in the building, a building that the city spent a fortune to rebuild."
In essence, he contended, building inspectors temporarily sabotaged a part of the ambitious program created by another municipal agency, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.
The housing department spent $43,000 an apartment for the renovation under a $5.1 billion 12-year housing program. Mr. Segal paid the rest of the cost, which came to $65,000 an apartment altogether, financing most of it. Tenants are drawn from a lottery, and they have to be low- and moderate-income New Yorkers.
Mr. Rinaldi called Mr. Segal's case "a strange one." After his top aides reviewed the department's files on the building, Mr. Rinaldi said he concluded that much of the delay was the developer's fault.
Several safety issues had to be resolved before the building could be occupied, the Commissioner said. On three occasions between last July and October, he said, inspectors issued objections about the fire escapes at the building. The rear escape had been removed, Mr. Rinaldi said, and a new escape was added on the side of the building in October.
 
Question of the Original Plan
 The changes required amendments to the approved architectural plan, Mr. Rinaldi added, making it more difficult for Mr. Segal to obtain the final approval. If the developer had wanted swift approval, he should not have altered his plan, Mr. Rinaldi said.
But Mr. Segal said the Commissioner was mistaken. The original plan, approved by the Buildings Department, called for the removal of the rear escape and the new one on the side, he said. There was no reason for the inspectors to issue objections, because there was no problem with the escape, he said.
"None of their explanations are really plausible," Mr. Segal said.
 
Fewer Than 10 Arrested
 Federal, state and city law-enforcement agencies have been investigating the inspectors for two years trying to find bribe takers, he said, adding that fewer than 10 had been arrested.
"There is something going on, but it is not as prevalent as everyone thinks," Mr. Rinaldi said.
He said he had repeatedly made it clear that he would not tolerate inspectors' accepting bribes. Inspectors are rotated, to make it more diffcult for build up familiarity with contractors. Appointments for inspections, which used to be made by the inspectors, who could reward friends, are now made solely by clerks.
Mr. Rinaldi said he had told the inspectors that undercover employees of the Building Department would offer them bribes. "The word is entrap," he said. "We told them, 'We have people in the department who are going to offer you money.' "
 
Acceptance of $5
 The money was offered a few times and declined, the Commissioner said. But within two weeks of the initial warning, an inspector accepted $5 from an undercover worker and was discharged.
"Has this kind of thing happened in the past?" a deputy commissioner, Stewart D. O'Brien, asked. "Unfortunately yes. Has it continued? Unfortunately yes."
Contractors, developers and architects contended, though, that bribe-taking continued to be common. "Some inspectors are always looking for it, and some aren't," a contractor said. "It's pretty blatant."
Obtaining a certificate of occupancy is critical in development. Contractors can usually collect their remaining fees and free up letters of credit only after obtaining final approvals. Developers can begin charging rent and gain long-term financing only after they are granted.
The certificate's financial significance gives inspectors enormous leverage. Builders also said the complexity of the Building Code gave inspectors wide latitude in granting final approvals.
 
Hand Signals and Code Words
 Many contractors and developers said that a bribe was usually just part of the cost of doing business in New York and that it was less expensive than the cost of a delay in obtaining a final approval. No one was willing to detail the size of a typical bribe.
"It's much cheaper to pay it, and they know it," said a contractor with wide experience in the city.
Inspectors never directly solicit a bribe, contractors and developers said. They use hand signals or code words to indicate their intentions. The contractors, including some who said they had paid bribes, declined to describe the signals and code words.
A person familiar with construction and development said a contractor had recently told him this account: Eager to obtain final approval on a building, the contractor was sent by an inspector to see his supervisor. The contractor met the supervisor in the official's office, where the supervisor shook hands and identified himself as "Mr. Green." The contractor was confused, because that was not the name listed on the office door. Then he realized that the supervisor was not identifying himself but was describing the desired form of payment -- cash.
 
Major Cases Six Year Ago
 Accusations that inspectors use their economic leverage to elicit bribes are not new. In 1984, in separate undercover sting operations, city and Federal officials arrested 10 water and sewer inspectors, 12 electrical inspectors and 2 supervisors in bribery cases.
The officials said then that they were amazed how pervasive the corruption appeared to be. They also said new law-enforcement techniques, including undercover operations, offered hope of altering long-entrenched patterns of corruption.
But contractors and developers asserted that the patterns have continued. Some practices have become more subtle, they said, in part because of fears of being caught.
Payment is never made if more than two people are present, contractors and developers said, and usually the person handing over the money has to be well known to the inspector. Sometimes an intermediary, a consultant called an expediter, passes the money to an inspector, many builders said.
"We hire expediters, which is a legal way of paying someone to pay someone," a developer said. "That's the difference between getting it done and not getting it done."
"All I know is that we when hire expediters who are well known down there," he said, referring to the Buildings Department, "it gets done, usually in extraordinary time. And when we don't, things go much more slowly. Appointments get missed, and new objections are constantly raised."

HEADLINE: Investors Challenging Banks on Bad Loans

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Shareholders and the Securities and Exchange Commission are questioning whether some banks violated securities laws by concealing bad loans for months before they announced large losses.
Bankers and their lawyers respond that the large increase in loan losses reflects the rapid deterioration of the economy and the decline in real estate prices, events that are beyond their control. 
 Lawyers for shareholders who have filed suits against banks say the banks were required to disclose the problems months before they were reported.
Many of the questions have been raised about banks in the Northeast, where loan losses have been greatest. Lawsuits have been filed against such well-known banking companies as Citicorp and the Bank of New England, as well as small New Hampshire banks that are little known outside the state.
At the Securities and Exchange Commission, a special task force in the Division of Enforcement has been concentrating on banks and savings institutions for a year.
The S.E.C. team consists of 16 lawyers and 5 accountants. It has been operating at full strength for about six months and has more than 20 investigations under way, said Joseph Goldstein, an assistant director at the commission. "The most common theme is that income was overstated as a result of an understatement of loan-loss reserves," he said.
A bank's loan-loss reserve is supposed to represent management's estimate of losses expected on bad loans. Banks have been reporting huge losses because the money added to these reserves every quarter is subtracted from profits.
A lawyer whose firm has been representing shareholders in lawsuits against banks suggested that many banks had understated their loan problems to preserve the appearance of profitability in their financial reports.
"The provision of reserves for bad loans is, to a large degree, discretionary, and many banks take advantage of that to mislead the public," said Mark C. Rifkin, a lawyer at Greenfield & Chimicles, a law firm in Haverford, Pa. Mr. Rifkin added that "although shareholders own the company, they are outsiders who don't have access to the records showing how much a bank knew about its problems and when they knew it."
 
Proving Fraud
 One of the great difficulties shareholders face in their lawsuits is obtaining information to show that a bank knowingly concealed bad news. In some cases, judges have said that comparing a heavy loss with optimistic statements made by bank management in previous quarters is not enough to prove fraud. Several of these cases have been dismissed before shareholders had an opportunity to study internal bank documents.
On Friday, a Federal judge in Rhode Island dismissed a lawsuit by a disgruntled investor who claimed that the Eastland Financial Corporation, a banking company in Woonsocket, R.I., had fraudulently exaggerated its financial health in the months before the bank announced a large loss in September 1989.
The court said the shareholder, Marshall Haft, failed to describe specifically how fraud was committed. "A complaint must do more than offer speculation," Judge Raymond J. Pattine said in dismissing the suit. "It must make some step toward showing that fraud was actually committed."
Some judges have been more sympathetic to investors and have denied banks' requests that the lawsuits be dismissed. Motions to dismiss shareholder suits against the Midlantic Corporation in Edison, N.J., and the Northeast Bancorp in New Haven, have recently been denied, clearing the way for shareholders to collect more detailed information, said Mr. Rifkin, whose firm was involved in the suits. Other banking companies facing shareholder lawsuits handled by Greenfield & Chimicles include the Boston-based Bank of New England, which was recently taken over by Federal regulators, and the Dime Savings Bank of New York and Citicorp.
Douglas M. Kraus, a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, a New York law firm representing Eastland Financial, said some lawyers were taking advantage of bank losses by "claiming in effect that the bank's alleged failure to predict the current recession or to avoid its effects amounts to security fraud." In addition to the Eastland case, he said a shareholder suit against MNC Financial, the holding company for Maryland National Bank, was also dismissed recently.
 
'Litigation Factory'
 Lawyers at Skadden, Arps complained that 11 shareholder suits handled by Stull, Stull & Brody, a New York law firm, used almost identical language even though the financial condition and loan portfolios of the banking companies differ widely.
In a suit against the Greater New York Savings Bank brought by a shareholder represented by Stull Stull & Brody, lawyers at Skadden, Arps charged that the similarity of language in all 11 suits presents "a clear picture of a litigation factory."
Officials at Stull, Stull & Brody, declined to discuss the issue.
Other banking companies sued by shareholders represented by Stull, Stull & Brody include the Bank of New England Corporation; the BankWorcester Corporation, Worcester, Mass.; Barnett Banks, Jacksonville, Fla.; Eastchester Financial Corporation, White Plains, and the Southeast Banking Corporation, Miami. Three bank companies in Manchester, N.H., were also sued by shareholders represented by Stull, Stull & Brody: Amoskeag Bank Shares, the BankEast Corporation, and the United Savers Bancorporation, which changed its name to Dartmouth Bancorp last April.

HEADLINE: End of Jobless Benefits Pushes Many Near Despair

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TROY, Ohio, Jan. 25

 BODY:
Swollen and weary in her ninth month of pregnancy, 28-year-old Lisa Bramlette sat chatting at her kitchen table while her 5-year-old son, Tyler, romped around the house in a Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtle outfit.
Mrs. Bramlette's mother, Edith Crowell, was by her side in case labor began because Mrs. Bramlette's husband, William, was more than 1,000 miles away in Florida. "He doesn't know what's going on with me," Mrs. Bramlette said. "While he's down there working, he doesn't know if I'm in labor or if the baby's here until I call him at 9:30 each night." 
 Laid off a year ago from his job at Dinner Bell Foods, a local meat packing plant, Mr. Bramlette has been taking odd jobs ever since he exhausted his unemployment insurance benefits in July. Recently, he and a friend were hired by a local woman to help her parents pack up their home in Clearwater, Fla., and move back to Ohio.
"This really stinks," Mr. Bramlette said by telephone from Clearwater. "I really don't like it, but you have to do what you have to do, and we need the money."
 
Running Out of Benefits
 The 40-year-old Mr. Bramlette is one of about 2.3 million jobless people nationwide who used up all their unemployment benefits in 1990, a 16 percent increase over the year before. The number is expected to jump again this spring when those who were laid off as the recession took hold in recent months begin to run out of benefits.
In addition, a recent study by Mathematica Policy Research, based in Princeton, N.J., determined that 75 percent of the unemployed had not found work four weeks after their benefits had expired, and 60 percent were still jobless 10 weeks after depleting their benefits.
Yet, unlike its actions in the recessions of 1975, 1980 and 1982, Congress has not acted to extend unemployment benefits beyond the maximum period allowed by individual states. At present, 48 states provide unemployment compensation for a maximum of 26 weeks. Massachusetts and Washington allow a maximum of 30 weeks.
Any benefits paid beyond the states' maximum period are shared by the states and the Federal Government. But changes in Federal law in the 1980's made it more difficult for states to pay benefits beyond the basic period, and no states are currently paying those extended benefits. In contrast 30 states paid extended benefits in 1982.
Representative Thomas J. Downey, a Suffolk Democrat who is acting chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, which has jurisdiction over unemployment compensation, said he would introduce legislation next month to ease the restrictions on states' payment of extended benefits.
"We have consciously denied people the benefits they need and deserve," he said.
 
Thousands of Job Applications
 Any liberalizing of the law could have a significant effect on Troy, a blue-collar town set amid cornfields 20 miles north of Dayton. In December, the jobless rate for Miami County, where Troy is the county seat, was 6.1 percent, matching the national average, but above the 5.8 percent mark for Ohio as a whole.
For many in Troy who have bleak job prospects and have depleted their unemployment benefits, life seems perilously close to the financial and emotional edge. Bills go unpaid, houses and automobiles remain in need of repair, medical insurance is allowed to lapse and self-confidence is damaged.
Six years ago, when she had her first child, Mrs. Bramlette quit her job in her third month of pregnancy. This time she continued to work as a sales representative for an insurance company until Thursday, four days after the baby was due. Even so, the Bramlettes were $300 behind on their utility bill and got through Christmas only by using food donated by Mr. Bramlette's former union.
The pressure was too much for Mrs. Bramlette. On the night before Mr. Bramlette left for Florida, she erupted, pouring out her anger and frustration until 3 A.M.
"I'm holding down the fort," she complained the other day, her blue eyes blazing. "I'm paying the bills. I'm paying his child support. I'm keeping things together. I'm pregnant. I'm tired, and I can't do it all."
 
Work When the Weather Is Good
 In good years, Daniel Dever, 34, earned $20,000 to $25,000 a year boning hams at Dinner Bell Foods. After he lost his job a year ago, he collected $257 a week in unemployment benefits until the end of July. Since then, he has worked three days a week at a local carwash when the weather is good enough. He earns $4.16 an hour.
His family gets by with the income from Mr. Dever's two stepsons who live with him in his three-bedroom home. One earns $7 an hour at a local fiberglass factory and the other makes $4 an hour at another factory. But even with his stepsons' earnings, Mr. Dever has not paid his $407 mortgage payment in three months and is afraid he might lose his house. Mr. Dever and his wife have no medical insurance, and he failed to renew the insurance on his 1977 Ford because he could not pay the $200 premium.
"This is the first time since I had a driver's license that I haven't had insurance on a car that I own," Mr. Dever said. "I just hope I don't get into an accident."
For Mike and Gail Lee, the concern is staying healthy. "We don't have any health insurance," said Mr. Lee, 42, "If either one of us gets sick, everything will be gone." Until Mrs. Lee recently got a job earning $64 a week as a part-time teacher's aide, the Lees had been out of work for more than a year. Their unemployment checks stopped coming last fall.
The Lees have been able to hold onto their house by taking in Mrs. Lee's son by a previous marriage and his wife, who both hold temporary jobs. "I don't want to lose my home and all the stuff we have," said Mrs. Lee, her voice cracking. "But how do we get out of this situation? I don't know if we will."
 
Savings Nearly Depleted
 So far, Wayne Larck, 40, does not have the same sense of desperation as the Lees, though he has traveled throughout the area looking for work. Unlike the Lees, Mr. Larck has paid off the mortgage on his home, and his jobless benefits just expired last month.
Nonetheless, after he pays his next property tax bill, Mr. Larck said his savings will be nearly depleted. To save money, he and his wife, Gloria, 41, eat only one meal a day. Despite his own troubles, Mr. Larck says he is more concerned about his son, Donald, who is with the Army in Saudi Arabia. "So far, we worry about our boy more than anything else," he said.
Miscalculations and misinformation have contributed to the plight of some of the former Dinner Bell workers whose unemployment checks have stopped. Mr. Dever, for example, has not applied for welfare or food stamps, believing that he is ineligible because he owns his house. Officials at the Ohio Department of Human Services say home ownership does not necessarily disqualify a person from receiving public assistance or food stamps.
Rather than looking for another job immediately after he was let go, Mr. Lee bought a restaurant in Springfield, Ohio, 21 miles from Troy. He lost $15,000, virtually his life savings. when it failed. By the time he began searching for work, the recession had taken hold and job prospects had dried up.
"I've just got to find a job or it's not going to work at all," he said softly. "I have to find a job."

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia, Jan. 27

 BODY:
Frightened by almost nighly attacks by Iraqi missiles, American employees of the Saudi national oil company are describing themselves as economic hostages, forced to choose between their jobs and their safety.
Several American and other Western employees of the Government-controlled Saudi Arabian Oil Company, or Saudi Aramco, said they had been told by their managers in recent days that if they left the country, they would face dismissal. 
 "I feel like I'm being held against my will," said John Saadi, an electrical engineer from Boston who has worked at Aramco for 12 years. "I feel in danger."
Despite the threat to their jobs, many of the 3,000 Americans who work for the oil company -- Aramcons, as they call themselves -- are gathering up their families and leaving anyway.
"I see no reason for the company taking this stance that it's business as usual," said Kathy Cox, who spent much of the weekend packing up her life's belongings in preparation for returning to the United States.
 
Sacrificing Early Retirement
 A 54-year-old teacher at Aramco's English-language school, she resigned from her job even though she is only seven months shy of her 10th anniversary at Aramco, a milestone that would have entitled her to early retirement.
She is part of an exodus of foreign workers from scores of companies in eastern Saudi Arabia who despite the loss of their salaries and their pensions, are fearful of remaining here while Iraqi missiles continue to be fired into the country.
Aramco's senior vice president for industrial relations, Abdallah Jumah, acknowledged in an interview that some workers were being offered a stark choice between leaving Saudi Arabia and keeping their jobs.
"We are not holding anybody against his will," Mr. Jumah said. "All we are saying to our employees is, look, you are here because we need you, and we need you now. If you leave, you will have to forfeit certain things that you otherwise would have."
 
Began as American Company
 It is an attitude that many employees say is destroying the trust built up over decades between Aramco and its thousands of expatriate workers. The company dates to 1933, when Standard Oil of California received a concession from the Saudi Government to drill for oil. Until 1974, Aramco was owned by American oil companies.
Beyond concern over their job security, foreign workers at Aramco complain that the company, which pumps 96 percent of Saudi Arabia's oil, has also been slow in demonstrating concern for their safety.
Until late last week, the company lacked an adequate air-raid warning system, and some workers who live in Aramco housing said they had slept through the initial missile attacks on Dhahran. Large pieces of shrapnel from the missiles have been found in the Aramco compound here.
"Basically you're going to have a hard time finding anybody who is real pleased with the way the company is handling the situation," said Robert Cashill, a 44-year-old industrial engineer from Newark who has worked at Aramco for eight years.
Mr. Cashill spent Friday night huddled with his wife in a bathroom in his home in the sprawling Aramco complex in Dhahran -- the bathroom has no windows that might shatter in an attack -- waiting for the all-clear to sound after a volley of Iraqi missiles.
The Cashills carry their gas masks almost everywhere, fearing that one of the Iraqi missiles might carry some of the chemical or biological agents that Iraq is known to have stockpiled.
 
'Coercion' Is Criticized
 Jack Devine, a geologist from Saskatchewan, Canada, who has worked at Aramco for 12 years, described the company's handling of its employees during the war as "heavy-handed."
"They seem to think that by coercion and force, they can keep people on the job," he said.
One of the geologists on his staff has already left, and the other was scheduled to leave today. "He's pretty shook up," Mr. Devine said.
Although there have been no reports of injuries from Iraqi missile attacks on Dhahran, a Saudi man was killed and 23 other people injured Friday when the warhead from one of the Iraqi Scud-B missiles landed in downtown Riyadh, the Saudi capital.
It was the first death from a Scud attack on Saudi Arabia. Most of the Scuds launched against Saudi Arabia have been intercepted by American-made Patriot missiles.

HEADLINE: Soviets Said to Hedge on War With Future in Mind

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
Administration officials said today that they viewed the statements by the Soviet Foreign Minister, Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, cautioning the United States against destroying Iraq as the beginning of an effort by the Soviet Union to preserve its influence in the Arab world in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war.
A senior Administration official, speaking after Mr. Bessmertnykh's talks Saturday night with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, said that for now the Bush Administration was notparticularly concerned about the Foreign Minister's remarks, which were the harshest criticism leveled by Moscow against American policy in the gulf since the crisis began. 
 The official said Washington would really be concerned about the Soviet Union only if it showed any sign of supporting the various efforts by North African and nonaligned countries to have the United Nations order a cease-fire in the war.
The official said that neither in public nor in private did Mr. Bessmertnykh evince any support for a cease-fire, which Washington has opposed on the ground that it would only give theIraqis a chance to regroup.
"The Soviets are positioning themselves with the Arabs for the aftermath of the war," the official said. "They are thinking about the future. But they have also made clear that they are still totally on board with us. The important thing is that they are not joining in the calls for a cease-fire. That is key."
Another Administration official said, "What Mr. Bessmertnykh was doing was trying to put an arm's length between us and the Soviets regarding the actual conduct of the war." The Soviet Union, this official said, does not want to be inextricably linked to the United States in case Iraq is devastated andthere is a backlash in the Arab world.
Speaking to reporters after his talks with Mr. Baker, Mr. Bessmertnykh walked a fine line, saying: "I have never put in doubt the commitment by the Soviet Union or the United States or any other member of the alliance to the Security Council resolutions. I think what's being done is in complete accord with those resolutions. They are intended to free Kuwait from oppression."
With Mr. Baker at his side, the Soviet minister added: "The source of the concern that I have expressed before is that there may be a danger of the conflict going more in the direction of the destruction of Iraq and in the direction of involving more casualites on both sides. So we have to think about it and try to avoid it."
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney saidtoday on the NBC News program "Meet the Press" that the Pentagon had no evidence to substantiate press reports that factions of the Soviet military were sending truckloads of equipment into Iraq through Iran.
Administration experts on Soviet affairs say a fundamental breach in the two countries' attitudes toward the gulf could come in the aftermath of the war.
American officials are already talking about instituting some type of "security structure" in the gulf that would protect Kuwait and Saudi Arabia from future attacks by Iraq or Iran. Although the officials have not said so publicly, such a structure would involve in the short term an American ground presence in the gulf and in the longer term an expanded American naval presence, as well as pre-positioned military supplies in Saudi Arabia.
The Soviet military is said to be uncomfortable with such a permanent increased American military presence along the Soviet Union's southern flank.
The Baker-Bessmertnykh talks on Saturday were devoted largely to the situation in the Baltics, an American official said. Mr. Bessmertnykh tried to impress upon Mr. Baker the point that if the United States and its Western European allies imposed economic sanctions on Moscow because of the Soviet crackdown in the Baltics, it would only serve to undercut President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's position. He said it would strengthen conservative forces in the Kremlin who are ambivalent about the improvement in Soviet-American relations to begin with, American officials said.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Congress;
Explaining War Votes Back in Home Districts

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26

 BODY:
Senator Sam Nunn scrapped a speech on the economy and spent three hours with the Chamber of Commerce in Gainesville, Ga., the other day, laying out details of tactics and strategy in the Persian Gulf war. He also explained his vote against authorizing the use of force.
But, like many Democrats all over the country, Mr. Nunn insisted that "this debate is over," and that he was squarely behind his country's war. Members of the chamber listened intently. 
 Senator Al Gore, who voted to support the use of force, traveled through his home state of Tennessee and found audiences "pensive." He said he was struck by how often people who strongly disagreed with his vote "recognize some legitimacy in the arguments on the other side."
The approaches of these two potential Democratic Presidential candidates mirrored what dozens of other lawmakers were doing in recent days, discussing their positions on a war that divided the nation before it began and now enjoys overwhelming support.
As Republicans were firing their first partisan salvo on Democrats who voted against force, members of Congress were hearing a complex variety of responses from their constituents. The variety underlined the risks in instant political judgments about how votes on the war will affect politics, Presidential and Congressional.
 
Conflicting Message
 Some lawmakers got conflicting messages at the same time. Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, got 949 critical letters from his district and only 61 backing his vote for the use of force. But he found that the reaction in person -- from audiences at speeches to people passing him on the street -- almost the reverse and "extraordinarily supportive."
Representative Ed Jenkins, a Georgia Democrat who represents Gainesville, said he was sure the voters of his district disagreed with his vote against the use of force, but "they're not angry." He credits that partly to the quality of the Congressional debate on the war. "People were very, very impressed with the caliber of the debate and what they were hearing and learning," he said, and this led many to tell him that while they disagreed with him, "I respect your position."
Prof. Gary Jacobson of the University of California at San Diego, one of the nation's foremost experts on Congressional elections, said he believed that the war vote, pro or con, was a vote that should not cost members of Congress support because they had taken care to explain their views carefully. On a major issue like this, he said, a vote that can be thoughtfully explained is likely to be safe.
The sort of political calculus commonly employed in Washington looked on Mr. Nunn's "no" vote as one that helped soften his generally conservative image with the liberals who traditionally dominate Democratic Presidential nominating contests. It treated the more liberal Mr. Gore's "yes" vote as one that covered his right flank. Each Senator laughed off the assumed motivation.
 
Big Factor: How the War Goes
 The intentions aside, the biggest uncertainty about political impact, on the Presidential hopes of Mr. Nunn or Mr. Gore or even President Bush, or the prospects for a second term in the House of someone like Representative Larry LaRocco of Idaho, is whether the war goes well or badly.
A quick, easy war seemed to be the assumption behind this week's attack by Clayton K. Yeutter, the new chairman of the Republican National Committee on Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and other Democrats who voted against authorizing force. He said they could suffer for their votes in the 1992 elections.
But some elected Republicans were more cautious. One of the most partisan Republicans in the House, Representative Robert S. Walker of Pennsylvania, said, "It was for most members a vote of conscience." The Lancaster Congressman, who voted for force, said that if the news turned bad "we have vulnerabilities."
"Our vote of conscience has a definite down side," he said.
There was plainly Democratic concern, and just after the war started, both houses passed resolutions pledging their support to the troops and to President Bush. Many members, like Senator Nunn and Speaker Thomas S. Foley, had punctuated their speeches against force by saying they would support the use of force if they lost the vote in Congress, as they expected to.
 
A Sudden Change in Reaction
 And Mr. Nunn explained this week in Gainesville that he had always said war and force were justified against Iraq, but that his doubts were about timing and whether all other options had been exhausted. Moreover, he said, support was now easy because "when our men and women are on the battlefield, and when the shooting starts, I believe we must all stand together with them as they unfurl the flag and face the foe."
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota noted a sudden transformation of reaction. His mail ran heavy before the vote, with 95 percent of it in opposition to force. But now, with a war on and South Dakotans fearful for their friends and relatives in the service, the issue is different. "These people can no longer afford the luxury of arguing the policy," he said, adding that their concerns are now that the troops be "safe and successful."
Even with the sudden transformation of national public opinion, from an even split on war or sanctions before the bombing began to nearly four to one support for war after it started, some supporters of the war, like Mr. Solarz or Representative Mel Levine, a Santa Monica, Calif., Democrat, encountered protests. Mr. Levine, whose district office was occupied by antiwar protesters before his vote for force, faces a threat of another sit-in if he does not hold a large meeting with his constituents who are critical of his vote, a step that his spokesman said he was unwilling to take for security reasons.
 
Importance of Being Honest
 But for many lawmakers, there is a suprising calm. Representative Jim Olin, a Democrat from Lynchburg, Va., said that before his vote against force he got a great deal of mail in opposition to war. Since then, though he is sure his district backs Mr. Bush, he said, "I've heard almost nothing from anybody."
Mr. LaRocco said he, too, was experiencing "a bit of a lull." In three town meetings he held after voting against force, he said, "I really didn't take any flak over it."
Representative Gene Taylor, a Democrat from Gulfport, Miss., said that his mail had stayed supportive of his vote against the use of force, and that while one Republican State Representative had threatened to offer a resolution against him a number of military veterans in the Mississippi Legislature had squelched that effort.
Again and again, lawmakers said that explaining their position thoughtfully had been critical. Representative Stephen L. Neal, a Democrat from Winston-Salem, N.C., said he knew his vote against force "may come back to haunt me some day." But for now, he said, he was confident that "voters understand that no representative is going to agree with them all the time."
"People understand," he said. "If you've done your homework and thought about your vote, they'll support you."
And Wyche Fowler Jr., Georgia's junior Senator, said he had never thought this would be a politically critical vote for him. "Most people accept that when you're voting on matters of life and death you vote devoid of political consideration," he said.

HEADLINE: Slump Forcing Up Albany's Aid to Poor

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 27

 BODY:
In blaming New York's fiscal slide on the national recession, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has been highlighting the corrosive effect of hard times on state revenues. But the recession is also applying great pressure to the spending side of the state budget by increasing the mandated costs of caring for the poor.
After several years of steady decline, the state's caseloads of public welfare and Medicaid recipients started to rise steeply in late 1989, and the growth is projected to continue unabated through this year. State budget officials expect the welfare rolls, which averaged 1.28 million people in 1990, to grow by nearly 100,000 people. 
 Welfare and Medicaid are programs any state resident is entitled to join if he or she is poor enough. The state is required to cover much of their costs, along with the Federal and local governments. And as the economy worsens, more people qualify and the costs rise. At the current rate, the costs would rise by hundreds of millions of dollars, although plans abound in Albany for ways of cutting them back.
"You have a fabric of social programs that are means tested, and they all closely reflect what's going on in the economy," said Russell Sykes, a policy analyst for the State Communities Aid Association, a nonprofit group that lobbies for social service programs.
 
15 Percent Medicaid Rise Seen
 Officials in the Cuomo administration said the Governor's 1991-92 budget, which will be released on Thursday, would include growth of about $600 million for Medicaid, a 15 percent increase, and about $130 million in welfare costs, a 12 percent increase.
Because state revenues are growing less than 2 percent, those increases contribute significantly to the $6 billion budget gap that Mr. Cuomo announced on Thursday. In this year's $29.2 billion budget, those programs ran about $75 million over budget, adding to a $900 million deficit that the Governor will close through short-term borrowing at the end of this fiscal year in March. That borrowing, in turn, will contribute nearly $1 billion to the $6 billion figure.
Most of this year's deficit and next year's shortfall can be attributed to what the Governor describes as "a precipitous decline" in revenues produced by everything from the personal income tax to the lottery. To help balance next year's budget, Mr. Cuomo is expected to propose tax increases for the third consecutive year.
But he has said that most of the shortfall will be attacked with spending cuts. And as the fastest growing segment of a state budget that must be slashed by billions, the "safety net" programs will attract great attention this spring from the Legislature.
 
Republicans to Propose Cuts
 Next week, the Republican leaders of the State Senate plan to propose cutting $1 billion from social-service programs like welfare, Medicaid and foster care, largely by restricting eligibility and reducing costs.
But advocates for the poor argue that a recession is the worst time to cut spending for society's most vulnerable members. They predict that such cuts will only worsen homelessness and crime, cementing the permanence of the underclass and passing an even greater burden to future generations.
Mr. Sykes and others have lobbied for an increase in the welfare grant, which now leaves recipients living below the poverty line. The typical welfare grant for a family of three in New York City is $577 a month, which includes a housing allowance of $286.
Administration officials said Mr. Cuomo would propose neither an increase nor a decrease.
 
Limiting Services to Poor
 Michael J. Dowling, Mr. Cuomo's deputy secretary for human services, said much of the growth in welfare and Medicaid would be offset in the budget by proposals to contain their costs and limit the amount of services that local governments would have to provide.
But Cesar A. Perales, the State Commissioner of Social Services, said his department would have to balance some of its growth in mandated costs through cuts in other areas. "We're going to have to take a very big cut on the services side, like programs to prevent teen-age pregnancy, expand child care and assist victims of domestic violence," he said.
Medicaid and welfare are not the only state programs susceptible to an economic downturn. Crime rates generally rise, and along with them go needs for more prison space, court officials and public defenders. Losing a job often causes depression, and a bigger burden on mental health clinics. And families break apart in hard times, leaving children in foster care.
But because the state must pay for Medicaid and welfare, those programs cannot escape the impact of recession.
 
Extra Growth in Home Relief
 Using the most recent numbers available, which reflect October statistics compiled by the Department of Social Services, the number of welfare recipients rose to a peak of 1.32 million in that month. The average was 1.28 million from January 1990 to October, compared with 1.22 million for all 1989. At $1.07 billion, the state's cost of providing for those recipients absorbed 4 percent of the current budget.
Almost three-fourths of the growth has been in the home-relief program, although the program accounts for less than a quarter of all welfare cases. Its average caseload grew by 20 percent in 1990, with 80 percent of the growth in New York City.
Home relief provides grants to childless couples and single men who qualify because of their income level or disabilities. The home-relief population is particularly vulnerable to job scarcity.
The larger component of welfare -- Aid to Families With Dependent Children -- has been been more stable, with an average caseload that grew by 2 percent in 1990.
About 10 percent of the growth in the welfare rolls stems from more Soviet immigrants and a surge in AIDS patients. "The rest of it is pretty much economically driven," said Paula Wilson, the state's deputy budget director. State studies show that the increase in New York's welfare caseload has been following the gradual increase in the state's unemployment rate.
The impact of the recession on the state's $4 billion in Medicaid spending is harder to track. But most welfare recipients also receive Medicaid benefits.

HEADLINE: Some in Congress Harden on Trade

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
Many members of Congress are preparing for another confrontation with the Bush Administration over trade legislation.
Resentments about the slow pace at which Japan and South Korea are opening their markets to American companies is feeding a drive for laws that would require Washington to retaliate against countries that keep markets shut. 
 The Administration insists it has enough legal authority to do the job and bridles at curbs of Presidential discretion that the spate of new bills would produce if they are enacted. It also wants to avoid riling trade partners while the Persian Gulf war is under way. And it fears that legislative initiatives could turn protectionist in the current recession.
One focus of the conflict is on what to do about the expiration last year of what is known as the Super 301 provision of the 1988 trade legislation. That provision attacked foreign barriers by identifying "priority" nations and practices that needed attention and then set deadlines for negotiation and retaliation.
The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee's Trade Subcommittee, Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat, called the law "the most successful provision" of the 1988 trade act and wants it back, with better enforcement provisions.
The ranking Republican on the subcommittee, John C. Danforth of Missouri, concurs that "enforcement has become the principal interest here."
But the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, says there is "already an ample arsenal of tools," and expressed her opinion that Super 301 was actually "quite clumsy" because it required retaliation "on a date specific" even while the United States was engaged in negotiations that could open foreign markets.
 
Undermining World Trade Pact
 The law also enraged many foreign partners, who said the measure's unilateral imposition of sanctions undermined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the 101-nation agreement that serves as the world's trade charter.
One Congressional proposal is a bill on financial services introduced by Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, the chairman of the banking committee, and Jake Garn of Utah, its ranking Republican.
It authorizes regulators to deny bids for expansion in the United States by financial institutions based in countries that bar American companies from comparable competitive opportunities.
The sponsors acknowledge that the bill is aimed mainly at Japan, which despite some progress over the years still maintains an elaborate web of laws and practices, American Treasury officials say, that keeps foreign banks and securities firms from competing on equal terms with the Japanese.
 
More Retaliation Feared
 The Administration opposes the Riegle-Garn bill on the ground that narrow reciprocity as a principle of trade policy would lead to escalating retaliation. But it has not yet decided on whether to veto the bill.
"We've seen this coming and warned the Japanese that if we don't see more progress, Congress could become so enraged that it will legislate," said a senior Treasury official who asked not to be identified.
On Monday in Washington, Bush Administration and Japanese officials will tangle once again over demands the United States has been making for seven years about a faster pace for Japanese financial deregulation.
One American complaint is that interest rate controls keep money rates unusually low in Japan, providing a considerable advantage for Japanese banks as they expand in the United States. Japanese banks now have a 25 percent share of the lucrative California market, for example.
Officials at Japan's Finance Ministry insist that foreign and Japanese companies are treated equally and that the American campaign is merely an effort to seek excuses for American businesses that are not doing well in Japan.
 
Allowed to Expire
 Super 301 was the popular name applied to a 1988 amendment to Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which is generally aimed at unfair trade practices. It was allowed to expire last year amid the general truce engendered by global trade talks. But those talks collapsed last month.
Should the trade discussions be revived, which is appearing more likely, many lawmakers are now saying that Super 301, or something like it, will be enacted as the price Congress exacts for approving any global agreement.
Congress historically demands -- and gets -- trade policy changes, usually in the form of some improved protection for domestic industry and workers, in return for supporting international agreements that open the United States to more imports.
"For the past two years," said William T. Archey, a vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce in Washington, "Congress has granted to the executive branch the leadership in trade policy. It is doubtful that such deference will continue during this Congress."
 
Japan Reassures U.S.
 TOKYO, Jan. 27 (REUTERS) -- Japanese negotiators sought to reassure the United States over the weekend that Tokyo's procedures for buying computers were fair, Japanese Government officials said. Washington wants an increase in sales of American computers to the Japanese Government and sought assurances that bureaucratic foot-dragging would not get in the way. Kenichiro Sasae, a Foreign Ministry official, said the Japanese policy was consistent with that of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Travel;
FEAR OF TERRORISM IS CURBING TRAVEL

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
Frightened by the threat of terrorism and preoccupied with the war against Iraq, Americans are canceling vacation plans and choosing to stay close to home.
In the clearest indication yet of the war's effects on the economy, operators of group tours, airlines and cruise lines all report an increase in cancellations and a drop in bookings since United States-led forces started attacking Iraq on Jan. 17. 
 While many canceled trips involved travel to the Middle East and Europe, people are also postponing other overseas flights as well as domestic vacations that involve air travel. Foreign travel to the United States has also fallen off.
Concern about flying anywhere is the reason most often given for canceling trips. But some people say they are staying home for other reasons as well. Some potential travelers are riveted to their television sets, captivated by the constant news reports about the war, a condition that some people are calling the "CNN effect."
One traveler staying home is Chuck Santoro, who runs an insurance agency in Bergenfield, N.J.. He canceled a family trip to New Orleans for Mardi Gras.
"It is not really a great time to party," he said. Mr. Santoro said he was worried about being part of the unruly mass of people that gather to celebrate Mardi Gras. "Who knows what could happen?" he said. "Somebody could chuck a bomb in there."
Tourism to New York, Washington and other large cities has fallen as people try to avoid potential targets of terrorism.
Along with the drop in tourism has come a reduction in business travel, reflecting both the recession and corporate bans on international travel because of the war.
Whether more Americans will take vacations this year in the family car, staying at hotels and motels or camping out, is impossible to determine yet. Even if such trips are planned six months in advance, few people make reservations that early. So that shift in vacation plans would not turn up in hard numbers.
Indeed, precise numbers on the changing travel patterns are difficult to come by, and January and February are generally the slowest travel months of the year anyway. Still, many hotels and airlines say customers are making reservations at levels below their projections. In the cruise industry, January is the most important month, in terms of reservations being made. A bad January could have repercussions for the rest of the year.
 
Cruise Cancellations
 Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. in Miami is the nation's largest cruise operator, with numerous vacations to the Caribbean. It says it is receiving 10 to 20 cancellations a day, compared with 3 or 4 daily last January.
Bookings through American Express travel agents have dropped by nearly 10 percent since the beginning of the year. "It is a significant drop in a very short period of time," said Roger H. Ballou, president of the Travel Services Group, a division of the American Express Company.
The packaged-tour business at the Carlson Travel Network dropped 40 percent after war broke out, said Ronald Letterman, president of the travel agency and tour operator in Minneapolis. "The week after the war started, our advance bookings just stopped."
Other travel executives agree that travel plans seem frozen since the war began. "People are just putting their trips on hold," said Charles D. Platt, president of Alamo Rent a Car Inc. in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. If people do not fly, he said, they do not rent cars.
The drop in vacations comes at a bad time for the travel industry, which was already bracing for a rough year because of the recession. Companies in the travel business say it is too early to tell how long the slowdown will last and if it will lead to layoffs or other cost-cutting measures.
Many airlines have ended flights to the Middle East, and some have announced plans to cut flights to Europe. Trans World Airways said it would halt up to half its overseas flights. Delta Air Lines has canceled its daily Cincinnati-to-Paris flight, and airline industry analysts said similar moves by other carriers were likely.
 
Fewer London Flights
 British Airways has trimmed flights in the face of falling demand. The airline is now flying two rather than three flights a day between New York and London. One of the two Concorde flights on Sundays has been canceled. A spokesman for British Airways said the war was compounding the ecomomic slowdown. "It will have an effect on revenues and profitability," said John Lampl, an airline spokesman.
British Airways has pulled its advertising. But to combat slack demand, it began offering a special $249 round-trip fare for New York to London through travel agents last week.
Several airlines, including United and American, have relaxed their penalties for canceling flights. Travelers concerned about flying can exchange their tickets for vouchers that can be traded for tickets during the year.
Even before the terrorism scare, hotels had been offering discounted room packages to attract guests. John Fox of the accounting firm Pannell Kerr Forster said the industry would face additional pressure to cut rates if the slowdown continued.
 
'Nobody Really Wants to Travel'
 Several large cruise operators canceled cruises to Europe this week when reservations failed to materialize because of safety concerns. Princess Cruises in Los Angeles decided this week not to send a second cruise ship to Europe this summer as planned, because the war had depressed bookings.
Crystal Cruises also decided not to sail to Europe this summer. "Nobody really wants to travel across the Atlantic," said Arthur Sbarsky, senior vice president of marketing for the Los Angeles-based company.
The war has also altered the course of the Cunard Line's Queen Elizabeth 2. The ship will not go through the Suez Canal or stop at any Mediterranean ports. Instead, the ocean liner will steam around Africa as part of an around-the-world cruise.
There are some indications that people may choose to take short driving vacations to areas close to home. Since war broke out, "the phones are ringing a heck of a lot more than they had been," said Bobbi Doren of the Pines Resort Hotel in South Fallsburg, N.Y., a family resort in the Catskills two hours from New York City. "It is closer to home," she said.
 
Traffic on Amtrak
 An Amtrak spokesman said yesterday that it could not be determined if its ridership had changed since the war began. Passenger traffic on the rail system has increased 2 percent to 3 percent since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August, he said.

HEADLINE: Pump-Priming Pail Is Dry As U.S. Budget Comes Up

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
In the textbook world, a primary tool to fight recession is an expanding Federal budget deficit. Extra Government stimulus, the theory goes, will make up for diminished spending in the private sector and thereby soften the economic downturn.
Even before the outbreak of war, the reality did not match the ideal, and the conflict in the Persian Gulf is not expected to bring the two any closer. By contrast to the industrial mobilization for World War II, which pulled the nation out of the Great Depression, this conflict is backed by a well-stocked military inventory. 
 When the budget debate opens on Capitol Hill this week with the President's request for spending and revenues for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, the gap between the theory of pump-priming and the reality of the 1990's will be painfully apparent.
Since the Government failed during the prosperous 1980's to run budget surpluses, or even achieve balance, it lacks the wherewithal to pump up a deflated economy. A long-feared prospect is thus at hand: a recession that hits when fiscal policy is already immobilized.
"A deficit is appropriate during a recession because you need the stimulus," said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company. "The problem is the base from which we start -- the deficit is already so high."
Recessions automatically increase the deficit, now estimated at somewhat more than $300 billion this year even if the downturn proves to be short-lived. During a recession, spending for unemployment insurance and other elements of the social safety net rises while revenues from income taxes and other levies fall. But the Government seems unable to go beyond these so-called stabilizers, a fact acknowledged by economists and legislators across the political spectrum.
"We should not try to counteract the downturn with pump-priming," Representative Lee H. Hamilton, an Indiana Democrat and member of the Joint Economic Committee, said recently. "We already have enormous stimulus through our large deficit. As economists have said for so long, we have pushed our fiscal accelerator to the floor while holding hard on the monetary brake. If we want to go faster, we should ease up on the brake, not try to push the accelerator through the floorboard."
Mr. Hamilton's point was reinforced Tuesday by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, who urged that Congress remember the long-term goals of last fall's agonizingly achieved five-year budget-cutting agreement.
 
Social Security Tax Cut Proposal
 And while the war itself is unlikely to provide large stimulus to the economy, additional spending on a myriad of things from chemical weapons suits to combat pay is taking place. But the bulk of the stimulus is being offset through the initial stages of the war by the tax increases and spending cuts the budget package calls for.
The magnitude of the deficit is not the only barrier to a reflexive turn to Government jobs programs, stepped-up spending on public works and tax cuts. Even former supporters of such moves agree that such programs take so long to put in place that their effect is generally not felt until the economy is recovering on its own.
One of the few proposals for such a move comes from Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, who has revived legislation to cut Social Security payroll taxes. The main goal is to halt the use of Social Security surpluses to help finance the deficit. But Senator Moynihan contended in reintroducing the measure last week that it would serve to cushion the recession.
In theory, tax policy could be used as a countercyclical tool, said Alice M. Rivlin, a former head of the Congressional Budget Office, if Congress were only "good at figuring out when we were going into a recession." The task, however, seems to be beyond the ability of any forecaster.
In fact, any substantial fiscal stimulus risks provoking enough anxiety about the integrity of the budget legislation to be counterproductive. "You'll send all the wrong signals" to the bond market, raising interest rates and thereby worsening the slump, said Lyle E. Gramley, a former Federal Reserve official who is now chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association.
"I really don't think there's much the Administration can do" to fight recession, Mr. Gramley added.
 
 Constraints on the Fed

The near-paralysis of fiscal policy leaves Federal Reserve monetary policy as the main anti-recession tool. Unfortunately, many analysts say, the Fed also faces constraints not normally considered in textbooks.
The most prominent is the battered condition of the nation's banks, the main agents through which policy makers increase the money supply. Because so many loans have gone sour, banks have become reluctant to extend new loans and to reduce rates. This situation means that an easier Fed monetary policy cannot be pursued with the traditional confidence that it will help business activity.
"I don't ever remember the banking system being an independent element of weakness" in the economy, said Milton W. Hudson, economic adviser to the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company.
A $300 billion budget deficit itself also affects this process, economists at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. said in a market letter. "The implied huge Treasury financing needs will provide the paper for cautious commercial banks to invest their reserves in, while they refrain from lending to real estate and corporate sectors saddled with falling profits, shrinking asset values and deteriorating liquidity," they declared.
If the Treasury's huge demands lead to a sharp increase in long-term interest rates, as seems possible even in recession, this not only would further hobble the economy, it would also raise the deficit, since interest on the debt now accounts for more than one-fourth of the budget.

HEADLINE: Andover Journal;
At a Missile Maker, Pride and Relief

DATELINE: ANDOVER, Mass., Jan. 21

 BODY:
For many workers in this Boston suburb of 27,000 people, the success of the Patriot missile in the Persian Gulf war is more than just a matter of pride. It's a matter of job security.
The Raytheon Company plant here began making the radar and guidance systems for the missiles in 1980. Since then, people from throughout the Merrimack Valley have come to Andover, the well-heeled town where President Bush went to prep school, looking for work. But defense cuts and threats by Congress to scrap the Patriot, which tracks and intercepts attacking missiles, have made continued employment uncertain. 
 In the last six months, the Andover plant laid off more than 300 of its 6,000 workers, sending them into a battered local economy whose unemployment rate has doubled in just over two years, to 7.3 percent.
Until news came two weeks ago that the Patriots had begun knocking out Iraqi Scud missiles, morale had been low, workers said.
"I was laid off from the plant before, so I had been worrying about my job," said an assembler, who spoke on condition that her name not be used. "But I feel good about what I do, especially now that the war is on and the Patriot is working. Maybe if it continues to do well, Raytheon will get more contracts and there will be more secure jobs."
Workers at the plant had been expecting additional layoffs early this year, but instead they are working around the clock to keep up with orders brought in by the gulf crisis.
"I think we just all feel good about the fact that the Patriot is doing its job," said Joseph O'Donnell, another assembler at the plant, as he soldered parts on to a missile's circuit board. For three weeks last year, Mr. O'Donnell was laid off from his $12.99 an hour job. Now, he said, his bosses are asking him to work overtime.
Since 1980, Raytheon, the largest private employer in Massachusetts, has delivered more than 108 high-tech Patriot missile systems, which includes the missile, the launcher and other ground equipment, and more than 4,500 missiles. The Pentagon pays $50 million to $55 million for a complete system and $600,000 for each missile.
Led by sales of the missile, Raytheon today announced record profits of $557.3 million on sales of $9.3 billion for 1990. Besides the United States, which has asked Raytheon to step up production, buyers of the missile include Germany, the Netherlands, Japan, Italy, and, since the gulf crisis began, Israel and Saudi Arabia.
Andover officials hope the money that goes into the company will spill out to the community. "Raytheon is a good neighbor to us, and we are pleased the Patriot is doing well," said R. S. Stapczynski, the town manager. "Maybe there'll be some jobs created by this success. This whole state could use a boost."
Tightened security at the Andover plant, which is surrounded by a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire, serves as a reminder that the United States is at war against an enemy whose weapons could include terrorism. On the other side of Boston in Quincy, workers at another Raytheon plant , have petitioned for stricter security measures.
Raytheon officials would not comment on security measures, but employees said entrances to work areas, once staffed by one security guard, now had four to six guards. All handbags and knapsacks are now inspected as workers enter and leave the plant.
"They are checking everything," said Cindy Cote, a 31-year-old assembler whose husband works as a mechanic on the morning shift. "They just seem to be afraid of people coming in here illegally."
Elation about the Patriots' successes has also been dampened by the increasing numbers of friends and family called into military service. More than 100 people from the Merrimack Valley are serving in the gulf, at least 13 of them from Andover.
While no war protesters have made their way to Raytheon's gates, Andover residents have gathered in homes and churches to pray for peace and the soldiers' safety. "A lot of people have relatives over there and are worried," said Mr. O'Donnell, a 43-year-old veteran of the Vietnam War.
Mrs. Cote said her worries had been of a different nature.
"At first I had a hard time thinking about making weapons that are killing people," she said. "But now I think about the fact that it's saving our own people and it's for our country. I guess if it wasn't me making it, it would be someone else. And it's a good job."

HEADLINE: As Urban Blight Worsens, Victims Find Their Isolation Is Deepening

SERIES: The Missing Agenda; Poverty and Policy - Second of three articles.

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS

 BODY:
In the St. Thomas housing project, with its rows of boarded-up red brick buildings, the ghosts speak more eloquently than the living about the despair at the bottom of urban America.
There's the spindly crape myrtle tree and a modest plaque marking the spot where 5-year-old Coco Vessel died in a crossfire of bullets on Nov. 19, 1989. There's a weed-choked patch outside the apartment where Elnora Barnes for many years tended her begonias and roses, green peppers, eggplant and okra before gunfire drove her away. 
 There's no missing the dreadful toll of inner-city decay in America's urban slums. But for those outside the blighted districts, insulated by money and geography, there's a terrible paradox. As the problems of the urban poor become more toxic to those inside, their immediate impact on most Americans is becoming more distant and elusive.
 
Effects Are Widely Felt
 In a nation now more suburban than urban, with residential segregation common, jobs increasingly following residences out from the urban core, and regional growth and corresponding political power moving away from the most affected areas, the impact of urban poverty is more like a tornado than a hurricane, ripping apart some cities, neighborhoods and lives, but leaving others almost intact.
 
Far-Reaching Effects
 But even though elusive, the effects of urban poverty can be far-reaching. They strain big-city budgets, produce criminal behavior that is altering urban life, poison race relations and threaten to create an undereducated work force that could haunt the nation for decades. The presence of the homeless, like battered refugees from a blighted kingdom, in even the most prosperous cities serves as a reminder of the depth of the nation's social ills.
One of the political challenges of the 1990's is finding a way to summon the national will to address a problem that the nation has done its best to isolate and flee.
"After the riots of the 1960's, a quite elaborate social reorganization of American metropolitan life has taken place based on the principle of everbody getting as far away from the underclass as possible," said Nicholas Lemann, author "The Promised Land," a book on poverty to be published in March by Alfred A. Knopf.
"A place like New York is a very special case where the richest neighborhood is right next to some of the poorest," Mr. Lemann said. "That's very rare. Most people know the conditions in the ghetto are terrible, but it's a problem that doesn't directly affect them."
 
View From the Projects
A Daily Assault Of Fear and Despair
To Lilianne Flavin, a Dominican sister from Ireland who is an incongruous, healing presence at the St. Thomas housing project here, the urgency of the problem is as unmistakable as the despair she sees daily. "The question shouldn't be what these people are doing to society," she says. "It's what society is doing to them."
St. Thomas was once a stable home to white working class residents, with neat three-story brick buildings, French Quarter-style iron grillwork and leafy oaks. Now, about 550 of the 1,500 apartments are gutted and abandoned and the project is a patchwork of decay -- an uprooted toilet in front of one building, a pile of dilapidated furniture forming a makeshift playground in front of another.
 
Perils to the Children
 The overwhelming majority of the residents are the victims, not the perpetrators. They are people like Rose Bailey, worried about the lead poisoning of her 3-year-old son, Theresa Delmore, hoping her four children can escape the crack to which she is addicted, or Earnestine Lather, resolutely trying to protect her children from the slum's perils.
"Being here, I feel like we're living in the Last Days," said Mrs. Lather, invoking a term from Revelation to describe the project's slide toward chaos.
As she waited to meet her 6-year-old's school bus, Mrs. Lather added, "Mostly, you try to keep them away from the drugs and the violence, but it's hard. I tell my oldest boy I don't want him hanging out with the boys who are getting in trouble, and he says, 'Aw, mama, ain't nobody else for me to be with.' "
There is rage at St. Thomas. Its explodes in the gunfire at night and lurks just beneath the surface of daily life, evident in the touch football game played each afternoon with a fury that's more blood sport than play.
 
'It's Like Being in Jail'
 But far more common is simple despair.
"I feel like I'm a different person when I'm not here," said Ms. Delmore, who stopped working as a nurse's assistant when she became addicted to crack three years ago. "I feel good. I feel I don't need drugs. But being in here, you just feel like you're drowning. It's like being in jail. I hate the projects. I hate this rathole."
 
View From Next Door
Cities Transform As Many Escape
New Orleans is one of the rare cities where rich and poor live in close proximity and where conditions at the bottom have a direct effect on everyone. Fear of crime is transforming some neighborhoods, like the lovely Uptown district near Tulane University, from some of the nation's most appealing to some of its most besieged.
Chink Ogden is a 34-year-old lawyer with two young childen who grew up in New Orleans and until June lived in the house that his grandfather built in 1898. But in June he sold the house, moved to suburban St. Tammany Parish and cannot imagine moving back.
"I didn't want to raise my kids in a crime-ridden city, and I didn't see it getting any better," he said. "This city was the greatest city in the world to live in. I like to party and the city never died. You could always go out and have a good time. Now you have to be careful and watch where you go, and that's not living."
In the French Quarter, the party still goes on. But New Orleans now is more like a caricature of America's racial politics at their worst instead of symbolizing the joys of urban life. It is a city that is 65 percent black with almost 15 percent of the population living in public housing. Just across the parish line is the all-white suburban district that sent a former Ku Klux Klan leader, David Duke, to the Louisiana House of Representatives.
 
Flight From New York
 The same sort of frustrations are probably felt most acutely in New York City, where the nation's largest concentration of inner-city poverty exists in the densest urban environment.
Irena Choi Stern is a 32-year-old mother of three who after eight years on the Upper West Side is planning to leave for the suburbs.
After being a victim of a series of violent or abusive incidents -- some random crime, some tied to her Korean ancestry -- she has decided she would rather see her children learn about life from the distance afforded by the suburbs than the turmoil of the city streets.
"I find I'm becoming much more racist personally living in the city, and I don't want my kids to be that way," she said. "I find the people who grew up in the suburbs and then moved to the urban centers are more open minded than people who've had so many negative experiences with other racial groups."
Tom McCarthy, a 45-year-old freelance editor and lifelong New Yorker said he has been mugged five times since 1983, most recently by black youths on a crowded street. He does not consider himself a racist, but neither does he object when a bartender, alluding to three recent robbery attempts by blacks, refuses to buzz in a neatly dressed black man to a bar in upper Manhattan.
 
Events Embitter a Black
 "If life is not about playing the percentages, I don't know what it's about," Mr. McCarthy said. "If I'm a bar owner and three out of three black men in suits come in and rob me, then you don't have to know much about statistics to be skeptical about opening your door to black gentlemen wearing suits and ties."
 To blacks, even the most advantaged, that attitude is a bitter reminder of the souring of the urban dream.
Phil Isom, a 26-year-old black man and a third-year law student at Columbia University, recalls with bitterness and anger a recent incident in which a store owner refused to allow him into a stationery store frequented by Columbia students until he presented an identification card.
"The stereotypes being perpetuated about black men are not working to solve the problems," said Mr. Isom, who grew up in East Harlem. "If anything, they add fuel to the problems. There are a lot of angry young black males out there, and every time you're not buzzed into a store, every time you cannot catch a cab, every time you get on an elevator and everyone gets off, every time you're asked for an ID card when no one else is, it just gets you much more angry and it turns you further and further away from trying to be a part of this society."
 
View From Across Town
Most Are Aware But Not Affected
Largely because of the haunting visibility of the homeless, most Americans have at least some personal experience with the worst ravages of poverty.
A New York Times Poll found that 54 percent of Americans say they see homeless people in their community or on the way to work. In the survey of 1,028 adults, 48 percent said they have taken some special precaution against crime and 29 percent said they see people buying and selling drugs in their community or on their way to work. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus three percentage points.
Homelessness, drugs, crime -- these most obvious urban problems break through the public consciousness from time to time and get the most attention from politicians. But interviews around the country indicate that many Americans, even those in big cities with the worst poverty problems, feel largely isolated from the problems of the poor.
Michael Rosenzweig, like Mr. Ogden of New Orleans, is a lawyer with two young children who lives in a city with soaring poverty and crime. But when asked how the problems of the urban poor affect his life in a neighborhood north of downtown Atlanta, he gives a very different answer.
"I find it impinges on my life very little, if at all," he said. "I find I simply am not forced to confront those problems physically or visibly in any real way. I read that stuff in the papers and see it on the news, but I don't ever really experience it."
In Atlanta, with little downtown living, widespread residential segregation and most residences and jobs spiraling away from the urban core and toward the northern suburbs, it is a common experience.
 
'You're Insulated From It
 That experience is the norm, not the exception in American life.
Charles Lockwood of Los Angeles observed, "In New York, you're forced into dealing with people on the street or on the subway; here so much of life is lived behind the windshield of your car, you're insulated from it."
Mr. Lockwood, who writes articles and books on urban and architectural issues, added, "I think it's one reason why these issues aren't being dealt with in this country, outside of a sort of moral malaise."
The effect of moving residents as well as jobs out of cities is a new kind of community. "If you go to a place like Reston Town Center outside Washington," Mr. Lockwood said, "they've created a downtown without crime, without graffiti, without poor people. It's not only white flight, it's total abandonment of the center city."
James Alan Fox, a professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University, notes that the explosion in murder rates in recent years has been almost entirely limited to the nonwhite poor. From 1987 to 1989, when the murder rate for nonwhites rose by 16 percent, it declined by 2 percent for whites, he said.
"I think there's a moral obligation to deal with these problems," he said. "But I can't say that if we don't do anything about it all these kids in the inner city will grow up and attack us. It does not tend to happen that way."
 
View Into the Future
Experts See Peril To Nation's Health
Sometimes the reality of inner city life intrudes in jarring ways. In Dallas, for example, a group of elderly people were lined up outside a building at Fair Park, site of the annual State Fair of Texas, for a Junior League crafts fair last fall when one woman suddenly collapsed with what people took to be a heart attack. When she was taken to a hospital, it turned out she had been hit in the ankle by a stray bullet, apparently from a low-income area nearby.
Sometimes, the problems show up in the growing acrimony of racial politics in places like Milwaukee and Dallas. Black officials in both cities, citing the growing decay and despair in the city's black districts, have recently raised the specter of the kind of urban violence that convulsed the nation in the 1960's.
More often there is the sense, even by those like a writer from Austin, Tex., who describes the problems of the ghetto poor as "a storm in another county," that something has gone terribly wrong in American life and that it is diminishing both those who are at the bottom and those who are not.
"There has to be some kind of hope restored," said Charles Norman, director of field operations for Community Youth Gang Services, the largest non-law-enforcement organization dealing with gangs in Los Angeles County. "Hopeless people are very dangerous."
 
Some Neighborhoods Thrive
 In Chicago, where strong neighborhood identities have blunted much of the sense of urban decline, the downtown area remains the hottest real estate market in the metropolitan area. Even in New York, a surge of immigration -- Russian Jews, Haitians, Dominicans, Vietnamese -- is bringing the promise of new vitality to some sections of the city even as some other sections continue to decline.
But evidence is strong that in general America's cities are continuing a long, slow decline.
Larry Long, a demographer and sociologist with the Census Bureau says that a few years ago researchers wanted to know whether gentrification indicated a lasting return of the middle class to urban America.
"Now everyone is asking the same question in reverse," he said, wondering whether the decline of the cities is accelerating.
 
Much Depends on Cities
 In the end, some experts say, what is at stake is not just the health of cities, but the urban sensibilities and values that have shaped the nation's culture.
Kevin Starr, a professor of urban and regional planning at the University of Southern California, says that in the Middle Ages the city was said to represent the "plenum mundi," the pulse of the world. One thing that seems to have drained out of American politics is a sense of cities as organs whose health is essential to the survival of the social body.
"If cities are the matrices of our civilization, if our great ideas, our intellectual and moral consciousness comes from there," Mr. Starr said, "then woe and betide us if we have a national policy to let our cities become scenes from 'Escape from New York' or 'Blade Runner,' the city of dreadful night. You can't have a policy that lets cities decline, because in the decline of cities comes the decline of everything."

HEADLINE: F.T.C. Is Re-Emerging As Watchdog on Prices

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
The Federal Trade Commission, slowly emerging from the laissez-faire attitude of the Reagan Administration, is starting to use its antitrust muscles and renew its interest in cases that affect the public's pocketbook.
The agency has begun to challenge manufacturers that seek to limit price discounting by retailers and is also investigating the possibility that makers of infant formula colluded to set prices. The number of cases involving false and deceptive advertising, another area regulated by the agency, is also up. 
 "There is a new vigor and commitment at the agency," said Michael Pertschuk, a commission member from 1974 to 1984 who is co-director of the Advocacy Institute, a public interest group in Washington. "This infant-formula investigation might have been brought under the Reagan Administration, but the economists at the F.T.C. then would have figured out why price fixing is good for consumers."
 
Inquiries in Other Areas
 In the formula case, the agency subpoenaed the records of all leading makers of infant formula after state welfare officials and consumer groups complained that the manufacturers had raised prices in a uniform way over the past decade.
Although the infant-formula case has attracted the most attention, the agency has undertaken a number of other efforts, including these:
*It recently settled the first retail price-fixing case in eight years, and an inquiry is expected to result soon in a call for action against the United States subsidiary of Nintendo, the Japanese producer of video games, over its sales policies.
*In the first deceptive-advertising case since 1985 to be brought against an advertising agency, the F.T.C. challenged television commercials for a toy manufacturer that said -- erroneously -- that a doll could twirl on its own.
*The agency has filed a growing number of consumer-protection lawsuits, including the first involving a "900" telephone number.
Just how aggressive the agency will become under the Bush Administration is uncertain, but Janet D. Steiger, who was appointed F.T.C. chairwoman in August 1989, is getting much of the credit for the agency's new mood. Mrs. Steiger is also moving to coordinate Federal and state consumer-protection actions, something that did not happen often during the Reagan years.
"This Administration has begun the process of improving relationships," said Robert Abrams, the New York State Attorney General.
 
'Nowhere to Go but Up'
 But some public-interest advocates are not impressed. "The F.T.C. had nowhere to go but up," said Bruce Silverglade, legal director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington. "But in terms of activism, it has not turned around like the Environmental Protection Agency or the Food and Drug Administration."
Whatever the case, the F.T.C. that greeted Mrs. Steiger had lost virtually half of its staff and nearly a third of its budget in the 1980's. Some enforcement also declined under James C. Miller 3d, who was chairman from 1981 to 1985, and his successor, Daniel Oliver, both advocates of a laissez-faire approach.
A 1989 American Bar Association report found that approach translated into effects. "Too rarely has the public received the message that the F.T.C. believes it is important to move aggressively against false and deceptive advertising," that report stated.
In an interview, Mrs. Steiger described herself much as others do, not as an ideologue but as a bureaucrat who can be expected to take a middle course. "I want this to be a judicious enforcement agency that is interested in the public's health and welfare," she said.
 
Focusing on Retail Prices
 In her first 18 months, Mrs. Steiger has already overseen changes in the agency's attitude in one antitrust area: efforts by manufacturers to prevent retailers from discounting products below minimum prices.
During the Reagan years, some Administration economists argued that this form of price fixing was not illegal and could even help consumers because excessive discounting by retailers might reduce customer service.
But F.T.C. officials are now taking a different view. They recently settled a suit against Kreepy Krauly U.S.A., a Florida-based producer of swimming pool cleaners, after charging that the company had illegally entered into a written agreement with dealers in which the dealers agreed to maintain suggested retail prices. And investigators plan to recommend that the agency file a complaint against the American subsidiary of Nintendo into the possibility that the company is trying to keep its prices artifically high, said a person at the F.T.C. who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The agency may also move to expand its antitrust powers. In the infant-formula investigation, for instance, it is relying on a relatively new antitrust theory that holds that actions other than traditional written or spoken agreements may constitute price fixing or improper division of markets.
"You don't have to sit around in a room together conspiring," said Kelly Signs, a lawyer on the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust, Monopolies and Business Rights, which held hearings on infant-formula pricing in May. "If a business, for example, relies on information supplied by competitors to set prices rather than doing it independently, that could be a problem."
 
A Theory Is Tried Out
 In 1979, the F.T.C. invoked this theory of antitrust for the only time when it sued several petrochemical companies over similar practices in the sale of gasoline additives. But in 1984, a Federal judge dismissed the suit, saying the F.T.C. could not prove its claim.
Some of the agency's aggressiveness on antitrust matters is spilling over into the area of advertising. Over the past 18 months, the number of enforcement actions involving deceptive-advertising claims is up about 40 percent, said Joel Winston, the agency's assistant director for advertising practices. Also, for the first time in six years, the F.T.C recently brought charges against an advertising agency.
In that complaint, the commission accused Lewis Galoob Toys Inc., a San Francisco-based manufacturer, and its advertising agency, Towne, Silverstein, Rotter Inc., of producing television commercials that falsely implied, among other things, that a toy doll could twirl without human assistance. In settling the case, the companies, which admitted no wrongdoing, agreed not to make deceptive claims in the future.
Mark Silbergeld, legislative director of Consumers Union, said his group, whose 1989 complaint initiated the Galoob investigation, was pleased with the F.T.C.'s handling of it.
Over all, the number of consumer-protection complaints filed by the F.T.C. the past two years virtually equals the number filed in the previous four years, agency statistics show.
 
Hostility Is Recalled
 F.T.C. officials are also mending fences with state attorneys general. In the late 1980's, these state officials, moving to fill what they saw as a Federal regulatory void, began coordinating the filing of consumer-protection lawsuits against airlines, car-rental companies and others. F.T.C. officials accused their state counterparts of trying to usurp Federal powers.
"There was a lot of hostility" said Linley E. Pearson, the Indiana Attorney General. Now, Mr. Pearson and others credit Mrs. Steiger for healing that rift. Unlike her predecessors, those officials said, she actively courts their views and has worked to coordinate Federal and state actions. One example: a joint investigation into claims by companies that their products are environmentally beneficial.
But the agency's wheels still grind very slowly. The infant-formula investigation, for example, is in its eighth month. And Mrs. Steiger said in Congressional testimony last July that the F.T.C. was looking into advertisements for alcoholic beverages aimed at minors. But she declined in an interview to comment on the progress of that inquiry.
F.T.C. officials argue that such delays are not unusal. But Mr. Miller said that Mrs. Steiger's tenure may produce more rhetoric than change. "I would characterize any difference as one of style rather than any substantive shift in philosophy," said Mr. Miller, who is chairman of Citizens for a Sound Economy, an advocacy group.
The F.T.C.'s future is by no means in Mrs. Steiger's hands alone. A majority of the agency's five commissioners must approve major actions, and the views of Deborah K. Owen and Roscoe B. Starek 3d, the two other commissioners appointed by President Bush, are largely unknown. Both remaining Reagan appointees, Mary Azcuenaga and Andrew J. Strenio Jr., are well regarded by public interest advocates and the business community alike.
For her part, Mrs. Steiger appears resolute on more changes: "The record will have to speak for itself."

HEADLINE: A.T.&T. Is Hoping To Lease Out Space At Its Headquarters

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company is trying to lease out most of the space in its headquarters at 550 Madison Avenue and planning to shift its employees to less expensive office space elsewhere in New York City.
Walter Murphy, a spokesman for the nation's largest telecommunications company, said last night that the building, between 55th and 56th Streets, would remain its headquarters. He said employees would be moved only if a large tenant or tenants were found. 
 If A.T.& T. succeeds with its plan, it will have to return to New York City about $16 million in tax abatements.
The plan to lease the building has been rumored in real-estate circles for months and was reported today in Crain's New York Business.
 
The Sole Occupant
 The headquarters, designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee, is sometimes called the Chippendale skyscraper for its pediment resembling the top of an 18th century highboy.
A.T.& T. has 1,300 employees in the 35-story building and is the sole occupant. The leasing plan would put more than 600,000 square feet of office space on the market. Given the depressed state of the Manhattan office market, it is not clear if the company will find a tenant at a rent it finds acceptable.
After construction began on the building in 1978, A.T.& T. received $26 million in local tax abatements for agreeing to maintain a substantial presence in the city. In 1987, in exchange for a continuation of the abatements, A.T.& T. promised to remain the sole tenant and to keep 1,000 employees in the building. If A.T.& T. breaks that agreement, it will have to repay the city as much as $16 million, Mr. Murphy said.
Jeanne Nathan, a spokeswoman for Sally Hernandez-Pinero, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, said last night, "A.T.&T. has assured us that they would honor their obligation to return any taxes due us should they lease the building, and that any employees that leave the building would be placed elsewhere in the city."

HEADLINE: Dispute Over Lease Threatens a Musical

BYLINE: By C. GERALD FRASER

 BODY:
The producers of the long-running black musical "Mama, I Want to Sing" say they will close the show on March 30, the eighth anniversary of its opening.
The decision to close "Mama" follows years of wrangling between the producer and the New York City Government. At issue is the right of Reach Productions, the producer, to use the Heckscher Theater on Fifth Avenue at 104th Street, which is in a building set aside for nonprofit organizations. 
 "Mama, I Want to Sing" has been running at the Heckscher Theater since 1983. In its first five years the show grossed $25 million, and in 1988 it earned $8.7 million. Companies have toured the United States and performed in Japan and Turkey. A sequel has been playing in repertory at the Heckscher since March.
The producers' lawyer, Paul Batista, said his clients, Vy Higginsen and Ken Wydro, have a lease that went into effect in 1984 and is valid for the run of the play.
 
'I Have Just Had Enough'
 Both sides presented arguments on Jan. 7 in the Appellate Term of State Supreme Court on the validity of that lease, which the city contends is month-to-month, and await a decision. The city appealed a 1989 verdict by Judge Carol H. Arber that Mr. Batista said upheld the producers' right to rent the theater and affirmed the sublease from the prime tenant, the East Harlem Arts and Education Complex.
A decision has not yet been handed down, but Ms. Higginsen said, "I have just had enough."
"I surrender," she said. "I give up. I accept the fact that they don't want us in this theater. I couldn't accept this for years. I couldn't see why anyone would want to put people out of work. I have stopped asking why."
Ms. Higginsen said she obtained her lease legally and with the city's full knowledge of her profit-making status. She said that the theater had been empty for 15 years before she took her production into it and that the musical has brought significant economic benefit to the surrounding neighborhood.
She also said: "We have no air-conditioning in the summer. The ceiling is falling down. There are not sufficient bathrooms, and there are leaks."
Barbara J. Fife, the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Development, said she had been familiar with the issue since she was in the Manhattan Borough President's office. "The building is used for nonprofits," Ms. Fife said, and Ms. Higginsen's production, she said, "is not nonprofit."
Ms. Fife added, however, that her office hoped to negotiate an agreement between Reach Productions and the city's Department of Real Property that would allow the show to stay at the Heckscher for five more years. "She can operate with stability and then leave," Ms. Fife said.
But Ms. Higginsen, who wrote the musical with Mr. Wydro, to whom she is married, said: "I can't continue to do business under this threat of eviction. And this threat has been relentless."

Within Our Means
The Struggle for Economic Recovery After a Reckless Decade
By Alfred L. Malabre Jr.
Illustrated. 167 pages. Random House. $21.
Four years ago, Alfred L. Malabre Jr. published a book called "Beyond Our Means: How America's Long Years of Debt, Deficits and Reckless Borrowing Now Threaten to Overwhelm Us." It foresaw an economic hurricane producing three possible results: the kind of hyperinflation that Germany experienced in the 1920's, or the sort of radical disinflation America had in the 1930's, or, most likely of all, flat-out socialism. Reviewers turned purple with panic, and rushed to stuff their money in mattresses. 
 Now four years later, Mr. Malabre, who is an editor and columnist for The Wall Street Journal, has written another jeremiad called "Within Our Means: The Struggle for Economic Recovery After a Reckless Decade." It foresees an economic hurricane, but, well, uh, maybe there's time to tie the furniture down and tape the windows. Hyperinflation or deflation are still possibilities. (Socialism seems to have blown out to sea.) Yet now, Mr. Malabre writes: "The United States will probably be spared such Draconian punishment, but something close to it is entirely possible, for the American economy, as this book will document, is far sicker than it should be after so many years of recession-free growth."
What happened in the interval between the two books to make Mr. Malabre lighten his dark forebodings? The world neglected to come to an end. The stock market crashed but recovered. It is as if Mr. Malabre had been an actor onstage and someone backstage had missed his cue. Mr. Malabre stamped his foot and called for molten lava and a plague of frogs, and -- stamp! -- nothing happened. Stamp! Nothing. Well, maybe he had better improvise. So improvise is what he sets out to do in "Within Our Means." The trouble is, he never really finds his theme.
He starts out seeming to promise a prescription for our woes. He explains that if the first book's title, "Beyond Our Means," held the double meaning that it was beyond our means to stop living beyond our means, the title of his new book also has two meanings: It is within our means to learn to live within our means, "though the task will entail some self-inflicted pain -- higher taxes, less Federal largess, tighter regulation of business activity."
But having suggested that his book will be prescriptive, he spends five out of his six chapters detailing our problems again. Numbingly detailing our problems. Every reader knows the litany: the annual budget deficits, the huge national debt, the negative balance of trade, the lack of productivity, the mounting private debt, the dependence on foreign investment, the savings-and-loan crisis, the downturn in the business cycle. These things have been described before, not only by Mr. Malabre. For all their reality, they've become boring to read about.
And then in the last chapter, "Looking Ahead," Mr. Malabre equivocates. At various points, he writes the following sentences: "The road ahead will be rough." "There are a few bright spots." "Hope springs eternal, but it is difficult in such circumstances to believe that very deep trouble can in fact be avoided." "But it is not beyond our means to weather it and move on, through more sensible behavior to sounder prosperity." One begins to long for that hurricane.
And what is his prescription for the incurable disease from which we may be recovering? Are you ready? Higher taxes and reduced Federal spending. He concludes: "A greater effort must be made to attract able people to Washington." "Congres sional operations also need an overhaul." "A smaller budget deficit would reduce the Treasury's need to borrow, which would help lower interest rates and free funds to invest more in productive facilities and less in simply helping the Treasury roll over its debt. This in turn would serve to improve U.S. competitiveness and thus strengthen the nation's trade balance." Yes. And if chickens had teeth they would chew bubble gum.
Mr. Malabre's two books teach one invaluable lesson. It is dangerous to speculate about what lies ahead. Events have a way of undermining one's expectations. Mr. Malabre writes: "It is also time, with the Cold War over, that wherever possible foreign aid of a largely military nature be sharply curtailed. The largest recipient by far is Israel, which receives some $3 billion in aid from the United States each year. With such Soviet clients in the Middle East as Syria receiving far less aid from the U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe, there is no reason for the United States not to cut back as well. But to do so would . . . require political courage." Also maybe a loss of touch with reality.
Whatever happens to the crisis in the American economy, if crisis is indeed the state that it is now in, the outcome will most likely surprise us. It has been said over and over that those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it. But economic events result from the behavior of people who remember the past all too well. The sum of their memories is unique, because each new generation remembers what none has remembered before, and so the consequences of its behavior must be unique. We cannot predict it; we can only blindly guess.
Mr. Malabre can stamp his foot or patiently explain. He can announce that now is when "the defense sector offers large cost-cutting opportunities." He can predict: "Cutting the tax rate on capital gains would also raise the incentive to save, making it more attractive for investors to put money into assets offering the potential for long-term growth. . . ." But whatever happens in the future will only make sense in retrospect.

HEADLINE: ABROAD AT HOME;
A Sense Of Proportion

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
U.S. and allied planes have flown 11,000 combat missions so far against Iraqi targets. But air bombardment will not be enough, intelligence officials say. The 500,000 troops massed in Saudi Arabia, most of them American, will have to go into action on the ground. The fighting may go on for months.
This enormous war effort is necessary, President Bush says, to achieve a "new world order." 
 But as our attention is on the gulf war, something else is happening. In Moscow and Vilnius and Riga, the hopes of democracy and freedom are slipping away. The Soviet Union is moving rapidly back toward repression: a militarized form of the totalitarian state.
The headlines have been dwarfed by the war with Kuwait, the television coverage glancing. But think what has happened in the last two weeks.
* Soviet soldiers have shot and killed 19 civilians in Lithuania and Latvia.
* The Soviet Government has ordered armed soldiers to join the police in patrolling all major cities in the country.
* President Gorbachev has granted sweeping powers to the K.G.B. and the police to search private businesses -- foreign as well as domestic -- and to freeze their assets.
Those ominous actions have been accompanied by ominous rhetoric. Soviet military officers describe the elected government of Lithuania as "fascist." Secret "Committees for National Salvation" ask for presidential rule of the Baltic states -- as Czech Stalinists invited Warsaw Pact forces to crush the Dubcek Government in 1968.
Mikhail Gorbachev's position is still something of a mystery. He has not so far imposed presidential rule on the Baltics. He told the foreign press that events there were "tragic."
But what is clear is that Mr. Gorbachev is more and more relying on the new Soviet right, and deferring to it. Made up of military officers, K.G.B. leaders and Communist bureaucrats, it is deeply conservative and xenophobic. It fears economic reform, private enterprise and foreign investment. It denounces "bourgeois" ideology and demands a return to "Socialist" central control.
The right is deeply suspicious of the United States. Some question Mr. Gorbachev's joining American policy in the Persian Gulf, saying that it will lead to American domination there and will menace the U.S.S.R. A key right-wing figure, Col. Victor Alksnis, has denounced what he called Soviet "appeasement" in the gulf.
The trend of events in the Soviet Union must be of the deepest concern to President Bush, and to all of us. But the American Government's capacity to address the problem has been compromised by Mr. Bush's decision to go to war against Iraq.
Mr. Bush has criticized the shootings in Vilnius and Riga. He will probably postpone the summit meeting scheduled for next month. What more could he do to protest Soviet developments?
What he could do is to deal directly with the crucial immediate issue: the three Baltic republics. The United States has never recognized the Soviet takeover of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in 1940. Nor, lately, has it directly encouraged their claims to renewed independence -- a cautious policy that seemed to me wise.
But the cynicism and brutality of recent Soviet military actions in the Baltics require a reappraisal of our policy. How can we just wring our hands when we see what looks like the development of an internal Brezhnev Doctrine, the use of armed force to suppress freedom in the republics? Today it is Lithuania; tomorrow it would be Georgia or the Ukraine or Russia.
There are no easy answers for the United States in the chaos now overtaking the Soviet Union. But President Bush should be forcefully protesting the repression in Lithuania and Latvia. He should be talking with those who are struggling for democracy in Vilnius and Riga and Moscow. But he cannot when he so urgently needs Soviet support for his policy in the Persian Gulf.
Mr. Bush is obsessed by the gulf crisis. He told David Frost that there has been "nothing like this since World War II. Nothing of this moral importance." As Haynes Johnson wrote in The Washington Post, Mr. Bush was saying: Not the Marshall Plan, not the cold war, not Korea, not Vietnam. Nothing to equal this conflict.
Mr. Bush and his Administration have lost their sense of proportion in this war. And if the Soviet Union goes down the road to darkness, they will have lost their new world order, too.

HEADLINE: The Killing Fields Aren't Level

 BODY:
Close to 30 percent of the Army's troops in Operation Desert Storm are black, though blacks are just 14 percent of the nation's population between the ages of 18 and 24. In a land war, black casualties will be similarly disproportionate. Is it fair? Is it inevitable? For answers, one must search the soul of American society.
Gen. Colin Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and a black, has pointed out that it is "simply a given" that any group suffers in proportion to its presence in the fighting force. Rejecting charges that the proportion of blacks is unfair, he says he's "proud that African-Americans have seen fit to volunteer to join the armed forces." 
 From World War II through Vietnam, most U.S. servicemen were drafted, the armed forces were larger, and minority representation was in closer proportion to the population. Today's all-volunteer system replaced the draft in 1973.
A big pay hike and cash benefits for education have raised the caliber of enlistments. More than 90 percent of recent recruits are high school graduates -- far higher than the national percentage or the percentage for draftees in the past. According to the Pentagon, the average G.I.'s socio-economic background is slightly below average for his age group, but -- nonpartisan analysts agree -- he is not a dropout from society. Still, blacks are more likely to enlist than whites. Almost 21 percent of U.S. forces worldwide are black; the figure is higher in the gulf because of large Army and Marine contingents.
Clifford Alexander, a black who was Secretary of the Army in the 1970's, explained the imbalance at the time in a few pointed words: "(Ask) why there is almost 40 percent unemployment among black teen-agers before you ask why they enlist or why they re-up." Their jobless rate is still above 30 percent, and the point endures: the military offers blacks more opportunities than life on the outside.
Once laggard, the military is now a leading force for integration. General Powell has said that before the gulf crisis, some blacks complained that planned cutbacks in the armed forces would hurt them, but "now I'm sort of getting the reverse, that perhaps they're overrepresented."
While the attractions are real -- rewarding career, education, escape or proud service -- they do not match the risk to life itself. Army recruiters don't advertise it. Casualty lists will tell it loud and clear. But life at home holds terror, too. Listen to a 19-year-old black who enlisted in Los Angeles last month: "It's nothing out there in the streets for you but trouble. I don't want to die at a young age getting caught up in the gang thing."
The Brookings Institution's Martin Binken, an authority on military service, says equal representation under current conditions is next to impossible; unless black enlistments were barred, the services would have to expand considerably, enlisting or drafting enough whites to balance the blacks, taking men now rejected. And blacks would still sustain more casualties than whites, because men with less schooling get low-skill duty, which includes combat.
The disproportion is unfair on its face. Tragically, it may be almost inevitable -- rooted in unequal opportunity. America owes its minorities a better chance, as offered by the job rights bill that President Bush vetoed last year. Meanwhile, despite the indignities they suffer in civilian life, or perhaps because of them, blacks in the military serve their nation with honor -- disproportionately.

HEADLINE: Americans Should Buy a Bit More American;
Their Surplus Dollars

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Buy American. American What?" (editorial, Jan. 12) criticizes Manuel Lujan, Secretary of the Interior, for advocating that we buy American cars. You argue that by buying foreign-made products we put dollars in the hands of our trading partners to buy our products. This is partly true. 
 Some of our trading partners (Japan and Germany) enjoy huge trade surpluses with the United States. They have plenty of dollars to buy our soybeans, commercial jetliners and computers. With their surplus dollars, however, they buy our real estate and corporations and build new factories in the United States.
The United States, with its year-after-year trade deficits, can only finance those deficits by selling assets such as a quarter of downtown Los Angeles, most of Honolulu, corporations in the entertainment business and the best golf courses.
The trade deficit is equal to the difference between what we save and what we invest. All Americans would do well to heed Mr. Lujan's advice. Narrowing the trade deficit would produce more jobs and increase investment at home. If continued trade deficits are so desirable, as you imply, why don't Japan and Germany alter their economic policies so that they can enjoy the rewards of massive trade deficits? Until a more compelling argument is made than you give, I'll stick with Mr. Lujan's advice and buy American.

HEADLINE: Brief History of an Earlier Antiwar Group

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Half-Century Later, F.B.I. Doesn't Forget" (letter, Dec. 29) contains serious errors about the American League for Peace and Democracy. The organization was not "founded by clergymen to keep the United States from entering World War II," was not infiltrated by Communists, nor was it dissolved overnight when Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, and "the party line reversed itself." 
 It was founded as the American League Against War and Fascism in September 1933, six years before war broke out in Europe, as part of an international movement headed by the French author Henri Barbusse to prevent war following Hitler's takeover of Germany that year.
Although prominent religious leaders, including Dr. Reinhold Niebuhr of Union Theological Seminary and Rabbi Israel Goldstein of the Social Justice Commission, Rabbinical Assembly of America, were among the original supporters, they were part of a coalition at the founding meeting in New York City that included representatives of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, the Fellowship of Reconciliation, the War Resisters League, the Women's Peace Society, the Socialist-led League for Industrial Democracy, several labor unions, organizations of the unemployed and the Communist Party, whose leader, Earl Browder, addressed that gathering along with the pacifists A. J. Muste and Devere Allen, William Pickens, field secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and the union leader Emil Rieve. Plainly, there was no need for Communist infiltration. While some of the original supporters dropped away, others, especially labor unions after the founding of the C.I.O. in 1936, joined in its activities.
The American League for Peace and Democracy held its last meeting, in Philadelphia, in December 1939. Hitler's armies invaded the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941.
I regret that the letter writer feels it necessary to withhold signing his name half a century after he joined an organization dedicated to fighting Hitlerism and war, because of which his son was denied the right to wear a Navy uniform. Meanwhile, organizations seeking to persuade the Federal Bureau of Investigation to release uncensored copies of the mountainous lists it set up in those tragic times when the fundamental rights of Americans were severely restricted run into an impenetrable wall.
I was national youth secretary throughout most of the American League for Peace and Democracy's existence. Dr. Harry F. Ward, professor of Christian Ethics at Union Theological Seminary, was the League's national chairman.

HEADLINE: Manhattan Bridge Had a Design Load Problem From the Start;
And Scrap the Tolls

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Jonathan Lang's idea in "Scrap Transit Fares" (Op-Ed, Dec. 29) can be extended to the highway transportation mess caused by the archaic system of tolls on highway bridges and tunnels. Delays in traffic caused by toll booths damage the economy and quality of life of the region: increased travel time; increases by millions of dollars in the cost of doing business; air pollution and fuel consumption caused by millions of hours of idling motors.
The revenue collected by tolls could equally and more efficiently be collected through a moderate increase in state motor fuel taxes in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
History shows the rise and fall of an economy parallels its transportation facilities.

Dynamic Advocate; Nadine Strossen

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
The founding principles of the American Civil Liberties Union come to life in the family history of Nadine Strossen, its newly elected president.
She remembers her parents' stories of her maternal grandfather, a recent immigrant from Italy, who endured public ridicule by local officials for refusing to fight in World War I. The A.C.L.U. started about the same time, established in part to defend dissenters from government attacks on free expression. 
 "Because he was a conscientious objector, he was made to stand up against the courthouse so people could spit on him," she recalled, moments after her election on Saturday as the civil liberties union's first female president. "I had a strong sense of individual rights and sticking one's neck out on behalf of unpopular causes, even at the risk of personal ostracism."
 
Interest in First Amendment
 Members of the A.C.L.U. called Ms. Strossen a dynamic spokeswoman and an astute constitutional scholar with a keen interest in the First Amendment. In interviews and a seemingly nonstop schedule of debates and speeches, she talks about the group's work with an enthusiasm that blends plainspokenness and sophistication.
"I think this is the most important organization in the country, if not the world," she said. "To say what we're doing is controversial is to say the Bill of Rights is controversial. I want to emphasize the American in American Civil Liberties Union."
Sam Walker, an A.C.L.U. board member and author of a recent history of the group, said of Ms. Stossen: "She really believes this stuff. It's not just campaign rhetoric."
Ms. Strossen, a 40-year-old professor of constitutional law, Federal courts and human rights at New York Law School, has served the A.C.L.U. as a board member in 1983 and as general counsel since 1986. She taught at Columbia and New York University law schools and practiced commercial litigation at several New York firms.
 
Planned 'Traditional' Career
 Born in Jersey City on Aug. 18, 1950, Nadine Strossen moved with her family to Hopkins, Minn., when she was 8 years old after her father, an oil company executive, was transferred. Her father, Woodrow J. Strossen, emigrated to the United States after American troops liberated him from a German labor camp, where he had been imprisoned for anti-Hitler activities. He later changed his first name to Woodrow, in honor of President Woodrow Wilson.
Although Ms. Strossen said she planned on a "traditional" woman's career like teaching or graduate school, her involvement in debating and feminist groups while at Radcliffe College sparked an interest in law. "I met women lawyers in women's issues and that gave me a sense of confidence," she said. She attended Harvard Law School, where she was editor of the Law Review and graduated magna cum laude in 1975.
Noting that the A.C.L.U. has long addressed issues like reproductive rights and sexual equality, some observers said Ms. Strossen's victory was a greater shift not for the organization but for the legal profession. "It's the coming of maturity of women who entered law school in the 70's," said Sylvia A. Law, a professor and co-director of a civil liberties program at New York University Law School.
A.C.L.U. officials said her election sent a signal that the organization is committed to affirmative action.
Feminists have criticized the A.C.L.U., saying it had too few influential women, but Ms. Strossen said her election could help underscore the organization's commitment to women's rights. She noted that the A.C.L.U. has been responsible for 80 percent of all Federal cases involving reproductive rights.
When she assumes the presidency on Feb. 1, Ms. Strossen will inherit an organization that has grown to a membership at 300,000 and that includes projects on issues like abortion rights, censorship, capital punishment and workers' rights. She expects that the war in the Persian Gulf will revive traditional challenges to dissent, conscientious objectors, foreigners and the media.
"There are tremendous assaults on civl liberties people are wiling to accept as part of a wartime mentality," she said.
But she is also concerned about another conflict, one that will continue after the last bullet has been fired: the nation's war on drugs, which she believes has imposed limits on basic freedoms in the pursuit of public safety.
Although many board members said the national organization is stronger than ever, Ms. Strossen said she wants to enhance the vitality of its local affiliates, helping them with fund-raising and public education efforts. "That's where civil liberties are implemented," she said. "It's one thing for the Supreme Court to decide something and another for a local school board to abide by it."
Those efforts will help, she said, because the group's defense of unpopular causes like pornography or the rights of neo-Nazis to demonstrate has been misunderstood by the public and by an increasingly conservative Federal judiciary.
Reflecting her personal interest in human rights, she said she wanted to explore ways of applying international human rights laws to issues before state courts like gay rights and capital punishment. She wants to expand the A.C.L.U.'s outreach, establishing chapters not only at colleges, but also in high schools, where disputes over censorship and minors' right to abortion have put them "on the cutting edge" of civil liberties.
She lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan with her husband of 10 years, Eli M. Noam, an economist and lawyer who teaches at the Graduate School of Business at Columbia Univeristy. A former member of the Public Service Commission, Mr. Noam also directs the university's Center for Telecommunications and Information Studies.

Review of California's Debt May Result in Downgrading

 BODY:
The ever-thinning ranks of triple-A-rated states may soon lose another if the Standard & Poor's Corporation lowers the rating of California's general obligation debt.
Standard & Poor's announced yesterday that it had placed under review for possible downgrading some $11.6 billion in California general obligation bonds as a result of a rapidly developing deficit that is projected for the fiscal years 1991 and 1992. 
 The rating agency said it was also placing under review about $3 billion of debt issued by state agencies, whose ratings are guaranteed or supported by state appropriations.
S.& P. noted that the state's economic growth, while still stronger than that of most of the nation, slowed strikingly in the second half of 1990. General fund revenues on a $42 billion budget are expected to be $2 billion less than those of the state's most recent forecast, made in November.
"Historically, budget reserves have been more than adequate against shifting economic conditions," the agency said. "But the current shortfall will eradicate reserves and leave the state with a 1991 deficit approaching $1.8 billion."
Analysts at S.& P. plan to review the situation during the months leading up to the next formal revenue forecast in May, waiting to see whether the state government takes action to reduce the projected deficits for 1991 and 1992. In the absence of a rapid economic recovery, failure to address the budget gaps will result in a rating in the double-A category, the agency said.
Moody's Investors Service, which rates California's general obligation debt Aaa, does not have the outstanding debt under review.

HEADLINE: Careers;
Marketing Holds Up In Recession

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
ADVERTISING spending is down and there have been many layoffs and forced retirements in the field, but demand for corporate marketing executives continues strong, according to Miles L. McKie, a managing director in the Chicago office of Russell Reynolds, the management recruiting firm.
As a general rule during a recession, many companies cut their advertising spending to save money, Mr. McKie said in a telephone interview last week. 
 "My contacts with senior executives indicate it is no different in this recession," he said. "But the interesting aspect is that there is currently a continuing strong demand by corporations for experienced marketing executives, with good credentials."
"Also, I would call this a bicoastal recession, not a heartland recession, such as we had a few years ago," he said, noting that job losses tended to be heaviest in the Northeast and on the Pacific Coast. For example, recruiting for financial and accounting executives is down sharply in Eastern cities like Boston and New York and in major West Coast cities, but demand for manufacturing executives has held up well, especially in the Midwest, he said.
"Having said all this about the recession, I do see some companies spending more to build their market share," he said, adding that the focus is on upgrading marketing staffs. One indication is that the demand for marketing executives has not changed during the last 12 months, despite the recession. "It seems to go from strength to strength," he said.
"We are doing consumer-driven searches for senior vice presidents and down the ranks through directors of marketing," he said, "and I think there is demand at lower levels, too. In other words, the recession has not affected demand."
The demand is coming from basic consumer-oriented companies like food producers and other packaged-goods companies as well as service organizations, he said.
He said that hiring skilled, creative marketers was one way for large companies, intent on gaining market share, to upgrade their staffs. "Now, especially for the top spots, companies demand marketers with service-company experience, such as with airlines, financial services and hotels, in addition to or instead of packaged-goods experience." he said.
While advertising expenses have been cut sharply, companies have been using their in-house marketing staffs to increase sales-promotion efforts, like dealer incentives, coupons, samples, rebates, advertising on supermarket carts and special sales. The marketing staffs often work with consumer-promotion companies. "My observation is that the outside consumer-promotion companies like to hire people out of their client companies rather than from advertising agencies," Mr. McKie said.
He noted, however, that "it is well recognized that companies cannot build permanent market share just on sales-promotion efforts." Temporary sales promotions do not buy long-term loyalty, but advertising does, he said.
Some insight into the current situation for marketing executives comes from Lee Hecht Harrison, an outplacement firm. It has just issued its latest quarterly booklet of resumes of job-seeking executives.
First offered in June 1989, the list then had a few pages of brief anonymous descriptions of the talents of middle managers seeking new jobs through the firm. Now it has evolved into the Directory of Executive Talent, a 60-page booklet published quarterly, with brief descriptive paragraphs about 360 middle managers seeking jobs. The increase in the number of job seekers indicates the tough times facing middle managers who have been dismissed.
The firm sends out 5,000 copies of the quarterly to corporations and to management recruiting firms, both of which can request full resumes from executives on the list.
Among the listings in the directory, about 13 percent are marketing executives, about the same percentage as in the previous directory published in September.
About 11 percent of the requests for resumes from the September issue were for marketing executives, said Penny J. Shaw, a senior vice president of the firm. She agreed that "a lot of upgrading is going on" as companies try to improve and strengthen their marketing staffs.
Based on the September issue, about 65 percent of the requests for resumes came from companies and 35 percent from search firms, she said. "That compares with about 50-50 when the directory first began," she added.
The new directory has been out only a few days, and so far there has not been enough time to measure the number of requests for resumes,
"The good news" Ms. Shaw said, "is that executves in our directory are finding jobs, although it takes them longer than it did a year ago."

HEADLINE: Affordable-Housing Owners Get a Tax Cut in New Jersey

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON Jan. 28

 BODY:
The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled today that owners of subsidized low- and moderate-income housing were entitled to reduced property taxes.
The court, in a 7-to-0 decision, upheld a lower-court ruling that said local tax assessors must recognize restrictions on the resale value of housing units designated as affordable and not tax them at full market value. 
 "There was a danger that families already living in low- and moderate-income housing units would no longer be able to afford it if the court had allowed towns to assess the units at full value," said Donald M. Palombi, a deputy attorney general representing the Council on Affordable Housing. "There would have been a lot of foreclosures."
 
Housing Is Mandatory
 In a series of rulings known as the Mount Laurel decisions starting in the early 1970's, the State Supreme Court said all municipalities must provide affordable housing opportunites for low- and moderate-income families.
Today's ruling stemmed from a decision in 1986 by the Village of Ridgefield Park inBergen County to assess its affordable housing at fair market value without recognizing deed restrictions that lowered the units' resale value.
The owners of two condominium units, whose resale value was limited to $46,000 but whose tax assessments exceeded $80,000, appealed. A state tax court ruled in favor of the municipality, but the Appellate Division of Superior Court overturned that ruling, and the Supreme Court today concurred.
Sidna B. Mitchell, a spokeswoman for the Council on Affordable Housing, said more than 7,500 housing units would be affected immediately by the ruling. Eventually, shesaid, if the state meets its goal, the owners of 145,000 affordable housing units will be covered.
Stephen Eisdorfer, an assistant public advocate, said only one other municipality, Peapack-Gladstone in Somerset County, had tried to assess units in a low- and moderate-income development for the elderly at full market value. The borough changed its mind after the Appellate Court decision in the Ridgefield Park case in 1989.
Today's Supreme Court decision settling the issue will not have a major impact on the tax structure in Ridgefield Park. The vil lage of about 12,000 residents has only four units that carry restrictions to ensure their sale to low- or moderate-income buyers.
Brian T. Campion, the lawyer for the two families who appealed their assessments, said his clients had paid the higher taxes of more than $1,000 a year while the appeal was being decided and would now be entitled to a partial refund.
 
A 'Burden' on Property
 The State Supreme Court did not write a majority opinion, instead adopting the Appellate Division ruling written by Judge Sylvia B. Pressler, who said, "The deed restriction limiting resale price constitutes a patent burden on the value of the property."
"It is, moreover, a restriction whose burden on the owner is clearly designed to secure a public benefit of overriding social and economic importance -- namely the maintenance of this state's woefully inadequate inventory of affordable housing."
Justice Gary S. Stein, filed a concurring opinion that supported Judge Pressler's analysis but expressed some concern that ownership of affordable housing units by families whose incomes had increased beyond the low- and moderate-income levels "could dilute the public purpose and benefit of the deed restriction."
Justice Stein said the problem might be "self correcting," since low-income families that experience significant income increases "may tend to seek better-quality housing."
But he recommended that state housing regulators re-examine their program to make sure the aim of insuring adequate supplies of affordable housing "is not frustrated by attrition."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Narrowly Mixed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were narrowly mixed in extremely listless trading yesterday, as bond prices inched higher and short-term notes moved a bit lower.
"The only news is that the market is holding, which is somewhat surprising in light of the fact that we have lots of supply to bid on soon," one government-bond trader said. 
 The Treasury is expected to announce tomorrow that it will sell between $34 billion and $35 billion worth of notes and bonds at its quarterly refunding auctions beginning Feb. 5.
Market participants largely ignored a report showing that personal consumption, which had lagged badly in the first two months of the fourth quarter, bounced back in December, rising by seven-tenths of a percent in the month.
 
Surprise for Analysts
 The report came as a surprise to some analysts. They said that based on the consumption figures, the odds that the economy would contract in the first quarter had been reduced.
"It is too early to make a prediction, but the assumption that G.N.P. is definitely going to be down in the first quarter has been shaken," said Raymond W. Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., research firm.
"Unless we see consumption start to contract again, the odds now seem to favor that first-quarter growth will be positive."
The consumption figures, in conjunction with last Friday's preliminary estimate that output in the economy fell at an annual rate of 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter, had a dampening impact on prices of short-term notes and bills.
Traders said the figures made it slightly less likely that the Federal Reserve Board would move to lower short-term interest rates when its policy-making Open Market Committee meets in Washington next week.
 
Higher Bill Rates
 Interest rates on new three-month and six-month Treasury bills auctioned yesterday moved higher, partly in response to the recent economic reports.
The new three-month bills were autioned at an average discount rate of 6.22 percent, up from an average rate of 6.14 percent at last week's sale.
Meanwhile, bids on new six-month bills produced an average discount rate of 6.28 percent, up from an average rate of 6.21 percent a week ago.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 105 31/32 late yesterday, up 1/8 point, to yield 8.20 percent, down from 8.22 percent late Friday.
Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 103 3/ 32, up 1/32, to yield 8.03 percent. And the 7 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 26/32, down 1/32, to yield 7.10 percent.
 
BankAmerica Notes
 In the investment-grade corporate bond market, the BankAmerica Corporation offered $100 million of new 12-year notes through an underwriting group led by Merrill Lynch & Company.
The 10 percent notes, which mature Dec. 1, 2003, are noncallable for life. They were priced at 99.85 to yield 10.022 percent, 1.97 percentage points higher than the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated A-3 by Moody's Investors Service and A- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Activity in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds was extremely light, traders said. However, they added that in the wake of Moody's ratings downgrade late Friday, bids on outstanding Citicorp securities fell by as much as 2 points.
"There is not that much trading of Citi paper," one corporate trader said.
As an example, the trader said that bids on an outstanding 9 percent Citicorp issue maturing in 1999 fell to $82 yesterday, to yield 12.53 percent. On Friday, the same securities were offered at $84, to yield 12 percent.
 
California Ratings Cut
 Activity in the tax-exempt municipal bond market was also very slow. Traders said they were trying to assess the impact of a move yesterday by Standard & Poor's to place the State of California on "credit watch," a step that could lead the agency to lower its current AAA rating on California securities.
Market participants said that bids on outstanding California general-obligation bonds fell by 1/2 point to 3/4 point after the Standard & Poor's announcement.
"The good news at the moment is that there are not a lot of California bonds around right now," one trader said. "But the Street is still confused about what this will mean."
California normally sells between $500 million and $700 million worth of securities every six weeks.
But traders said yesterday that because of the state's fiscal problems, there were rumors that California, which is expected to sell new bonds next month, might have to increase the size of its auctions to well over $1 billion.
Following are the results of yesterday's auctions of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Weicker Sees $1 Billion Rise In State Taxes

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 28

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. said today that he was prepared to cut the preliminary state budget for the next fiscal year by 10 percent but that Connecticut's shortfall in tax revenues was so large that residents faced $1 billion or more in new or higher taxes.
"Let's not tiptoe around on this -- that's the dimensions of the problem," he said at a news conference in his office. 
 Mr. Weicker, a former Republican who took office on Jan. 9 as a third-party governor, had declined until today to tip his hand in even a general way about how much might be needed in new taxes to close a budget gap that is projected to reach $2.2 billion over the next 17 months.
He still did not provide any specifics about what state programs might be cut or what taxes raised in the budget plan he is to present to the General Assembly on Feb. 20.
 
$850 Million in Cuts Identified
 He said $850 million to $900 million in cuts had been identified in the $8.6 billion preliminary budget for the fiscal year starting July 1. While most of the remaining $1.3 billion shortfall might take the form of new or higher taxes, he said, further cuts are being explored.
Connecticut, along with dozens of other states, has seen its tax collections, especially those from sales and corporate profit taxes, plummet in the recession. The sales and corporate taxes together provide more than 50 percent of the state's revenues.
Leaders of the Democratic majority in the General Assembly reacted cautiously to the Governor's announcement, with several saying his numbers were simply too vague to have much meaning. Republicans were less kind.
"I don't think that that kind of tax increase is at all reasonable," said the House minority leader, Edward C. Krawiecki Jr., a Republican from Bristol. "We're going to have a very long haul during this legislative cycle if those numbers are in fact the kinds of numbers that the Governor recommends on Feb. 20."
Mr. Weicker stressed in releasing the figures that discussions on the budget were continuing. He said, for example, that negotiations had yet to be completed with unions representing state employees about what their "part of the solution" will be in terms of pay or benefit concessions or possible layoffs. But he added that he would try to avoid wide layoffs that could make a bad economy even worse.
Mr. Weicker also repeated his opposition to borrowing money -- through the sale of state bonds, for example -- as even a partial solution to the problem. But he conceded that all revenue measures were still on the table and that "absolutely nothing" has been ruled out.
Connecticut's biggest single revenue source is its 8 percent sales tax. Budget estimates project that each percentage point increase would bring in only about $310 million toward filling the budget gap.
The second biggest source is the corporate profits tax, where each additional percentage point would be expected to bring in about $5.4 million. Both of those taxes are also already among the highest in the country.
 
Unexpected Announcement
 Mr. Weicker's announcement, which came unexpectedly at a routine question-and-answer session with reporters, did not shed any light on whether his budget plan would try to patch existing state finances or overhaul them by introducing an income tax on wages.
Connecticut is one of only 10 states that do not tax regular income, although it does tax money earned from dividends, interest and capital gains.
Some lawmakers, including the co-chairman of the Assembly's Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, Representative Richard T. Mulready, a Democrat from West Hartford, said they thought Mr. Weicker's tentative tax numbers were so high that an income tax might ultimately emerge as the only option.
 
Two Income-Tax Plans
 Mr. Mulready said his committee had already decided to consider an income-tax plan whether Mr. Weicker suggested one or not. Two proposals are under consideration, he said, one a flat wage tax of 5.75 percent on all income over $25,000 and one a graduated tax that would begin at 4 percent for income over $25,000 and rise to 8 percent for income over $100,000.
Both plans would generate about $2.5 billion in revenue, Mr. Mulready said, a figure that he said would allow the state to balance its budget and -- along with Mr. Weicker's $900 million in spending cuts -- still include $800 million in reductions in other taxes.
Mr. Krawiecki, the Republican minority leader, said he believed Mr. Weicker's preliminary numbers pointed down the wrong road for the state. He said the $900 million in cuts were not really cuts, but rather simply reductions from the "unreasonable and illogical" spending plans filed last year by agency heads working under Gov. William A. O'Neill, a Democrat.
Those budget plans called for a 21 percent increase in spending for the fiscal year that begins July 1. The cuts proposed today would reduce the total growth rate in the budget next year to 11 percent, Mr. Krawiecki said. He said Republicans would seek a growth rate that was closer to 5 percent.

HEADLINE: Credit Card Defaults Rise

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The number of Americans defaulting on credit card payments soared in November, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said yesterday.
"Charge-offs and delinquencies in each of the past few months have been considerably higher" than a year earlier, a Moody's economist, Andrew Silver, said. "We're starting to see the effects of a slowing economy and the high levels of debt accumulated by consumers in the 1980's."
In what Mr. Silver said was "another indication that households are having increasing difficulty making their monthly debt payments," the portion of total debt paid back by consumers slipped to 10.33 percent from 11.75 percent.
Credit card debts, like mortgages, are sold to investors in the form of bank-issued securities. In November, Moody's Aggregate Charge-off Index -- which tracks losses on these securities -- rose 49 percent over the previous year.
The index rose to 4.5 percent, from 3.03 perent in November 1989, the bond-rating agency said. Total delinquencies rose to 5.9 percent of debt outstanding, against 4.37 percent a year earlier.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Facing Heavy Losses, Tonka Seeks a Buyer

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: MINNETONKA, Minn., Jan. 28

 BODY:
The Tonka Corporation, the nation's third-largest toy maker, predicted substantial losses today for the fourth quarter and for 1990 and said it had been involved in talks about a possible sale of the company.
Tonka did not identify any potential buyer. The company said the discussions were preliminary. 
 Analysts said a sale of Tonka might be necessary because of its heavy debt load and expected losses. Tonka, maker of Tonka trucks and Play-Doh, took on $555 million in debt when it acquired Kenner Parker Toys Inc. in 1987.
Another toy maker, Lewis Galoob Toys Inc., said on Friday that it had retained Bear, Stearns & Company to explore financial alternatives, including the possible formation of "strategic alliances."
Citing slow retail sales, Galoob reiterated a forecast of a "significant loss" for the year. Galoob makes Micro Machines miniature vehicles.
News that its rivals were involved in possible buyout talks sent Tyco Toys Inc. stock higher, analysts said. Tyco makes the Ideal toy line. Its shares rose $1.625 today, to $10, in over-the-counter trading. On the New York Stock Exchange, Galoob fell 25 cents, to $3, and Tonka slipped 75 cents, to $4.375.
Analysts said it was unclear whether Hasbro Inc. and Mattel Inc., the largest and second-largest toy makers, respectively, would try to acquire Tonka. A Mattel spokesman would not comment, and a Hasbro representative could not be reached.
Carol Palmer, an analyst at Duff & Phelps, said Tonka's troubles stemmed partly from the economy and partly from the fact that it does not have a hit toy.
Tonka estimated its sales for 1990 would be about $786 million, down from $870.5 million in 1989. For the first nine months of 1990, Tonka reported a loss of $25.4 million, on sales of $541.3 million. For all of 1989, Tonka reported a profit of $7.7 million, or 90 cents a share.

HEADLINE: Spreading the Faith, and the Debate

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
Some people are calling it the "stealth" encyclical -- the long papal letter on missionary work that appeared last Tuesday with little advance notice and no English texts available in the United States.
 In Rome, Vatican spokesmen said the document, "Redemptoris Missio," reflected fears that Catholicism was lagging behind Islam in expansion in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. But when American Catholic officials read the text, they found it aimed more at debates within Christian ranks about the whole point of missionary activity. And officials of Jewish groups sought reassurance that the letter did not signal a setback for Catholic-Jewish relations. 
Pope John Paul II apparently wanted to counter any impression that the church's effort to spread the faith through missionary work might be eclipsed by its dialogue with other religions and its involvement in economic and political struggles. Earlier papal documents have dwelt on the economic and political struggles; what is special to "Redemptoris Missio" ("Mission of the Redeemer") is the Pope's concern with theological views that suggest Christianity has no special status as a means to salvation.
Scholars in comparative religions have been drawn to the idea that all world religions, even in their differences, are about equal in their potential for spiritual fulfillment. The idea has also gained adherents among academic Christian theologians, especially those deeply engaged in discussions with representatives of major faiths like Buddhism, Islam and Hinduism.
 
Missionary as Hero
 What effect these views have had on missionary work is an open question. Auxiliary Bishop William J. McCormack of New York, American director of the church's mission arm, the Society for the Propagation of the Faith, said missionaries in the field were "getting on with the job and not letting various theories interfere with their work." But he added: "These theories are greatly discussed. Intellectually, if they stay there long enough, they will have an impact."
Clearly, the Pope would like to restore a heroic image of missionaries, harking back to the days when their courage and ingenuity in far-off lands made them a religious equivalent of Indiana Jones. That image has been weakened by the declining number of people joining the priesthood and religious orders, the mainstays of Catholic missionary work.
In addition, many Christians have recognized that in the past missionary efforts were linked to colonization or foreign domination. That awareness has increased self-consciousness about claims of Christianity's superiority to other world religions, especially when the Christian faith seemed to be losing ground in the missionaries' own homelands in Europe or the United States.
 
'Myth' of Uniqueness
 William R. Burrows, managing editor of Orbis Books, the publishing house of the Maryknoll order of missionaries, speaks of a division between younger and older missionaries. Those under 55 years old are more likely to see validity in non-Christian religions as a simple matter of their experience, he said. But they struggle with "how to square the circle" of fitting that experience into their older theology.
In 1988, Orbis Books published "The Myth of Christian Uniqueness," co-edited by John Hicks, a Protestant scholar, and Paul Knitter, a Catholic theologian. Mr. Knitter said Vatican officials had called his work inimical to missionary efforts, charging that his approach would remove all incentive to preach Christianity and gather converts.
Mr. Knitter denied that accusation but acknowledged that in his view, seeking converts should be subordinate to interreligious dialogue and to practical cooperation for human progress. For such a dialogue to be genuine, he added, all religions would have to be on equal footing.
By rejecting this view, the Pope's encyclical wades into a debate cutting across Christian denominations. It will play a part at the sessions when representatives of hundreds of Protestant and Eastern Orthodox groups gather in Canberra, Australia, next month for a World Assembly of the World Council of Churches.
It is also a debate in which individual positions remain in flux and party lines are not fixed. In "Christian Uniqueness Reconsidered," another book published by Orbis, several strong supporters of interreligious dialogue reply critically to the religious pluralism advocated by Mr. Knitter and Mr. Hicks. This kind of pluralism, the criticism goes, tries not to impose Christian standards on non-Christian religions but ends by imposing the standards of some form of modern liberalism on Christian and non-Christian religions alike.
 
Keeping the Dialogue Going
 The Pope's insistence on retaining some traditional priorities does not mean that he rules out the newer concerns. The encyclical strongly endorses missionary efforts to relieve poverty, counter political oppression and defend human rights.
Its recognition of God's saving presence in other religions goes well beyond the Second Vatican Council's decree on missions and Pope Paul VI's 1975 letter on evangelization, said the Rev. John F. Hotchkin, executive director of the American bishops' Secretariat on Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs.
The encyclical said interreligious dialogue could lead to spiritual growth and asked all the faithful to engage in some form of it. Father Hotchkin called it "as positive a statement as I've seen" in authoritative church declarations.
Responding to concern expressed by spokesmen for some Jewish groups about the document's stress on Jesus as the source of salvation, Father Hotchkin said the encyclical was not meant to address relations between Christianity and its parent religion, Judaism. They are in a different category from Christianity's relations with other major faiths, he said.
Rabbi Jack Bemporad, interreligious affairs officer for the Synagogue Council of America, agreed with this interpretation. But two other leaders in interreligious discussions, Rabbi A. James Rudin of the American Jewish Committee and Rabbi Leon Klenicki of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, said they regretted that the distinction had not been made explicit in the encyclical.
In fact, the document left a lot unstated. It restated the Christian teaching that all salvation comes from Christ and that this occurs ordinarily and most fully through the churches. But the encyclical also said many people would attain salvation even though they would never be Christians.
The "mysterious" relation of their salvation to Christ and the church is something the encyclical did not try to explain theologically. The Pope has left plenty of puzzles for theologians to ponder and, no doubt, debate.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Dips on Thin Volume; Recession Fears Are Cited

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar drifted aimlessly lower in thin trading yesterday, undermined by a lack of compelling news about the Persian Gulf war and continued worries about the recession, analysts said.
The dollar initially edged higher in domestic trading against major foreign currencies on a Commerce Department report that personal incomes in December rose seven-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.75 trillion. 
 Some market participants said the figure was more than double what many traders were expecting. The rise, however, was not enough to offset the general downward pull of the stagnating United States economy.
"The market still feels the Fed will ease more before the economy bottoms out," said Tom Benfer, a senior marketing representative in the currency trading department of Bank of Montreal.
Concern that lower interest rates and the United States recession could erode the dollar's value continued to lessen the currency's appeal as a safe holding during the Persian Gulf crisis.
Traders said the war was considered a non-event yesterday, with few developments major enough to spur buying or selling of dollars.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.07 Japanese yen, to a closing 132.45 yen. It was quoted at 132.15 yen late in London trading. In New York, the dollar fell to 131.60 yen from late Friday's 132.55 yen.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.9645, from $1.9580 late Friday. Later, in New York, 1 cost $1.9650, more than the $1.9564 late Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday, included: 1.4871 German marks, down from 1.4910; 1.2617 Swiss francs, down from 1.2628; 5.0515 French francs, down from 5.0685; 1,116.25 Italian lire, down from 1,120.50, and 1.1624 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1643.

HEADLINE: McDonald's Net Up 8.8% in the 4th Quarter

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 28

 BODY:
The McDonald's Corporation reported today that its net income rose 8.8 percent in the fourth quarter, to a record $186.2 million, and was up 10.4 percent for all of 1990, to $802.3 million, also a record. But analysts said that the earnings were inflated by unusual gains and other additions to profits that came from outside of its basic fast-food operations.
McDonald's latest results compared with fourth-quarter income in 1989 of $171.1 million and full-year income of $726.7 million. Revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.73 billion, up from $1.58 billion a year ago; revenues for the year were $6.78 billion, compared with $6.14 billion in 1989. Earnings per share jumped to 51 cents from 46 cents, for the quarter, and for the full year rose to $2.20 a share, from $1.95. 
While McDonald's, in a statement, painted a glowing picture of its performance, several securities analysts who watch the company said that after putting aside special items, the company's adjusted profits were down and that management was trying to minimize a fundamental deterioration in McDonald's business.
"The fourth-quarter results were awful," said Caroline Levy of Lehman Brothers. "This is a company that has severe, severe problems."
In particular, Ms. Levy and other Wall Street analysts pointed to what they called McDonald's anemic United States operations.
 
Profits Down at U.S. Restaurants
 For more than two years, sales and profits have been falling at McDonald's Ameican restaurants. The decline has come partly because of the domestic recession, partly because of consumer concerns over cholesterol, high fat foods like burgers, and partly because of stepped-up competition, particularly price cutting, by rivals like Burger King, Wendy's, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut.
Ms. Levy, for instance, calculates that among McDonald's company-owned restaurants in this country, operating profits companywide fell 2 percent in the first quarter, 9 percent in the second quarter, 12 percent in the third quarter and 14 percent in the fourth quarter. This figure is somewhat exaggerated by the fact that the number of company-owned McDonald's restaurants fell in 1990 from 1989.
Michael G. Mueller of Montgomery Securities, meanwhile, calculates that in the fourth-quarter average sales at individual, company-owned McDonald's restaurants in this country fell 1.8 percent from a year ago. "Real" sales per restaurant, he says, which are sales adjusted for price increases, fell 5.6 percent.
Analysts say that results at franchisee-owned restaurants in this country have been equally weak. Customer counts have been flat, real sales have been declining, and the restaurants have been losing share to more feisty rivals, particularly Taco Bell.
"McDonald's just has not been as aggressive as the competition in delivering value to the consumer," Mr. Mueller said.
For McDonald's shareholders, the good news is that the company has been doing extremely well in Europe and Asia. Indeed, the strong overseas results were the principal factor behind the record fourth-quarter results that the company reported today.
McDonald's stock closed at $27.75, today, down 62.5 cents in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Analysts, who consider the per-share numbers to be perhaps the best indicators of a company's health, noted that the 51-cent figure was inflated by unusually big gains on the sale of company-owned McDonald's restaurants as well as by a lower tax rate in 1990's fourth quarter versus the comparable 1989 period. The analysts said that adjusted for these items, McDonald's per share results were flat compared with a year ago, at about 45 cents.
Publicly, McDonald's officials are not nearly as pessimistic as the analysts about the company's United States situation. But the officials do acknowledge that the recession is cutting into McDonald's domestic business. And they confirmed today that the company was taking several steps in response.

HEADLINE: Japan's Stern Warning on Trade Sanctions

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
A top Japanese Treasury official warned today that if the United States applied sanctions against his country because of slowness in opening financial markets, Tokyo would respond by curbing credit to the United States, creating a "very, very harmful" situation.
The warning by Makoto Utsumi, the Vice Minister of Finance for International Affairs, was considered unusually blunt, underscoring rising tensions in negotiations that Washington and Tokyo are holding over longstanding American demands for better access to Japanese financial markets for American financial institutions. 
 It has long been speculated that American sanctions against Japan could lead to Japanese reprisals in the financial sector. But rarely have Japanese officials spoken so openly about consequences for the United States.
 
Differences Not Narrowed
 After a daylong meeting here, Mr. Utsumi and his American counterpart, David C. Mulford, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, failed to narrow any of their differences over the pace of Japanese financial services deregulation. No date was even set to continue negotiations.
Mr. Utsumi's remarks were delivered at a news conference with Mr. Mulford after the meeting. The meeting was a continuation of talks that began in 1984 to remove barriers in Japan's financial services industry.
The talks have assumed rising importance against the backdrop of a strong Congressional push for legislation that would impose sanctions and Bush Administration plans, expected to be announced soon, for reforming the nation's banking system.
 
Japan Is Primary Target
 The sanctions bill -- introduced by Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and Jake Garn of Utah, its ranking Republican -- would authorize regulators to deny bids for expansion in the United States by financial institutions based in countries that bar American companies from comparable competitive opportunities.
The bill is aimed mainly at Japan, which despite some changes over the years, still maintains an elaborate web of laws and practices that Washington believes keeps foreign banks and securities firms from competing on equal terms with the Japanese.
American officials assert, for example, that controls over interest rates allow Japanese banks to compete more successfully for money, giving them substantial advantages when they expand overseas, like in the United States.
 
No Bush Support
 But the Bush Administration opposes the Riegle-Garn legislation, saying that narrow reciprocity as a principle of trade policy would lead to escalating retaliation.
Mr. Mulford told reporters today that the United States was trying to get Japan to "address the changing environment with regard to rising Congressional concerns about deregulation and access in Japan." He spoke of "new forces that could result in a substantial politicization of the process unless there could be very rapid progress in Japan."
Responding to questions about the Riegle-Garn legislation, which almost cleared the last session of Congress and was recently reintroduced, Mr. Utsumi noted pointedly that the United States "is experiencing a credit crunch."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: RECRUITING;
Many Are Calling; Some Will Be Chosen but Not All Will Fight

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME

 BODY:
For recruiters finding themselves with both a popular war and a shrinking military, the Persian Gulf is providing a new sort of Catch-22.
As in Joseph Heller's satirical World War II novel, in which almost everything came with a catch, those most interested in fighting in the Persian Gulf are often finding the military a hard place to join, and those the military most wants may be harder to recruit. 
 "I've had a number of phone calls from people who want to join the Air Force to help fight Saddam, but unfortunately those are the ones that are often unqualified," said Staff Sgt. Danny Williams, the top Air Force recruiter in Los Angeles.
Recruiters for the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps say they have received a surge in calls from people interested in fighting overseas, many of them veterans. The Army says that on Jan. 18, a day and a half after fighting began, twice as many applicants as normal came in for the Army physical and entrance testing.
Some will qualify. But with standards rising and the ranks still shrinking, at least in the war's early stages, many of those expressing interest are either too old or otherwise unqualified.
On the other hand, officials say they are having to work harder to persuade promising young high school students, and particularly their parents, that now is a good time to join the military.
"I think at this point it's been a wash," said Lieut. Col. Donald Tarter, commander for the United States Army Recruiting Battalion based in Atlanta. "Some people are interested because of it, and some are less likely to sign up because of it. Right now, the long-term effect is an unknown."
Colonel Tarter said the outbreak of war has brought a flood of calls to recruiters from would-be soldiers, many of them a bit long in the tooth.
 
'Thank You Very Much'
 "Two-thirds of them you can tell them on the phone, 'Thank you very much, we appreciate your patriotic interest, but we can't help you,' " he said. "A couple of people said, 'Just let me drive a truck so some soldier can do what needs to be done,' but you ask how old they are, and they're 51." Under most circumstances, the age limit for enlisting in the Army is 35.
Potential recruits interviewed yesterday expressed a wide range of reasons for joining up. For some, the war and the patriotic mood it has engendered was a big part of their decision.
"I'm here because I like the Army, and I want to do something with my life," said Moises Gonzalez, 24 years old, who was interviewed at a Boston recruiting office. "Besides, I agree with the war. We have to put a stop to Saddam Hussein. If we don't, he will own the world."
Staff Sgt. Angel R. Rivera, a recruiter at the same station, said he had seen an increase in the number of Hispanic people signing up since the war began. "Ninety percent of them are saying, 'I have a commitment to this country, and I want to serve,' " he said.
 
'For the American Way'
 At the Times Square recruiting office in Manhattan, Frank Gonzalez, a member of the Army Reserves, said he was there to join the regular Army. He said the war is "a good thing for the American way -- we don't need people who take over small lands."
But the war is only one reason for enlisting. Studies by the Army in recent years have shown that money for college and job training are the two biggest reasons cited by military recruits.
Sean Daley, a 23-year-old Coast Guard recruit from Boston, said he decided to enlist after being laid off from his job as a metal worker. "I'm all for my country, and I want to support Bush, but my being here has to do with the economy basically," he said. "I want to better my education and get back to school and get a job I am interested in. But if my country calls me to war, I would go."
 
Giving It a Second Thought
 Frank Bayley, a 17-year-old from Marietta, Ga., who plans to join the Marine Corps after he graduates from high school, said he has wanted to be a marine since he was 12, but the war was having sharply differing effects on his friends.
"Some guys are watching what's happening and deciding that this is something they've got to do," he said. "And there are others who are saying to themselves, 'Wait a minute. I'm not so sure about this.' "
Army recruiters say that, in general, the beginning of the gulf buildup and the outbreak of war have made their job harder, and they have had to spend more time both with potential recruits and with their parents.
"Our enlistments are now coming from an older age group, say 26 or more years," said Sgt. First Class Doug Chapman, a recruiter in Charlotte, N.C. "We spend a lot of time in the local area in gyms, in fast-food places, wherever we are having to do that more. We still work the high schools, but we're not having nearly as much success now that the war has started."
 
Highest Standards Ever
 The Army expects to recruit 88,000 soldiers this year, down from 119,000 two years ago. Officials say that in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, October through December, 97 percent of applicants had high school diplomas and 72 percent scored in the top half of the entrance aptitude test, the highest standards the Army has had.
A question for the Army, with its recruits' emphasis on college money and job training, is whether the war will affect its ability to keep those standards.
For other branches, the war may help. Marine recruiters say the Corps' emphasis on esprit de corp and patriotism probably makes the war a plus for recruiting.
Air Force recruiters cite the television coverage of F-15E fighter pilots roaring over the Persian Gulf. "This attention focused on the Air Force has helped us," said Technical Sgt. Tony D. McClain, supervisor of the Atlanta area Air Force recruiting office.
For all the emphasis on the war, however, it is not at all clear that any recruits who sign up now will fight in it.
Marine officials say recruits not learning specialized skills will train at least 17 to 22 weeks before being assigned to a unit. Those learning specalized skills could train for from 52 to 58 weeks. "It's a lot more things than getting a haircut and a uniform," said Sgt. Christopher Carr, a Marine spokesman for recruiting in Manhattan.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Prices for Platinum Plunge To Near a Five-Year Low

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Platinum futures prices approached five-year lows yesterday as industrial and investment demand for the metal lagged.
Platinum futures settled $8.40 to $9 lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with the contract for delivery in January at $379.30 an ounce, the lowest spot platinum price on the exchange since Feb. 14, 1986. The more actively traded April contract finished at $383.50. 
 Gold futures settled $1 to $1.60 higher on New York's Commodity Exchange, with gold for January delivery up $1, to $376.70 an ounce and the active February contract at $377.10 an ounce. Silver was 2.3 cents to 2.5 cents higher, with March at $3.842 an ounce.
Platinum soon could be trading at a discount to gold for the first time since 1985 unless the market's fundamentals change, analysts said.
Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst with Paine Webber Inc., said recession worries had strangled platinum demand by investors and industrial users, which include car and jewelry manufacturers.
The price of silver, which also has a large industrial component, has also fallen sharply lately, though gold has remained relatively firm.
One factor that could give platinum a lift is the tension in the Soviet Union, the world's second-largest platinum producer.
"If law and order break down, we could see a supply disruption over there," Mr. Savaiko said. "It is a possibility that should not be overlooked."
World sugar futures fell sharply to new life-of-contract lows in a late selloff on New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange.
It was sugar's sharpest one-day drop since the Persian Gulf war began, halting most sugar exports to the Middle East.
Harry Schwartz, a analyst with Cargill Investor Services Inc., said that because most of the selling occurred in the last five minutes, traders would be watching today's early action to determine whether "this is significant or just a bear raid."
Sugar settled 0.16 cent to 0.2 cent lower, with March at 8.76 cents a pound.
Livestock and meat futures rose on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in line with stronger cash cattle markets.
But gains in cattle were limited by selling prompted by Friday's quarterly Agriculture Department cattle-on-feed report. The report showed the largest on-feed inventories since 1979 in the 13 largest cattle states.
Live cattle futures settled 0.05 cent to 0.4 cent higher, with February at 78.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 0.17 cent to 0.4 cent higher, with January at 90.50 cents a pound; live hogs were 0.1 cent to 0.77 cent higher, with February at 54.27 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 0.35 cent to 1.22 cents higher, with February at 69.47 cents a pound.
Stronger domestic feed-grain demand lifted corn futures prices on the Chicago Board of Trade and helped push most other grain and soybean futures higher as well.

HEADLINE: Florio Approves a Rise In Tolls on the Turnpike

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
Gov. Jim Florio today approved a toll increase on the New Jersey Turnpike of 70 percent for cars and 100 percent for trucks, on the same day that his Treasurer announced that some of the toll revenues will be used indirectly to balance the state budget.
The Treasurer, Douglas C. Berman, also announced that the Governor would seek to freeze wages for state workers and to impose severe cuts in state contributions to health and pension benefits. 
 For months, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority has been comtemplating the toll increases as a way to pay off $2 billion in bonds borrowed in 1985 and to pay for construction projects centered around Newark International Airport. The increases will go into effect before April 1.
"The turnpike is giving people something for their money," Governor Florio said after approving the increase. "The plans they will carry out will ease congestion, improve safety and give a big boost to our economy."
 
Sale of State Roads
 Mr. Berman, in a briefing on the state budget today, said that in addition to layoffs and service cutbacks, the state plans to sell state roads to the turnpike authority for $400 million in an effort to balance the budget for the fiscal year that begins on July 1.
If approved by the Legislature, Mr. Berman's plan would mean, in effect, that a part of the higher tolls drivers would be paying on the turnpike would be used to finance state government and avoid more layoffs. Officials estimated that about 10 percent of the toll increases would be used to pay off the $400 million in road purchases.
The move has severely split the administration, including officials who say the toll increases will be perceived as a new tax on drivers, just three weeks after Governor Florio promised no new taxes in his State of the State address.
A number of top aides to the Governor have argued that the idea of selling state roads to balance the state budget was ill-conceived and expressed hope that Mr. Florio would still distance himself from the plan.
 
Still Lower Than Other Tolls
 "Its like selling your furniture when you can't pay your electric bill," one administration official said.
Under the toll increases approved today at a meeting of turnpike commissioners and supported by Mr. Florio, the toll for a car traveling the full length of the turnpike, which stretches from the Delaware border to the Hudson River crossings, would rise to $4.60, from $2.70.
According to Gordon Hector, a spokesman for the turnpike authority, tolls on the New Jersey Turnpike are still considerably lower than on many other toll roads. As of January 1991, for example, the cost for a car was $2.29 for 100 miles on the New Jersey Turnpike, compared with $3.10 on the main line of the New York Thruway, $4.15 on the Massachusetts Turnpike, and $2.88 on the northeast section of the Pennsylvania Turnpike.
The New Jersey Turnpike Authority, an independent agency, borrowed $2 billion for a 1985 road widening project, which suffered many years of delays. As a result of the borrowing in 1985, turnpike officials said some toll increases were inevitable. More than $1.3 billion of that money remains, and the authority has plans for major widening projects that will cost $900 million.
 
$400 Million to Purchase Roads
 In his announcement today, Mr. Berman said the remaining $400 million would be used to buy adjoining roads, which would be administered by the authority. They would not become toll roads, Mr. Berman said.
"We are in economic hard times," Mr. Berman said in explaining the budget that will be presented to the Legislature on Tuesday. "It will keep New Jersey building for the future."
Other administration officials said the roads likely to be sold to the authority would either be the connection between the northern end of the turnpike and the George Washington Bridge on Interstate 95 or the sections of Interstate 295 running parallel to the turnpike in the southern part of the state.
Before Mr. Berman's announcement the turnpike authority had proposed that the remaining $400 million could have been returned to bond holders, or it could have been used to pay for other planned road improvements, like an improved connection between the turnpike and Route One to Trenton, or improved connections with the Pennsylvania Turnpike or the Atlantic City Expressway.
 
Hard Times Ahead
 David Goldberg, the chairman of the turnpike authority, said that if the authority spent $400 million on buying roads from the state it would have to cancel other plans for road improvements. He also questioned whether the authority could purchase roads it took responsibility for maintaining, if it did not charge tolls on them.
In his news conference, Mr. Berman painted a bleak picture of state government in the next fiscal year. The state will try to impose $160 million in wage freezes, forcing state workers to forgo their cost of living increases, and save $75 million in state contributions to health benefits and $40 million in pension reimbursements. Mr. Berman said the state could impose those changes without renegotiating contracts with state workers.
The state also hopes to earn $25 million in increased revenues by raising user fees on a variety of state services, including litigation fees and fees imposed by the Department of Environmental Protection.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Collagen Goes Beyond the Cosmetic

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif.

 BODY:
The Collagen Corporation takes its name and has always made most of its money from a product that makes people look younger. Now the company is moving beyond products with cosmetic uses to ones that treat medical problems. And Wall Street, after neglecting the stock for years, is again enthusiastic about Collagen.
For nine years, injectable collagen, a purified protein derived from cowhides, has provided the company with a stable earnings base and steady if not spectacular growth. About 700,000 people, some attracted by before-and-after shots in magazines like Vogue and Harper's Bazaar, have had collagen injections to smooth wrinkles and scars. More recently, it has been used to give lips a fuller, more pouty look. 
 But the product has been challenged in lawsuits contending that patients developed autoimmune diseases after receiving collagen injections. So after initial optimism when the company when public in 1981, the stock fell to a low of $4.125 in October 1987 after reaching a high of $19.50 earlier that year.
 
New Medical Applications
 Excitement about Collagen's diversification into medical products, which are more recession-proof than cosmetic products, has helped the stock recover, although it has been volatile. It rose sharply on Friday and reached a new high yesterday of $26.75, but fell later to close at $23.875, down $2.125, in over-the-counter trading.
One new collagen-based product, Contigen, promises to bring relief to millions of sufferers of urinary incontinence, who have had few alternatives to adult diapers. Another such product, Collagraft, could speed healing of severe bone fractures. A tiny, steerable catheter produced by the company's majority-owned subsidiary, Target Therapeutics Inc., is gaining acceptance in treating tumors and vascular disorders.
Finally, Collagen's earnings prospects could be improved by the fact that the company's cash-burning biotech unit, Celtrix Inc., will soon be spun off as a separate company.
For the near term, Collagen, which is based in Palo Alto, will continue to derive the biggest share of its income from its namesake product. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1981, injectable bovine collagen has the blue-white color of skim milk and the consistency of heavy cream, and is shipped to dermatologists and plastic surgeons mixed with a saline solution and lidocaine, a local anesthetic.
Physicians who have administered collagen injections say that they primarily treat women between 25 and 45 years old and that the patients are typically pleased with the results. Collagen is gradually absorbed by the body, so injections must be repeated two to four times a year. The annual cost is about $1,000.
"The void in our specialty that it fills is the person with the early aging changes that you couldn't in good conscience recommend surgery for," said Robert Harvey, a San Francisco-based plastic surgeon who has done thousands of collagen treatments. "Before this came out we could only say, 'Come back in 5 or 10 years for a face lift.' "
 
Lawsuits Outstanding
 But Collagen still faces lawsuits linking the product with autoimmune diseases, in which the body attacks its own tissues. Collagen's insurance carrier settled the first suit, but the company has fought subsequent claims; juries have ruled in its favor in the five that have come to trial. Four cases have been dropped, and six have yet to be heard.
The litigation focused attention on Collagen. In October 1989, Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, began an inquiry into the F.D.A.'s approval of injectable collagen. He raised questions about why it was approved as a medical device rather than as a drug, which would have required more stringent review. "That investigation has continued, and there will be a report issued later this year with conclusions and findings," said Dennis Fitzgibbon, a spokesman for Mr. Dingell.
Collagen officials say that there are no data to support a link between their product and autoimmune diseases, and note that they have gone out of their way to document every adverse reaction. They say these are mostly localized allergic responses, which occur in 1 or 2 percent of patients; doctors administer a skin test to weed out these patients. A January 1990 report by the Department of Health and Human Services found no greater incidence of autoimmune disease among collagen patients than among the general public.
Howard D. Palefsky, Collagen's president and chief executive, said, "The scientific evidence to me is just so obvious and so well supported by data and physicians in the field that there's no question in my mind" about collagen's safety.
One reason Collagen has come under scrutiny is its high-profile advertising, unusual for a medical product. Mr. Palefsky said the advertising was appropriate. "While injectable collagen for the treatment of wrinkles is certainly a medical product, it is basically a product that treats healthy people," he said.
The controversy surrounding cosmetic collagen has not stopped its sales from growing about 15 percent a year. The company had 1990 earnings of $4.1 million, or 46 cents a share, on revenues of $54.3 million, of which $41.4 million came from injectable collagen products. But its real hopes for growth come from finding medical uses for the material.
 
Help for Incontinence
 The first of these uses, Contigen Bard Collagen Implant, received unanimous recommendation for approval from the F.D.A.'s Gastroenterology and General Use Devices panel on Oct. 18. The implant involves the injection of collagen into the tissue surrounding the urethra, which narrows the opening from the bladder and allows the patient's muscles to control urination better. It will be marketed by C. R. Bard Inc., a leading company in the urology field.
"Contigen is potentially a very big product," said Jim McCamant, editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter. "It's got the things you look for," he said, noting that more than three million patients are candidates for the therapy, that C. R. Bard is already a primary supplier to urologists, and that Contigen is much simpler and more effective than wearing a diaper or having surgery.
The company estimates that for every 25,000 patients treated, its earnings per share could grow 25 cents. Competition for Contigen will come primarily from the Mentor Corporation, of Santa Barbara, Calif., which has a similar treatment, called Urethrin, in which Teflon is injected.
Collagen officials say Contigen has the advantage of being a natural protein. But some physicians may prefer to use Urethrin because it will not be absorbed by the body and will not require subsequent injections.
After Contigen, Collagen will seek F.D.A. approval for Collagraft Bone Graft Substitute, which combines ceramic materials with collagen. The material is intended to provide a scaffolding onto which a fracture patient's bone cells will grow; as the ceramic materials are slowly dissolved by the body, they are replaced by natural bone. Collagraft could be used instead of bone grafts taken from elsewhere on the patient's body or from bone banks.
In addition, Target Therapeutics, a company that began as a joint venture of Collagen and Eli Lilly but is now majority-owned by Collagen, has developed some very small and specialized catheters. They have proved useful in delivering blood-clotting agents and chemotherapeutic drugs, and represent a growing market.
 
Changing 'Before Our Eyes'
 "The company is really changing right before our eyes," said Kurt H. Kruger, a medical-technology analyst with Hambrecht & Quist. "It is becoming a true medical-products company, which implies much more stable earnings and sales growth than a cosmetics company, which is what they were."
While the cosmetics business has been very profitable for Collagen, its earnings have been obscured in recent quarters by the high costs of maintaining a unit devoted to biotechnology research and development. That unit, Celtrix, will be spun off within a few months. It is primarily developing genetically engineered proteins that cause bone growth.
James T. McKinley, Collagen's senior vice president and chief financial officer, said that while Celtrix's technology was promising, its need for cash and lack of near-term revenues were not compatible with Collagen.

HEADLINE: Personal Income Up Strong 0.7%

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
Personal income ended the year on a buoyant note, rising seven-tenths of 1 percent in December and helping to lift wages by 6 percent for the year as a whole, the Commerce Department said today.
The yearly total, however, fell just short of matching the 1990 inflation level. Consumer prices last year rose 6.1 percent. 
 December's gain in personal income -- which reflected the fact that workers put in longer hours at higher pay levels -- followed a revised report of a rise of four-tenths of 1 percent for the month before.
And while analysts said the gain was better than expected and spelled good news for the economy, they warned that it did not signal a quick end to the recession.
Personal consumption matched the gain in income, also moving up seven-tenths of 1 percent in the month, compared with a gain of one-tenth of 1 percent in November.
Last year's 6 percent rise in income followed a 7.7 percent increase in 1989, the department said.
The gain in December income outpaced projections. The average Wall Street forecast had called for a rise of four-tenths of 1 percent.
The figures also appeared to fly in the face of overwhelming evidence that the United States had entered a recession, but economists doubted that they signaled a new trend.
"It's good news, but I just think it's presumptuous to say the economy has bottomed out," said Charles Lieberman, economist at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company.
The data "would lead to the conclusion that perhaps the economy is beginning to stabilize," said Norman Robertson, economist at Mellon Bank, but he cautioned against making too much of one month's numbers.
Separately, a Federal Reserve Board governor, John P. LaWare, projected that the United States economy will climb out of recession no later than the third quarter of 1991.
In remarks before an economic group in Boston, Mr. LaWare said that if the Persian Gulf war was short, its end "should see a dramatic return of consumer confidence."
Analysts said the December rise in income came after industry moved earlier than usual to cut staff as the recession loomed, with the remaining workers putting in longer hours to maintain production levels.
 
Fewer Higher-Level Job Cuts
 At the same time, fewer high-level service and production jobs were cut in December, and this improvement showed up in higher wages. Morever, employees working longer hours were getting overtime, which also raised the figures, analysts said.
But the gains could be short-lived.
"I don't expect to see these numbers repeated anytime soon," said Donald Ratajczak, an economist at Georgia State University.
Most economists now believe that the current recession will be short and should end by midyear, depending on the outcome of the gulf war.
On Friday, the department reported the economy contracted at a 2.1 percent annual rate in the last three months of 1990, recording its steepest downturn in eight years.

HEADLINE: Health Care A Growing Burden

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
With health-care costs pushing relentlessly upward, companies and employees are feeling the burden. Last year, in fact, fully 26 percent of the average company's net earnings went for medical costs, a survey released yesterday shows.
Health care cost an average of $3,217 for each worker in 1990, an increase of 17.1 percent from 1989, A. Foster Higgins & Company, a benefits consulting firm, said yesterday. The survey combined dental, vision and hearing with spending on traditional medical coverage, the type that most employees have. Traditional costs alone increased by 21.6 percent in 1990, to $3,161 an employee, according the firm's survey of 1,955 business and government employers. 
 The costs at large companies, with at least 40,000 employees, were even higher: $3,999 an employee. John Erb, a Foster Higgins managing consultant, said costs were higher at large companies because they often have contracts with unions and provide more generous medical coverage. The steepest increases were among concerns with 5,000 to 9,999 employees; their costs per employee rose 31.6 percent, to $3,302.
 
Traditional Costs Rose Faster
 Spending on health maintenance organizations increased less rapidly than in traditional medical plans, which pay doctors and hospitals with few questions asked.
But traditional medical costs have risen by more than 20 percent annually since 1988, Mr. Erb said, and will exceed $22,000 an employee by 2000 if the current rate of growth continues.
Although most companies offered employees a chance to join a health maintenance organization, only one-third of their workers joined one, the survey found. About one-third of employers also offered incentives to use networks of doctors and hospitals that agree to accept discounted fees. At such companies, 59 percent of the employees actually used the discount networks.
But the Foster Higgins findings showed that the H.M.O.'s and discount networks had made only a relatively small dent in overall medical spending increases.
Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University, said he was "surprised at how many companies still pay for largely conventional coverage." In the Middle Atlantic States, where there are relatively few discount networks and other health-cost containment plans, traditional medical expenses rose 28.3 percent, to $3,500 an employee, Foster Higgins found. On the West Coast, by contrast, the increase was 19 percent, to $3,271 an employee. It was $2,922 in the Southeast, $2,893 in the South Central states, and $3,138 in the Midwestern and North Central states.
Mr. Erb said 82 percent of the employers required workers to pay part of their family health-care costs. Individual employees contributed $396 a year on average, up 43.5 percent, from $276 in 1989, while family payments rose 29 percent, to $1,068.
The highest traditional medical costs, $4,296 an employee, were in the highly unionized utilities industries, with many older employees (40 years old on average). Retail and wholesale employers, with fewer unions and younger employees (age 34 on average), spent $2,323.
 
Costs Doubled in 5 Years
 The cost of traditional medical coverage has doubled in five years. A survey by the Wyatt Company, a consulting firm, found that traditional medical costs in 1986 were $1,460 an employee, said John Menefee, a Wyatt health economist in Washington. In 1980, such costs were only $860.
In other measures of rising medical costs, the Health Insurance Association of America, an insurers trade group, said that premiums rose in 1989 by 28 percent, to $3,216 a year, for families with traditional coverage, and 29 percent, to $3,132, for members of the type of health maintenance organization that has a staff of salaried doctors. Individual premiums rose by 21 percent for traditional coverage and 33 percent for H.M.O. members.
The Commerce Department said national spending on health care rose 11.9 percent in 1990, to $675.7 billion, of which $398.7 billion came from private employers, insurers and out-of-pocket payments by individuals. Government health programs spent the remaining $277 billion.

HEADLINE: Bush Speech to Urge Bank Law Changes

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
Although the Persian Gulf war will dominate his State of the Union Message on Tuesday, President Bush will also address domestic issues and will offer sweeping proposals to revamp the nation's banking laws, Administration officials said today.
Mr. Bush was still considering today what to include in the speech. He may mention proposals to increase educational opportunities for low-income people, to encourage homeownership by poor families and to combat infant mortality in about 20 large cities. 
 While Mr. Bush is not likely to propose any major changes in social welfare programs, he is almost certain to recommend a comprehensive overhaul of the nation's banking laws. His proposals would make it easier for banks to operate across state lines and would break down barriers that now separate commercial banks, investment banks and stock brokerage firms.
The Bush proposals would permit investment banks and industrial corporations to own commercial banks, Administration officials said. In addition, under the proposals, commercial banks would be allowed to underwrite and deal in corporate securities.
Administration officials acknowledge that there is little new money for domestic programs and estimate that the Federal budget deficit will soar to $318 billion this year, more than double the $153 billion deficit in the 1989 fiscal year. But they insist that the gulf war need not paralyze efforts to deal with domestic problems.
 
Emphasis on Foreign Affairs
 With President Bush and many Americans preoccupied with war, this year's State of the Union Message will emphasize foreign affairs much more than usual.
Mr. Bush is expected to devote more than half of the speech to reporting on the progress of the war and to affirming his view that it is "a just war" with a noble aim. He is also expected to describe his ideas for promoting peace in the Middle East after the war ends.
Administration officials said the domestic side of the speech had been a subject of intense wrangling inside the White House, a reflection of the political struggle between two wings of the Republican Party.
An early draft of the speech, ringing with statements about the need to empower poor people with more choices, was rewritten under the direction of Richard G. Darman, the budget director, and John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, to keep it in line with traditional Republican themes about the need for good government and sound management, the officials said.
"Young Turks" in the Administration, including James P. Pinkerton, deputy assistant to the President for policy planning, and other conservative Republicans like Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp and Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia had advocated the stronger language but lost out when the final version of the message was drafted for Mr. Bush.
The main speech writers, Mark Lange and David F. Demarest Jr., were sympathetic to the conservative emphasis on economic growth as a means to increase opportunities for poor people. But White House officials said Mr. Darman and Mr. Sununu diluted those themes.
Last year Mr. Darman publicly ridiculed some of the economic and political ideas espoused by Mr. Gingrich, the House Republican whip, and Mr. Pinkerton. Though they patched up their personal quarrel, the philosophical disagreements persist.
In a speech last week at the Cato Institute, a research and policy center here, Mr. Pinkerton said: "The war has eclipsed the domestic agenda, at least in the short run. But I don't think the debate that really counts, the intellectual debate, will be much affected" by it.
 
Changes in Banking Laws
 Mr. Bush's proposal for a comprehensive overhaul of the banking laws comes as some members of Congress, noting the financial problems of many banks, say they would hesitate to relax Federal requirements for the industry. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said last month that prospects for approval of the changes in the banking laws were "probably no better than 50-50."
Administration officials have apparently not decided how to shore up the Bank Insurance Fund, which insures deposits at more than 13,000 banks across the country. The Federal system of deposit insurance for commercial banks faces greater dangers today than at any time since it was born in the Great Depression. But in his State of the Union Message, Mr. Bush is unlikely to say much about the issue because Treasury officials and bankers have yet to reach agreement on specific proposals.
In a gesture to conservatives, Mr. Bush is expected to reaffirm his support for a cut in the capital gains tax, but he will not make it a centerpiece of his agenda as he did in the past, Administration officials said.
 
Voucher Proposal Revived
 Mr. Bush also plans to revive a Reagan Administration proposal for education vouchers as a means to expand the choices available to low-income families. Parents could use such vouchers, which would be a form of Federal aid, to enroll their children in the public or private elementary and secondary schools of their choice.
In an effort to underline his concern for children of the poor, Mr. Bush may also mention new proposals to combat infant mortality by expanding prenatal care and other services in cities with the highest infant death rates. Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, persuaded Mr. Bush to include those proposals in his budget for the 1992 fiscal year, which is to be submitted to Congress next week.
Administration officials said Mr. Bush would make a fresh appeal for Congressional approval of proposals to reduce crime, especially violent crime by drug users and drug dealers. The proposals call for new sentencing procedures to permit greater use of the death penalty, stricter limits on appeals by death row prisoners and rule changes to permit the use in criminal trials of some evidence illegally obtained by law-enforcement officers.

HEADLINE: Poll Says Most Blacks Prefer 'Black' to 'African-American'

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
Despite the increasing use of the term African-American, most black Americans still prefer to be called black, according to a survey.
The survey, by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington research organization specializing in black issues, found that 72 percent preferred black, 15 percent African-American, 3 percent Afro-American and 2 percent Negro, with the rest giving no opinion or other responses. 
 Milton Morris, the center's vice president for research, said the poll was conducted by telephone last fall among a random sampling of 759 black people nationwide. The survey had a sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, he said.
The term African-American has gained currency recently, at the African-American Summit in New Orleans in April 1989 and when Ramona H. Edelin, president of the National Urban Coalition, suggested that the term would give black people a greater sense of their history. The Rev. Jesse Jackson endorsed the change, and the term has since been adopted by prominent blacks including Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York, Mayor Maynard Jackson of Atlanta and Representative William H. Gray 3d, Democrat of Pennsylvania.
The Joint Center has not embraced the change. "Individuals here use the term, but as an institution we have not adopted it," Mr. Morris said. "Frankly, we think that among other practical considerations it is a bit more cumbersome than is convenient for much of our communication."
Mr. Morris said Mr. Jackson's endorsement appeared to have been the chief impetus for the movement to use African-American instead of black.
"There is a strong inclination among what you might call the elite in the black community to fall in line with such pronouncements, so they have, and the white community has been very responsive," Mr. Morris said.
 
Seeking a Sense of Public Mood
 Mr. Morris said his organization had undertaken its survey because "at no time have we had any sense of what the public preference was, what the mood was."
In polls in 1989 by Time magazine and The Chicago Tribune, a quarter of black respondents said they preferred African-American. In the Time poll, three-fifths said they preferred black; in the Tribune poll, two-fifths favored black and a third accepted either term.
The Joint Center poll also considered preferences offering only the terms black and African-American. It found that black was preferred by 72 percent to 28 percent in the East, 76 percent to 24 percent in the Midwest, 85 percent to 15 percent in South and 78 percent to 22 percent in the West.
The survey found more support for African-American among black men than among black women, 28 percent to 15 percent.
Blacks with some college education favored African-American more than those who had not gone beyond high school, by 20 percent to 15 percent.
Older blacks liked African-American the least, 17 percent for those of ages 50 and over, compared with 19 percent for those of ages 30 to 49 and 28 percent for those 18 to 29.

War Won't Open Too Many Jobs

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
FOR all its divisiveness, the Vietnam War broke down job barriers in ways the Persian Gulf war is never likely to match.
As the armed forces swelled in size in the late 1960's, men and women who had not sought work before were drawn into the labor force. The first big civilian job gains of the civil rights movement came then for blacks, and the rapid entry of women into jobs also began in this period. 
 But the Vietnam military buildup coincided with an economic boom and the draft drained away young men, starting in 1965, just as the civilian sector was running short of workers. The unemployment rate, as a result, plunged to less than 4 percent over the next four years, forcing companies to bid for people they had not previously considered.
"Poverty and joblessness declined across the country," said Paul Osterman, a labor economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
A quite different experience -- the unfolding of a recession -- has accompanied the first six months of the gulf crisis, and most Americans expect the war to be far shorter than the fighting in Vietnam. Unemployment, instead of declining, is rising much faster than the military buildup. For each of the 180,000 reservists activated by President Bush since Aug. 2, three other people have joined the unemployment lines. With the unemployment rate above 6 percent, employers are not hiring all those who seek jobs, much less those who remain outside the labor market.
The situation probably would not change even if President Bush activated all of the 1.15 million men and women in the Reserves and National Guard. A Defense Department study showed the reservists to be mostly high school graduates, in their late 20's and 30's, holding a great variety ofjobs: teachers, civil servants, mechanics, police officers, office workers, self-employed. But if all 1.15 million were to be called to active duty tomorrow and replaced in their civilian jobs by the unemployed, the jobless rolls would decline only to their levels of last spring. The unemployment rate then was 5.3 percent.
"The armed forces and the Reserves are too small a number to have any impact," said Gregory Weyland, a Census Bureau economist.
Making an impact would require a renewal of the draft, an end to the recession and months or years of gulf warfare, economists say. Only then might employers find themselves so short of workers that they would turn to those on the margins of the labor force, particularly black and Hispanic young people, who stay out of the labor force in large numbers today, neither holding nor seeking jobs.
The armed forces are still well below the level that set off the influx of workers into the labor force in the late 1960's. During the Vietnam War, the military grew to more than 3.4 million people in 1967 and 1968, or 4.3 percent of the total labor force. That was enough to produce a shortage of civilian workers, and jobs opened up for millions of womenand minorities, in many cases in the retail and service industries then beginning to expand.
By comparison, the 2.1 million men and women in the regular armed services today represent only 1.7 percent of the labor force. If all 1.15 million reservists were called up, the total in uniform would rise to only 2.8 percent of the labor force, which is much larger today than in the Vietnam years.
Even the busy Raytheon Corporation, maker of the much-used Patriot missile, is not hurting for workers. The Defense Department asked the company to speed up Patriot production at its Andover, Mass., plant, where 6,000 employees produce Patriots and other missiles. The speed-up has been achieved through overtime and the hiring of only 250 additional workers, said Edward Powers, a company spokesman.
Were these skilled missile makers hard to find? "We have had no difficulty, because other companies in the area have been laying off good people, particularly the computer companies," Mr. Powers said.
The General Dynamics Corporation and the Grumman Corporation, two other manufacturers of weaponry widely used in the gulf, also report that skilled workers are relatively easy to find, although neither has hired additional workers in response to the gulf crisis.
The ample pools of skilled people would presumably disappear if the war lasted long enough and the armed forces swelled in size. When this occurred during the Vietnam War, many employers endorsed federally subsidized job training for unskilled new workers drawn into the labor force. And the Government obliged under the Manpower Development and Training Act of 1962.
Most of the subsidized training was later phased out, but a prolonged gulf war might bring it back, Mr. Osterman said. "The reservists are older, skilled people embedded in their jobs, so it is hard to think you could replace a reservist with a 19-year-old dropout," he said. "But if the war were sustained, there would be a trickle-down effect. People would be trained and would get hired."

HEADLINE: Big Cut in U.S. Deposits Hastened Fall of Freedom Bank in Harlem

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
While public funds were being used to shore up the Bank of New England, the Treasury Department sharply cut back similar deposits at the Freedom National Bank, thus hastening the collapse of the small minority-owned Manhattan institution.
According to former officials of Freedom National and bank documents, the Treasury in March suddenly curtailed its longstanding practice of keeping at Freedom as much as $300 million of income-tax withholding payments in what are known as "tax and loan" accounts. 
 "The loss of the tax and loan revenue almost doubled our losses on a monthly basis, forcing us into insolvency on a faster basis," said George A. Russell Jr., Freedom National's former president, who unsuccessfully lobbied senior Treasury Department officials to reverse the decision to cut back on their deposits at the Harlem bank.
 
Boston Bank's Plan
 The Bank of New England, based in Boston, had drawn up a plan early last year to use tax and loan accounts to help improve its cash position, and that plan was agreed to by officials at the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, bank officials and regulators said in December.
The different experiences of Freedom National, with $100 million in assets, and the Bank of New England, with $15 billion, adds to the debate about regulatory unfairness that arose after both institutions collapsed. The disclosure of the way the Treasury handled its deposits at Freedom National came on the eve of the department's release of a plan to overhaul the banking system, a plan that is expected to include changes in the "too big to fail" philosophy.
After the Bank of New England and two sister banks were seized by Federal regulators on Jan. 6, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation guaranteed all deposits, even those exceeding the $100,000 legal limit for insured deposits. The agency said that failing to repay completely all depositors of the third-largest banking company in New England would have been catastrophic for the region's economy.
But depositors at Freedom National who had accounts exceeding $100,000, including churches and a nonprofit organization that cares for poor children in Harlem, were not fully reimbursed after the institution was taken over on Nov. 9.
Frank Rush, a former executive vice president at Freedom National who tried to get the Treasury to be more flexible in its dealings with the bank, said Federal regulators "exercised discretion based on the policy that big banks could not fail but there was no such policy for minority banks."
 
Officials Deny Favoritism
 As for the tax and loan account program, Treasury officials say that since Treasury deposits are "blindly" placed, there is no preferential treatment. They also insist the program is safe because the public money is fully collateralized.
But the case of Freedom National suggests that Treasury officials are not always unaware of tax and loan account activity and that repeated though temporary collateral deficiencies had been tolerated for years.
Last year, Treasury officials denied that minority banks received any special treatment from the tax and loan program.
At the beginning of 1990, both Freedom National and the Bank of New England were experiencing heavy losses and had problems raising cash. When asked today for the reason for the different experiences of the two banks, a Treasury official who insisted on anonymity said the Bank of New England could meet the department's collateral requirements and Freedom National could not.
The Boston bank was allowed to use commercial loans as collateral, a practice that is frowned on by financial experts but permitted under Treasury regulations for tax and loan accounts. Most other banks in the New England region post Treasury bills or other high-quality collateral against their Treasury deposits, according to Dan L. Sanford, the vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston who administers the Treasury accounts in that region.
 
Overnight Deposits
 The Treasury tax and loan program includes deposits by businesses of employee income tax withholding payments, which are placed temporarily at hundreds of institutions and sit overnight without any interest being paid to the Treasury. The program also covers Treasury operating cash, which is dispersed nationwide to hundreds of institutions that pay the Treasury a return on its balances. The various Federal Reserve banks act as the Treasury's agent, monitoring and holding the collateral required as security.
Over the years, Freedom National had been allowed to have for short periods of time $200 million to $300 million in tax and loan accounts from the withholding payments while it posted a small fraction of collateral inventoried at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, according to bank documents and former bank officials. The Treasury deposits provided Freedom National an interest-free source of short-term cash and an important source of income.
But in mid-March, the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York banned the keeping of large business deposits overnight at Freedom National. They also cut sharply, from $15 million to $8 million, Freedom National's maximum balance for absorbing deposits from the tax and loan accounts, according to the bank's 1990 proxy statement. The reduction came even though Freedom National had Government securities worth at least $19 million posted as collateral, according to bank and Treasury officials.
 
A Matter of Timing
 Mr. Russell and other Freedom officials said they wanted to eventually reduce the bank's dependence on these funds, but not as fast as required by Treasury and the Fed.
But Freedom National officials said that when they talked to officials of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Treasury officials in Washington, the New York officials told them to talk to Washington and vice versa. Freedom eventually appealed directly to the Secretary of the Treasury, Nicholas F. Brady. (The Bank of New England had hired as its chief liaison with Federal regulators R. T. McNamar, a former Deputy Secretary of the Treasury under President Ronald Reagan.)
In May, Mr. Russell, the bank president, wrote Mr. Brady that he was concerned that "for the first time in Freedom's involvement" in the tax and loan program the department had begun enforcing its collateral requirements. He proposed that the bank use as collateral "reverse repos." Reverse repurchase agreements are a common financing technique in which Government securities are purchased on a short-term basis with an agreement to sell them back at a set price.
 
An Official's Reply
 Gerald Murphy, the Treasury's Fiscal Assistant Secretary, wrote a reply to Mr. Russell, stating that "the frequency of the collateral deficiencies had exceeded Treasury's tolerances."
Mr. Murphy also wrote that while the use of reverse repos for collateral was not prohibited by Treasury regulations and was being done at two other minority-owned banks, the Treasury could not approve Freedom's plan "because of Freedom's financial situation."
"Treasury regulations are currently silent with regard to the use of reverse repos to collateralize" such deposits, Mr. Murphy wrote.
The Treasury official told the bank it was being granted the leeway to hold uncollateralized tax deposits the same day they were received, but not overnight. Overnight use of funds, Mr. Murphy wrote, "was not intended by Treasury to provide a major source of revenue to a financial institution," adding that some institutions "place too great reliance on that feature."
 
Order to Cease and Desist
 It was concern about Freedom National's condition that caused the bank's regulatory agency, the Office of the omptroller of the Currency, a unit of the Treasury Department, to propose last March a cease and desist order against some of the bank's lending activities. That was at about the same time that the Treasury and Federal Reserve officials curtailed the New York institution's use of Treasury deposits.
In late February, the Comptroller had issued a cease and desist order against the Bank of New England, and the bank then submitted the liquidity plan that called for, among other things, the use of Treasury tax and loan accounts, according to bank officials.
Soon thereafter, Treasury's balance at the Boston bank soared to $1.8 billion, helping the bank drastically reduce its dependence on higher-cost loans from the Federal Reserve, according to bank officials and documents. After the bank collapsed earlier this month, financial analysts said the Treasury funds had helped the bank stay alive.
Last month, Robert R. Glauber, the Treasury's Under Secretary for Finance, told the Senate Banking Committee that Treasury funds were not being used to finance weak banks and that any collateral deficiencies were "quickly" corrected.

HEADLINE: U.S. AND MOSCOW POSTPONE SUMMIT

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
The United States and the Soviet Union announced today that they were postponing the meeting between President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that had been scheduled for Feb. 11-13 in Moscow.
The official reasons given for the delay were Mr. Bush's reluctance to travel far from Washington during the Persian Gulf war and the inability of the two sides to conclude the treaty on reductions in long-range nuclear weapons that they had planned to sign at the meeting. 
 Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the Soviet Foreign Minister, Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, said the meeting would be rescheduled for sometime in the "first half" of 1991. They made the joint announcement after Mr. Bessmertnykh's talks at the White House with President Bush.
 
Administration's Reluctance
 Mr. Baker and Mr. Bessmertnykh presented the postponement as a mutual decision unrelated to the violent crackdown on pro-independence demonstrators in the Baltic republics of Latvia and Lithuania. But American officials said the decision was driven largely by the Bush Administration's reluctance to appear to be engaging in business as usual with Mr. Gorbachev.
Leading Republicans in the House and Senate warned Mr. Bush last week that a trip to Moscow at this time would be widely opposed in Congress. The White House apparently did not want to stir up a second foreign policy dispute at a time of division in the United States over the gulf war.
Nor apparently did the Bush Administration want to undermine or embarrass Mr. Gorbachev by canceling the summit meeting on account of his treatment of the Baltic republics.
The statement said simply:
"By mutual agreement, Presidents Bush and Gorbachev will be rescheduling their summit in Moscow, originally planned for February, to a later date in the first half of this year. The gulf war makes it inappropriate for President Bush to be away from Washington. In addition, work on the Start treaty will require some additional time. Both Presidents look forward to setting an exact summit date as soon as it becomes feasible to do so."
A deferential attitude also characterized public remarks by the two sides. Mr. Baker appeared to go out of his way to avoid criticizing the Soviets for their behavior in the Baltic states, and Mr. Bessmertnykh seemed to return the favor by muting his earlier criticism of the intense aerial bombardment of Iraq by American-led forces.
American officials said Mr. Bessmertnykh warned Mr. Baker in private talks that citing the crackdown on the Baltic republics as a reason for canceling the meeting would only strengthen the hand of conservatives is Moscow. Hard-liners might argue that since relations with Washington were already sour, the Kremlin need not feel constrained in repressing the Baltic independence movements, the Foreign Minister reportedly told Mr. Baker.
 
First Such Delay Since 1960
 The postponement marked the first time that a scheduled summit meeting between the two nations has been put off since 1960. Moscow canceled a meeting set that year between Khrushchev and Eisenhower after an American U-2 spy plane was shot down over Soviet territory and its pilot, Francis Gary Powers, captured.
The decision was also the most tangible sign that relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, which have steadily improved since the day Mr. Bush took office, are now beginning to cool. Mr. Gorbachev has increasingly failed to meet American expectations that he would shift from a Communist to a market economy and loosen his tight control over independence-minded Soviet republics.
Seeking to limit the damage to relations, Administration officials began trying several days ago to steer reporters away from the crackdown in the Baltics as a reason for the summit's postponement, saying their only concern was that President Bush remain in the country while the war is raging.
They argued that travel might make communications with the Pentagon difficult -- even though the White House has a traveling communications center that can put Mr. Bush in touch with the Pentagon from anywhere in the world.
 
Not Like 'Going to Cleveland'
 The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said earlier today: "Our main concern is just the Persian Gulf conflict. A trip halfway around the world is fairly extraordinary. It's not like going to Cleveland."
Asked if the Soviet Union, which had pushed hard for the meeting, was disappointed, Mr. Bessmertnykh replied, "It was a mutual decision, so there was no disappointment."
Mr. Bessmertnykh's attempt to play down any differences over the meeting was typical of his public remarks and those of Mr. Baker. The Soviet official clearly abandoned his earlier harsh criticism of American military action in the gulf and Mr. Baker clearly muted any criticism of Soviet policy in the Baltics.
Pressed by reporters on whether the Baltics had any effect on the decision, Mr. Baker said: "The question of the Baltics was discussed at quite some length. It has been discussed by the Minister and myself over five hours. It was discussed here by the Minister and the President during the course of their meeting. We have made our substantial concerns known to the Soviet Union in a substantial way."
 
Says Gorbachev Is 'Wrestling'
 Asked for a more general assessment of Mr. Gorbachev's status, Mr. Baker said the Soviet leader was "wrestling with a number of problems" and was "coping with them to the best of his ability."
Then it was Mr. Bessmertnykh's turn. Asked whether the American military had gone too far in the gulf, something that he had suggested twice in the last three days, he responded:
"The United States is doing its important part in implementing the United Nations Security Council resolutions. And it is getting moral and the other kind of support in those actions, because the aim is to get the aggressor back from the country he occupied. And this is a goal which is a mutual goal, and we are going to get that task achieved."
While the joint statement appeared to be less than straightforward about the relevance of the Baltic republics to the postponement, its reference to the incomplete negotiations for a treaty to reduce strategic nuclear weapons was quite legitimate.
 
Hoping to Finish Treaty
 Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev had originally planned to sign the treaty at the meeting next month. Mr. Baker said that Mr. Bessmertnykh and President Bush agreed that the two countries would try to conclude the strategic arms reduction treaty, also known as Start, by the end of February. If completed, the treaty would slash Soviet and American long-range nuclear bombers and missiles by about 30 percent.
The eight-year negotiations are now down to some highly technical matters involving how the two sides monitor each other's missile factories to guard against cheating, and how they obtain data from each other's missile-flight tests to insure that weapons remain within the treaty's limits.

HEADLINE: Trump Castle Lays Off 190

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY, Jan. 28

 BODY:
Nearly 200 employees were laid off today at the Trump Castle Casino Resort to save money. Donald J. Trump also announced that he had hired a new president for the Trump Plaza casino.
Roger Wagner, the president of Trump Castle, said the 190 workers laid off were from the management and executive levels. About 3,400 employees remain, said Mr. Wagner, who was hired away from the Claridge Casino Hotel this month to cut costs at Trump Castle.
Mr. Wagner said the declining economy and flat gambling market prompted the need to cut costs.
Trump Castle has been the weak sister of three Atlantic City properties owned by Mr. Trump. The third and newest of these is the Trump Taj Mahal.
The Trump Plaza's new president and chief operating officer will be Kevin DeSanctis, a former executive of the Mirage hotel and casino in Las Vegas and a former member of the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement.
Mr. DeSanctis, 38 years old, replaces Gary Selesner, who had been interim president and chief operating officer since April. Mr. Selesner will remain in a senior executive position, Mr. Trump said.

HEADLINE: What Really Threatens the Environment?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
ARE Americans preoccupied with relatively modest environmental threats while neglecting big ones that could unleash catastrophe?
To a large extent, some scientists and Government officials believe, the answer is yes. William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, told a Senate committee in Washington on Friday that in many cases, the public and Congress are at odds with scientists over which environmental threats are the most serious. He has begun a campaign to reassess those priorities, and he leaves no doubt that his money is on the scientists. 
 "Sound science is our most reliable compass," he says in speeches calling for the nation to establish environmental priorities.
Mr. Reilly's campaign is intended to stimulate a national debate over environmental goals. And at a time when many of the most obvious and clear-cut environmental threats like air pollution and water pollution have been addressed and more subtle, complex problems are coming to the fore, the campaign may usher in a new, more complicated and more contentious phase in the national environmental struggle.
 
Mismatch of Perceptions
 There seems little doubt of a mismatch between public perceptions of environmental risk and those of the scientists. Oil spills, hazardous waste, underground storage tanks and releases of radioactive materials, for instance, have aroused high emotions, generated reams of reports and prodded Congress to spend billions of dollars. Opinion surveys place them in the front ranks of public concern about the environment.
But in terms of the actual magnitude of risk they pose, scientists advising the E.P.A. rate them near the bottom of a broad array of environmental threats. This, the scientists say, is because their effects are relatively limited or short-lived or both.
At the same time, global warming and the destruction and alteration of natural habitats rank relatively low in public perception, polls show. But the scientists place them among the top risks because their potential consequences appear to be so damaging in the long run and their effects so widespread and difficult to reverse.
Federal environmental laws "are more reflective of public perceptions of risk than of scientific understanding of risk," the E.P.A. Science Advisory Board said in a report on environmental risks last fall. The scientists' report was the basis for Friday's hearings. Mr. Reilly and others say environmental problems are addressed unevenly, usually on the basis of episodic, momentary public anxieties about problems that, while frightening, represent a relatively limited threat: contamination of a local waterway by hazardous wastes, for example.
No one is suggesting that these problems should be ignored. Oil spills and other low-ranking risks can cause "real damage where and when they occur," Mr. Reilly told the senators. But, he said, "they are in a different league compared to some of our other problems, such as stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change, which have the potential to affect life everywhere, and for many years to come."
The advisory board identified four environmental threats to health that it said were in the front rank: outdoor air pollution, exposure of workers to chemicals, indoor air pollution and pollutants in drinking water.
 
Major Environmental Threats
 It established three categories of risk for threats that humans pose to the environment. Relatively high-risk problems of this nature included the global warming that many scientists predict will result from an increase in heat-trapping atmospheric gases produced by human activity; depletion of the ozone shield that protects Earth from the Sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation, and destruction and alteration of natural habitats and the extinction of species, with an accompanying loss of biological diversity.
A middle rank includes herbicides and pesticides, pollution of surface waters, acid precipitation and airborne toxic substances. Relatively low risk was assigned to oil spills, escape of radioactive materials, acid runoff to surface waters and pollution of groundwater.
Risks in this area of ecological threats were assigned largely on the basis of how many people a problem affects, how wide a geographical area is involved, and how serious and long-lasting the harm might be, said Dr. William Cooper, a zoologist and aquatic ecologist at Michigan State University who headed the board's panel on ecological risks.
On that basis, oil spills, for example, ranked low because their effects on coastal areas are relatively short-term and local. "The public doesn't perceive it that way," Dr. Cooper said, "but those ecosystems bounce back real fast."
By contrast, he said, the loss of natural habitats and the disappearance of species are top risks because they affect the economic welfare of future generations worldwide and because the loss is "virtually irreversible." Similarly, ozone depletion and global warming were placed in the top rank because they are worldwide problems and because their effects are potentially catastrophic and reversible only over decades.
Given the substantial cost of environmental protection, Mr. Reilly argues, it is all the more important to set sensible priorities as the next phase of environmental protection begins. The E.P.A. estimates the United States will spend nearly 3 percent of its gross national product on environmental protection by the end of this decade. The nation "can probably afford to spend 3 percent," Mr. Reilly said, "but we're not rich enough to spend it in the wrong places."
 
Doubts Are Raised
 While many environmentalists and politicians say it is a good idea to set priorities, doubts and possible points of dispute are cropping up.
Environmentalists who have devoted themselves to causes ranked low on the priority list are unlikely to stop pushing their interests. Others resist anything that might look like an effort to practice environmental triage, concentrating on some problems to the exclusion of others.
"I don't quarrel with the conclusion that global warming is the No. 1 threat," said David Doniger, a senior lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council. "But I don't think the only way you can tackle global warming is by not tackling hazardous wastes. We can and should, and can afford, to do it all."
Several Senators questioned on Friday whether scientists knew enough to set priorities confidently. Senator Dave Durenberger, Republican of Minnesota, asked whether science was as good a guide as public values. People know what environmental assets are important to pass on to future generations, he said.
The Science Advisory Board acknowledged that assessing relative risks was an imprecise science, since much was unknown about some environmental threats. The board noted in its report that environmental policy making "necessarily embodies subjective values" and that policy makers should take both science and public perceptions into account.
As more complex and challenging environmental threats dominate the discussion, the debate will probably be complicated by increasing uncertainty about the nature of environmental risks, noted Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who presided over the hearing. Science, he said, is a matter of complexity and probability, not simple certainty.
What this means is that when science is invoked as a guide to priorities, as Mr. Reilly and others believe it must be, clear-cut answers are harder to come by. As science investigates an issue, it often tends to raise as many questions as it answers. In the eyes of the public, this could weaken the claim of science as an arbiter of priorities.
 
Danger of Inaction
 But on the biggest risks, some scientists argue, uncertainty must not become cause for inaction. Much is uncertain about the magnitude and effects of global warming, for instance. By the time scientists know whether they are right or wrong about predictions of climatic catastrophe, Dr. Cooper said, it will be too late to do anything.
This requires "a whole different mind set," Dr. Cooper said.
"You don't care about being right," he said. "You just don't want to be wrong. Once the cost of being wrong gets too high, you go into a risk-aversion mode. You avoid the risk no matter what the cost."

HEADLINE: Experts Differ on Dissecting Leaders' Psyches From Afar

BYLINE: By DANIEL GOLEMAN

 BODY:
AS Government officials and military tacticians struggle to determine the aims and methods of Saddam Hussein, questions are being raised anew about the usefulness of psychological profiles.
These profiles have established themselves in academic circles as a sound method for the detailed understanding of a single life, particularly in retrospect. But many experts on political behavior challenge their use in trying to predict the actions of a living world leader. 
 A detailed psychological study of Mr. Hussein, given in Senate testimony, depicts the Iraqi President as not clinically insane, but suffering from "malignant narcissism," a severe personality disorder that leaves him grandiose, paranoid and ruthless.
The study was prepared by Dr. Jerrold Post, a professor of psychiatry and politics at George Washington University.
For 21 years Dr. Post regularly made such psychiatric evaluations of world leaders as the founding director of the Center for the Analysis of Personality and Political Behavior, now part of an interdisciplinary Government agency that continues to provide psychological profiles of foreign leaders to the President and other senior officials.
Psychological profiles have their roots in Freud's work. In fact, some of the earliest psycholgical profiles were his case studies and his analysis of historical figures. Psychological profiles were first used by the Government in World War II and in the years since many experts have attempted to draw them. President Carter relied on psychological profiles of Anwar Sadat of Egypt and Menachem Begin of Israel when he conducted the talks that produced the Camp David accord.
Some experts object to the psychological effects of focusing on Mr. Hussein's personality flaws. "Making a demon of Saddam leads people to the assumption that he personifies all the troubles of the region, and that if we just get rid of him, everything will be all right," said Dr. Robert Jay Lifton, a New York psychiatrist whose books include a study of Nazi doctors.
And many experts question whether it is possible to draw useful conclusions about people from a distance. They particularly wonder about any profiles of Mr. Hussein, given the sparse and occasionally conflicting accounts of his early life.
"Psychoanalyzing someone from a different culture at a distance is very hard," said Robert Jervis, a political scientist at the Institute of War and Peace Studies at Columbia University.
Dr. Otto Kernberg, the Cornell University psychoanalyst who first proposed malignant narcissism as a diagnosis in 1984, said he knew too little about Saddam Hussein to apply the label to him.
 
'They Can't Empathize'
 But Dr. Post said there was evidence to show that Mr. Hussein meets the four conditions Dr. Kernberg set for a diagnosis of malignant narcissism: an extreme sense of grandiosity, sadistic cruelty, suspiciousness to the point of paranoia and an utter lack of remorse. Both Hitler and Stalin fit the pattern, Dr. Kernberg said.
Such people, said Dr. Kernberg, are so self-absorbed that they see other people solely as instruments to their own ends. "They can't empathize at all, but they can still make a shrewd assessment of how others will react," said Dr. Kernberg. "But they manipulate with no sense of how others feel inside."
Their grandiosity takes the form not just of arrogance, but of the deep belief that they have some special destiny in life that sets them apart from others. This grandiosity takes a malignant turn when it is combined with the conviction that any aggression is justified if it furthers one's goals.
Malignant narcissists are filled with sadism and "take pleasure in hurting others," Dr. Kernberg said. "They are extremely suspicious, seeing themselves as persecuted victims of a plot. They project their own cruelty on to their enemies."
The final malignant trait is lack of any moral sense or conscience. "They have none at all," said Dr. Kernberg. "They lie, cheat, exploit people without any remorse, though they can be loyal to people they feel they need."
Dr. Post sees these traits in Mr. Hussein, reflected in his speeches. "He identifies himself with Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian king who conquered Jerusalem in the sixth century B.C., and with Saladin, who captured Jerusalem from the crusaders in the 12th century," Dr. Post said. "Being at the center of the world stage fulfills the dreams of glory he's had since adolescence."
 
Paranoia Can Help
 Dr. Post sees paranoia in the Baathist Party ideology that Mr. Hussein has embraced. "Saddam Hussein says with sincerity that the problems of the Arabs came from the imperialist West, from the Jews and from the Persians," he said.
This doctrine was also articulated in a pamphlet written by Mr. Hussein's mentor and uncle, Khayrallah Tulfah, entitled "Three Whom God Should Not Have Created: Persians, Jews, and Flies." Mr. Hussein had the pamphlet reprinted in 1981.
"This paranoia can be helpful in political life, especially if you belong to a persecuted revolutionary group," said Dr. Kernberg. "But once you get into power yourself, you have to search out new enemies. For a dictator it typically takes the form, 'If you're not with me, you're against me.' "
Mr. Hussein's "paranoid outlook," said Dr. Post, "justifies his own aggression to himself.
"In his view, Kuwait waged economic warfare on him. His attack, then, was 'defensive,' in a war they initiated. He sees his own aggression as justified by the enemy, but does not see how he created the situation."
While Dr. Post's psychological analysis makes sense of many facts of Mr. Hussein's life, critics note that other interpretations are equally plausible, and that his diagnosis is based on a slim body of evidence.
For example, the key factor in childhood that seems to lead to malignant narcissism, said Dr. Kernberg, is "an extreme amount of cruelty, either witnessed or received."
 
A Cousin Could Read
 Because accounts of Mr. Hussein's childhood differ, Dr. Post is unable to say for sure that as a child the Iraqi leader was often beaten, as some biographers say. Mr. Hussein's father died at about the time the son was born. His mother married his father's brother, according to custom, and it was supposedly the stepfather who was cruel to the young Saddam.
The most famous incident of Mr. Hussein's childhood is his having been impressed at the age of 10 by the visit of a cousin who could read and write. When the young Saddam asked his parents if he, too, could go to school, the answer was no. That night, Saddam ran away to the home of his uncle near Tikrit, and went to school there. The uncle, an early member of the Baathist party and later a governor of Baghdad, shaped Saddam's world view.
Some political analysts point out that the Baathist ideology itself explains many or most of Mr. Hussein's actions. Other critics say that even if the diagnosis is correct, it may be of little use.
Saddam Hussein "seems a perfectly rational political decision-maker, given the circumstances, despite any personality twists," said Dr. Jervis. "For example, he can win by losing the war. If he survives he'll emerge a hero to the Arab masses."
Other experts object that diagnoses of a powerful leader are irrelevant. "When someone has immense political power, he transcends any psychatric label you might give him," said Dr. John Mack, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School and a founder of the International Society of Political Psychology. "You have to understand what he does in terms of his ideology, his culture and its view of the world, and his capacity to change the course of events."
 
Article on Goldwater
 Since World War II, when military intelligence commissioned a personality study of Hitler, there has been a cottage industry producing detailed psychological analyses of major political figures. The focal point of that industry, at least in the Federal Government, has been the center Dr. Post founded. The psychological assessments are used in briefings of Government officials for meetings or negotiations.
Within the behavioral sciences, however, the general approach has come under sharp attack over the years. Its greatest fall into disrepute came in the wake of an article in Fact Magazine in 1964 in which several hundred psychiatrists offered glib psychiatric assessments of Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, the Republican Presidential candidate. As a result, it is now considered unethical for psychotherapists to diagnose someone they have not interviewed or studied intensively.
That does not apply, however, to personality studies based on detailed research about the circumstances of someone's life. For example, Dr. Post's analysis, unlike the off-the-cuff psychiatric diagnoses of Senator Goldwater, drew on a wide variety of sources, ranging from the half dozen biographies of Mr. Hussein and his speeches, to interviews with people who have had personal dealings with him.
Recent years have seen increasing intellectual respect for such detailed psychological histories, or "psychobiography," often of historical figures like Woodrow Wilson, Virginia Woolf or Freud himself.
In making his study of Saddam Hussein, Dr. Post did not have access to many key details of his life. "To do a thorough psychobiography of Saddam Hussein, you'd need detailed information about his childhood and later life that we just don't have," said William McKinley Runyan, a psychologist at the Institute of Personality Assessment and Research at the University of California at Berkeley.
 
Friendliness as Weakness
 But despite the fragmentary information available about Mr. Hussein's personal life, Dr. Runyan said the psychological analysis was "still worth having," adding, "Knowing the psychological profile of a leader like Hussein seems a necessary component of knowing how to deal with him more skillfully."
For example, drawing on what is known about those with malignant narcissism, Dr. Kernberg said, "they only respect power and strength," adding, "They see friendliness or compromise as weakness. The danger is that they may not be able to assess that a danger is real, because their grandiosity may make them feel invulnerable."
But the predicitve value of psychological profiles has limits. Dr. Post, who said before Jan. 15 that Mr. Hussein would probably back down from a confrontation at the last minute, said, "These are patterns and tendencies. You can say how someone has reacted in past crises, but you can't make hard predictions" based on personality alone.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
Qualify for Good Job

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
Times are hard and good jobs are not easy to get. But here's a simple test to find out if you qualify for a well-paying position as an opinion maker in the field of international affairs.
All you have to do is prove that over the past 12 months you have publicly taken the positions listed below on the Soviet Union and the Middle East. 
 The Soviet Union:
1. Mikhail Gorbachev's survival as leader of the Soviet Union is essential to American interests, the well-being of the Soviet people and world peace. Without him the deluge, never mind what Soviet democrats say to the contrary.
2. Under Mr. Gorbachev, the power of the K.G.B. is finished for good. No Soviet citizen will ever again fear the nighttime knock on the door, bless him.
3. The United States must channel money, credits, food, everything it can afford right to Mr. Gorbachev. We must hurry before we lose our chance to help him, and establish an economic foothold in his new Soviet free-market world.
4. The Baltic nations are making a nuisance of themselves by demanding independence. One day maybe he will give them all the freedom that is good for them. Until then, they should shut up and be patient.
5. That was a nifty decision of the Nobel people to give Mr. Gorbachev the Peace Prize.
On the Middle East:
1. The real problem of the Middle East is the struggle between Israel and the Palestinians. If the intransigent Israelis would settle that by giving up land to a new Palestinian state, the threat of any war in the Middle East would be all over.
2. Saddam Hussein is vital to the stability of peace in the Middle East, to say nothing about the stability of the price of oil. He may be a terrorist, but we need him and have to be pragmatic.
3. Saddam Hussein will not invade Kuwait.
4. Well, all right, he did invade Kuwait, but the way to get him out is to sanction him to death. He is already so weak that he couldn't stand more than a few more months of it. Forget that scare talk about how he is building up his strength, not fading away, as we wait.
5. Hafez al-Assad of Syria is vital to the stability of peace in the Middle East, to say nothing about the stability of the price of oil. He may be a terrorist, but we need him and have to be pragmatic.
Now, if you can prove you supported all 10 positions, there is no limit to the jobs for which you can qualify, including Secretary of State. Most experts outside the Government cannot claim number 3 in the Middle East section -- they never even thought of the possibility. But if you missed on a few, don't despair. You could still be one of those specialist-professors who are hired as experts by the networks, or a columnist, or an editorial writer, or appear on TV programs where everybody gets paid to shout at everybody else.
Plenty of all those types have taken anywhere from five to nine of those positions. Some score higher in one category than the other. Depends on which is stronger -- their wishfulness about the Soviet Union, or their detestation of Israel.
But please note the tricky opening paragraph. I said you would qualify as an international expert -- I never actually promised you the job.
There are four hitches.
1. The people who took so many of those stands are still in their jobs, so there are not many openings. They have no intention of resigning because of a few lousy mistakes.
2. To get one of these great jobs, you have to know how to hint that history will prove you right after all. You need the skill of rewriting history -- like saying that Gorby couldn't make it only because Soviet democrats pushed him too hard for freedom.
3. You also have to predict a future that will fit in with your past mistakes. Like: Total chaos will envelop the Soviet Union without Mr. Gorbachev, or the defeat of Iraq will leave a terrible "power vacuum."
4. This is important -- you also have to hold deep grudges. Never forget that one day the war with Iraq will be over and then we can really stick it to Israel.
So maybe you won't get the job after all. But there is a consolation prize. If you have taken the test, maybe you won't put so much credence in the words of all those opinion makers who have demonstrated their simple-mindedness about Communism or their soft-mindedness about Arab dictators, or both, but are still on the job, predicting away, analyzing like mad, same as ever.

Couture in Crisis
It is an especially delicate moment for the couture business. Many clients and journalists have stayed away from the Paris shows, as much for fears of terrorism as for the fact that the declining dollar has made some dresses as costly as a Mercedes. 
 With a shrinking list of perhaps 2,500 clients worldwide for such high-priced frippery, there has been dark talk of haute couture dying out. Houses like Nina Ricci and Jean-Louis Scherrer are in distress because up to 50 percent of their customers come from wealthy Arab nations. Pierre Balmain canceled its couture program in December, saying it was too expensive to keep going.
The Chanel show scheduled for today will cost about $2.4 million to mount, including the price of the sample garments, according to a report in Le Figaro, a Paris newspaper. The cost is said to be justified in part by the publicity generated.
Aside from the fact that the major players don't eat, couture is not that much different from the Super Bowl. Both are pumped-up spectator sports with related spin-off businesses. Instead of promoting beer and cars, couture is said to promote sales of perfumes, accessories and ready-to-wear clothes.
But fashion executives, while acknowledging the hype, take the view that these collections represent the apex of fashion creativity.
"I always find the couture directional," said Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue, who flew to Paris for the collections. "On one level or another it affects fashion. What you see in the spring couture sets the pace for the fall ready-to-wear."
As an example, Ms. Wintour mentioned the red asymmetric suits shown by Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel on the couture runway for last spring, which also cropped up in the Chanel ready-to-wear, or mass-produced, collection for fall.
"Particularly now, in difficult economic times for fashion, it's important to see everything," Ms. Wintour added.
 
Men's Wear and Reality
The Paris couturiers are not the only ones undergoing an existential crisis. American men's wear designers are staging their seasonal shows in New York this week, amid news of war and a continuing recession in their business.
Robert Comstock canceled his fall men's wear show, citing concern about the Persian Gulf crisis. Ronaldus Shamask called off his show because fabric shipments from Italy were delayed in customs. Isaac Mizrahi decided not to hold a show this week for other reasons. In his debut collection last year, Mr. Mizrahi may have overdazzled his audience.
"Honestly, I think I confused everybody," Mr. Mizrahi said. "With a women's fashion show, every passage has to be fascinating, or it doesn't walk. Women's sportswear buyers know enough not to order certain things. However, men's wear buyers insist that men wear the clothes styled as they were in the show."
Mr. Mizrahi's fall men's wear line had mixed results, he said. The coats, at $800 to $1,200, sold well; but suit jackets, at about the same price, were less successful. They didn't "look the money," as the saying goes.
For his new men's wear, Mr. Mizrahi said he was taking a page from Donna Karan's book and designing for real needs.
"If I wouldn't wear it," he said, "I won't do it."
 
Saks and the Larger Woman
Saks Fifth Avenue will begin stocking large sizes for women this spring.
"We think there is a need," said Helen O'Hagan, a senior vice president of the store. "There is a big petite market, but we really want to offer clothes in large sizes at our taste level." Large size is 16 and up.

HEADLINE: Ideas to Help Poor Abound, But a Consensus Is Wanting

SERIES: The Missing Agenda: Poverty and Policy - Last of three articles.

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE with PETER APPLEBOME

 BODY:
Wanted: An American anti-poverty policy. Strategy must offer reasonable prospect for ending cycles of dependency and despair that disfigure urban America. Long hours and serious commitment needed. Costs may be high. Costs of doing nothing may be higher.
The want ad for an American social policy might go on to list other requirements: a passionate leader to articulate it, taxpayers willing to pay for it, special interests that sacrifice for it, skilled administrators to apply it. 
 While some have argued that the nation has run out of ideas, a wealth of research in the late 1980's has produced many new proposals for helping the disadvantaged.
"There's been increased attention and vigorous debate among a range of specialists and some policy makers about new approaches," said Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research and advocacy group. "But I think the public is only dimly aware of a fair amount of the policy debate."
Ideas on ghetto poverty tend to cluster in four schools of thought. One emphasizes an expanded network of traditional government social services. Another stresses economic policies to create more good jobs that would offer a way out of poverty. A third stresses welfare reform. The fourth calls for "empowering" poor people with programs that let them make choices in areas like housing and education.
Some of the strategies are complementary: expanded social programs and welfare reform might work hand in hand, for instance, and some experts call for both. But other proposals are in conflict. Some emphasize building up inner-city areas, while others talk about helping people escape them. Some suggest universal programs in which all Americans can participate, while others say efforts should be aimed at the neediest.
The last Congress acted on some of these ideas when it expanded tax credits that provide cash supplements for the working poor, and financing for Medicaid and Head Start, despite tight budgets. And Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp, the Administration's chief antipoverty strategist, has sent President Bush a list of possible initiatives and urged him to use tonight's State of the Union Message to propose "audacious solutions" to inner-city poverty. But Administration officials say that after much bickering among aides President Bush has chosen a less ambitious domestic line.
 
Attention Is Diverted
 With recession and war capturing the nation's attention, progress on the domestic front may be stopped cold, and that frightens social policy experts of many ideological shades. They argue that America is fighting a war at home to preserve its own ideal of an equal citizenry, and that this fight is one the country cannot afford to lose.
"I think we're fighting a second Civil War here, and like the first Civil War, money shouldn't be the problem," said Lawrence Mead, a political scientist at New York University who describes himself as conservative. "We're trying to prevent a secession of the poor -- from work, school, politics, from mainstream institutions of every kind."
"We're in the 1862 stage," he said, speaking of a year when the Union Army met several defeats. "It could go either way."
 
A Social Approach
 
Old Programs Provide Models
To many liberals, the bitterest element of today's domestic policy environment is the widespread perception that government programs for the poor do not work, an attitude they say was stoked by the anti-government attitudes of the Reagan Administration.
Liberal academics like Lisbeth B. Schorr of Harvard University or advocates like Marian Wright Edelman of the Children's Defense Fund argue that there is ample evidence that government spending, if properly targeted, on schools, housing, health care and job training can be invaluable in breaking the cycle of poverty.
"It's a lie that nothing works," said Ms. Edelman, "and I think more and more people are realizing that. The fact is we made dramatic progress in the 1960's in eradicating hunger and improving the health status of children, and then we just stopped trying."
When arguing the effectiveness of government programs, advocates cite one more than any other: Head Start. A study of the best-known program applying Head Start principles, the Perry Preschool in Ypsilanti, Mich., tracked students for 16 years after they finished the program, and concluded that each dollar spent saved $6 in subsequent expense for things like remedial education, criminal justice and social services.
Advocates say the Head Start principle of concentrated flexible programs can be employed in many other areas, including health care, education and job training. In her book "Within Our Reach," published by Anchor Press Doubleday in 1988, Ms. Schorr examines numerous poverty programs that she concludes are making important differences.
In Tacoma, Wash., she says, the Homebuilders program uses social workers to counsel the families of troubled teen-agers, keeping them out of foster care or jail. In Elmira, N.Y., she points to the Pre-Natal/Early Infancy Project, which has lowered rates of infant mortality by sending nurses and social workers into the homes of pregnant poor women.
 
Skeptics Raise Questions
 Many other experts have pointed to the work of Dr. James Comer, a New Haven educator, in arguing that the sustained efforts of educators and social workers can make a difference in the lives of the poor. His School Development Program has raised the academic performance of poor children by using teachers and social workers to get parents involved in the schools.
But skeptics abound. Some say that the successes, including Head Start, have been oversold and that few programs have worked for the most imperiled group: young, noncollege-bound males. Others say the underlying social ills of slums and larger economic forces working against the urban poor mean that government programs can produce only isolated successes at best. And some successes, skeptics argue, are built from the efforts of especially talented administrators. They may therefore be impossible to replicate on a large scale.
Cost is also often an issue in these times of tight budgets, with estimates for a broad array of antipoverty programs ranging from $10 billion to $25 billion. But Ms. Schorr argues that the problem is will, not wallet.
"I don't know why it is 'possible' to find $500 billion to bail out the savings and loan industry and the money it takes to fight Saddam Hussein," she said, "but it's not 'possible' to find the money it takes to meet this equally grave threat."
 
An Economic Approach
 
Job Opportunity Is Seen as the Key
While liberal intervention programs focus on raising the mental and emotional capital of the poor, a different set of policies focuses more directly on their economic prospects.
One of the most influential thinkers on urban poverty over the past decade has been William Julius Wilson, the University of Chicago professor and author of "The Truly Disadvantaged," published by the University of Chicago Press. He argues that poverty and its associated problems ultimately arise from economic forces that are beyond the control of poor people.
Slums deteriorated, he argues, primarily because well-paying industrial jobs died out or companies fled the central cities. Any serious solution must take aim at the roots of inner-city problems through economic policies that promote full and profitable employment.
"I really believe that if you increase educational opportunity and employment opportunity, a lot of the social problems would disappear," Mr. Wilson said. "If all of a sudden people see they have some chance of moving out of their situation, then their behavior changes."
Those who agree with Professor Wilson's analysis call for a broad array of economic approaches, including policies to promote full employment, programs to train and relocate all displaced or new workers and the creation of government jobs.
In addition, most call for other policies to insure that working people are able to support their families. These include the use of tax benefits to supplement the earnings of the working poor, national health insurance, and a stricter enforcement of child-support awards, with the Government making the payment when it fails to collect.
 
Programs Available to All
 Professor Wilson says the main provisions of his plan -- like the job training and relocation programs, the health insurance and the child support guarantees -- would be available to all Americans, not just the poor.
Supporters of such universal programs argue that they would bring more political support, and less social stigma, than programs exclusively for the poor. The call for universal programs also reflects the belief that the problems of the poor are not so much a separate phenomenon as they are a concentrated example of the larger national social and economic difficulties.
Other analysts who are skeptical of such a macroeconomic approach note that creation of a full-employment economy has eluded policy makers for most of the century. Some say racism is so much a part of the inner-city problem that a strong economy would not always benefit the black poor.
Others note that many immigrants continue to succeed in the American economy as it is. The main inner-city problem, they argue, is not economics but social ills like the underground drug economy and welfare dependency that leave many inner-city poor people incapable of capitalizing on the opportunities that already exist.
"The behavior of the long-term poor is a real mystery," said Professor Mead, the New York University welfare expert. "It's not clear why they don't do what most immigrants do -- work hard and get ahead."
 
A Reform Approach
 
Altering Welfare In Novel Ways
A different group of experts believes that any antipoverty strategy is doomed without an accompanying overhaul, or a complete replacement, of the nation's welfare system.
"If you change welfare you will change the material basis for the culture of poverty," said Mickey Kaus, a senior editor at The New Republic magazine and the author of an influential article on welfare reform who is writing a book about antipoverty strategies. "Everything else is tinkering. It's good tinkering, but it's tinkering."
The current system, he and others argue, allows generations of single mothers to view unemployment as a way of life. In addition, it penalizes women who do try to work, since the low-wage jobs they can land often fail to make up for lost Medicaid benefits and the additional expenses of child care and transportation.
But there is considerable disagreement about how far government should go in requiring mothers on welfare to work and in supplementing their income with benefits like tax credits, medical insurance and child care.
Among those who see welfare reform as the key to antipoverty policy is Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who is the architect of the 1988 Family Support Act, Congress's most recent attempt to change the welfare system. Senator Moynihan argues that in passing the law, Congress has already laid the groundwork for a successful welfare system and that further change should await the results of this legislation, which he said will not be clear for at least 10 years.
The law requires states to enroll 20 percent of their eligible welfare population in job training or education programs by 1995. And it tries to make work profitable by guaranteeing child care and Medicaid for a year after a mother leaves welfare.
 
Doubts, and Other Ideas
 Some skeptics doubt the policy will reach the most disadvantaged. They argue that it compels too few to participate and provides too little to those who do work.
"It's a good first step, as long as it's a first step," said Professor David T. Ellwood, a poverty expert at Harvard.
In calling for a more ambitious program, Professor Ellwood says the country should offer a guarantee that no full-time worker would remain in poverty. To do this, he calls for expanded tax credits, which provide cash to low-wage workers, and an increased minimum wage. In addition, he advocates Government guarantees of child support from missing parents, child care and health insurance.
Once these methods had insured that work was a road out of poverty, he said, the Government should combat dependency by placing a time limit of two or three years on welfare payments. Those still unemployed at the end of their limit should be offered Government jobs, he said, but denied the extra cash benefits.
Mr. Kaus accepts those principles, but wants to take them further and faster. "Why give young mothers two or three years to be sucked into dependency?" he said.
He argues that welfare should be abolished completely for new recipients and replaced with a system of guaranteed government public works jobs, to men and women alike. The pay would be just below the minimum wage, to encourage recipients to leave for the private sector.
Government would provide those working such jobs with tax breaks, child care and medical insurance, to insure that all who took the jobs would be lifted out of poverty.
"You put the moral choice in its simplest and starkest terms," Mr. Kaus said. "If you work, we'll make sure your income is above the poverty line. If you don't work, the Government is not going to give you a check."
Among the objections raised to Mr. Kaus's plan is its expense, which he estimates would be in the $40 billion range, and the enormous difficulty of administering it.
Others say an overhaul of welfare, in aiming at women, does not provide sufficient incentives for undereducated men, and does not address other urban problems like crime, lack of affordable housing or bad schools.
Moreover it raises the problem of what to do with people who simply refuse to work, by constantly calling in sick, for instance, or showing up drunk or on drugs.
Mr. Kaus acknowledges that such people -- and their children -- would be forced to rely on private charities and shelters. "Some of them might become a more severely straitened class," he said, "but it wouldn't be anywhere near the size it is today."
 
An 'Empowering' Approach
 
Making Success Matter of Choice
When Mr. Kemp, the Housing Secretary, is asked to summarize his plans for what he calls "a new war on poverty," he sometimes resorts to a single word: "empowerment."
What is it?
Philosophically, it is the argument that poor people have been robbed of the choices available to others by their reliance on monopolistic government bureaucracies, particularly in the areas of welfare, housing and schools. "Empower" them with choices, the argument goes, and they will thrive.
In its particulars, empowerment most often boils down to policies that encourage the poor to run their own housing projects or own their own homes and that allow parents to chose which schools their children will attend. If forced to compete for students, the empowerment argument goes, schools will improve.
In addition, Mr. Kemp has called for tax policies, most notably capital gains cuts and the creation of "enterprise zones," which he says will provide the incentives to attract businesses and new job opportunities to the inner cities.
Mr. Kemp often attacks the current welfare system, but he has been unspecific in proposing an alternative. Of programs that require work in exchange for welfare benefits he said, "Workfare is a form of a stick; I think we need, dramatically, more carrots."
In his own nod toward empowerment, President Bush last year appointed Mr. Kemp to head an Administration task force charged with finding other applications for the principle.
A list of options from across the Government, submitted to the President by Mr. Kemp late last fall, ranged from the bold to the bland. At one end was a proposal to "empower" families by raising the personal income tax exemption to $3,300 from $2,050, at a cost of $50 billion a year in lost revenue. At the other was a vague call to "enhance victims' rights."
Mr. Kemp rejects Professor Wilson's contention that the problems originate in the general economy. The problem, he argues, is that Government policies on housing, education and welfare have created what he terms socialist economies in the inner city that have eliminated incentives for personal effort.
Critics argue that Mr. Kemp has substituted windy optimism for a clear appraisal of the depths of inner city need. Exhortations about the joys of entrepreneurship and home ownership, they say, will do little for people who have never worked or whose skills can land them only minimum-wage jobs.
"It's Pollyannish," said Isabel Sawhill of the Urban Institute, a Washington research center. "I think it's too optimistic about the ability of the poor to suddenly transform themselves into middle-class citizens."
Some argue the best solution is not to build up slums but to get their residents out. One conspicuous success story is the Gautreaux program in Chicago, which, under a 1976 court order, has relocated more than 4,150 families from public housing into subsidized apartments in neighborhoods throughout the Chicago area.
Studies show that those relocated have far better chances of working and avoiding antisocial acts. Only budget constraints and a shortage of available apartments keep the program from being larger.
Ed Marciniak, an urban affairs professor at Loyola University in Chicago, says that Mr. Kemp "is in dream world when he talks of tenant ownership."
"What people in poverty need are neighborhoods, communities," Mr. Marciniak added, "and it's difficult to have a neighborhood in a public housing project. What you need to do is build ladders out."
But such complaints fall on deaf ears, and Mr. Kemp reponds evangelically. "Entrepreneurial capitalism and empowerment can work," he said. "Let's unleash the greatest wealth our nation has: the pent-up talents and potential of our people."

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front- page article on Tuesday about poverty and the national political agenda referred imprecisely to a remedy proposed by Mickey Kaus, an expert on welfare policy. Under his plan to replace the welfare system with a program of guaranteed Government jobs, people who refuse to work would not receive Government payments but could be aided by Government programs that provide services.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: THE OVERVIEW;
80 OF IRAQ'S PLANES NOW IN IRAN; HOSTS' INTENT CALLED A PUZZLE; U.S. SAYS FLOW OF OIL IS STEMMED

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia, Jan. 28

 BODY:
More than 80 Iraqi warplanes have been flown to Iran by their pilots in recent days, including more than 60 fighters and bombers, the United States reported today.
American officials suggested but said they were unable to confirm that the exodus of Iraqi planes had been coordinated between Baghdad and Teheran and was not the result of individual defections by pilots. The exodus amounts to 10 percent of the Iraqi Air Force and includes some of Iraq's most advanced French and Soviet-made planes. 
 Lieut. Gen. Thomas Kelly, the Pentagon operations director, said the United States was ready to shoot the Iraqi planes down if they tried to leave Iran and enter the war.
 
Combat Role Doubted
 But he said he did not think that they would be used in combat because grounded aircraft "begin to break after a time" without spare parts and regular maintenance. He indicated that the Iranians were not in a position to provide such help, saying Teheran did not have similar airplanes, "or not very many of them, so they are somewhat in jeopardy in terms of their longevity."
With the Iraqi Air Force heading for Iranian sanctuary in ones and twos, the American command said an attack by United States warplanes apparently succeeded in cutting off Iraq's release of crude oil into the Persian Gulf. The Saudi Government estimated that the slick had reached more than 450 million gallons, or nearly 11 million barrels, making it the largest spill in history.
An international task force gathered here to fight the ecological and economic consequences of the disaster, including a team of American experts assembled at President Bush's orders. A specialized Norwegian ship fitted with huge booms arrived off the neighboring island sheikdom of Bahrain, and Britain began the dispatch of 70 to 90 tons of equipment to be used to protect power and desalting plants. [Page A11.]
 
Saddam Hussein Interviewed
 The Cable News Network's correspondent in Baghdad, Peter Arnett, reported that in an interview tonight, President Saddam Hussein asserted that Iraq was justified in using oil for self-defense. [Page A12.]
Mr. Arnett said that in the interview, conducted in a bungalow on the outskirts of Baghdad, Mr. Hussein strongly hinted that he would use chemical weapons if his back was to the wall. The Iraqi leader was also quoted by Mr. Arnett as saying he had dispatched Iraqi planes to Iran because the two countries were Muslim states that viewed the gulf war as a struggle against infidels. Mr. Arnett is the last correspondent for a major American news organization still in Baghdad.
British authorities put the total number of Iraqi planes now at various airfields in Iran at more than 100, but in Washington, officials said a recheck showed 80 to 85 planes had been recorded by the end of the day. The Foreign Office said that Teheran had given the British ambassador fresh assurances that the planes would be detained and the pilots interned for the duration of the war.
 
No Interceptions Made
 Although General Kelly said that the United States has seen some of the planes leaving Iraq on radar screens, no effort has been made to head them off or shoot them down. Asked to explain why, Pete Williams, the Pentagon spokesman, responded that "they weren't causing us any trouble."
The allies report that they have shot down 26 Iraqi aircraft since the war began on Jan. 16 and destroyed 24 other planes on the ground. Few have risen from their bases to challenge allied aircraft, causing some concern that President Hussein might well be husbanding his resources to try to mount a counterattack once allied forces invade Iraqi-occupied Kuwait.
"Their air force doesn't amount to much of a threat," General Kelly said at the daily briefing.
But Iraqi ground fire has brought down a number of allied planes, and seven American pilots are now listed as prisoners of war. Baghdad radio, which had previously said they would be used as human shields against allied bombing, said today that several had been hurt in American raids.
 
Marines Lose a Harrier
 In the air war, the United States lost its first plane in 72 hours, a Marine Corps Harrier jet that was brought down over Kuwait. The allies have reported the loss of 24 planes so far, 18 of them in combat, 11 of them American. With weather over Iraq again clear, allied pilots managed another 2,000-mission day, pushing the overall total so far to 24,000.
French Mirage and Jaguar warplanes took part in the assault, blasting Iraq's Republican Guards in their encampment along the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. Italian Tornados also played a role. British Tornados, which have specialized in low-level bombing and suffered heavy losses, were joined by a squadron of Buccaneers, high-altitude bombers first built in the 1960's.
Iraq's only response was the launching of Scud missiles at Israel and at Riyadh, the Saudi capital. One projectile aimed at Riyadh was intercepted by American Patriot missiles, and there were no reports of injury or severe damage there. One Scud missile aimed at Israel broke up in the air before any Patriots were fired at it, the Israeli authorities said.
Asked about complaints from Red Cross workers that allied planes had bombed the main road linking Baghdad with the Jordanian border, Brig. Gen. Pat Stevens 4th, the American logistics chief in the gulf, responded, "We do target main supply routes," but he insisted that pilots were "extremely careful not to cause any civilian deaths."
 
Ground Preparations Continue
 Although preparations for a ground offensive continued, with waves of C-130 Hercules transports heading north at dawn and roads leading to the Kuwaiti frontier crowded with tank transporters, cargo trucks, tankers and other types of vehicles, any such assault appeared to be at least two weeks away. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said on television on Sunday that all American ground troops would be in position for action by late February.
A Baghdad Radio broadcast asserted that an allied air attack on Sunday had created the oil spill. The allies spotted the slick several days before that, and said they had sent in United States F-111 bombers with "smart bombs" to cut the pipes from which much of the oil had been flowing.
The Saudi oil minister, Hismah Nazer, estimated the flow to date at almost 11 million barrels, equal to 460 million gallons, and many others put it hundreds of millions of gallons higher. On Mr. Nazer's estimate, the gulf spill is already larger than the biggest previously recorded, which was the blowout of the Ixtoc One well in Mexico in 1979 and 1980. That spilled from 2.5 million to 10.4 million barrels, or about 100 million to 440 million gallons, according to Government estimates at that time.
Col. Ahmed al-Robayan, a Saudi military spokesman, said the fires within the huge oil slick were now "getting smaller and smaller."
 
Oil Slick Slows
 It appeared the speed with which the oil was spreading had slowed markedly. This afternoon it was officially described as covering an area 35 miles long by 10 miles wide, as it was 24 hours before, and its forward point was again said to be just off the Saudi port of Ras Mishab, where it was said to be on Sunday night.
That news gave Saudi officials more time to get oil-trapping booms into place farther down the coast, especially at the big desalting plant at Jubail, north of Dhahran, which supplies half of all Saudi drinking water. But there appeared little that could be done to save the wildlife.
"It's a choice between clean drinking water and fish, and we've got to protect our drinking water first," a Saudi official commented.
The Pentagon confirmed the Saudi Government's statement on Sunday that the oil that has been washing ashore at the town of Khafji, near the Kuwaiti border, had come from oil tanks near Khafji that had been ruptured by enemy artillery fire. The larger mass of oil has not yet reached the shore, officials in Washington said.

HEADLINE: Bush Surrenders at Home

BYLINE: By Alan Brinkley; Alan Brinkley is professor of history at the City University of New York Graduate Center.

 BODY:
If anyone has reason to be grateful for the war in the Persian Gulf, it is the unfortunate White House speechwriter responsible for President Bush's State of the Union Address this evening. Without an international crisis, what would the President have to talk about?
Perhaps no Administration in this century has completed two years in office so devoid of domestic accomplishments and so uninterested in setting a domestic agenda. And there is no suggestion that anything will change soon. John Sununu captured the essence of the Administration's emptiness recently when he answered a question about what remained on the President's domestic agenda with a curt, "Not that much." Were it not for Saddam Hussein, the Bush Presidency would be nearly invisible. 
 The litany of Mr. Bush's domestic failures is already painfully familiar: the silly drumbeating for hopeless constitutional amendments, the embarrassing contortions leading up to a budget agreement that the President now claims makes him "gag," the bold promises about education, drugs and homelessness followed by almost complete inattention.
Not even Ronald Reagan managed to antagonize black leaders as quickly as Mr. Bush has done with his clumsy veto of the 1990 Civil Rights bill and his even clumsier handling of the Education Department's notorious directive on minority scholarships. With the nation heading into what could be a major recession and its banking and financial system on the verge of collapse, the Administration has no response other than to hope that things will get better soon.
What accounts for this vacuous record? The President blames it on the Democratic Party's control of Congress, and he is partly correct in that. Unlike Ronald Reagan, Mr. Bush inspires no fear -- and, if the budget negotiations are any indication, some contempt -- among Congressional Democrats, who seem eager to see him (and his obstreperous aides) fail.
But the President's critics are also partly correct when they blame the Administration's problems on its own conceptual emptiness. Throughout his nearly three decades in politics, Mr. Bush has been a man of highly malleable convictions. On domestic issues, at least, he has never given the slightest hint of a deep commitment to anything other than his own political needs. He entered office with no ideological base, no natural constituency and no discernible agenda. The Bush Administration not only lacks a domestic mission, it lacks the will to look for one.
But Mr. Bush's greatest problem is precisely what got him elected in the first place: the hard-won triumph of the right within the Republican Party, a triumph achieved -- after years of frustration -- by the creation of what is now being trumpeted as a "new paradigm." For 30 years after the New Deal, the Republican right struggled to halt and even reverse the growth of the Federal Government. All such efforts ended in futility.
Attacking Government programs directly, as right-wing Republicans from Robert Taft to Barry Goldwater discovered, does not attract majority support. Every Federal program has a political constituency. The biggest and most expensive programs have the broadest support. Voters might not like government in the abstract, but almost everyone has some stake in the things the Government does.
Not until Howard Jarvis launched a tax revolt in 1978 with Proposition 13 in California did the right discover that there was a better way to undermine government than by assailing specific programs: It was assailing taxes. By separating the issue of taxes from the issue of what taxes supported, the right achieved the most controversial elements of its own agenda (destroying the Government's ability to achieve new goals) without openly antagonizing the millions of voters who continued to expect a public response to social problems.
George Bush is now the unhappy legatee of this dubious victory, one he dutifully supported throughout the 1980's but in which he himself apparently never really believed. Unlike Ronald Reagan, he is not inherently hostile to government; on the contrary, he is its creature.
He speaks forlornly of social goals he would like to achieve if only there were more money, and is unable effectively to challenge the "new paradigm" of the Reagan years -- that cutting taxes and undermining government's ability to act is the best route to success. The President's feckless performance during the budget negotiations makes it clear that he has no idea how to make the case for increasing public revenues.
Trapped between a deteriorating social and economic climate crying out for Government intervention, and a deliberately emasculated public sector stripped of most of its traditional tools, the President is now little more than a not-very-interested observer of the course of domestic events. He has no apparent strategy and no visible ideas, only the faint echoes of stale campaign rhetoric.
"We have the kinder, gentler approach," President Bush told Time magazine recently. "It is catching on. They used to laugh about the thousand points of light. There are plenty of areas of this nature that I would readily concede we have got a long way to go [before we] fulfill what I would like to see done in the next two years." That is about as coherent as George Bush has ever been on the subject of domestic policy.

HEADLINE: Net at Scripps Declines 32.3%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CINCINNATI, Jan. 29

 BODY:
The E. W. Scripps Company, a diversified media concern, said on Monday that its fourth- quarter earnings dropped sharply because of reduced advertising revenues.
Earnings for the quarter that ended on Dec. 31 were $21 million, or 28 cents a share, down 32.3 percent from $31 million, or 40 cents a share, in the 1989 quarter, the company said. Scripps had an unusual gain of $2.3 million a year ago on the sale of its investment in American City Business Journals.
Revenue for the latest quarter was $345.5 million, down slightly from $346.3 million the previous year.
"The advertising recession continues to hurt our earnings," said Lawrence A. Leser, president and chief executive."Despite good cost control, the weakness impacted us significantly, particularly at the newspapers."
E. W. Scripps, which is based in Cincinnati, operates 19 daily newspapers, 9 television stations, 5 radio stations and cable television systems with 613,200 subscribers. It is also a worldwide syndicator of news features and comics.
For the year, net income was $48 million, or 63 cents a share, down 46.2 percent from $89.3 million, or $1.14 a share, in 1989. The 1990 figure includes a $36.4 million charge associated with the termination of the joint-operating agreement between The News-Sentinel and The Journal newspapers in Knoxville, Tenn. The charge reduced net income by $23.7 million, or 31 cents a share.
Revenue was $1.3 billion, up slightly from $1.27 billion.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises on War News; Gold Contract Prices Drop

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar closed higher against leading currencies yesterday, strengthened by news of at least one Iraqi raid into Saudi Arabia.
"Apparently Iraq knows its strength is on the ground," said Marc Cohen, vice president of Fuji Bank in New York. "Perhaps it it trying to lure the United States into a ground war prematurely."
 
February Contract Down 70 Cents
 Gold fell, meanwhile, with the price of the expiring January contract slipping 60 cents, to $376.10 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange. Gold for the active February contract fell 70 cents, to $376.40 an ounce.
The dollar, historically a safe holding for investors in time of crisis, tends to rise on bad news from the war zone in the Persian Gulf.
Accordingly, it closed at 1.4960 German marks, up from 1.4880 marks Monday. Against the Japanese currency, the dollar closed at 132.15 yen, up from 131.60 yen.
A senior United States military official said a dozen Iraqi soldiers slipped across the Saudi Arabian border Monday night and wounded three Saudis in an ambush.
 
'Next Step' in the War
 Iraq reported three cross-border attacks on Saudi Arabia, saying its units returned to their bases after seizing and destroying equipment.
"If Iraq continues these attacks, the U.S. will have to react," starting a ground war, Mr. Cohen predicted. "Apparently, we are embarking on the next step of the gulf crisis."
For most of the day, however, the dollar showed few trends. It was helped briefly by news that durable goods orders in the United States rose by a greater-than-expected 4.4 percent in December, but fell back somewhat when the Conference Board reported that the consumer confidence of Americans fell in January to its lowest level in 10 years.
The British pound closed at $1.9595, down from $1.9650 on Monday. Against the Swiss currency, the dollar closed at 1.2675 francs, up from 1.2630 francs.
The dollar closed at $1.1605 (Canadian), down from $1.1625 (Canadian) on Monday. The dollar also bought 5.0770 French francs, up from 5.0545 francs on Monday.

HEADLINE: India in an Uproar Over Refueling of U.S. Aircraft

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Jan. 29

 BODY:
A decision to allow United States military aircraft to refuel at Bombay's international airport en route from the Pacific to the Persian Gulf has set off a political outcry that could bring down the Government of Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar.
Beginning on Jan. 9, American C-141 transport planes stopped at Safar Airport in Bombay at the rate of about two a day, according to The Times of India, which first reported the refuelings on Monday. 
 The newspaper said the planes werecoming from the Philippines. A spokesman for the United States Embassy here, refusing to comment on the report, said today that diplomatic missions do not normally confirm or deny military movements.
Mr. Shekhar, who has since the beginning of the gulf war taken a stand more critical of Iraq than that adopted by nearly every other political party, is being accused of pandering to "American imperialism."
Among his sharpest critics are the leftists and the Congress Party of Rajiv Gandhi, whose support is needed to keep the Shekhar Government in power. Another former Prime Minister, V. P. Singh, has also opposed any policy that appears to favor the United States, saying that violates India's traditional posture of nonalignment.
A strategic analyst here, Bharat Wariavwalla, said in an interview today that it appeared that the Shekhar Government, in a significant departure, "was trying to distance itself from a kind of third-world romanticism about Saddam Hussein."
The decision to refuel American planes, which the Indian Government said were carrying no weapons or other war supplies, comes at a time when the domestic airline, Indian Airlines, has had to cut back its servicesby nearly one-third to conserve aviation fuel.
From the start of the gulf crisis in August, India has only half-heartedly backed United Nations condemnations of Iraq. Baghdad and New Delhi had close ties, diplomatically and economically. Indian expertise and labor had been used in Iraqi industrial and strategic development.
Last year, Iraq stood nearly alone among Islamic nations in refusing to join in condemnation of India's heavy suppression of an independence movement in Kashmir.
Soon after taking office in November, Mr. Shekhar, a pragmatic man with no experience in foreign policy, rejected attempts to link the annexation of Kuwait with Israeli occupation of areas claimed by Palestinians. On several occasions, he has said Mr. Hussein couldhave been more forthcoming in responding to efforts to avoid a war.
Mr. Shekhar's political enemies and Congress Party supporters, unable to deflect him from taking bold domestic steps like meeting leaders of militant Sikh organizations to discuss the crisis in Punjab or refusing to dismiss controversial ministers, have now found a potent weapon in foreign policy.
Mr. Shekhar's Foreign Minister, V. C. Shukla, was disqualified from Parliament with seven others in early January for having broken a law against switching parties without resigning a seat. The Law and Justice Minister, Subramaniam Swamy, was forced to apologize publicy to the Speaker of the House for having threatened to arrest him if he did not do the Government's bidding in postponing the disqualification decision.

HEADLINE: Only One U.S. Family in Four Is 'Traditional'

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
The decline of the traditional family two parents with children -- continued in America in the 1980's but at a slower pace than in the 1970's, the Census Bureau said today.
In 1970, 40 percent of the nation's households were made up of of a married couple and one or more children under age 18. That proportion dropped to 31 percent in 1980 and to 26 percent last year, the bureau said. 
 The information came from a survey of 57,400 housing units conducted in March 1990. Household information from the complete census, conducted a month later, will not be available forseveral months.
"All of the things we saw happening at a rapid and destabilizing rate in the 1980's are continuing, but at a more moderate pace," said Steve Rawlings, a family demographer at the bureau who wrote the report.
"There's also a slowdown in the net increase of total households and a slowdown in the creation of new households," he said. "It may be the aging of the baby boom. And economic factors may well be depressing the ability of young adults to form their own households."
In other respects, the report depicted a nation leveling off from the breakneck pace of change in the 1970's:
*While the number of single parents hit 9.7 million last year, the growth in that category, 41 percent over 10 years earlier, was half the 82 percent increase in that category in the 1970's.
*The number of single mothers (8.4 million of those 9.7 million single parents) was up 35 percent from 1980, as against an 82 percent increase in the 1970's.
*The number of divorced mothers was up only 1.6 percent annually in the 1980's, as against 9 percent a year in the 1970's.
*Household size continued to decline, but at a slower pace. The size of theAmerican household was 2.63 people in 1990, down from 2.76 in 1980 and 3.14 in 1970. In 1940, it was 3.67 people.
The number of traditional families remained fairly stable throughout the 20-year period: 24.5 million in 1990, 24.2 million in 1980, and 25.5 million in 1970. But the total number of households grew at a more rapid pace.
"You could say that all the increase in households has taken place outside of traditional families," said Linda Waite, a sociologist with the RAND Corporation, a California research group. Thus, anything that tended to slow the growth in family households would increase the proportion of traditional families.
Late marriage delays formation of new families and can increase single households. Divorce increases the number of single households.

Hilton Plans to Seek Atlantic City License

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LEV, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 29

 BODY:
The Hilton Hotels Corporation said today that it planned to apply for a license to operate a hotel and casino in Atlantic City with an eye toward entering the market.
"An opportunity for our company in Atlantic City could occur," said Barron Hilton, the company's chairman, in a statement. "We want to be in a position to proceed." 
 Hilton owns or operates 254 hotels in the United States, including three hotel-casinos in Nevada.
Mr. Hilton said the company was not currently in any negotiations to purchase a casino in Atlantic City.
Hilton built a casino and intended to enter the Atlantic City market in 1985 but was denied a license by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, which said it was aware of ties between some Hilton executives and people who had been linked to organized crime. Hilton denied the allegations.
The commission subsequently granted the company's request for a rehearing, but Hilton decided to sell the property, now known as Trump Castle, to Donald J. Trump for about $320 million.
Mr. Trump is now having severe financial difficulties and analysts speculated that Hilton might want to reacquire the Trump Castle at a discount. Mr. Trump also owns the Trump Plaza and Taj Mahal in Atlantic City. Mr. Trump issued a statement today saying that he had not had discussions with Hilton about the sale of Trump Castle and that "Trump Castle is not for sale."
The Bally Manufacturing Corporation, another troubled company, also owns a property in Atlantic City and could be compelled to sell, analysts said.
David Jackson, an analyst at the Western Group, a securities firm in Los Angeles, said the timing was right for Hilton to look in Atlantic City. With competition heavy and business off because of recession, Hilton could drive a hard bargain.
Joseph J. Doyle, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company in New York, said that despite the slowdown in growth in Atlantic City, the market holds promise in the long term because of the tremendous revenues casinos can produce.
Hilton shares closed down $1.125 today, at $34.875, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Mark Manson, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in New York, said the share price fell because some investors believed that with Hilton expressing interest in Atlantic City, the chances were smaller that the company would reorganize or sell out. In 1989, management put the company up for sale, but later took it off the market.
James J. Murren, an analyst at C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. in New York, said some investors were worried that Hilton would find Atlantic City rough going.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Uses Image of F.D.R. and '32

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 29

 BODY:
Conjuring up the economic nightmares of the 1930's seems like perilous strategy for politicians facing hard times. But when the comparison invokes the image of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was swept from Albany to Washington at the depth of the Great Depression, the strategy could have its benefits.
Such, at least, appears to be the reasoning of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. In recent weeks, Mr. Cuomo has invoked the dark days of the 1930's on several occasions, saying that the state government is as bad off today as it was 60 years ago. 
 New York is confronting "fiscal problems more severe than any we have faced since the Great Depression, and maybe more severe than anything this state has ever faced," Mr. Cuomo said in his recent State of the State address.
 
Referring to Government
 In an interview today, Mr. Cuomo stressed that he was referring only to the problems facing the government, not to the problems facing New Yorkers in general. "My distinction is between problems and fiscal problems," he said. "Social problems, for example, were much worse then than they are now."
Even taking such distinctions into account, however, historians say they find the comparison puzzling. "We certainly do not appear to face a crisis of the magnitude of the Great Depression," said William Leuchtenburg, a Roosevelt scholar and a professor of history at the University of North Carolina. "That's not the comparison that immediately jumps to mind."
 
Vast Differences in Scope
 By almost every measure available, New York's current problems are only a dollhouse version of the problems that it faced during the Depression. Statewide unemployment figures for the 1930's are not available, but local figures present a bleak picture; in 1932, for example, unemployment in Buffalo reached 33 percent, according to a State Labor Department survey. At the start of this year, in contrast, the unemployment rate in New York State was under 6 percent.
In terms of state finances, the focus of the Governor's remarks, the comparison between the Great Depression and today's recession is somewhat more apt, but still strained. In the grim winter of 1932, Governor Roosevelt presented to the New York State Legislature a budget with a shortfall of $124 million. This shortfall represented slightly more than half of the state's expected tax revenues for the year.
Governor Cuomo, who is to present his budget to the Legislature on Thursday, has said that for the upcoming year the state is facing a budget gap of $6 billion. This amounts to roughly one-fifth of the tax revenues that the state expects to collect.
Experts say that even if the raw numbers matched up, the historical analogy would be rendered almost worthless by the tremendous changes in the scope of state government.
Sixty years ago, state government was a relatively limited venture; New York State built prisons, paved roads, provided education aid and cared for crippled children.
Today, the state presides over a network of social service programs, administers a farflung university system, owns nuclear power plants and provides care for thousands of mentally ill adults.
"The basic conditions are just so different, you can't make a comparison," said Norman Hurd, who served as state budget director under Govs. Thomas E. Dewey and Nelson A. Rockefeller.
Governor Cuomo is something of a student of state history, and recently he received a briefing on New York during the Depression, including a copy of Governor Roosevelt's budget proposal for 1932. (The similarities between some of Mr. Cuomo's recent remarks and some of Mr. Roosevelt's statements are striking.)
Still, aides to Mr. Cuomo say they are not sure how he came to the conclusion that the state was facing a fiscal crisis along the lines of the Depression. The purpose of the comparison, they say, is largely scholastic, anyway.
"Part of it is an education in the size of the problem and the dramatic steps we're going to have to take to solve them," said Anne W. Crowley, the Governor's press secretary.
 
Some See Other Motives
 But others see trickier motives at work. Governor Cuomo, they say, is drawing an unspoken but emphatic analogy between himself and Governor Roosevelt, who was elected President in the bleak fall of 1932.
"Without saying anything explicit, the implication is that F.D.R. went on to be a great President," said Gerald Benjamin, a professor of political science at the State University of New York at New Paltz. "F.D.R. is not remembered as Governor; he's remembered as President, and that's precisely the point."
Mr. Cuomo, not surprisingly, denies any such implication, noting today that it was Gov. Herbert H. Lehman, not Governor Roosevelt, who led New York out of the Depression. "Lehman did a lot more socially than Roosevelt did," he said.
What Mr. Cuomo did not point out, but what is clear from his biography, is that Mr. Lehman never got close to the White House; he ended his political career in the United States Senate.

Perhaps that will come, but in the meantime we in this state have a very positive duty to do what we can to help ourselves." - Gov. Franklin D. Roosevelt: Jan. 6, 1932
 "While only the national government can influence significantly the national economic tide that carries the 50 state boats, we in the state cannot afford to wait for Washington's help, or to use their failure as an excuse for not doing all we can for ourselves." - Gov. Mario M. Cuomo: Jan. 9, 1991 (UPI/Bettmann, 1932; Joe Traver for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Consumers' Confidence Dips Again

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Reflecting worry over rising unemployment and the Persian Gulf war, consumer confidence fell again in January, the Conference Board reported yesterday. Not since the early 1980's has the board's monthly survey turned up such pessimism.
Consumer confidence, as measured by the Conference Board and the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center, more or less tracks the ups and downs of the nation's economy by suggesting how willing Americans are to spend. January's low reading indicates that a spending spree is not yet on the horizon to lift the nation out of recession. 
 The Conference Board, a business research organization, produces two indexes from a nationwide poll of 5,000 households. These indexes had fallen steadily but gradually from March until August, when they plunged sharply in the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, reaching recessionary levels in the fall.
 
Pessimism on the Future
 One index, measuring how consumers feel about current business conditions and job availability, dropped in January to 53.6 from 63.3 in December. That was the lowest level since September 1983. The other, measuring what people feel might happen to jobs, income and business activity over the next six months, fell to 54.3 in January from 59.8 in December. That was the lowest level since May 1980.
Less than one person in five expected their incomes to rise over the next six months, and one in three complained that jobs were hard to find. Plans to buy a car or a home also fell in January from December's level.
The big question is whether confidence will rebound if the war ends soon and successfully. Fabian Linden, who runs the Conference Board's survey, and many other economists say the gulf crisis explains why consumers are feeling so low, while rising unemployment and a weak economy play a lesser role.
"The readings we are getting are far too stark to be explained by the economy alone," Mr. Linden said. "If the war ended tomorrow, we would get a spurt in confidence and a psychological thrust toward ending the recession. But ending the war might not end the recession."
 
Separate War Responses
 In support of this view, the Conference Board poll, conducted from Jan. 1 through Jan. 24, broke out responses after the war started on Jan. 17. "They were a bit more positive; not pushing the indexes up to the December level, but more positive than the responses earlier in the month," said Jesse Bram, a Conference Board official.
Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache, noted that personal consumption data released by the Government this week showed a rise in December. "Consumers don't seem to be acting as badly as they seem to feel," he said.
Richard T. Curtin, director of the University of Michigan's consumer survey, is more pessimistic. "The problems in the Middle East helped to cause the fall in consumer confidence and the recession," he said. "But once the economy was in recession, then the problems usually associated with recession came center stage: unemployment and lagging incomes."
The university's January survey has not yet been published.
The Conference Board's survey is conducted for the organization by National Family Inc., Toledo, Ohio. It noted that confidence fell in January in seven of the nation's nine regions.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Saudi Arabia;
War Transforms a Bypassed Desert Community Into a Boom Town

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ZULFI, Saudi Arabia, Jan. 27

 BODY:
George Bush is a local hero here. America is Number One. And some Bedouins here have been calling their hunting falcons Patriot, a name that residents predict Bedouin children will soon bear.
The war has been good for Zulfi. Egyptian, French and Syrian troops have recently passed through this sprawling community of hamlets set in valleys of sand. As a result, Zulfi, which most traffic bypassed once a major freeway was completed in the early 1980's, is booming. 
 But merchants throughout the area expressed ambivalence about their sudden prosperity. "The war is good for business," said Mohammed Abdul Samad, an Indian who manages an electronics store. "But I wish it were over."
 
An Influx of Kuwaitis
 Mr. Samad's success began soon after Aug. 2, when thousands of Kuwaitis fled to Zulfi, many to the villas and farms they had purchased long before Iraq's invasion, others to more modest shelter, even tents. Sales of shortwave radios and television sets promptly increased by 40 to 50 percent after their arrival, Mr. Samad said.
Al-Nakeel Bakery, which used to sell 20 cartons of round, flat Arabic bread a day, now moves 50 to 70 cartons a day. And the owner of a rice and spice shop in the vegetable market reported that his business had increased by 40 to 50 percent.
Agriculture in this region, which is heavily subsidized, is also doing well. Abdullah Barjas, an owner of the National Fertilizer Company, said demand for his chemical-based products was particularly strong. "We sold about 45,000 metric tons in 1989, and nearly 60,000 metric tons last year during the crisis," Mr. Barjas said. A metric ton is about 2,200 pounds.
The results of the Government's intensive nurturing of the kingdom's agricultural sector are surreal. Lush green fields irrigated by giant water cannons are framed on one side by a towering rocky escarpment and on the other by an ocean of red-tinged sand dunes hundreds of feet high.
 
Camping Atop the Sand
 Bedouins and residents still take to the dunes at dusk in their four-wheel-drive Land Cruisers to camp atop the sand, sip tea and swap gossip over campfires. Some come just to gaze at the moon and the Milky Way and retell ancient myths about battles between the constellations. On a clear, cold desert night, with a full moon, there are many shooting stars, and these, unlike the Scuds and Patriots over Riyadh, do not explode.
Zulfi is part of the Nejd, the conservative central Arabian heartland, in which almost everything is "haram" -- forbidden. "We call it Haramstan," complained one young resident.
One sunny market day, a Western reporter, dressed in a headscarf covering every strand of her hair and a black floor-length cloak, was approached by two young members of the religious police. Scowling, they commanded a man who was with her to "cover her face."
"We are Americans, and American women do not wear veils," the woman protested. Studiously ignoring her, they turned once more to the man. "Aren't you ashamed?" they chided him, throwing up their arms to the heavens in disgust. "How can you let her walk around like that?"
 
Roads Paved in the 1970's
 Zulfi is only about 15 years old. Before that, it was two small villages connected by a dirt road. There were no paved roads here until the 1970's. Villagers from Belad and Aqdah, which became Zulfi, used to hurl stones at one another, such was the emnity between them. Now, the physical, social and psychological lines that separated them have blurred.
Beyond this merged town lie remnants of the poverty that all too recently was the hallmark of central Arabia. The tiny hamlets, set like emeralds in the rolling dunes, betray the secrets of the past. Most have a squat mud-brick tower, in which these settlers protected themselves against marauding Bedouins, one of this country's most enduring struggles -- that between the settled farmers and the nomadic peoples.
Several of the hamlets languish in their isolation. These places, built by the country's poorest, not by Government subsidy or decree, are slowly collapsing in the winter rains and blasting desert windstorms.
 
Steadfast Backwardness
 These hamlets fought to preserve their backwardness: Athuwayr, for example, rejected mandatory education for boys until 1974; for girls, education did not come until 1981. Both were resisted, along with other forms of "westernization," as contrary to Islam, and the Government did not impose them.
"The Government knew that connecting these virtually deserted outposts with paved roads, running water and electricty was a waste of money, that it did not make economic sense to permit these people to engage in nostalgic farming," said one cosmopolitan young resident of Riyadh, who was raised in such a village. "But the people wanted it, so, of course, the Government complied."
"It looks romantic now, doesn't it?" he said, pointing to the eroding mud hut that once was his home. The reality was harsher, he said. When it rained, his family huddled by a fire on the dirt floor in the only section of the palm-leaf thatched roof that did not leak. There was unrelenting heat in summer, numbing cold in winter, no lights or running water and omnipresent lizards, spiders and flies. Ants the size of a fingernail used to creep inside his ears and bite.
"This is the poverty we came from," he said. "This is what most of us remember. And this is why we hate Saddam. This is what he wants us to return to."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Germany;
GERMANS TO GIVE $5.5 BILLION MORE

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Jan. 29

 BODY:
German leaders, under quiet but sustained criticism for not contributing enough to the anti-Iraq coalition, announced today that their Government would provide an additional $5.5 billion.
They also said Germany would send new air defense systems to Turkey, together with about 580 soldiers to operate and maintain them. 
 The Defense Ministry says that 1,600 to 1,700 German soldiers are already aboard minesweepers and frigates in the eastern Mediterranean and at an air base in Turkey. It is the first military force Germany has sent to a war zone since the end of World War II.
"This contribution is a clear sign of German solidarity with the United States, whose soldiers bear the main burden of implementing the United Nations resolutions on the liberation of Kuwait," the chief Government spokesman, Dieter Vogel, said in a statement announcing the new aid today.
 
Help for the Israelis
 Mr. Vogel said Germany would soon supply air defense systems and perhaps other military equipment to Israel. Officials said later that the Government was also considering making a direct contribution to Britain to help defray its war costs.
Leaders of the allied countries, anxious to preserve the anti-Iraq coalition, have refrained from publicly criticizing Germany for the level of its contribution to the war effort. But allied unhappiness with Germany has begun to spill into public view. It has been especially sharp in Britain, where some politicians and news commentators have in recent days been accusing the Germans of cowardice.
Otto Lambsdorff, head of Germany's Free Democratic Party and a senior political partner of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, said on returning from Washington on Monday that he had found Americans "indignant and disappointed" about Germany's uncertain role in the Persian Gulf conflict. He reportedly pressed his colleagues in Bonn to announce new aid commitments.
"Germany's position in the United States has never been as difficult as it is now," Mr. Lambsdorff said.
According to Government figures, Germany had already contributed or pledged more than $2.2 billion to the allied war effort, in addition to $1.3 billion in aid for Turkey, Egypt and Jordan. But it is unclear how much of that money had already been committed when hostilities in the gulf began.
 
A Constitutional Issue
 The total amount Germany has now pledged to the war effort, slightly more than $9 billion, roughly equals the sum pledged by Japan, which has also been criticized for failing to aid the anti-Iraq effort generously enough. The Government spokesman, Mr. Vogel, said at a briefing today that the similarity was coincidental.
"Japan's gross national product is twice as big as ours," Mr. Vogel said. "We also have obligations in southeastern and eastern Europe that must be taken into account. In our negotiations with the Americans, we ask them to take that into account. And they do."
The German Constitution, in clauses that have been much debated in recent weeks, bans the dispatch of troops to foreign combat zones. The 18 Alpha jets and 270 pilots and maintenance workers that Germany sent to Turkey this month, and the additional military aid pledged today, are symbols of Germany's commitment to the defense of a NATO ally against possible Iraqi attack, but they are not deployed as part of the anti-Iraq effort.
Recent public opinion surveys suggest that Germans are evenly divided over whether the Alpha jets should be sent into action if Turkey is attacked by Iraq. Chancellor Kohl has taken no firm stand on the question, much to the consternation of Turkey's President, Turgut Ozal.
"The signal should go out that if Turkey is attacked, let NATO be with Turkey," Mr. Ozal said in an interview broadcast on German television last week. "We would like to see that wrong messages should not be given to President Saddam Hussein, because in that case he may make wrong decisions."
 
'Count-Me-Out Attitude'
 Former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, writing in the liberal weekly Die Zeit, warned that Germany's nonparticipation in the military offensive against Saddam Hussein was being viewed as "an egotistical count-me-out attitude."
Resentment toward Germany in other allied countries stems not only from its perceived low level of commitment to the gulf force, but also to the role of German companies in arming Saddam Hussein. Public demand to curb such exports has risen sharply, and officials are moving to give the police greater investigatory powers, but some Germans remain skeptical of the Government's seriousness.
"All German governments, no matter from what party, as well as a silent majority in the Bundestag, are responsible for the fact that Israel has not been able to sleep the past few nights," concludes the weekly magazine Stern in its current issue. "German governments, officials, and companies could have prevented Saddam's arms buildup if they had chosen to do so. The shame of having built up Saddam's military is a burden on Germans, and it is understandable if other countries find this deplorable."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;
A Club Med Vocation For a New Executive

BYLINE: By Kim Foltz

 BODY:
Tod Seisser said he had little difficulty adjusting to his new position as senior vice president and associate creative director at Ammirati & Puris, the New York agency he joined this month.
It helped that one of the first responsibilities he inherited was the Club Med account, which involves a bit of tropical travel. Ammirati, which has billings of more than $245 million, also handles accounts for BMW, Schweppes and U.P.S., though Mr. Seisser would not specify his other clients.
Mr. Seisser is perhaps best known for his work at Levine, Huntley, Schmidt & Beaver on the Maidenform campaign, which featured the actors Corbin Bernsen and Omar Sharif discussing their feelings about lingerie.
He left the agency to become vice chairman at Keye/Donna/Pearlstein, New York, but he found himself unemployed when the agency closed last year. He did freelance work for nine months before joining Ammirati.
In his new job, Mr. Seisser has already traveled on business to Club Med resorts in St. Lucia, Martinique and Guadeloupe.
"It beats touring a garbage bag factory in Alabama, which I've done, too," Mr. Seisser said.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Public Opinion;
A Slight Decline Is Found In U.S. Backing for War

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. KAGAY

 BODY:
Support by the American public for the war against Iraq continues to be strong, but there are further signs of reduced expectations, according to a new poll conducted by CBS News.
Seventy percent of the 1,173 adults nationwide interviewed by telephone Sunday and Monday agreed that "the United States did the right thing in starting military actions against Iraq." That was down slightly from the 76 percent who agreed with the same view a week earlier in a New York Times/CBS News Poll. 
 In another indication of a more sober outlook, 34 percent of those interviewed said their impression was that the war was going "very well" for the United States, down from 50 percent a week earlier. Most of the rest in each poll said the war was going "somewhat well."
The proportion of Americans who expected a war of just a few weeks duration continued to fall, to 7 percent in the latest poll from 18 percent a week ago and from 40 percent the day after the war began.
The new CBS News Poll and the earlier Times/CBS News Polls had margins of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
On a question intended to measure personal distress caused by the war, 39 percent of the Americans interviewed said they have felt "edgy or short-tempered or are having trouble sleeping" because of the war.
But the percent saying they "feel proud about what the U.S. is doing in the Persian Gulf" remained essentially unchanged at 78 percent.
 
Slight Drop for President
 President Bush's job approval rating stood at 79 percent, down slightly from 84 percent a week earlier.
But Americans were evenly divided on Mr. Bush's handling of the economy: 43 percent approved while 44 percent disapproved. Their view had been even more negative in December when 34 percent approved and 55 percent disapproved.
The image of Congress also seemed improved from the level before the war; 49 percent said they approved of the way Congress was handling its job, up from 23 percent last October during the battle over the budget.
Although the question has been asked only intermittently in national polls since 1974, this is one of the highest rating ever given Congress.
In the latest poll, 67 percent said they thought "the United States military is holding back information about the war in the Persian Gulf." But more people said the purpose was to avoid giving help to Iraq than said the purpose was to avoid giving bad news to Americans.
Looking ahead, 42 percent of the Americans interviewed said they expected the war in the Persian Gulf would hurt the nation's economy.

HEADLINE: Tax Rebate in New Hampshire Town Poses a Test for School-Choice Issue

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EPSOM, N.H.

 BODY:
A new program granting $1,000 tax breaks to families that send their children anywhere but the local public high school may turn this small town into a national testing ground for plans that offer parents a choice as to where their offspring will go to school.
The plan was enacted in December in this town of 2,800 people in south-central New Hampshire as part of an effort to reduce local property taxes, which are among the highest in the nation. Epsom has no high school of its own; instead, it pays a fee to a regional high school for each student it sends there. 
 Sponsors of the measure contend that for every family that chooses to enroll its children in other schools, including parochial schools, Epsom will save money.
But opponents of the program, including some parents, school officials and the state's largest teachers' union, say it would violate the constitutional separation of church and state and is really a disguised attempt to undermine public education. They also say it would discriminate against those who do not own property.
 
Bush Administration's Views
 The concept of parental choice plans is favored by the Bush Administration, which recently set up the Center for Choice in Education as part of the Department of Education. The Administration has strongly supported a new Wisconsin program that allows up to 1,000 low-income families in Milwaukee to use state funds to send their children to private nonsectarian schools.
Clint Bolick, the director of the Landmark Center for Civil Rights in Washington, a conservative group that has offered legal and financial aid to defend the Epsom program if it is challenged in court, said, "I think Epsom has tremendous potential significance for New Hampshire and the United States."
The center is also providing legal help for the school-choice program in Milwaukee. A lawsuit challenging the Wisconsin law is scheduled to be argued before the State Supreme Court this spring.
Mr. Bolick said the Epsom program might be an even more important "breakthrough for choice" than Milwaukee's because it was enacted by the town itself, without going through a state legislature. "That makes it highly transportable and ripe for copying by other municipalities around the country," he said.
 
'Frightening Implications'
 But Barbara Barksdale, who has three children in Epsom's public schools, said, "I see this program as the first step in abolishing public education in this country."
Dr. Paul DeMinico, the superintendent of schools for Epsom and four neighboring towns that share Pembroke Academy, the regional high school, said: "In my opinion this has frightening implications. It creates a new class of citizens who are less responsible for supporting public education, and it could mean that public schools will only be for the poor, ethnic minorities and the handicapped."
He added, "I don't think this is fair or legal."
The new plan may bring more attention to Epsom than the landmark for which the town has been best known until now -- a 10-foot-tall roadside replica of a Trojan horse, designed to mock the United Nations as the handmaiden of Communism.
Under the plan, any Epsom property owner can get a rebate of up to $1,000 on his property taxes if he sends his children to a high school other than Pembroke Academy. This could be a private school, a religious school or another public high school.
Jack Kelleher, a former town selectman who devised the ordinance, said the program would save the town $3,600 for every student who chooses not to go to the local public high school. Epsom must pay $4,600 per pupil to the high school now, but would have to give back only the $1,000 in tax abatements to parents who sign up for the program, a savings of $3,600.
 
'Choice and Competition' Cited
 Mr. Kelleher, a member of the Libertarian Party, said, "This is the only program I know of where the more people participate the more the government saves."
The program also fosters "choice and competition," said Mr. Kelleher, who is single and has no children. "Essentially, what we have now is a government monopoly over schools. As in any monopoly, quality deteriorates and costs go up."
In addition, Mr. Kelleher said, the plan would help the local public high school because it would reduce crowding in classrooms and lighten teachers' classroom work.
Dr. DeMinico challenged Mr. Kelleher's arguments. "It doesn't work out as neatly as he claims," the superintendent said, because "the bulk of our costs are fixed costs, for items like bond debt service, utilities, transportation and the salaries of teachers and maintenance people."
"So if we get fewer students from Epsom, it doesn't mean that we can cut our costs the $4,600 we charge per pupil," Dr. DeMinico continued. Instead, he said, the school will have to raise the tuition it charges Epsom to compensate for its loss of revenue.
 
'User-Fee System' for Schools
 Dr. DeMinico said he also thinks the new plan creates "a user-fee system for public schools," adding, "This goes against what public education in America has meant."
So far, the parents of 12 Epsom students of high school age have signed up for rebates. But their children are already attending other schools, most of them parochial schools. Of the 800 students enrolled at Pembroke Academy, 180 are from Epsom.
Epsom's adoption of the rebate program is part of a spreading tax revolt in New Hampshire, the only state in the country except Alaska that has neither a state income tax nor a sales tax. This has meant a heavy reliance on local property taxes.
In New Hampshire, local property taxes account for 91 percent of the revenue for public schools, by far the highest percentage in the nation, according to the United States Department of Education. The second highest is Oregon, with 68 percent. The national average is 46 percent.
 
'A Convenient Whipping Boy'
 In small residential towns like Epsom, with no industry or commercial development to broaden the tax base, the heavy reliance on property taxes has made homeowners keenly attuned to any increase in school budgets. Epsom's property tax rate has doubled in the past decade, and many residents have taken out their anger on the public schools.
"The schools are a convenient whipping boy," said Mrs. Barksdale.
Mr. Kelleher, who wrote the rebate program, said that when he first proposed the plan in 1982 he was regarded as "so radical and crazy" that no one would sit near him. But he persisted.
Mrs. Barksdale said Mr. Kelleher once showed up at a school board election with a sign saying, "Cut your property taxes by 75 percent -- abolish public education."
Mrs. Barksdale, who is organizing a group of parents opposing the program, said there were several different groups of people who supported it: Libertarians like Mr. Kelleher, who advocate a sharply reduced role for government, especially on the Federal level; old-line New Englanders, who see the program simply as a way to save money; parents who want the best education for their children and think the $1,000 will help get them a private school education, and Roman Catholics who send their children to parochial schools.
One parent who has signed up for the plan is Ken Preve, a college administrator with a 15-year-old son in Bishop Brady High School in Concord, 12 miles west if Epsom. "It's a matter of pure economics for the town; it saves the town money," said Mr. Preve. "The issue of church and state has nothing to do with it."
 
Legal Challenge Weighed
 Mr. Kelleher is confident the ordinance will withstand legal challenge because he copied much of its language from a landmark 1983 Supreme Court decision, Mueller v. Allen, involving a Minnesota law that allows taxpayers to deduct school costs, including those for parochial schools.
But Ted Comstock, a staff lawyer for the New Hampshire School Boards Association, said he thinks the Epsom plan violates the First Amendment, as well as the New Hampshire Constitution's prohibition against using public money for church schools. Mr. Comstock said the association is considering a plan to join a lawsuit against the program.
A similar move is being considered by the New Hampshire branch of the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Education Association of New Hampshire, the local branch of the teachers' union.
But the first challenge may come from the neighboring town of Pembroke, which is examining whether Epsom failed to live up to the terms of its contract with the district school system.
Dr. DeMinico said he thinks Epsom is in violation, and therefore Pembroke could refuse to accept high school students from Epsom.

Barbara Barksdale, left, who has three children in Epsom's public schools, said, "I see this program as the first step in abolishing public education in this country." Jack Kelleher, a former town selectman, devised the ordinance. (Jon-Pierre Lasseigne for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: In New York State, That Question Again: How Much to Tax, and Who Should Pay?

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM with EDWARD B. FISKE

 BODY:
As New York State's budget crisis slides from the painful to the excruciating, the state is being forced to confront anew one of its least favorite questions: how much tax revenue should be squeezed from its citizens and companies?
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, with an eye on his national reputation, has for months stressed his desire to balance the budget mainly by spending less. But administration officials have already said that in his budget plan for next year, which the Governor will unveil tomorrow, he will propose a 10-cents-a-gallon increase in the gasoline tax, a delay in scheduled reductions in the personal income tax and other tax increases. 
 Those new taxes, however, would offset only about one-fourth of the projected shortfall for the 1992 fiscal year, now estimated at $6 billion.
Virtually everyone agrees that state government is laden with fat and low-priority programs that should be lopped off. Some will be cut; but spending cuts have political and practical limits of their own, and deep reductions could be especially painful for a state that prides itself as a generous pioneer in social spending.
 
Long-Term Increases?
 Some experts believe that the deficits looming in the years ahead are likely to be so great that the state will be forced to consider major long-term tax increases as well as major reductions in its programs.
Among the questions posed by those who believe taxes will have to rise substantially are these:
*Did a 1987 cut in personal income-tax rates go too far, letting high-income New Yorkers off too easy?
*Should a decline in business-tax revenues be reversed by curbing the investment credits and other incentives that let many companies slash their taxes?
*Should the growing share of the economy devoted to services, like consulting, accounting and computer programming, continue to escape the sales tax, which was growing sluggishly even before the recession?
The Governor said last week that he wants to "avoid increases in broad-based taxes that would impair our economic competitiveness." But while elected officials tend to shy away from talk of tax increases, among private groups a debate has already been joined.
 
The Debate Begins
 Not surprisingly, public-employee unions and human service groups that depend on public funds call for casting a wider tax net.
Expected cuts in funds for essentials like schools and roads as well as for supporting the poor "will cause a real public outcry," predicted Russell Sykes, a policy analyst with the State Communities Aid Association, which represents social-service groups.
"The State Legislature will be forced to look seriously at the revenue side," Mr. Sykes predicted.
But Daniel Walsh, president of the Business Council of New York State, asserted that major tax increases could drive companies from the state. "The problem isn't on the revenue side, it's on the spending side," he said. "How do you get more revenues pumped out of an economy that's flat?"
While the recession has intensified the crisis, the state's budget has in fact been seriously out of balance for several years, according to experts ranging from the State Comptroller to community organizations. Borrowing that built up $5 billion in debt and the frequent resort to one-time revenue measures, these experts say, indicate a chronic imbalance that could outlast the recession.
And many economists warn that in the decade ahead the state's economy is not likely to repeat the boom of the 1980's. That would mean slower growth in revenues in an era when pressures to spend -- on health care, on the elderly, on crime, on a decaying infrastructure -- are greater than ever.
And since two-thirds of state spending supports city and county budgets, what happens to state revenues will directly influence the fiscal prospects for troubled New York City.
 
The Burden
High Taxes And High Spending
New York has long been a relatively high-tax, high-spend state, an approach perhaps epitomized by the reign of Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller from 1959 to 1973. Those policies have been extended under Governor Cuomo during a decade of booming economic growth that, until this year, allowed government to grow even as tax rates were cut and Federal aid, apart from welfare and Medicaid, declined.
New Yorkers complain that they pay the country's highest taxes, and they are essentially right.
If only state taxes are considered, New York would appear to bear an average burden: in percentage of personal income collected as state taxes -- 8 percent in 1989 -- New York ranks 21st among the states. But when state and local taxes together are considered, New York is number two, trailing only Alaska, where oil companies pay most of the bill, according to data compiled by Steven D. Gold of the Center for the Study of the States at the State University of New York.
This does not necessarily mean that urban extravagance is the problem. New York, unlike other states, requires local governments to share the huge costs of Medicaid and welfare. But the numbers do show that the economic and political impact of state taxes are linked to trends in local taxes, some of which are rising this year too.
 
Low Business Taxes
 After the 1987 cuts, the percentage of personal income collected by state and local taxes in New York declined slightly, from 16.6 percent in 1987 to 15.6 percent in 1989, but this was still well above the national average of 11.5 percent, according to Mr. Gold.
Unlike most other taxes, corporate taxes in New York are relatively low. Faced with a loss of manufacturing jobs, the state has offered a range of investment credits and other attractive features. A 1989 study, by the accounting firm Price Waterhouse, of tax burdens for companies investing in manufacturing in nine states -- five northeastern states plus Ohio, North Carolina and California -- found that New York had the lowest effective corporate income tax. Comparing total tax burdens on companies, including corporate, property, sales and other taxes, New York was below average, with a burden equal to those in North Carolina and Massachusetts.
 
The Outlook
Slow Growth, Increasing Pressure
Pressure for higher taxes will hinge in part on the performance of the state's economy; slow economic growth means less revenue from personal, business and sales taxes. Long-term forecasts are notoriously unreliable, but many economists believe that New York will not experience booming growth for many years, well after the current recession ends. "It will be a sober recovery," said Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
"The 90's will be a payback time, a period of restructuring and consolidating," said Rae D. Rosen, vice president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. The finance industry, the engine of growth in the 1980's, appears to be in for a long period of reorganization. Banks are also retrenching. With exceptions upstate, manufacturing continues to dwindle.
New York City's economic performance is the biggest single factor in state revenue prospects. In the 1990 fiscal year, the city alone provided 36 percent of the state's personal income tax revenues, and 41 percent of its sales taxes.
 
Personal Income Tax
Most Visible, Least Popular
Providing close to half of tax revenues, the personal income tax plays a more prominent role in New York than in almost any other state. The rate has been cut substantially since the 1970's, when it was 15 percent, but with business and sales taxes lagging the personal income tax is more dominant than ever.
The most recent cut, in 1987, was to be phased in over five years, cutting the maximum marginal rate to 7 percent for a married couple. Last year, as the deficit loomed, the state delayed the decline, freezing taxes at the 1989 rate of 7.875 percent.
The State Communities Aid Association, in a recent report, called the 1987 changes "too generous," and said they let higher-income taxpayers off too lightly. It proposes creating new top brackets for those with high incomes, a temporary surcharge and other changes.
Many experts say the personal income tax is often the fairest, most efficient way to raise revenues. Simply placing a surcharge of 10 percent on the existing tax, for example, would bring in an extra $1.5 billion. It is also, however, one of the most politically visible taxes, and one of the least popular.
 
Corporate Taxes
How to Handle Declining Revenues
To the chagrin of state officials, revenues from key business taxes declined from 1987 to 1990, even before the recession. The revenues rose in the current fiscal year only because the state imposed a temporary surcharge.
The 1987 changes in the corporate franchise tax -- the main income tax for manufacturing, trade and financial service firms -- reduced the top rate from 10 percent to 9 percent of taxable income, but at the same time sought to tax income that had previously been excluded. The combination of the two changes was supposed to leave the level of revenue unchanged, said James W. Wetzler, Commissioner of Taxation and Finance.
"It appears in hindsight that the tax reduction was too large to fulfill that goal," Mr. Wetzler said. Payments for the franchise tax instead declined by hundreds of millions of dollars during years of rising company profits. Several factors contributed, a state study found, including unexpected effects of Federal tax changes, reduced profits in financial services, increased deductible interest payments and increased use of investment tax credits. Another factor was a shift by many smaller companies to a tax status that allows owners to treat profits as personal rather than corporate income.
Mr. Wetzler described the problem with corporate taxes more as one of volatility and unpredictability than of declining revenues. But he added, "New York doesn't raise that much from corporations compared to other states, and we do it unevenly, with some companies paying higher rates and some paying lower rates."
 
Investment Credits
 Revenues jumped back up last year when the legislature placed a surcharge on corporate taxes of 15 percent of payable taxes for two years, then 10 percent for a third year.
Many critics have faulted the state's investment credit, which permits companies, mainly manufacturers, to write off a share of their investment costs. The credit became a lightning rod in the mid-1980's when it was discovered that the bulk of the benefits was received by a handful of giant companies.
Several changes have reduced the worth of the investment credit and related credits, but they still cut state revenues by about $300 million a year, Mr. Sykes estimates. And the benefits are still highly concentrated: more than half go to 10 large companies, he said.
Adding to the controversy was the revelation in the mid-1980's that thousands of companies, including some of the world's largest, had amassed enough credits to wipe out all tax liability except the token minimum of $250. In 1987, an alternative minimum tax was passed that now, with the surcharge, amounts to 5.875 percent. A majority of the state's manufacturing firms earn enough credits to require their use of this alternative.
Critics have also questioned the basis for calculating taxable corporate income. New York makes it relatively easy for interstate or international companies to allocate their income to other jurisdictions, tax experts say.
 
Fear of Losing Businesses
 Called loopholes by critics, most of the corporate tax breaks were adopted to counter a perceived threat of corporate flight, and to help lure new companies to the state.
"Do you want to risk losing an I.B.M. or a Kodak?" asked Abraham Lackman, director of fiscal studies with the Finance Committee of the Republican-controlled State Senate. "It's critical to our state to have these kinds of industries."
But Richard D. Pomp, a tax specialist at the University of Connecticut Law School who directed a major study for the New York Legislature that helped bring about the 1987 changes, said: "Corporate taxes are a low percentage of the cost of doing business in New York. It's hard to show that this affects anyone's decision."
 
Sales Taxes
Should Services Also Be Taxed?
Even before the recession, revenues from sales, excise and other consumption taxes had grown sluggishly. The big item is the sales tax, which has long been set at 4 percent; local governments charge another 3 to 4.25 percent.
One reason for poor growth in sales tax revenues, many experts believe, is the exclusion of the fastest-growing part of the economy: services. Special attention has focused on services often used by businesses, ranging from computer programming, advertising and consulting to accounting, legal and engineering services.
Extending the sales tax to many of these services could raise several hundred million dollars a year. But the lesson in Albany last year, when affected industries successfully beat back such proposals, was that the political obstacles are enormous.
So too would be the practical problems. One concern, even among proponents of such a tax, is that larger firms that have their own legal departments, accountants and other professional employees would escape the tax, while smaller businesses that must hire outsiders to provide such services would suffer. And in fields where the "products" are largely intangible and are delivered electronically, companies could easily move such "production" to branches out of state, noted Mr. Lackman, the State Senate aide.
But proponents of service taxes say such problems can be solved. "We have a service economy and we're not taxing services," Mr. Sykes said. "That's fundamentally wrong."
Mr. Wetzler, the State Tax Commissioner, urged great caution in entering the area of service taxes. "In looking at the tax system," he said, "it's important to be mindful that, just as manufacturing firms have the option of leaving, it's just as possible that service firms might leave."

HEADLINE: Borrowing By F.D.I.C. Suggested

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
Congress's chief economist proposed today that to head off insolvency, the Federal bank insurance program borrow from the Treasury and pay taxpayers back later.
Robert D. Reischauer, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, told lawmakers that without such a step, the fund that insures bank deposits could have a deficit by the end of this year. Even if the banks increase their contributions and the recession is mild and short-lived, he said, the fund will run a deficit of about $2.8 billion next year. 
 In the budget request President Bush will send to Congress on Monday, the White House is forecasting that the fund will be insolvent as early as next year and that its deficit could be as large as $23 billion by 1995.
 
On Congressional Agenda
 The proposal by Mr. Reischauer, a highly regarded figure on Capitol Hill who has a strong reputation for not being ideological and not overstating budgetary problems, puts taxpayer assistance to the bank insurance fund on the Congressional agenda.
The budget office recommendation that the borrowing limit for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation be increased above its current $5 billion cap by $5 billion to $10 billion is the latest of several repair proposals under discussion in Washington among regulators, lawmakers, Administration officials and industry leaders.
All the proposals, which involve some form of borrowing or increased contribution from the industry, seek to avoid the taxpayer bailout that the more pessimistic forecasters call a virtual certainty. At the end of 1990 fund balances had sunk to about $9 billion from about $13 billion at the beginning of the year.
 
Proposal From Bush
 President Bush said in his State of the Union address this evening that the Administration's plans to revamp banking laws would "bring America's financial system into the 21st century so that our banks remain safe and secure, and can continue to make job-creating loans for our factories, businesses and home buyers."
He did not provide any specifics of the plan that Treasury is expected to disclose as early as next week. Treasury officials have said that they will call for the repeal of Depression-era laws that have prevented the merger of investment banks and commercial banks, sharply limited interstate banking, and prohibited industrial companies from owning banks.
Mr. Bush also did not address the problems of the bank insurance fund in his speech. Administration officials and industry executives have yet to agree on a solution in private meetings that have been under way since last week.
Administration officials have maintained that a reorganization of the Depression-era laws will ultimately make banks more profitable and attract badly needed investment, which could then be used as a cushion against losses.
 
One Official's Prescription
 But in his appearance before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Reischauer discounted the effect of such changes on the short-term health of the fund.
The insurance fund's liquidity needs "cannot be remedied by long-term regulatory reforms," Mr. Reischauer said. "To avoid delaying necessary bank closures because of a cash shortage, the F.D.I.C. must have the resources to undertake those closures."
He estimated that in the current economic climate, the F.D.I.C. would probably have to borrow $11 billion through 1994 to make up for shortfalls, even if banks pay premiums of more than 50 percent above the current annual payments of 19 cents for every $100 in deposits. If the recession became severe, he said, the F.D.I.C. might be required to borrow as much as $38 billion.
Mr. Reischauer also predicted that between July of last year and the end of 1993, 596 banks would fail, 48 of which have assets of more than $500 million.
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Donald W. Riegle Jr., called the suggestion of borrowing money to bail out the F.D.I.C. "a rather stunning development." Mr. Riegle, Democrat of Michigan, said the budget office recommendation could be adopted as a part of the effort to reorganize the fund, but questioned whether the projections were too optimistic.
 
Depression-Era Idea Revived
 The staggering difficulties of both the insurance fund and the industry are apparent just by the nature of the proposals being explored. A new fund that would invest in weak banking companies, a kind of plan not used since the establishment of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation during the Depression, is being discussed.
Treasury officials and banking regulators are scheduled to meet privately with bankers on Thursday to explore how to reorganize the insurance fund.
One approach being considered is for the F.D.I.C. to borrow from the banking industry instead of taxpayers, with interest to be paid by the premium payments. One problem with such an approach is that it would further limit the amount of money that banks would be able to lend to their customers.

HEADLINE: Canada Is Expected to Join U.S.-Mexico Trade Talks

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 29

 BODY:
After months of high-level talks, the United States, Mexico and Canada have reached agreement to include Canada in negotiations toward a continentwide North American free-trade zone, diplomats and trade officials said today.
The agreement, which could be announced as early as this week, would make Canada a direct participant in talks that have been under discussion by the United States and Mexico since the middle of last year. 
 The negotiations envisioned in the agreement would seek to bind the three countries' economies in a common market that would include more than 350 million people and would be larger than the European Community. Such a huge unhindered market would encompass interests as diverse as the machine shops of northern Mexico, the financial district of New York and the farmlands of western Canada.
"Everything is ready," one diplomat said, describing preparations for the three-way talks. "It's just a matter of making the formal announcement."
Administration officials in Washington said that any inclusion of Canada, which signed a bilateral free-trade agreement with the United States in 1988, would probably oblige President Bush to notify Congress that new trade negotiations were planned. A notification of the United States-Mexican trade talks was sent to Capitol Hill on Sept. 25. After receiving notification, Congress can disapprove of the proposed talks within 60 legislative days.
Diplomats said the inclusion of Canada would probably not delay the start of the talks with Mexico, which are expected to begin this spring. They said the talks could take account of Canada while awaiting the direct participation of Canadian negotiators after the 60-day Congressional period has passed.
In Mexico City today, business leaders who have been involved in the trade talks expressed support for broadening the negotiations.
"This could be the birth of a commercially united America, equal to the united Europe that is expected in 1992," said Francisco del Cueto, a spokesman for the Foreign Trade Coordinator for Business Organizations, a council of 500 Mexican business executives that is advising the Mexican Government on free-trade issues. "If it includes more countries, it gives more alternatives to Mexican producers and consumers."
 
Effort Begun Last Year
 Speculation about the possibility of continentwide free-trade negotiations has been strong since last year, when President Carlos Salinas de Gortari formally requested free-trade talks with the United States.
Canada quickly expressed interest in having a role in the new talks, but its status was left unclear amid uncertainty about how its inclusion might affect the United States-Mexican talks, which were considered a high priority by both countries.
President Salinas has sought to conclude a free-trade pact quickly to accelerate the economic growth that has become a hallmark and a crucial test of his administration. President Bush has also made an accord a central economic objective and has sought to complete it before it could become embroiled in the politics of the 1992 Presidential election year.
As discussion about broadening the talks has grown, Mexican politicians and commentators have expressed concern that Canada's participation could slow the process and reduce Mexico to the status of a latecomer to the 1988 United States-Canada accord.
But American officials have appeared increasingly receptive to the idea of a three-way negotiation. In his letter to Congress in September requesting permission to negotiate a United States-Mexican agreement, President Bush said Canada would be consulted. Since then, the three countries have held a series of meetings to work out the details of Canada's participation, including a high-level conference at the Mexican resort of Cancun earlier this month.
Administration officials in Washington today would not directly confirm that an agreement had been reached to include Canada. But a spokesman for Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, said Mrs. Hills had made clear her receptiveness to such an arrangement.
 
No Obstacles Seen
 "She has said in the past that she sees no technical or substantial obstacles to Canada's participation," said the spokesman, Timothy O'Leary.
In seeking a direct role in the negotiations, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada has argued that any United States-Mexican agreement would inevitably affect Canada.
Canada and the United States exchange more than $150 billion of goods and services each year and each is the other's most important trading partner.
Mexico's two-way trade with the United States is more than $60 billion, making Mexico the United States' third-largest trading partner, after Canada and Japan. Mexican trade with Canada amounts to only $2.5 billion annually, but has grown rapidly in recent years.

Buoyed in part by new military orders related to the Persian Gulf buildup, orders to factories for long-lasting goods climbed 4.4 percent in December, the Commerce Department reported today.
The increase was somewhat more than expected, but analysts said they found little in the latest figures to support hopes of an economic rebound. Even the rise in military orders, they noted, was from a severely depressed level the month before and was not large enough to provide any more than a nudge to business activity in coming months. 
 "It's only a marginal recovery," commented Robert H. Chandross, chief economist for Lloyds ank North America. He added that the best that could be said of today's report on durable goods, which are those that last at least three years, is that "in the aggregate, the economy is not in free fall."
A survey released today by the Conference Board, however, showed that consumers' confidence in the economy continues to erode, Pessimism is deepening, the survey showed, as worries mount about the Persian Gulf war and rising unemployment. [Page D2.]
 
No Military Breakdown
 A Commerce Department official said last month's orders for durables were clearly higher than they would have been in the absence of the Persian Gulf confrontation. But he said he could provide no breakdown, for example, of orders for ships compared with those for tanks.
Excluding military orders and those for commercial aircraft -- segments of the economy not closely linked to the business cycle -- December durables orders fell 3.4 percent from November levels.
Excluding only military goods, orders rose 1.9 percent, to $113.3 billion, after tumbling 9.1 percent without military goods in November, the department reported.
December's 4.4 percent overall rise from the month before, to $121.6 billion in orders, followed a 10.1 percent plunge in November from October, only slightly better than the 10.5 percent plunge initially reported for that month.
November's order total was so poor because of the later-than-usual adoption of the Federal budget, which delayed military and other Government purchases. Orders for military capital goods in November were the lowest in more than eight years, at $5.3 billion, and they rose last month to only $8.3 billion, or about 10 percent more than the monthly average for 1990 and below the average for 1989.
For all of 1990, durable goods orders sank 1.6 percent, the first decline since a 6.4 percent drop in the recession year of 1982, according to department officials.
Orders for durables are closely watched because they signal future levels of economic activity. But analysts are careful to allow for wild gyrations caused, in part, because durable goods tend to be costly items, like airplanes, that are ordered sporadically and in large quantities.
Analysts also take into consideration that some of the biggest items ordered may not actually be built for years, although the economy gets some immediate stimulus from design and other preliminary work.
Other parts of today's report showed that shipments of durable goods in December fell 2.8 percent, to $118.1 billion, hurt by a decline in shippings of motor vehicles and parts.
 
Higher Backlogs
 Backlogs of unfilled orders edged up seven-tenths of 1 percent, to $501.6 billion, almost entirely related to aircraft and shipbuilding, the department said.
The 13.6 percent increase, to $32 billion, in transportation equipment was helped by large increases in military shipbuilding and commercial aircraft and parts, which more than offset a decline in motor vehicles and parts. Orders for electrical machinery rose 11.5 percent, to $20.6 billion, mostly reflecting communications equipment.
However, new orders for non-electrical machinery slumped 5.1 percent, to $21 billion. And orders for primary metals slumped 6.1 percent, to $10.1 billion.
 
Year-to-Year Decline
 Before adjustment for seasonal variation, durable goods orders last month were $123.7 billion, up from $115.6 billion in November but 7.3 percent below the level of December 1989.
New orders for nonmilitary capital goods advanced 16.9 percent last month, to $41.9 billion, the report also showed, reflecting increases in orders for machine tools, computers and office equipment.
The economy could get "a significant countercyclical" lift in coming months from investment spending, said Gordon Richards of the National Association of Manufacturers, particularly from spending on computers.

HEADLINE: Intel to Spend Up to a Billion This Year

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif., Jan. 29

 BODY:
In a bold move to stay ahead of its competitors, the Intel Corporation plans to spend as much as $1 billion on new plants and equipment this year. If it does, that would make it the leader in capital spending among semiconductor companies, American or Japanese.
Gordon Moore, Intel's chairman, told securities analysts at a meeting here today that Intel's capital spending would be $800 million to $1 billion this year, and he said that the company expected to maintain that level for several years. That amount would be up sharply from about $670 million last year and would double the less than $450 million spent the year before that.
 
'Definitely a First'
 "This is definitely a first for a company to spend $1 billion," said Rajiv Chaudhri, semiconductor analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company. Japanese chip makers, he said, are being more conservative in capital spending because they already make too many dynamic random access memory, or D-RAM, chips, their main product. The leading Japanese semiconductor producers are expected to spend $600 million to $800 million this year, he said. 
 The ability to outspend American companies on development and production has been a big reason Japanese companies have made gains in the semiconductor business. Now Intel plans to borrow a page from the Japanese by spending heavily through a recession to gain ground on weaker competitors. Other American companies might not be able to match that tactic because Intel has an unusually strong product line.
Intel is the only supplier of the 386 and 486 microprocessors, which serve as the "brains" of the most advanced personal computers compatible with the standard set by the International Business Machines Corporation.
 
Facing End of Monopoly
 But Intel, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., now faces the end of its monopoly. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is beginning to sell a chip that duplicates the 386. And powerful microprocessors using technology known as reduced instruction set computing, or RISC, are moving strongly into the marketplace.
Intel's apparent response will be to use accumulated wealth to outspend the competition. It will add advanced new capacity at existing plants and at new plants in Ireland and Oregon.
The advanced technology will allow the company to produce vastly more complex chips, containing millions of transistors. That will essentially allow more of the parts of a computer to be placed on a single chip, giving Intel greater revenue from each computer sold. Dr. Moore said Intel should be able to keep a positive cash flow despite the heavy expenditures.
But Michael Gumport of Shearson Lehman Brothers, said the high spending could hurt Intel's earnings if demand softened or competition proved tougher than expected.
"I would be a lot happier if they had won those lawsuits before deciding to spend so much money," he said, referring to legal attempts by Intel to block Advanced Micro Devices and other competitors.
Intel's stock, traded over the counter, closed today at $44.50, up 50 cents.
Andrew Grove, Intel's president and chief executive, said in an interview that the company wanted to move "not when the competition becomes palpable, but well before it does." He added, "For us to have the opportunities that we have today and not bet on them, I don't want to lose that way."
Intel also plans to be a moving target for competitors. While Advanced Micro begins selling its 386, Intel will try to move computer makers toward the more powerful 486 chip.
Intel will introduce three scaled-down versions of the 486 this year that will be less expensive than the full 486 and should appeal more to computer makers. The first of those chips, expected to be called the 486SX, will lack the high-speed arithmetic capability of the full 486.
Thomas Kurlak, semiconductor analyst at Merrill Lynch, said that given Intel's plans, the potential competition from Advanced Micro and the RISC chips seems far less worrisome than it did a few months ago. Wall Street "has learned they don't need a monopoly as a crutch to do well," he said.

HEADLINE: Auto Slump Hits Honda And Production Is Cut

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 29

 BODY:
One of Japan's most successful auto makers is experiencing one of the most important rites of passage since it became a United States manufacturer: slumping sales and production cuts.
The Honda Motor Company, maker of the best-selling model in the United States for the last two years, the Honda Accord, said it would trim production at three assembly plants, including its factory in Marysville, Ohio. The cuts reflect consumer jitters over the war in the Persian Gulf and a deepening recession in the American automotive industry. 
 But Honda will not take its cue from larger Detroit rivals, which customarily idle workers for a week or more. Honda production will be cut back, but workers in Ohio will stay on the job, assembling sedans, coupes and station wagons at a slower pace.
Besides the Marysville plant, two of the Honda plants are in Japan. But the Ohio factory, the Japanese industry's first assembly plant in the United States, has become a symbol of the auto maker's widely praised approaches to manufacturing, labor relations and product design.
Honda and the other Japanese auto makers with United States plants have not yet had to adjust to serious sales declines, so American labor experts will be closely watching how they cope as the industry slumps.
 
'Nobody Is Unaffected'
 Honda, which has never before had to slow American production because of faltering demand, said it would build 25,000 fewer cars in the first quarter, equal to about 3 percent of its United States sales in 1990. Production cuts at Honda's Sayama and Suzuka plants in Japan will account for about 20,000 cars, assorted models that would have been earmarked for export to the United States. About 5,000 cars will be cut from production schedules at Marysville.
"This shows that nobody is unaffected by the weaker demand picture," said Harvey Heinbach, automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch & Company in New York. "Honda has been one of the very few auto makers who was able to sell everything" it could produce.
He added, "Even Honda is no longer in that position."
While the company's reaction to slow sales is relatively mild so far, its approach could change if the recession is longer and deeper than economists are predicting, a Honda spokesman acknowledged.
Since the early 1980's, in the face of restraints on their exports, seven Japanese auto makers have opened their own North American assembly plants or joint-venture plants with American partners.
Honda was the first Japanese auto maker to open an assembly plant in the United States, when it began making motorcycles at Marysville in 1979. It added cars in 1982.
The plant has become a prime example of how well American workers can adapt to Japanese-style management: productivity and quality standards at the factory have consistently outpaced those at most Big Three auto plants. That is due in part to relatively young and enthusiastic workers who have been assured they will always have a job.
For years, Honda's sales have risen spectacularly. But skeptics, who include American union leaders, have wondered how Honda might fare in a time of adversity. They may now have a chance to find out.
 
U.S. Sales Down 16%
 In the last two months, Honda's United States sales have dropped almost 16 percent from a year earlier, and inventories of unsold cars have been swelling. Honda has been the only auto maker -- American or Japanese -- to refuse steadfastly to pay cash rebates directly to customers to stimulate sales. Instead, Honda prefers to give discounts to dealers, allowing them to negotiate prices with customers.
Shigeaki Kato, a Honda spokesman, said the production cut would be accomplished by slowing the Marysville assembly line; many workers will simply do their usual jobs more slowly. All overtime work is being canceled.
The line speed at the plant, which normally averages about 96 cars an hour on a two-shift operation, will be reduced by about three cars an hour. The Marysville factory is the single biggest and most productive auto plant in North America, producing about 50 percent more cars than the typical American plant. It employs 6,200 workers and assembles about 60,000 cars a year.
Japanese auto makers have long avoided layoffs in Japan by keeping their work forces lean. During slowdowns, they gave workers other projects, taught them additional skills or sent them out to sell cars until business improved.
During union organizing drives in the United States, like those that failed at Marysville in 1986 and at the Nissan Motor Company's plant in Smyrna, Tenn., in 1989, the United Automobile Workers insisted that nonunion workers in Japanese plants in the United States were in danger of being laid off in a recession without unemployment benefits.
Some of these Japanese "transplant" operations have hired temporary workers who are subject to layoffs. But so far, layoffs have not been a big issue at the American plants run by Japanese companies, because the sales of Japan's auto makers, as a group, have continued to grow.

HEADLINE: Cash Draining, T.W.A. Asks U.S. to Act on Deal

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Trans World Airlines, its coffers brimming with cash as it entered the winter, is now pleading hardship to the Federal Government.
Sharply higher fuel prices, a drop in travel because of the recession and now a huge decline in bookings on its international routes since the Persian Gulf war increased fears of terrorism have begun to deplete the airline's financial reserves. So in a filing on Monday seeking swift approval from the Transportation Department for the sale of its London routes and other assets to American Airlines, T.W.A. argued that it critically needed the $445 million it would get from the deal. 
 At the end of September, the most recent date for which the airline has disclosed its cash position, T.W.A. had about $383 million in cash and $500 million in investments, some of which could easily be converted to cash.
In normal times such a position would enable T.W.A. to offset its losses during the winter, when overseas travel drops. But these are not normal times.
"Prompt approval of the proposed transfer of route authority to American is essential if T.W.A. is to avoid Pan Am's fate," said the filing, which is required by the Transportation Department in considering route sales.
 
Loan for Pan Am
 Pan American World Airways filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code this month because it was running out of cash. It was also able to get a $150 million loan from Bankers Trust and United Airlines to tide it over until the sale of its London routes to United for $290 million.
Because T.W.A. has been in a better financial position than Pan Am, some analysts said the dire warning in the filing was intended to put pressure on the Transportation Department to approve the sale.
"Part of this could be posturing," said Raymond Neidl, an airline analyst with Dillon, Read. But he added that "if traffic in February and March continues to fall as it has, then the cash can disappear pretty quickly."
Carl C. Icahn, the chairman of T.W.A., sought during the fall to strengthen the carrier by trying to combine it with Pan Am, by considering the purchase of Eastern Airlines' assets like the hub at Atlanta, and by putting pressure on T.W.A.'s unions for concessions. These efforts have not succeeded so far.
Mr. Icahn has also not hesitated to make big cuts to reduce operating costs.
T.W.A. cut its international service by half and put smaller Boeing 767's on some of its flights to replace 747's. The carrier also cut its work force by 2,500 employees, or 8 percent.
 
Bookings Decline
 Mark A. Buckstein, a senior vice president and general counsel for T.W.A., said the decision to cut back was made when bookings for the next 30 to 60 days began to fall, with many cancellations.
He said Mr. Icahn and T.W.A. management were no longer trying to find a carrier to merge with or to pick up some of the assets on the market.
During the last period when terrorist attacks sent bookings plunging, in 1985 and 1986, T.W.A. also moved quickly to cut back on flights to Europe and diverted much of its fleet to destinations in Florida and other parts of the United States. Mr. Buckstein said a similar strategy was being followed now, with the airline having added capacity to Florida.
Some of T.W.A.'s unions, including the Air Line Pilots Association, have asked the Transportation Department to require management to submit a plan on the use of the proceeds of the route transfer or dictate that the money be spent on such things as new equipment.

HEADLINE: Wait for a Bed at Public Hospital Can Be Days

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
The average emergency room wait for a bed in the nation's public hospitals is now more than five and a half hours and in the worst cases 3 to 10 days, the National Association of Public Hospitals said today.
It is the first time that public hospitals around the country have been surveyed on this and other data that describe their rapidly deteriorating condition. Public hospitals, which are those operated by cities and other government bodies, are where most of the unininsured and the poor receive care. Private not-for-profit hospitals are run by churches, charitable organizations and universities while profit-seeking hospitals are owned by private corporations.
 
Average Loss of $40 Million
 Using data from a survey of 60 public hospitals completed in 1988, the study found that in that year: 
 The hospitals lost an average of $40 million to care that was not reimbursed by private insurance, Medicaid or Medicare. The hospitals receive subsidies from local governments, but even after these, their revenue fell an average of $9 million short of operating costs.
*An average of 104 cocaine-addicted babies were born in the hospitals, and the numbers were increasing.
*An average of 19,000 emergency room visits at the hospitals were drug-related, accounting for almost 30 percent of the emergency department visits.
The researchers found that the average wait for admission to a public hospital from the emergency department was 5.6 hours. The average of the longest wait at all the hospitals was 31.6 hours. While the longest wait was 10 days, waits of 3 to 4 days were not uncommon, said Virginia B. Weslowski, director of research for the public hospitals' association.
The survey for the emergency room waits was conducted over a one-month period while other parts of the study continued over the year.
 
Crisis for Many Hospitals
 Public hospitals, which historically are what the association called "the nation's safety net," have never been very healthy economically, said Larry S. Gage, president of the association. But now, the situation is reaching a crisis for many more hospitals.
"No one epidemic is sufficient to bring us to this point," Mr. Gage said. "But put together AIDS and crack and teen-age pregnancy and high infant mortality and inner-city violence and you see a large systematic increase in demand on these hospitals and a tremendous increase in mostly uninsured patients presenting themselves for care."
The report said, "In spite of long waiting times, overcrowding, staff shortages and lack of adequate equipment, the number of patients using public hospital clinics continues to grow."
The survey showed that more than 50 percent of all the visits to the hospitals by patients not admitted overnight were by people without insurance, confirming the idea that public hospitals are the "family doctor" for people who have no insurance.
 
Other Hospitals Affected
 Dr. Arthur Kellermann, medical director of the Emergency Department of the Regional Medical Center at Memphis, said the figures in the report described the first wave of a problem that is present in a large number of private and nonprofit hospitals.
Doctors have reported anecdotally for some time that public hospitals have been hit hard by a combination of epidemics and what Dr. Kellermann called a health care "system that just doesn't work well." The data released today provide evidence to back up the anecdotes that conditions are worsening, said Dr. Kellermann, who took part in the study,
The current crisis was noted in 1988 in New York City, he said, but the latest data show that the problems seen there are now occurring in hospitals around the country. "Many hospitals now are literally functioning daily and nightly as if there were a disaster or combat in the cities," Dr. Kellermann said.
The waits in the emergency departments, he said, are only the more visible parts of what is happening to hospitals in general. He said there are often long waits from the time a patient comes into the hospital and the time he first sees a doctor. "That is the least important wait, and this report doesn't measure that," Dr. Kellermann said. "These numbers are much more serious."
 
Waits for Intensive Care
 For example, he cited a wait of many hours for a patient who had suffered a stroke and had received emergency treatment but needed to be put in a bed where he could be watched.
The study showed the average wait for a bed in the intensive care wards was about 3.2 hours. The maximum wait at all the hospitals averaged 18.7 hours.
When the emergency rooms fill up with patients on stretchers, the survey showed that emergency departments take one or more of several measures: They refuse to accept new transfers from other hospitals, they close the emergency room to incoming ambulances and they begin to transfer patients to other hospitals.

HEADLINE: Weyerhaeuser Posts a Profit

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TACOMA, Wash., Jan. 29

 BODY:
The Weyerhaeuser Company, the wood products concern, today reported a profit for the fourth quarter but said its operating results were down in all but one of its business segments.
Weyerhaeuser had net income of $58.8 million, or 30 cents a share, compared with a loss of $128.7 million in the comparable period of 1989. Revenue for the quarter was $2.09 billion, nearly 19 percent less than the $2.57 billion for last year's quarter.
For the year, Weyerhaeuser had profits of $393.7 million, or $1.87 a share, 15.4 percent more than 1989's earnings of $341.1 million, or $1.56 a share. Revenue for 1990 was $9.02 billion, 10.8 percent below 1989's $10.11 billion.
The 1989 figures inlcuded a loss of $270.4 million for special items related to a restructuring. Without that expense, profits would have been $141.7 million, or 67 cents, for the period.
Setting aside special items in 1989, Weyerhaeuser's 1990 operating results for forest products were down 22 percent, while pulp and paper products were down 29 percent and real estate was down 70 percent. Operating results for financial services were seven times higher.
The company's shares were up 50 cents today, to $23.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.
George H. Weyerhaeuser, chairman and chief executive, said his company was among the first to be hurt by the recession. Mortgage and construction loans were harder to come by, housing starts hit a 10-year low and demand for new commercial space fell, all of which affected the building-materials markets, he said.
The company's financial service subsidiaries were a bright spot. The GNA insurance subsidiary set an earnings record, and the Weyerhaeuser Mortgage Company posted near-record results.

Transcript of President's State of the Union Message to Nation

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Bush's State of the Union Message last night at the Capitol, as recorded by The New York Times:
Mr. President and Mr. Speaker and members of the United States Congress, I come to this house of the people to speak to you and all Americans, certain that we stand at a defining hour. 
 Halfway around the world we are engaged in a great struggle in the skies and on the seas and sands. We know why we're there. We are Americans, part of something larger than ourselves.
For two centuries, we've done the hard work of freedom. And tonight we lead the world in facing down a threat to decency and humanity.
What is at stake is more than one small country, it is a big idea -- a new world order where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause to achieve the universal aspirations of mankind: peace and security, freedom and the rule of law. Such is a world worthy of our struggle, and worthy of our children's future.
The community of nations has resolutely gathered to condemn and repel lawless aggression. Saddam Hussein's unprovoked invasion, his ruthless, systematic rape of a peaceful neighbor, violated everything the community of nations holds dear. The world has said this aggression would not stand, and it will not stand.
 
World Stands as One
Together, together, we have resisted the trap of appeasement, cynicism and isolation that gives temptation to tyrants. The world has answered Saddam's invasion with 12 United Nations resolutions, starting with a demand for Iraq's immediate and unconditional withdrawal, and backed up by forces from 28 countries of six continents. With few exceptions, the world now stands as one.
The end of the cold war has been a victory for all humanity. A year and a half ago, in Germany, I said that our goal was a Europe whole and free. Tonight, Germany is united. Europe has become whole and free, and America's leadership was instrumental in making it possible.
Our relationship to the Soviet Union is important, not only to us but to the world. That relationship has helped to shape these and other historic changes. But, like many other nations, we have been deeply concerned by the violence in the Baltics, and we have communicated that concern to the Soviet leadership.
The principle that has guided us is simple: our objective is to help the Baltic peoples achieve their aspirations, not to punish the Soviet Union. In our recent discussions with the Soviet leadership we have been given representations, which, if fulfilled, would result in the withdrawal of some Soviet forces, a re-opening of dialogue with the republics, and a move away from violence.
We will watch carefully as the situation develops. And we will maintain our contact with the Soviet leadership to encourage continued commitment to democratization and reform.
If it is possible, I want to continue to build a lasting basis for U.S.-Soviet cooperation, for a more peaceful future for all mankind.
 
Wisdom of Our Founders
The triumph of democratic ideas in Eastern Europe and Latin America, and the continuing struggle for freedom elsewhere all around the world all confirm the wisdom of our nation's founders.
Tonight, we work to achieve another victory, a victory over tyranny and savage aggression.
We in this Union enter the last decade of the 20th century thankful for our blessings, steadfast in our purpose, aware of our difficulties, and responsive to our duties at home and around the world.
For two centuries, America has served the world as an inspiring example of freedom and democracy. For generations, America has led the struggle to preserve and extend the blessings of liberty. And today, in a rapidly changing world, American leadership is indispensable. Americans know that leadership brings burdens and sacrifices.
But we also know why the hopes of humanity turn to us. We are Americans; we have a unique responsibility to do the hard work of freedom. And when we do, freedom works.
The conviction and courage we see in the Persian Gulf today is simply the American character in action. The indomitable spirit that is contributing to this victory for world peace and justice is the same spirit that gives us the power and the potential to meet our toughest challenges at home.
 
An Appeal for Renewal
We are resolute and resourceful. If we can selflessly confront evil for the sake of good in a land so far away, then surely we can make this land all that it should be.
If anyone tells you that America's best days are behind her, they're looking the wrong way.
Tonight, I come before this house, and the American people, with an appeal for renewal. This is not merely a call for new government initiatives, it is a call for new initiative in government, in our communities, and from every American to prepare for the next American century.
America has always led by example. So who among us will set the example? Which of our citizens will lead us in this next American century? Everyone who steps forward today to get one addict off drugs, to convince one troubled teen-ager not to give up on life, to comfort one AIDS patient, to help one hungry child.
We have within our reach the promise of a renewed America. We can find meaning and reward by serving some higher purpose than ourselves -- a shining purpose, the illumination of a thousand points of light. And it is expressed by all who know the irresistible force of a child's hand, of a friend who stands by you and stays there, a volunteer's generous gesture, an idea that is simply right.
 
The Union of Each of Us
The problems before us may be different, but the key to solving them remains the same: it is the individual, the individual who steps forward. And the state of our Union is the union of each of us, one to the other, the sum of our friendships, marriages, families and communities.
We all have something to give. So if you know how to read, find someone who can't. If you've got a hammer, find a nail. If you're not hungry, not lonely, not in trouble, seek out someone who is. Join the community of conscience. Do the hard work of freedom. And that will define the state of our Union.
Since the birth of our nation, "we the people" has been the source of our strength. What government can do alone is limited, but the potential of the American people knows no limits.
We are a nation of rock-solid realism and clear-eyed idealism. We are Americans. We are the nation that believes in the future. We are the nation that can shape the future.
And we've begun to do just that, by strengthening the power and choice of individuals and families.
Together these last two years we've put dollars for child care directly in the hands of parents instead of bureaucracies, unshackled the potential of Americans with disabilities, applied the creativity of the marketplace in the service of the environment, for clean air, and made homeownership possible for more Americans.
 
Citizens as Resource
The strength of a democracy is not in bureaucracy, it is in the people and their communities. In everything we do, let us unleash the potential of our most precious resource: our citizens, our citizens themselves. We must return to families, communities, counties, cities, states and institutions of every kind the power to chart their own destiny and the freedom and opportunity provided by strong economic growth. And that's what America is all about.
I know, tonight, in some regions of our country people are in genuine economic distress. And I hear them.
Earlier this month Kathy Blackwell of Massachusetts wrote me about what can happen when the economy slows down, saying, "My heart is aching, and I think that you should know -- your people out here are hurting badly."
I understand. And I'm not unrealistic about the future. But there are reasons to be optimistic about our economy.
First, we don't have to fight double-digit inflation. Second, most industries won't have to make big cuts in production because they don't have big inventories piled up. And third, our exports are running solid and strong. In fact, American businesses are exporting at a record rate.
 
Times in Perspective
So let's put these times in perspective. Together, since 1981, we've created almost 20 million jobs, cut inflation in half and cut interest rates in half.
And, yes, the largest peacetime economic expansion in history has been temporarily interrupted. But our economy is still over twice as large as our closest competitor.
We will get this recession behind us and return to growth soon. We will get on our way to a new record of expansion and achieve the competitive strength that will carry us into the next American century.
We should focus our efforts today on encouraging economic growth, investing in the future and giving power and opportunity to the individual.
We must begin with control of Federal spending. And that's why I'm submitting a budget that holds the growth in spending to less than the rate of inflation. And that's why, amid all the sound and fury of last year's budget debate, we put into law new, enforceable spending caps so that future spending debates will mean a battle of ideas, not a bidding war.
And though controversial, the budget agreement finally put the Federal Government on a pay-as-you-go plan, and cut the growth of debt by nearly $500 billion. And that frees funds for saving and job-creating investment.
 
Capital Gains Incentive
Now, let's do more. My budget again includes tax-free family savings accounts, penalty-free withdrawals from I.R.A.'s for first-time homebuyers and, to increase jobs and growth, a reduced tax for long-term capital gains.
I know there are differences among us about the impact and the effects of a capital gains incentive. So tonight I am asking the Congressional leaders and the Federal Reserve to cooperate with us in a study, led by Chairman Alan Greenspan, to sort out our technical differences so that we can avoid a return to unproductive partisan bickering.
But just as our efforts will bring economic growth now and in the future, they must also be matched by long-term investments for the next American century.
And that requires a forward-looking plan of action, and that's exactly what we will be sending to the Congress. We've prepared a detailed series of proposals, that include:
*A budget that promotes investment in America's future -- in children, education, infrastructure, space and high technology.
*Legislation to achieve excellence in education, building on the partnership forged with the 50 governors at the education summit, enabling parents to choose their children's schools and helping to make America No. 1 in math and science.
*A blueprint for a new national highway system, a critical investment in our transportation infrastructure.
*A research and development agenda that includes record levels of Federal investment and a permanent tax credit to strengthen private R. and D., and create jobs.
*A comprehensive national energy strategy that calls for energy conservation and efficiency, increased development and greater use of alternative fuels.
*A banking reform plan to bring America's financial system into the 21st century, so that our banks remain safe and secure and continue -- can continue to make job-creating loans for our factories, our businesses and home buyers. You know, I do think that there's been too much pessimism. Sound banks should be making more sound loans, now. And interest rates should be lower, now.
 
Economic Incentives
In addition to these proposals, we must recognize that our economic strength depends on being competitive in world markets. We must continue to expand American exports. A successful Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations will create more real jobs, and more real growth, for all nations. And you and I know that if the playing field is level, America's workers and farmers can outwork, outproduce anyone, anytime, anywhere.
And with a Mexican Free Trade Agreement and our Enterprise for the Americas Initiative we can help our partners strengthen their economies and move toward a free trade zone throughout this entire hemisphere.
The budget also includes a plan of action right here at home to put more power and opportunity in the hands of the individual. And that means new incentives to create jobs in our inner cities by encouraging investment through enterprise zones. It also means tenant control and ownership of public housing. Freedom and the power to choose should not be the privilege of wealth. They are the birthright of every American.
Civil rights are also crucial to protecting equal opportunity. Every one of us has a responsibility to speak out against racism, bigotry and hate. We will continue our vigorous enforcement of existing statutes, and I will once again press the Congress to strengthen the laws against employment discrimination without resorting to the use of unfair preferences.
We're determined to protect another fundamental civil right: freedom from crime and the fear that stalks our cities. The Attorney General will soon convene a crime summit of our nation's law-enforcement officials. And to help us support them we need tough crime control legislation, and we need it now.
And as we fight crime we will fully implement our national strategy for combating drug abuse. Recent data show we are making progress, but much remains to be done. We will not rest until the day of the dealer is over, forever.
 
Health Care Initiatives
Good health care is every American's right, and every American's responsibility. And so we are proposing an aggressive program of new prevention initiatives for infants, for children, for adults and for the elderly to promote a healthier America and to help keep costs from spiraling.
It's time to give people more choice in government by reviving the ideal of the citizen politician who comes not to stay, but to serve. And one of the reasons that there is so much support across this country for term limitations is that the American people are increasingly concerned about big-money influence in politics. So we must look beyond the next election to the next generation. And the time has come to put the national interest above the special interest and to totally eliminate political action committees.
And that would truly put more competition in elections and more power in the hands of individuals. And where power cannot be put directly in the hands of the individual, it should be moved closer to the people -- away from Washington.
The Federal Government too often treats government programs as if they are of Washington, by Washington and for Washington. Once established, Federal programs seem to become immortal.
It's time for a more dynamic program life cycle. Some programs should increase. Some should decrease. Some should be terminated. And some should be consolidated and turned over to the states.
My budget includes a list of programs for potential turnover totaling more than $20 billion. Working with Congress and the governors, I propose we select at least $15 billion in such programs and turn them over to the states in a single consolidated grant, fully funded, for flexible management by the states.
 
'States as Laboratories'
The value of this turnover approach is straightforward. It allows the Federal Government to reduce overhead. It allows states to manage more flexibly and more efficiently. It moves power and decision-making closer to the people. And it re-enforces a theme of this Administration: appreciation and encouragement of the innovative power of "states as laboratories."
This nation was founded by leaders who understood that power belongs in the hands of people. And they planned for the future. And so must we, here and all around the world.
As Americans, we know that there are times when we must step forward and accept our responsibility to lead the world away from the dark chaos of dictators toward the brighter promise of a better day.
Almost 50 years ago, we began a long struggle against aggressive totalitarianism. Now we face another defining hour for America and for the world.
There is no one more devoted, more committed to the hard work of freedom than every soldier and sailor, every marine, airman and coastguardsman -- every man and woman now serving in the Persian Gulf.
Oh, how they deserve -- what a fitting tribute to them. You see, what a wonderful, fitting tribute to them. Each of them has volunteered, volunteered to provide for this nation's defense. And now they bravely struggle to earn for America, for the world and for future generations, a just and lasting peace.
Our commitment to them must be the equal to their commitment to their country. They are truly American's finest.
 
Diplomatic Efforts Cited
And the war in the gulf is not a war we wanted. We worked hard to avoid war. For more than five months we, along with the Arab League, the European Community, the United Nations, tried every diplomatic avenue. U.N. Secretary General Perez de Cuellar; Presidents Gorbachev, Mitterand, Ozal, Mubarak and Bendjedid; Kings Fahd and Hassan; Prime Ministers Major and Andreotti, just to name a few, all worked for a solution. But time and again Saddam Hussein flatly rejected the path of diplomacy and peace.
The world well knows how this conflict began, and when: it began on August 2d, when Saddam invaded and sacked a small, defenseless neighbor. And I am certain of how it will end. So that peace can prevail, we will prevail.
Thank you. Tonight I am pleased to report that we are on course. Iraq's capacity to sustain war is being destroyed. Our investment, our training, our planning, all are paying off. Time will not be Saddam's salvation.
Our purpose in the Persian Gulf remains constant: to drive Iraq out of Kuwait, to restore Kuwait's legitimate government and to insure the stability and security of this critical region.
Let me make clear what I mean by the region's stability and security. We do not seek the destruction of Iraq, its culture or its people. Rather, we seek an Iraq that uses its great resources not to destroy, not to serve the ambitions of a tyrant, but to build a better life for itself and its neighbors. We seek a Persian Gulf where conflict is no longer the rule, where the strong are neither tempted nor able to intimidate the weak.
Most Americans know instinctively why we are in the gulf. They know we had to stop Saddam now, not later. They know that this brutal dictator will do anything, will use any weapon, will commit any outrage, no matter how many innocents suffer.
 
A New, Enduring Peace
They know we must make sure that control of the world's oil resources does not fall into his hands only to finance further aggression. They know that we need to build a new, enduring peace, based not on arms races and confrontation but on shared principles and the rule of law.
And we all realize that our responsibility to be the catalyst for peace in the region does not end with the successful conclusion of this war.
Democracy brings the undeniable value of thoughtful dissent, and we've heard some dissenting voices here at home, some -- a handful -- reckless, most responsible. But the fact that all voices have the right to speak out is one of the reasons we've been united in purpose and principle for 200 years.
Our progress in this great struggle is the result of years of vigilance and a steadfast commitment to a strong defense. And now, with remarkable technological advances like the Patriot missile, we can defend against ballistic missile attacks aimed at innocent civilians.
Looking forward, I have directed that the S[trategic] D[efense] I[nitiative] program be refocused on providing protection from limited ballistic missile strikes, whatever their source. Let us pursue an S.D.I. program that can deal with any future threat to the United States, to our forces overseas and to our friends and allies.
The quality of American technology, thanks to the American worker, has enabled us to successfully deal with difficult military conditions and help minimize precious loss of life. We have given our men and women the very best. And they deserve it.
We all have a special place in our hearts for the families of our men and women serving in the gulf. They are represented here tonight, by Mrs. Norman Schwarzkopf. We are all very grateful to General Schwarzkopf and to all those serving with him. And I might also recognize one who came with Mrs. Schwarzkopf, Alma Powell, the wife of the distinguished Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. And to the families let me say our forces in the gulf will not stay there one day longer than is necessary to complete their mission.
 
Pilots' Courage Praised
The courage and the success of the R.A.F. pilots, of the Kuwaiti, Saudi, French, the Canadians, the Italians, the pilots of Qatar and Bahrain, all are proof that for the first time since World War II the international community is united. The leadership of the United Nations, once only a hoped-for ideal, is now confirming its founders' vision.
And I am heartened that we are not being asked to bear alone the financial burdens of this struggle. Last year our friends and allies provided the bulk of the economic costs of Desert Shield, and now, having received commitments of over $40 billion for the first three months of 1991, I am confident they will do no less as we move through Desert Storm.
But the world has to wonder what the dictator of Iraq is thinking. If he thinks that by targeting innocent civilians in Israel and Saudi Arabia that he will gain advantage, he is dead wrong. And if he thinks that he will advance his cause through tragic and despicable environmental terrorism, he is dead wrong. And if he thinks that by abusing the coalition prisoners of war he will benefit, he is dead wrong.
We will succeed in the gulf. And when we do, the world community will have sent an enduring warning to any dictator or despot, present or future, who contemplates outlaw aggression.
The world can therefore seize this opportunity to fulfill the long-held promise of a new world order where brutality will go unrewarded, and aggression will meet collective resistance.
Yes, the United States bears a major share of leadership in this effort. Among the nations of the world only the United States of America has both the moral standing and the means to back it up. We are the only nation on this earth that could assemble the forces of peace.
 
Burden of Leadership
This is the burden of leadership, and the strength that has made America the beacon of freedom in a searching world.
This nation has never found glory in war. Our people have never wanted to abandon the blessings of home and work for distant lands and deadly conflict. If we fight in anger, it is only because we have to fight at all. And all of us yearn for a world where we will never have to fight again.
Each of us will measure within ourselves the value of this great struggle. Any cost in lives -- any cost -- is beyond our power to measure. But the cost of closing our eyes to aggression is beyond mankind's power to image.
This we do know: Our cause is just. Our cause is moral. Our cause is right.
Let future generations understand the burden and blessings of freedom. Let them say, "We stood where duty required us to stand."
Let them know that, together, we affirmed America and the world as a community of conscience.
The winds of change are with us now. The forces of freedom are together, united. And we move toward the next century, more confident than ever, that we have the will at home and abroad to do what must be done: the hard work of freedom.
May God bless the United States of America. Thank you very, very much. Thank you all. Thank you.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: P.O.W.'s;
Baghdad Says Allied Air Raid Killed P.O.W.

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Jan. 29

 BODY:
An allied bombing raid on Baghdad last night killed a captured Western pilot detained apparently as a "human shield" at a Government building, the Baghdad radio said today.
The broadcast, quoting a military spokesman, did not give the pilot's name or nationality, and there was no means of corroborating the report. 
 "As part of the crimes being committed by the U.S. Administration and its Atlantic allies against steadfast Iraq and the residential areas in its town and against economic installations, the enemy fired three missiles simultaneously against Baghdad last night," the spokesman said. "One of the raids hit one of the departments of the Ministry of Industry, killing one of the captured foreign pilots, who had been evacuated to that department."
Iraq last week suspended an initial practice of screening and airing television and radio interviews with captured airmen, but said it would disperse them among economic and scientific installations. On Monday, the Baghdad Radio said several captured airmen had been wounded in allied air raids, but did not identify them.
The allies list 28 airmen as missing since the air campaign to drive Iraq out of Kuwait began on Jan. 17. Among those are 11 known to have been captured by the Iraqis -- 7 Americans, 2 Britons, 1 Italian and 1 Kuwaiti.
In Washington, the State Department summoned Khalid J. Shewayish, the senior Iraqi diplomat there, "to raise concern" about the pilots, a spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said.

Protests by Britain
 LONDON, Jan. 29 (Special to The New York Times) -- Britain called in the departing Iraqi Ambassador today to protest about reports that prisoners of war had been wounded while being held as human shields at strategic sites being bombed by the allies. The Government says that eight of its airmen are missing after being shot down over Iraq. Baghdad television broadcast film of two of them last week.
The envoy, Azmi M. Shafiq al-Salihi, confirmed to a Foreign Office minister, Douglas Hogg, that captured British, American and Italian pilots had been sent to "economic and scientific sites," a Foreign Office spokesman said.
The British minister said he had told the Ambassador that exposing British prisoners of war to military attacks would be a breach of the Geneva conventions.
Defense Minister Tom King said today that the allies would would continue bombing military and strategic targets for some time before sending ground forces into action against Iraqi troops in Kuwait.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION: The Response;
Mitchell Replies for Democrats to Bush's Message

 BODY:
Following is the transcript of remarks last night in Washington by George J. Mitchell of Maine, Senate majority leader, for the Democratic response to the State of the Union Message, as recorded by The New York Times:
Across the Persian Gulf, dawn is now breaking. For Americans there, another night of danger is passing. Another day of combat begins. 
 In the skies over Iraq, aboard the ships in the gulf, on the sands of Arabia, they're Americans -- not Republicans or Democrats -- but Americans who've answered their country's call.
Before the war began, we debated openly, as democracy demands. We agreed that Iraq's aggression was brutal and illegal and that Iraq must leave Kuwait, by force if necessary.
The difference was not in the goals, but in the means. Whether force should be used immediately, or only as a last resort if other means failed. No one will ever know if that other course would have worked. Now that war has begun we'll work to see that it's swift and decisive, with the least possible loss of life.
Our hearts go out to the prisoners of war who've endured brutality and exploitation. We honor their bravery. We care for their families. We warn their captors they'll pay a heavy price for mistreating our men.
There's nothing a democratic society can do that's more difficult than to ask a few to risk everything in behalf of the many who risk nothing. We've done that. Our troops deserve our full support. They have mine and that of the Congress.
Our support will not end when the fighting ends. Those who risk their lives in our behalf, and their families, must know that a grateful nation cares about them, not just during but also after the war.
 
Planning for Peace
And then, when the war's over, there's one lesson we must never forget: The dictator we help today may turn his weapons on us tomorrow. For 10 years, U.S. policy favored Iraq. We can't repeat that kind of mistake.
Out of the tragedy of war, we seek a world where the force of law is more powerful than the force of arms. We seek a world where justice and human rights are respected everywhere. Students massacred in China, priests murdered in Central America, demonstrators gunned down in Lithuania -- these acts of violence are as wrong as Iraqi soldiers killing civilians. We cannot oppose repression in one place and overlook it in another. We seek a world where the burdens of freedom are shared by all who enjoy its benefits.
For half a century, from the Berlin airlift to the Persian Gulf, America has done its part. Those allies who've prospered behind the shield of a common defense must contribute their fair share. They're not doing it yet. It's time they did.
One nation, Israel, has done much by its brave refusal to be provoked. This crisis has given us powerful new proof of the importance of Israel's friendship.
 
Nation's Other Business
But as critical as the gulf conflict is, the other business of the nation won't wait. The President says he seeks a new world order. We ask him to join us in putting our own house in order. We have a crisis abroad. But we also have a crisis here at home.
We're in a recession. More than a million Americans who had jobs last year are out of work today. Bankruptcies are rising. The banking system is in trouble. People are worried about their economic future. We can meet this crisis by providing for the well-being of the American family. That's our strength. Working families, the men and women who toil in industry, tend farms, work computers and run small businesses, the children and students who are the future -- they're the true measure of our national vitality.
In just two weeks, this war has shown us the enormous potential of our people and of our technology. We've combined superior equipment with concentrated training, high skill with great courage, to do the work of war. Now we should apply our talent and technology to the work of peace.
If we can make the best smart bomb, can't we make the best V.C.R.? If we can build a high-speed Patriot missile, can't we build a high-speed train? I believe we can.
Our first priority must be economic growth.
A skilled and dedicated work force, modern equipment and innovation are essential to a rising standard of living. And economic growth solves many problems. The old saying is true: The best social program is a good job.
 
Need for an Energy Policy
The first step to growth is a sensible energy policy. We should have learned the lessons of the two oil price shocks of the 70's. But we didn't. For 10 years, we've had no energy policy. We just relied on imported oil. We must change that. We need a new energy program which encourages conservation, promotes the use of alternative fuels, and reduces our dependence on imported oil.
We're outraged by the environmental disaster in the Persian Gulf. But there's a broader threat: To the global environment. We must combat pollution, before it makes much of the earth unfit for life.
We must strengthen the banking system now, before it's a full national crisis, not after.
Last year the Senate passed a good bill to limit spending in political campaigns and eliminate political action committees.
We're going to pass it again this year and push until it becomes law. We want a better society, not just for our returning service men and women, but for their children and all children.
We owe them not just a safer world but safer streets at home. So we'll put the emphasis and the resources where they belong, at the state and local level. That's the front line of the war on drugs and crime. We'll provide care, food and early education for the millions of children who don't get them.
 
Crisis in Health Care
We spend more on health care than any other country. We get the best of care -- but only for those who can afford it. That leaves out a lot of Americans. Thirty-seven million don't have any health insurance. And we don't have any policy on what will be the crisis of this decade: long-term care for the elderly.
We can provide better health care at less cost. We all have to do more with less. Your families have to. Government must do the same, to be more careful with your tax dollars. For 10 years, we've had record budget deficits and record trade deficits. We've lost a lot of American jobs. We've got to bring the deficits down and the jobs home.
 
Differing on Taxes
The President's way to do that is to give huge tax cuts to those with incomes over $200,000 a year.
We disagree. It's working men and woman, the middle class, whose taxes should be cut. They're already bearing most of the tax burden. They're also bearing the burden of war.
Not many kids whose families earn more than $200,000 a year volunteer to join the Army. It's mostly the children of working people, the middle class and the poor who'll do the fighting and the dying. Their families shouldn't have to bear all the burdens. What they need, what all Americans need most of all is opportunity, the chance to succeed through hard work.
Before I entered the Senate, I served as a Federal judge. It's a position of great power. But what I enjoyed most was presiding at citizenship ceremonies. People who'd come from all over the world gathered before me in a Federal courtroom. There, in the final act, I administered to them the oath of allegiance to the United States, and they became Americans.
After every ceremony I spoke personally with each new American. I asked them how and why they came. Their stories were inspiring, their devotion to America moving. Their answers were different but through them ran a common theme, best expressed by a young man who said, in halting English, "I came because here in America everyone has a chance." He summed up America in one sentence: Here everyone has a chance.
I know that's true. I know that in America you can go as high and as far as your talent and your willingness to work will take you. That means there must be a quality education for every American child. There must be jobs, fairness in the workplace, with no discrimination, with equal rights and economic independence for women. No guarantees for anyone, but an equal chance to succeed for everyone.
 
Taking Stock, in Freedom
So tonight, as we take stock of our country, we acknowledge our good fortune to be Americans, citizens of the most free, the most open, the most just society in human history, even as we recognize that there remain wrongs to be righted.
But most of all, we think of our grave responsibility:
To half a million of our fellow citizens who bear the burden of battle. To support them now, and to respect them when they return.
I think tonight about a young airman from Winslow, Me. I met him in December in Saudi Arabia. He has four children, including 1-year-old twins. He hadn't seen them for months and didn't know when he would. But he didn't complain. He was quiet, but it was the quiet strength of someone committed to his country and his duty.
Our duty now is to support the men and women serving in the Persian Gulf, to work and pray for their swift and safe return home, and to build an America worthy of them and their children. May God bless and watch over each of them. Thank you and good night.

HEADLINE: MOSCOW ASSURES BUSH ON BALTICS

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
The United States and the Soviet Union ended three days of talks here today with Moscow promising to withdraw some troops from the troubled Baltic region and Washington renewing its offer to stop the war against Iraq if Baghdad pulls its army out of Kuwait.
Neither statement seemed to constitute a significant change in the public policies of either country. But they allowed both superpowers to come away from the talks, the main purpose of which was to delay the next Soviet-American summit meeting, able to point to language that appeared responsive to issues that were at the top of their agendas. 
 The Bush Administration was able to cite Soviet assurances that it will seek to lessen tensions in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia as a sign that Moscow was responding to American concerns about the military crackdown in the Baltic republics, and as justification for Mr. Bush's decision not to cite the situation there as a reason for delaying the summit meeting.
For the Soviet Union, the Administration's offer to stop fighting if Iraq promises to withdraw, and then immediately follow up with concrete steps to do that, could help mitigate Soviet concerns that the United States is exceeding the United Nations resolutions on Kuwait by trying to destroy Iraq's offensive military potential.
 
A Way Out for Iraqis
 In the days just before the war began, President Bush and his aides said that combat could be prevented if Iraq agreed to withdraw from Kuwait and immediately began to do so. Administration officials said tonight's statement was not a change in the American position and did not mean the United States was prepared to have a pause in the war to give Baghdad a chance to rethink its position.
Administration officials said there was no indication that the Soviet concerns reflected any discussion between Moscow and Baghdad, or indicated a new Soviet approach to resolving the conflict in the gulf.
The superpowers addressed the Persian Gulf in a joint statement issued by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Foreign Minister Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh tonight after talks at the State Department. Mr. Baker and Mr. Bessmertnykh also met on Saturday, and the Soviet Foreign Minister talked with President Bush at the White House on Monday.
In the statement, the two ministers said they "believe that a cessation of hostilities would be possible if Iraq would make an unequivocal commitment to withdraw from Kuwait. They also believe that such a commitment must be backed by immediate, concrete steps leading to full compliance with the Security Council resolutions."
 
U.S. Insists on Full Withdrawal
 A senior Administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity insisted that this did not conflict with assertions by Mr. Bush and other top officials that there would be "no pause" for negotiations with Iraq. The official said the United States would insist on a "total withdrawal" from Kuwait.
On the situation in the Baltic republics, senior Administration officials gave conflicting accounts of how specific Mr. Bessmertnykh was in offering assurances that Moscow would try to reduce tensions in the region.
In his State of the Union Address tonight, Mr. Bush spoke of "representations" from the Soviet leadership, which, "if fulfilled, would result in the withdrawal of some Soviet forces, a reopening of dialogue with the republics and a move away from violence."
An Administration official said that amounted to a promise to withdraw "all of the forces that were not garrisoned in the Baltics before the current crisis began."
Before Mr. Bush's speech, a senior official told reporters that during Monday's meeting at the White House, Mr. Bessmertnykh essentially reiterated general Soviet assertions that the Moscow Government is "trying to do what they can to diminish the tensions and to solve it through peaceful means."
The official said Washington was still waiting for a concrete sign that this would actually occur and added that Mr. Bessmertnykh offered no promises of specific action.
Later, however, another senior official briefed reporters before Mr. Bush's address and suggested that Mr. Bessmertnykh had been more concrete. "They said they will pull some forces out," the official said. "They will renew the dialogue and move away from violence."
These differences appeared to reflect the Administration's own internal grappling with Soviet policy at a time when the White House is under increasing pressure to take some action that would clearly register disapproval of the crackdown in the Baltic republics.
Today, the White House went out of its way to assert publicly and privately that the crackdown had nothing to do with Mr. Bush's decision to postpone the Moscow summit meeting that had been scheduled for February.
 
Factors in Summit Delay
 Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said today that the Persian Gulf war and slow movement on arms control were the only reasons for the delay. "If the war was not going on, we'd go," Mr. Fitzwater said.
Before the summit delay was announced, however, senior Administration officials had said the Baltic situation was a critical factor in the decision about whether to put off the meeting with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
The public effort to smooth over the differences about the Baltics reflects the Administration's desire to work as much as possible with Mr. Gorbachev.
As long as Mr. Gorbachev continues to be cooperative in the Persian Gulf, in Eastern Europe and other areas, it is of value to maintain the relationship between the Soviet President and Mr. Bush, the official said.
 
U.S. Leverage on Moscow
 The United States has concluded, the official said, that with forward movement slowed on arms control, economic relations and other matters, its leverage over Moscow is largely based on two things: The continued dialogue between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev and a belief here that the current Soviet leadership still seems to care about its international reputation.
"The part that seems to be holding together reasonably well is our ability to deal with the Soviet Union on a state-to-state basis on some issues of interest to us," the official said. "It may eventually get to the place where the internal chaos in the Soviet Union makes it impossible for us to deal with them on a state-to-state basis and get things done, but in the current environment we're not there just yet."
 
Mild Relief in Moscow

MOSCOW, Jan. 29 (Special to The New York Times) -- The initial Soviet reaction to the postponement of the summit was one of mild relief that the havoc in the Baltic republics did not emerge as one of the stated reasons.
While the developments in Latvia and Lithuania were said to have been discussed at length in Mr. Bessmertnykh's meetings with President Bush and Mr. Baker, the fact that the Americans chose not to cite them publicly seemed to reassure the Soviets that the United States did not intend to abandon the efforts of recent years.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION: The Capitol Scene;
A Reassuring Ritual Counters the Tension of War

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
There was little doubt at the Capitol tonight that the state of the union was one of war. The security measures were extraordinary, the mood of the lawmakers subdued. President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d had lines of weariness around their eyes.
But there was a reassuring stability as the ritual of the State of the Union Message played out, as members of the Senate filed into the House chamber, followed by the diplomatic corps, the Justices of the Supreme Court and members of the Cabinet. 
 Barbara Bush entered the gallery unheralded, but lawmakers lept to their feet as soon as they saw her. She was flanked by Alma Powell, wife of Colin L. Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Brenda Schwarzkopf, wife of General H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of allied forces in the Persian Gulf.
Finally, Speaker Thomas S. Foley announced "the high privilege and distinct honor" of introducing the President.
The lawmakers responded to much of the President's speech with the unity of wartime; when he paid tribute to the troops in the gulf, the applause went on and on. But Democrats responded differently to his domestic proposals.
During the speech, the Democratic side of the aisle was notably subdued as Mr. Bush recounted his domestic record, particularly his recommitment to a cut in the tax on capital gains. In general, Democrats asserted that the President's speech paid too little attention to the problems at home.
"It was more a state of the Persian Gulf than a state of the union," said Representative Joe Moakley, Democrat of Massachusetts.
Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, Democrat of West Virginia, said: "On the domestic front, I had the sense he was throwing a barrage of words at us. He mentioned all the right words -- children, education -- but they didn't seem to hang together."
 
Intense Security
The security measures at the Capitol today did not compare to 1861, of course, when the Capitol was very much at risk and troops were drilling outside. But security was intense.
"We have 1,265 officers in our department, and it's safe to say that everyone is deployed for this," said a spokesman for the Capitol Police.
Those officers would close the Capitol grounds at 5 P.M. They would close all the streets in a four-block radius at 7 P.M., two hours before the address. Lawmakers were urged to use the Capitol's underground tunnels to get around. New security measures were imposed at the doors, including the use of machines intended to detect explosives. When a visitor's digital watch started to beep, a doorkeeper in the House looked up nervously, realized what it was, then advised, "I'd leave that at home tonight if I were you."
When the House recessed this afternoon, one Congressman said, "I would like to go home until the speech, but I guess I'd never get back in."
The Capitol Police declined to discuss the subject of threats, but the measures themselves seemed to raise Capitol Hill's anxiety level, which was already high in these days of war.
 
Hopes Overshadowed
Since the waning days of the Reagan era, Democrats have talked about the rise of a new domestic agenda. After a decade of neglecting issues like education and the environment, these Democrats argued, the nation would be ready to move on them. The seeming end of the cold war and the buoyant talk of a "peace dividend" fed the Democrats' hope.
All that has been overshadowed by the war in the gulf, and the President's State of the Union Message only underscored that. "When you're talking about 500,000 people and the entire war-making capacity of the country being mobilized, there's not much else you can focus on," said Representive Vic Fazio of California, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
Increasingly, Democrats are making their case for domestic programs by talking about the troops and what will await them when they return.
"We don't want the war to cripple the economic capacity of the country to come out of this recession or to become a powerful engine of growth and performance in the decade ahead," Mr. Foley said earlier today.
And in his response to the President's speech, George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate majority leader, said: "If we can make the best smart bomb, can't we make the best VCR? If we can build a high-speed Patriot missile, can't we build a high-speed train? I believe we can. Our first priority must be economic growth."
 
The Ritual
The Constitution provides that the President "shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union, and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient."
George Washington and John Adams both delivered State of the Union speeches to Congress, but Thomas Jefferson chose to make a written report, Richard Baker, the Senate historian, said. It was Woodrow Wilson who reinstituted the practice of the State of the Union speech, Mr. Baker said.
Over the years, the ritual has grown increasingly elaborate. For example, Democrats assert that in the years when Ronald Reagan delivered his address, Republican lawmakers were prepped for spontaneous demonstrations at the President's applause lines. Democrats countered by trying to beat them to the punch, for example leaping to applaud when the President denounced the burgeoning deficit, thereby demonstrating superior commitment to the cause.
It is generally understood that one should applaud. One aide to the Democratic leadership described the plight of frustrated liberals like this: "You can't applaud. You can't be seen not applauding. Why show?"

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION: The President;
President, in State of Union Talk, Dwells on War and the Economy

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
In a State of the Union Message to a nation burdened with war and recession, President Bush promised tonight that the "indomitable" American character would overcome Saddam Hussein abroad and economic troubles at home.
"If we can selflessly confront the evil for the sake of good in a land so far away, then surely we can make this land all that it should be," the President told a joint session of Congress. "If anyone tells you America's best days are behind her, they're looking the wrong way." [Transcript of the address, page A12.] 
 In a speech intended less to offer a new domestic agenda than to explain the war with Iraq and give courage to Americans fearful of a long and bloody conflict, the President harked back to images of the years leading up to World War II.
"Together, we have resisted the trap of appeasement, cynicism and isolation that gives temptation to tyrants," he said.
 
Relations With Moscow
 The President spoke in measured, sober tones, a contrast to his first State of the Union Message, in which Mr. Bush spoke triumphantly of "Communism crumbling" and of a new relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union.
Today he spoke of challenges in the new superpower understanding in light of the Soviet crackdown in the Baltic republics and war in the gulf. The President's speech followed three days of talks between the United States and the Soviet Union, in which each side offered signs of flexibility on those issues. [Page A3.]
Mr. Bush offered economic reassurance in his speech by referring to the recession as a temporary interruption of economic growth. Among the few domestic initiatives were a proposal to eliminate the political action committees that provide a large measure of the money for election campaigns, a promise to offer legislation that would reform the nation's banking system, and a renewal of efforts to reduce the tax rate on profits from investments.
For Mr. Bush, who generally shuns the formality of prime-time televised appearances, the nationally broadcast speech had political significance beyond the annual ritual of giving a report on the condition of the nation. He became the first President since the Vietnam War to deliver the State of the Union Message while the country was at war.
 
Measuring the Worth of the War
 The President's 50-minute talk was interrupted more than 40 times by applause. He drew standing ovations when he praised the American forces in the Persian Gulf and when he introduced the wives of General Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of gulf forces.
"Each of us will measure, within ourselves, the value of this great struggle," Mr. Bush said of the gulf war. "Any cost in lives -- any cost -- is beyond our power to measure. But the cost of closing our eyes to aggression is beyond mankind's power to imagine."
For Americans who worry that the United States is shouldering too much of the burden of expelling Iraq from Kuwait, Mr. Bush said that "as Americans, we know there are times when we must step forward, and accept our responsibility to lead the world away from the dark chaos of dictators."
"This we do know," he concluded, to applause from both the Republican and Democratic sides of the aisle. "Our cause is just. Our cause is moral. Our cause is right."
In the Democratic response that followed Mr. Bush's speech, Senator George J. Mitchell, the Majority Leader, struck right at what the Democrats consider the great vulnerability of the President, that he is too consumed by the Persian Gulf to pay attention to "the crisis" on the domestic front.
 
Trying to Quell Recession Fears
 In the face of criticism that the costly war is taking resources away from domestic matters, President Bush tried to outline domestic programs that would provide a "forward-looking plan of action" and sought to quell fears about a prolonged recession.
Speaking of the recession, Mr. Bush said that "the largest peacetime economic expansion in history has been temporarily interrupted." But he vowed that "we will get this recession behind us and return to growth -- soon."
Mr. Bush, whose criticisms of the Federal Reserve have so far been mild compared to those of previous Presidents, engaged in some arm twisting on interest rates. "Sound banks should be making more sound loans, now, and interest rates should be lower, now," he said. In the Administration's view the central bank has been slow to lower rates.
Mr. Bush tried to mitigate the political impact of the capital gains tax-cut issue, which sharply divided Democrats and Republicans last year. He called for the formation of a commission headed by the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, that would resolve differences over the economic impact of such a tax cut. Mr. Greenspan, who as a private economist was chairman of the Presidential commission in the early 1980's that established the current payroll tax structure for Social Security, has said he would like to see a lower capital gains tax rate.
Mr. Bush also revived other tax proposals that died in 1990, including tax-free family savings accounts and penalty-free withdrawals from retirement accounts for first-time home buyers. Echoing a favorite theme of the Reagan Administration, Mr. Bush proposed the establishment of $15 billion in block grants to states that the individual governments could then use as they think best.
 
Deliberate Domestic Ambiguity
 Administration officials said the speech was made deliberately ambiguous on domestic policy in an effort to continue to put off debates between the White House and the Democrats in Congress, and within the Republican Party, and to straddle differences on the nation's direction.
The speech also reflected the victory of Richard G. Darman, the White House budget director, in a power struggle with junior White House staff members who wanted the President to reach out in a more dramatic way to offer the nation's poor ways to help themselves.
The speech contained a few vague references to what the junior staff members call "empowerment" programs, but Mr. Bush did not use that word, which is currently fashionable among some young conservatives. He called for "a plan of action right here at home to put more power and opportunity in the hands of the individual," but the President offered only general descriptions of programs that would offer incentives to create jobs and help tenants buy public housing.
 
Weapons Highlighted
 In the sections of his speech referring to the war, Mr. Bush highlighted the performance of the high-tech weapons tonight as a way of rallying Americans to the cause. White House officials, obsessively watching the course of the war, have tried to present all developments in the best possible light.
Noting the success of the Patriot missile in shooting down Iraqi Scud missiles, President Bush proposed a major shift in emphasis of the Strategic Defense Initiative program, the space-oriented missile defense known as Star Wars. He said that it should be designed not only to protect against intercontinental ballistic missiles but also to shoot down shorter-range missiles like the Iraqi Scuds.
"Looking forward, I have directed that the S.D.I. program be refocused on providing protection from limited ballistic missile strikes, whatever their source," Mr. Bush said. "Let us pursue an S.D.I. program that can deal with any future threat to the United States, to our forces overseas, and to our friends and allies."
With the Kremlin's crackdown on the independence movements in the Baltic republics shaded Mr. Bush offered a marked change from last year's upbeat assessment of the United States relationship with the Soviet Union.
The President, who has been criticized for not speaking out more strongly on the Baltic issue for fear of upsetting the Soviet arm of the international alliance against Iraq, made it clear that he did not intend to forsake the personal relationship with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, which Mr. Bush values so highly and which is critical to his concept of the "new world order."
"The principle that has guided us is simple," Mr. Bush said. "Our objective is to help the Baltic peoples achieve their aspirations, not to punish the Soviet Union.
"In our recent discussions with the Soviet leadership," he added, "we have been given representations, which, if fulfilled, would result in the withdrawal of some Soviet forces, a re-opening of dialogue with the Republics, and a move away from violence."
In the Democratic response, Senator Mitchell offered support for the President's Persian Gulf policies but added: "As critical as the Gulf conflict is, the other business of the nation won't wait. The President says he seeks a new world order. We ask him to join us in putting our own house in order. We have a crisis abroad but we also have a crisis here at home."

BYLINE: By Florence Fabricant

French Class
At budget-cutting time it's hard to imagine that there is money for New York City high schools to inaugurate a program in French cooking. But Richard Grausman, a cookbook author and teacher of French cooking, has worked with the home-economics departments of 12 high schools to set up such a program at no cost to the city. 
 Last year he approached school administrators with the idea of setting up a semester-long course using his book "At Home With the French Classics" ( Workman Publishing , 1989), as a teaching manual. The plan was approved by the Board of Education in May; since then, he has been working to obtain donations of equipment and food.
More than 20 companies are underwriting the program, which is estimated to cost them more than $175,000. Workman is contributing 240 books and an anonymous donor has given $10,000 to cover the cost of ingredients that have not already been contributed.
The first of the once-a-week classes will be held Feb. 4 at Julia Richman and Lower East Side Prep in Manhattan; Adlai Stevenson and William Howard Taft in the Bronx; Franklin Lane, Thomas Jefferson, Prospect Heights, Erasmus Hall and John Dewey in Brooklyn; Benjamin Cardozo and Grover Cleveland in Queens, and Port Richmond on Staten Island. About 300 students are expected to take part. Their teachers have taken an all-day training session conducted by Mr. Grausman, who will also visit classrooms and meet the students.
 
Coffee and Cake
Oren's Daily Roast, a shop that specializes in coffees, teas and brewing equipment, has opened a third location, 1144 Lexington Avenue (79th Street). The other stores are at 1574 First Avenue (81st Street) and 434 Third Avenue (30th Street).
More than 50 kinds of coffee, including an excellent house blend that is one-third each French Roast, Colombian Supremo and Sumatra, are carried in the shop. Prices range from $6.49 a pound for Colombian to $28.99 for decaffeinated Jamaica Blue Mountain. The shop carries both Swiss water process decaffeinated coffees and coffees decaffeinated by the water and methylene chloride method.
All three shops are also selling elegant, delicious pastries delivered daily from La Bonne Patisserie, 405 East Madison Avenue, Dumont, N.J. The pastries range in price from $3 to $4.25 for individual eclairs and tartlets, to $13 to $19 for large fruit tarts and fancy cakes. Croissants, muffins and apple turnovers are $1.25 to $1.75. Oren's Daily Roast stores are open seven days a week, and will ship coffee and tea by mail. The phone number for the new store is (212) 472-6830.
 
Americans in Paris
The wheels have started turning to organize a chapter of the American Institute of Wine and Food in Paris. Julia Child, one of the founders of the group, is doing the driving by overseeing its development.
The aim of a Paris chapter would be to exchange ideas about food and wine between the United States and France and to serve as a resource for American companies, journalists and other food and wine professionals living in or visiting France, said George Usher, director of the Ritz-Escoffier Cooking School. He is on the organizing committee, as are Patricia Wells, restaurant critic for L'Express; Henry Pillsbury, executive director of the American Center in Paris; Lee Cockrell, director of food and beverage for Euro-Disneyland, and several cookbook authors based in Paris. The organizers hope to hold their first event in the spring, though they have not yet determined what it will be.
Chocolate Competition
Last week the American pastry team placed fifth in the 1991 Valrhona Pastry World Cup competition held in Lyons, France. Eighteen countries took part. First place was won by Japan. Belgium came in second, France placed third and Canada fourth.
On the American team, led by Jilles Renusson of the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel in Grand Rapids, Mich., were Mary Cech of the Cypress Club in San Francisco and Eric Bedoucha of the Peninsula Hotel in Manhattan. The teams had nine hours in which to prepare a chocolate dessert, six kinds of chocolate candies, six kinds of petits fours and a chocolate ice cream dessert that included an ice sculpture as part of its presentation.
George Bumbaris of the United States was not one of the three winners in the biannual Bocuse d'Or contest also held last week in Lyons. Representatives of 22 countries took part and the winner was Michel Roth of France. Second place went to Lars Erik Underthum of Norway; Gert Jan Raven of the Netherlands came in third.
 
Appenzeller Light
The Marketplace in Macy's Herald Square has started carrying a reduced-fat Swiss Appenzeller for $8.95 a pound. The cheese lacks the complexity of a regular Appenzeller but is still properly tangy. Macy's also has an extra-aged Appenzeller that has a mouth-filling richness and pungency. It's $10.95 a pound.
 
ARTISTIC RENDERINGS
THE Illustration Gallery, 330 East 11th Street, which represents cartoonists and other artists, has just published a cookbook that stretches the meaning of the word "recipe." Forty illustrators, including Charles Barsotti, Victoria Roberts and George Booth, have each contributed a black-and-white page that has something to do with food.
The recipes, the edibility of which the book disavows, range from the legitimate (like those for angel food cake and pumpkin pie) to the comical. For example, there is Roz Chast's jerk chicken: "Invite 10 friends over for dinner and forget to defrost the chicken.
The spiral-bound book is $20 at the gallery, $25 by mail. Telephone: (212) 979-1014.

HEADLINE: Ground Assault Now Carries Too High a Price

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Every commentator I've heard discuss the question seems to assume that our next inevitable step in the Persian Gulf, within a matter of days or, at most, weeks, is a massive frontal ground assault on the half million or so Iraqi troops in Kuwait. 
 We should be giving that assumption the same kind of intense and conscientious consideration that Congress gave the question of whether or not to authorize the President to undertake military action.
The propriety of a public debate on what might appear to be a question only of military strategy, now that war has in effect been declared, will seem to many to be somewhat dubious. There is no question of the President's authority, as Commander in Chief, to decide how best to fight the war that Congress authorized. What we have every obligation in a democracy to question, however, is his judgment of our purposes in having gone to war, and in devising means proportioned to those ends, when the means at issue risk thousands upon thousands of American lives.
The President proclaims that the central purpose of the war is to get the Iraqis out of Kuwait, and one can hardly disagree with that formulation as such. Moreover, if the events of the last week have disappointed the expectation expressed by the Congressional majority that authorization of military action alone would suffice to induce Saddam Hussein to withdraw without the need for war, they have probably demonstrated equally the unlikelihood of sanctions alone achieving that result.
But while that was our proximate goal in going to war, it was not, I suggest, our fundamental purpose: the strongest argument of the supporters of military action was that only in this way could we eliminate the threat of future Iraqi aggression, with or without recourse to chemical and nuclear weapons. And that goal the air assaults alone, in conjunction with the continuing embargo, may well be on the way to achieving.
The question, then, is whether an early massive ground assault is worth the price it will inescapably exact as the most direct and sure way of liberating Kuwait from Iraqi occupation. I believe it is not -- at least not until we have given the sanctions, powerfully reinforced now by continuing aerial bombardment, ample chance to induce Iraq's surrender.
As Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan pointed out during the Congressional debates, it is an absurd proposition that we should, literally, be willing to pay "any price" to get the Iraqis out of Kuwait. Apparently no one denies that a direct ground assault at this time would be very costly. In the circumstances, this is surely the time for patience and steadfastness in pursuing our present course.
No one can argue, so long as we determinedly continue striking, through the air and the embargo, at the roots of the Iraqi threat, that time is on their side; let us give Saddam Hussein's military forces lodged in Kuwait every opportunity to rot on the vine.

HEADLINE: Ground Assault Now Carries Too High a Price;
Grave Japanese Doubts

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Japanese society is intensely divided over the war in the Persian Gulf. The majority of the Japanese, according to various opinion polls in January, think it is unnecessary to shed American soldiers' precious blood to punish Iraq. They believe there is a better way to teach a lesson -- a painful, long-term lesson -- to the Iraqi people without engaging in high-risk, low-return military strategy. 
 Keeping severe economic sanctions, boycotting Iraqi oil for a long time, say, the next 50 years, will deprive Iraq of almost all its export income and drive its economy back to a primitive, impoverished agricultural one. The majority of the Japanese prefer this type of harsh but nonviolent punishment to a violent one.
While the ruling Liberal Democratic Party officially supports the war, there are some L.D.P. politicians who think that President Bush has taken more than necessary risks by plunging into war. For example, last December one knowledgeable L.D.P. parliamentarian told me: "I don't understand it. Why does George Bush want to take such a big risk in this inherently unstable, irrational place? Does he really believe that America's waging a bloody war will bring lasting stability in this region? Will the so-called 'new world order,' whatever that is, suddenly materialize when he kicks Saddam . . . and slaughters hundreds of thousands of Iraqi men, women and children? I don't see the situation in that way. I don't think it is in America's national interests to kill a lot of Arabs in this region."
Actually, these misgivings were (and are) widely shared by many Middle East analysts at the State Department, the Central Intelligence Agency and in Congress. They thought that the Game of Chicken a la Bush did not fully consider its long-term implications and consequences for the United States. Since the beginning of the war, some of these analysts have been quite depressed.
Even though many Japanese do not approve of this war, Japan now has no choice but to support the United States. After all, the brave American men and women who are doing a remarkable job in the Persian Gulf deserve full support from all of America's allies. This is not a time to criticize the less-than-cautious Bush brinkmanship but to make every effort to finish the war as quickly as possible with as few American casualties as possible. Japan therefore has increased its financial contribution to the war from $4 billion to $13 billion, and has decided to dispatch its civilian and military transport airplanes to the gulf area. The Japanese hope that Americans will not perceive Japan as getting a "free ride" in this conflict.
The gulf conflict has exposed Japan's inability to respond to a geopolitical emergency. It is time for the Japanese to seriously reconsider their defense policy, including the necessary amendment of the America-imposed Japanese Constitution. Japan, as a sovereign nation, should be able to exercise its military power when it and its ally -- the United States -- think such an action is necessary.

HEADLINE: Hollywood May Lose Old Hangout of the Stars

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif., Jan. 29

 BODY:
The old Brown Derby restaurant is gone, and so is Schwab's Drug Store, Pickfair and the Pan Pacific Auditorium. And now the Formosa Cafe, once the hangout of Lauren Bacall, Humphrey Bogart, Douglas Fairbanks and Marilyn Monroe, is on the verge of being torn down for a five-story parking garage.
 In a place where history is short and roots shallow, the Formosa, which dates back to a time when films were still silent and the air clean, represents what passes here for tradition.
 
 And the heated question in Hollywood now is: Should they make a historic landmark out of the dark Cantonese cave where Lana Turner once danced in the aisles, where Elvis Presley came to drink beer late at night, where a drunken Lee Marvin was thrown out and a sotted Rudy Vallee was once driven home by the staff, where the waitresses still remember Clark Gable as a lousy tipper, where the costumed casts of the "Beverly Hillbillies" and "Dynasty" lunched on sub gum pork and chow har ding? Is that the stuff of history?
 "L.A. is so ephemeral -- there are not many places like this that gather that kind of ambiance and history," said Teresa Grimes, preservation officer with the Los Angeles Conservancy, a private preservation group. "Nothing is really sacred. Nothing is here for a long time. We should be protecting not only our architectural resources but our cultural resources."
 
Studio Needs Parking Space
 But to Warner Brothers, which owns the hallowed land under the Formosa, the restaurant represents nothing more than an ideal place to expand parking for the Warner Hollywood Studios across the street, where three new stages and a new movie post-production center are planned. "I believe the lease is up and the studio has a real space problem," said Rob Friedman, a spokesman for Warners. "We gave them a lot of notice."
 And so the Formosa will shut at the end of February unless a determined band of supporters can win a delay. A group led by Rocky Schenck, a photographer and video producer, is preparing to petition the City of West Hollywood to have the restaurant declared a historic landmark, although that would require the studio to preserve only the building, not the business inside. "There's truly no place in Hollywood like it," said Mr. Schenck. "It's got a heart."
 The Formosa is a small concrete box with a neon sign on Santa Monica Boulevard. Inside, one can find the authentic old Hollywood, a place where actors mingle easily with lighting technicians, stage hands, writers and cameramen, without tourists or high-powered producers talking mega-deals. The walls and rafters fairly drip with history: signed photographs of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, Eve and Van Johnson, Jane Wyman, Edward G. Robinson, Jayne Mansfield, Jack Klugman, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.
 Special guests are seated in the Marilyn Monroe booth, a round banquette of peeling red leatherette that faces a wall full of the star's pictures; above is a glass case full of porcelain Elvis Presley statues. About half the tables are in what was once a trolley car. Nearby, at a booth near the cashier, sits Lem Quon, the genial 81-year-old native of Canton who came to the restaurant as a cook and has owned the place since 1945; his stepson, William Jung, has been a partner for 32 years. Behind the bar is Lindy Brewerton, serving drinks since 1942.
 
A Younger Crowd
 It is a sign of changing times in Hollywood that one encounters fewer movie stars at the Formosa today than rock stars, like the Irish band U-2. The crowd has turned young and hip. But one thing that has changed little is the staff.
Pat Edie, who has waited Formosa tables for 40 years, recalls Clark Gable giving her $25 to pay a $22 bill. "I put it in my pocket and said, 'Thank you very much,' " she said. "A little while later, I came back by the table and he was standing there waiting for me and said, 'You didn't give me my change back.' I couldn't believe it."
 Another waitress, Mary Kay Moore, a veteran of 41 years at the Formosa, boasts of all the stars she's stepped on. "I've stepped on all the most famous long legs in the world," she says. "I've stepped on people like Gary Cooper, Jimmy Stewart and Buddy Ebsen, because they would lean back and stretch their legs out. We've had lots of lovely, long-legged gentlemen in here and I managed to step on all of them." She recalls serving Marlene Dietrich, Tyrone Power and Charles Laughton in 1957 when they were filming "Witness for the Prosecution" at the studio across the street.
 Among the stars who are still regulars are Johnny Depp, who plays the title role in "Edward Scissorhands," and Christopher Lloyd, who played Dr. Emmett Brown in the "Back to the Future" movies and who lives just a few blocks away. "It's very much like a family place," Mr. Lloyd said. "It's not a pickup bar, but a social place. I don't know anyplace else where you can go in the neighborhood."
 
The Worse the Better
 The Formosa also appeals to John Waters, the Baltimore film maker, who stops in occasionally when in town. "I always thought this is exactly what Hollywood should look like," said Mr. Waters, whose movies include "Hairspray" and "Pink Flamingos." "I'll miss it even if I never go to it again. The worse it gets, the more I like it."
The studio was the original Samuel Goldwyn Studios, and changed hands several times over the years until Warner bought it in 1980. The forthcoming movie "Oscar," starring Sylvester Stallone and John Landis, was filmed there.
 Under the laws of West Hollywood, a small city adjacent to Los Angeles that was incorporated only six years ago, the restaurant cannot be torn down until the studio gets a permit to begin construction on its expansion; the process could take about a year and a half. But Warner could evict the Formosa in the meantime and leave it vacant.
 Formosa backers are hoping that the studio can be persuaded or shamed into sparing the restaurant and building the parking garage around it in exchange for concessions from the city to allow greater density for its expansion. They also point to city zoning rules that require restaurants and shops on the street level of new commercial developments. But officials of the city, eager to enlarge the tax base, point out that the law gives movie studios certain exemptions from these requirements.
 
Milestone or Millstone?
 In the meantime, Mr. Schenck and friends are pushing for landmark status, which Los Angeles conferred on the Original Pantry Cafe and Cole's P E Buffet downtown. But can a watering hole really be considered a historic landmark?
 Possibly, under West Hollywood's ordinance, which cites structures that are "identified with persons or events significant in local, state, natural history" or that reflect "special elements of the city's cultural, social, economic, political, esthetic, engineering, architectural or natural history" and that also possess "an integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling and association."
 Whatever the outcome, Mr. Brewerton, the bartender, has had it. He plans to retire and finish his memoirs, to be titled, "Forty Years Behind Bars." The Formosa, he complained, had been turned over to "kids and foreigners."
 "They run off all the old customers," he said. "It used to be a good place. But when it goes, I'm going with it."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 1, 1991, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about the Formosa Cafe in West Hollywood, Calif., incorrectly summarized the ownership history of Warner Hollywood Studios, which is seeking to have the restaurant demolished. The studio was built in 1919 as the Jesse D. Hampton Studios. It was taken over by United Artists in 1928 and acquired by the Samuel Goldwyn Studios in 1938. Warner bought it in 1980.

HEADLINE: Eating Well

BYLINE: By Marian Burros

 BODY:
SINCE 1977 one branch or other of the Federal Government has been telling everyone in the country to eat less fat, cholesterol and salt. Everyone, that is, except the children who participate in the federally financed school-lunch program.
 The United States Dietary Guidelines, published by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services, do not apply to school lunches, which come under the jurisdiction of the U.S.D.A. As a result, many of the meals served to schoolchildren are high in fat, cholesterol and sodium. 
Although there have been no national studies measuring the average amount of fat in school lunches, it is not unusual to find meals in which as much as 42 percent of the calories come from fat, according to calculations by the Center for Science in the Public Interest and the Marriott Corporation. The commonly accepted maximum is 30 percent.
 The meals, often that greasy kid stuff like high-fat hamburgers, french fries and hot dogs, are high in sodium as well, as much as 1,800 milligrams, which is the maximum amount recommended by the National Academy of Sciences for an entire day.
 Politics, inertia and ignorance are among the reasons many school lunches are such nutritional laggards. And the Agriculture Department has contended over the years that the dietary guidelines simply were not specific enough.
 But the latest version of the guidelines, published last fall, provides numbers that are difficult to ignore: people should get no more than 30 percent of their calories from fat, with less than 10 percent from saturated fat. The recommendations apply to everyone over the age of 2.
To motivate the Agriculture Department, the Citizens' Commission on School Nutrition recently published a "White Paper on School-Lunch Nutrition."
 The commission recommended, among other things, that the percentage of fat in school lunches be reduced to 35 percent of all calories over the next four years, and to 30 percent by 2000.
 The commission, brought together by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington advocacy group, included cardiologists, pediatricians, educators, nutritionists and school-food workers.
 The U.S.D.A. said it was willing to go along with most of the recommendations. "We don't want to turn the world upside down all at one time," said Ann Chadwick, the department's adviser for food and consumer services. "Changes have to be gradual."
 This is not the first attempt to improve the nutritional quality of school lunches. Officials of many school districts around the country, aware of the relationship between diet and health, have made their own changes. The U.S.D.A. itself tried, too.
 "We started out trying to do this in 1978," said Carol Foreman, former Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for food and consumer services.
 "And then it got to be controversial because the food producers -- the egg, milk and meat folks -- thought it was an attack on their products," she said.
 In nutrition circles the Reagan Administration is best remembered for trying to cut costs by having ketchup counted as a vegetable in school lunches.In 1981 the budget for the Government's Child Nutrition Program, including the National School Lunch Program, was cut by a third.
 "For 10 years that began with Reagan's inauguration the school-lunch program didn't go forward and it didn't even stand still," said Ms. Foreman, now a public-policy consultant in Washington. "It went backward and it is just regaining momentum now."
 Vivian Pilant, chairwoman of the American School Food Service Association's public policy and legislative committee, agreed. "My main concern is that the U.S.D.A. has not had funds," she said. "The Reagan Administration cut so much money."
 But the Federal bureaucracy has not been the only barrier to more nutritious school lunches:
 * Government commodities like ground beef and butter, many of which are high in fat, cost the schools less than what they would pay on the open market for more healthful foods. Most school systems do not have enough money to refuse the lower-cost items.
 * Untrained food-service workers do not know what constitutes a healthful meal or, for that matter, how to make food appetizing enough that children will eat it.
 * Junk food is easily available from vending machines in schools.
 * Some schools allow older children to buy lunch away from school.
 The biggest roadblocks to better nutrition may be the children themselves. "Because of television advertising, kids expect to eat a diet of foods that are fun," said Marion Nestle, a commission member and chairman of the department of nutrition at New York University.
 Victoria Leonard, director of the Children's Nutrition Project for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said: "Kids and industry are an unholy alliance. Kids are choosing to eat junk."
 And Ms. Chadwick of the U.S.D.A. said: "The biggest problem is keeping kids in the program. If schools don't give children what they want to eat, they buy it elsewhere."
 Ms. Foreman, however, is not buying the blame-the-victim excuse. Much of the food served in school lunches is, to put it politely, tasteless.
 "Some of the stuff in school lunches does not have to be radically different from fast food," Ms. Foreman said. "Minor changes can be made to reduce the fat and cholesterol and salt so that the food still looks the same and costs the same. But you have to be creative enough to do it."
 There are schools that are trying. Joy Miltenberger, director of food service for the Palm Beach (Fla.) School District, brought about one of the success stories. When the Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health was issued in 1988, Ms. Miltenberger decided that the 130 schools in her district ought to follow the recommendations.
 Salt has been reduced by half; dishes are made of half ground beef and half ground turkey; hot dogs, fried chicken nuggets and cold cuts like bologna and salami have been eliminated. French fries are served only two days a week.
 In 1989, California became the first state to limit the amount of fat and cholesterol in the school-lunch program. In Massachusetts, those who sell food to the schools are required to provide information on the levels of fat and calories per serving.
 In the Huntington and Harborfield Long Island School District, the menus arelower in fat, cholesterol and sodium two days a week. Tacos are made with turkey instead of beef, corn bread is made with egg whites rather than whole eggs, and skim milk has replaced whole milk.
 Praiseworthy as all of this sounds, there may be a downside to lowering the fat in school lunches. Lunch is supposed to provide a third of a child's daily nutritional and caloric needs. But for poor children, it may be the only square meal they get all day.
 Even though the commission's report called for the elimination of whole milk in school lunches, some health advocates believe it should remain as an alternative so that these children get the maximum number of calories.
 Everyone agrees that parental involvement can make a big difference in the quality of school lunches. To Dr. Nestle, lunch is part of a much larger problem.
 "It's part of our decline in caring about children," she said. "That's the reason school lunches are worth making a stink about, why they are worth fighting for."
 
LESSON NO. 1: REDUCE FAT; NO. 2: ELIMINATE JUNK FOOD
 THE Citizen's Commission on School Nutrition, made up of cardiologists, pediatricians, educators, nutritionists and school-food workers, has issued an 11-point program for improving school lunches. Because it is difficult to change children's taste preferences, the commission suggested making some changes in two stages, the first to be accomplished in four years; the second by 2000. NUTRITIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Adopt regulations to make school nutritional standards consistent with Government dietary recommendations.
 FAT: Stage 1: Reduce total fat to 35 percent of calories, with no more than a third from saturated fat. Stage 2: Reduce fat to 30 percent of calories.
 FIBER: Stage 1: Increase consumption of high-fiber foods, providing at least 8 servings a month. Stage 2: 15 high-fiber servings a month. Half of all bread and grain servings should be 100 percent whole grains.
SODIUM: Average sodium content of lunch, 1,000 milligrams. Stage 2: Average sodium content, 800 milligrams.
 NON-NUTRITIOUS FOODS: Ban sale of non-nutritious foods at school.
 CHOLESTEROL: Reduce average cholesterol content of meals to 100 milligrams or less.
 SUGAR: There should be no more than 20 percent sugar by weight in school breakfast cereals. Avoid sugary, high-fat desserts. ADDITIVES: Eliminate or reduce acesulfame-K, asparatame, BHA, BHT, caffeine, monosodium glutamate, saccharin, sodium nitrite, sulfite, yellow dye No. 5.
 MILK: Stage 1: Standard beverage should be milk with 2 percent fat; whole milk should not be required. Stage 2: Standard beverage should be milk with 1 percent fat or less.
 MONEY: Increase funds for lunches. Stage 1: Increase financing for Nutrition Education and Training program to $25 million by 1993. Stage 2: Financing beyond 1994 should be tied to inflation.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: GERMANY;
GERMANS ARE TOLD OF GULF-WAR ROLE

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Chancellor Helmut Kohl warned Germans today that they would not be able to avoid playing a role in the war against Iraq.
In a speech to Parliament, Mr. Kohl pledged that Germany would pay a fair share of war costs and would provide increased military aid to Israel. 
 The Government interprets Germany's Constitution as banning the dispatch of German troops to combat zones outside the NATO theater, but Mr. Kohl said he would seek to amend the Constitution to allow German soldiers to take part in United Nations peacekeeping missions.
"There can be no safe little corner in world politics for us Germans," Mr. Kohl said. "We have to face up to our responsibility, whether we like it or not. Until now, we have worked actively and successfully for the world's economic stability. This will no longer be enough."
 
Willingness to Aid Israel
 On Tuesday, responding to assertions that his Government had not contributed enough to the anti-Iraq effort, Mr. Kohl announced that Germany would send an additional $5.5 billion to the allied coalition. According to official figures, that raises the German contribution to slightly more than $9 billion.
Mr. Kohl warned today that tax increases would be needed to finance Germany's future contributions.
As he has in several other statements in recent days, Mr. Kohl stressed Germany's willingness to aid Israel. Relations between the two countries have been strained in recent weeks, and there have been protests in Israeli cities against Germany's role in arming Saddam Hussein.
"In these difficult days, Israel should know that it has our solidarity," Mr. Kohl told the Parliament.
A German television program reported Tuesday night that German companies had helped improve Iraq's Soviet-made Scud rockets, which have been used for attacks on Israel. The program also asserted that the German Government had given the companies financial guarantees for their work in Iraq. A Government spokesman said today that the guarantees were obtained under false pretenses.
In an interview to be published Thursday in Die Welt, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel described Bonn's efforts to control arms exports as "simply too weak."
An Israeli delegation is in Germany discussing details of a coming German military aid package. Newspaper reports published today said the Israelis had asked for $670 million in aid, including 2 submarines, 10 helicopters, batteries of Patriot and Hawk missiles, hand-held Stinger antiaircraft weapons, and serums for victims of anthrax and other poisons, as well as 100,000 gas masks.
