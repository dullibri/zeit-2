HEADLINE: First Union to Sell Annuities at Branches

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT 

 BODY:
The already weakened barriers between banks and insurance companies were further breached yesterday, when the First Union Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., announced plans to license 800 of its employees to sell annuities through its branch offices.
Annuities, which offer a stream of payments after retirement, are attracting more attention from banks that want to offer investment products that are more attractive than certificates of deposit. The United States Supreme Court ruled two months ago that banks could sell annuities, but left unanswered questions about who should regulate the activity. 
 First Union is the nation's ninth-largest banking company and is already a leader among banks in the mutual fund business, where it has licensed 1,700 workers at its branches to sell funds. About 800 of those workers -- one for each branch, except in Florida, where banks are not permitted to sell insurance -- will be licensed to sell annuities. The bank's workers are also responsible for selling other products like small loans and credit cards.
"We want to use our branch system to sell a full range of financial products," said Dave deGorter, director of the First Union insurance business.
By offering fixed annuities, which earn a specified interest rate, as well as variable annuities, in which earnings fluctuate according to changes in the stock and bond markets, thebank hopes to have annuities that will be attractive in different market conditions, he said.
Mr. deGorter said 70 percent of the recent sales of annuities in a pilot program at some branches in North Carolina had been of the fixed variety, whereas in 1993, when interset rates were lower but stock and bond prices were rising strongly, variable annuities accounted for 70 percent of sales.
For now, First Union will sell fixed annuities issued by insurance companies -- Western National Life in Houston for the fixed annuities and Nationwide Insurance in Columbus, Ohio, for the variable type. "Right now we are not permitted to issue our own annuities," Mr. deGorter said, adding that if the rules changed, "it is not beyond the realm of comprehension" that the bank would do so.
The agreements between insurers and First Union are reminders that the insurance industry is of two minds about the banks entering the $80-billion-a-year annuity business. Insurance agents oppose the entry of the banks, but many insurance companies have agreements to provide banks with annuities to sell to banks' customers.
Western National Life is controlled by the American General Corporation, based in Houston, which also owns the Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company. Variable Annuity filed lawsuits nine years ago against banking regulators to stop banks from selling annuities, but lost the case in a Supreme Court decision issued in January.

HEADLINE: From the Land of St. Patrick, a Dove

BYLINE: By JAMES F. CLARITY 

DATELINE: DUBLIN, March 16

 BODY:
A few months ago, John Bruton's political career was at its nadir, his popularity at an all-time low, his party apparently destined to remain in frustrated opposition. But the man who met with President Clinton in Washington today has changed all that in his three months as Ireland's Prime Minister.
In an interview before he left on Tuesday, Mr. Bruton said his primary mission on his weeklong visit to the United States would be to advance a political settlement of the 25 years of sectarian guerrilla violence in Northern Ireland, to "get a few messages into the political system about the need to get a balanced approach to this problem, to recognize the rights of both communities" -- Northern Ireland's Protestant majority and its Roman Catholic minority. 
 "I think I'm realistic enough to know that people in America don't wake up every morning and ask what's happening in Ireland," Mr. Bruton said, discussing the timing of his visit. "They think about Ireland maybe twice or three times a year in a serious way." St. Patrick's Day, he said, "is one of those times."
Mr. Bruton's meeting with President Clinton today was his first, but it was upstaged by another first encounter, that between the President and Gerry Adams, the political leader of the Irish Republican Army.
Since he became Prime Minister quite unexpectedly last December in a maelstrom over a domestic issue in Irish politics, Mr. Bruton has become instrumental in trying to advance a settlement in Northern Ireland.
But before he became Prime Minister, Mr. Bruton was a frequent critic of Mr. Adams and of the I.R.A.'s violent struggle to end British rule over Northern Ireland. The tall, balding, 47-year-old lawyer and gentleman farmer from rural County Meath was often described by Irish nationalists like Mr. Adams as a unionist -- a supporter of the Protestant leaders who want the North to remain part of Britain.
Mr. Bruton, a Catholic, denies this, and he is generally considered to have moderated his views. But much of what Mr. Bruton said in the interview would seem likely to make Irish nationalists and their Irish-American supporters grind their teeth.
Discussing Mr. Adams's refusal to make a categorical denunciation of the I.R.A. "armed struggle" even though the I.R.A. has observed a cease-fire for six and a half months, and Mr. Adams's hesitancy to discuss I.R.A. disarmament in the peace negotiations, Mr. Bruton said, "The insistence on the maintenance of substantial amounts of arms is not consistent with saying you are entirely and exclusively willing in all circumstances only to use political, nonviolent methods." But he said the British and the unionists must also make concessions.
Mr. Bruton's view of the republicans is a legacy of his party, Fine Gael. The grandfathers of many Fine Gael supporters defeated the republicans in the civil war that followed Irish independence from Britain in 1922, under a treaty that left the six counties of the North part of Britain. Today, Sinn Fein, the I.R.A.'s political wing, gets about one-third of the Catholic vote in the North, but not quite 2 percent in the Irish Republic.
In polls taken a few weeks before Mr. Bruton took office, only 10 percent of the voters who responded said he was their choice to lead the country, and his party had not led a Government since 1987. But he was vaulted to power when Mr. Bruton's predecessor, Albert Reynolds, was forced from office after a scandal in which his Government was accused of failing to act in the case of a Catholic priest accused, and later convicted, of sexually abusing children in Northern Ireland.
In recent weeks, the polls show him gaining in popularity and that more than half of the people are satisfied with him.
He has been accused, mostly by political enemies, of being gruff with his party colleagues, some of whom had tried to oust him, and stiff and uncharismatic in leading Fine Gael in Parliamentary debates. His critics said he was unable to focus on a single issue for very long, but his supporters noted his intelligence and dedication to the art of government, which he has learned in 25 years as a member of Parliament.
He also knows politics. When Mr. Reynolds's Government fell, he was able to make a deal with the Labor Party and the Democratic Left to form a center-left Government. He came into office charged not only with trying to advance the peace effort, but also with dealing with serious difficulties in the economy. While economic conditions have been improving, Ireland still has one of the highest unemployment rates in Europe -- about 16 percent.
He is generally considered a liberal on social affairs, and his Government overcame strong opposition over the last two weeks to win final approval in Parliament for a measure guaranteeing women access to information about foreign abortion clinics. Mr. Bruton has indicated, however, that his Government will not take on a revision of the country's constitutional ban on abortion. Abortion is legal only if the woman's life is in danger.
Asked whether his trip -- which includes visits to New York, Chicago and St. Louis -- was primarily to seek economic aid in Washington, he said: "This is not a poor country. We have plenty of resources, education, talent. What we need from the United States is political support, political recognition, political encouragement. We're not going to the United States in any mendicant mode."

HEADLINE: OUR TOWNS;
Debate? Campaign Issues? But This Is Scarsdale

BYLINE: By Evelyn Nieves 

DATELINE: SCARSDALE, N.Y.

 BODY:
ROBERT HARRISON is trying to bring American democracy to Scarsdale, but he is having a tough time of it.
He is running for mayor, but at a candidates' forum at the public library the other night, it was just he on the dais. Following a longstanding Scarsdale tradition, his opponent, Ann Janiak, refuses to debate. 
"We do things a little differently than in the rest of the country," she said.
In fact, the election is on Tuesday and Ms. Janiak, a village trustee, hasn't stated any campaign positions. Mr. Harrison, a write-in candidate, is running around making promises about open government and distributing fliers listing his membership in civic associations. Ms. Janiak is lying low.
"The Scarsdale Citizen's Party feels strongly that the candidate for mayor does not run on issues," she said.
She was picked as a candidate by the nonpartisan Citizens' Party, which is batting 1.000. For about 70 years, the party's candidate has won every time.
"People are selected for their knowledge of their community, for their good judgment, rather than their particular stand on an issue," she said. "If people state a position, then they're beholden to certain groups."
PRECISELY, Mr. Harrison said.
"We should tell people what we're going to do," he said. "We should be beholden to the people."
He said he wants to talk about moving the village compost heap. He wants to talk about downtown development. He wants to talk about new tennis courts. He wants to talk.
"I believe in freedom of speech and democracy," he said, sounding more "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" than he intended.
But the current Mayor, Walter J. Handelman, said that Mr. Harrison just doesn't understand.
"There is no such thing as issues when you run a municipal government," said Mr. Handelman, who is stepping down, as village tradition dictates, after one term.
"When you talk about 'issues,' " he said, "it has to really be in quotes. Because what you're talking about is solving certain problems with particular respect to municipal government that people have a point of view on."
Mr. Harrison decided to run for mayor three weeks ago, after attending a village board meeting where several items he wanted to discuss were not brought up. After 15 years of wrestling with Scarsdale's brand of government, he said he is ready for the old-fashioned system of open debate.
"There is no interaction," he said. "That's wrong. We want to totally open up the system and find out why everything takes so long to get done."
He is a former Wall Street broker with firm good-citizen credentials. He founded the New York Junior Tennis League of Scarsdale, co-founded the Scarsdale Spring Youth Tennis League, headed a neighborhood association and formed the Scarsdale Taxpayer Alert. "To protect our property values," he said. He has been a regular presence at the biweekly village board meetings for years.
His bid for election is one of the few times a citizens' committee candidate has ever been challenged. Scarsdale, one of the jewels of Westchester County, is rich and beautiful and basically happy. Its schools consistently land on national Top 10 lists. The median price of a one-family house is more than $500,000. Residents join clubs. The League of Women Voters (Ms. Janiak is a past president) has close to 700 members and is the largest suburban chapter in the country.
 THE current political system was devised about three generations ago by a reform-minded civic association now known as the Town and Village Civic Club. The Scarsdale Citizens' Party, with 36 members elected from Scarsdale's 18 election districts, meets privately to select candidates for office from resumes. Term limits are built in. Village trustees serve no more than two two-year terms; the mayor, usually chosen from among the trustees, serves one two-year term.
The mayor is a part-time volunteer. A village manager is responsible for the day-to-day work of running the village. This year, the city manager is retiring and a new manager, hired by the village trustees, is slated to take over.
At the candidates' forum, Mr. Harrison promised the two dozen people assembled that he would set regular office hours and address citizens' questions in open meetings that are as long as required. He promised to get the issue of the compost heap, which many residents hate, squared away. He was cheerfully received.
"I'd like to know what kind of vitamins you take," Susan Levine said.
Mayor Handelman, however, said that Mr. Harrison shouldn't make any promises. "Nobody, not even somebody who is on the board now and is a candidate for re-election -- none of those people can say, 'If you elect me, I will move the compost heap,' " he said. "It's just not the way it works. We decide things collectively. That's why we've had such a remarkable record of clean, efficient, forward-thinking government."

HEADLINE: Stock Prices Set Records Once Again

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Despite some new and conflicting economic reports, traders sent stock prices to record levels yesterday as bond prices fell slightly and the dollar seemed to steady overseas.
For the second time this week, the leading stock indexes surged past records to hit new highs. Stocks started out strong, and for the most part rose throughout the day. But traders said some of the action was most likely prompted by today's quarterly expiration of stock options. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 30.78 points to a record 4,069.15, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 3.53 points, to 495.41, also a record. And the smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 1.96 points to 809.34, another record.
Meanwhile, after rallying sharply in the morning, bonds gave up all of their gains in the afternoon. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 7.37 percent, from 7.36 percent on Wednesday. [Page D16.]
In international trading, the dollar steadied and continued to trade above post-World War II lows of 1.3895 German marks and 89.50 Japanese yen, but remained under pressure. The dollar fell as low as 89.14 yen before rising to 90.20 yen in late New York trading, up 0.70 yen, and as low as 1.3791 German marks before finishing at 1.3965 marks, up from 1.3895 marks.
Big stocks led the rally. They included oil companies like Exxon, conglomerates like General Electric, beverage companies like Coca-Cola, long-distance phone companies like AT&T, and health-maintenance organizations like U S Healthcare.
Stock traders said, however, that the increase in stock prices might have been exaggerated by the "triple witching" phenomenon that begins today with the quarterly expiration of three kinds of stock options.
In the past, to exercise their options traders have furiously bought and sold stocks on expiration day, but they now appear to spread their activity over two or even three days.
"In the last couple of quarters, every time we get into this thing, we rally before it," said Todd Clark, managing director of equity trading at Mabon Securities. A telltale sign that triple witching played a big part in the rally was that bond prices began falling around 1:30 P.M. and stocks continued to rally later in the day, he said.
Another sign was that on the New York Stock Exchange, nearly two stocks advanced for each one that declined, with 1,420 winning stocks and 801 losers. New highs were established for 107 stocks and new lows for 21 issues.
The market news at 8:30 A.M. was both good and bad, at least by the logic of the market. The Consumer Price Index rose in February by three-tenths of 1 percent, instead of the two-tenths of 1 percent expected by Wall Street, reinforcing a possibly inflationary reading on wholesale prices on Wednesday.
But a report released at the same time, a 2.6 percent drop in housing starts in February, seemed to reassure traders who think the economy is slowing. A report at 10 A.M. by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, indicating little or no growth in manufacturing in its region, served to confirm the idea.
Stock and bond traders therefore concluded that it was safe to buy stocks and bonds because there would be little chance that the Fed would raise interest rates while the economy was slowing.
Bond prices rose sharply until the afternoon, when prices suddenly dropped, wiping out the gains of the morning. Barry Kirschner, bond trader at Chase Securities, said "a very large seller of bonds" entered the market at about 1 P.M. and helped to drive prices down.
As many traders had expected, the Bundesbank, the German counterpart to the Federal Reserve, did not cut interest rates. And in Italy, Prime Minister Lamberto Dini won a vote of confidence on his deficit-cutting proposals.
Both moves meant, at least for now, that European and other traders would not suddenly dump dollars and lira to move to the German mark.
Whether nervous stock traders will dump dollars today in advance of the weekend, as they sometimes do in periods of extreme volatility, is unclear. But Victor Polce, a currency trader at the New York office of Commerzbank, said he thought the dollar was likely to fall at some point.
David De Rosa, a director of foreign exchange trading at Swiss Bank, said a crucial development to watch is whether Spain remains in the European Union's exchange rate mechanism.
He said the Bundesbank's decision to keep interest rates high, or at least not to reduce them in the short run, may have the effect of forcing the Spanish peseta out of the exchange mechanism, rather than simply into further devaluations.
And as the mark rises in value, the pressure on the dollar increases, because to buy marks traders must sell other currencies, including dollars.
But as the dollar weakens, American stocks and bonds fall in value for foreign investors. In a week of record-breaking rises in stocks, the Dow has still fallen 3.82 percent in Japanese yen and 4.36 percent in German marks for the year.
Tektronix, a maker of electronic test equipment, rose 4 3/8 to 37 3/8 after it reported that its third-quarter earnings rose 39 percent, to 70 cents a share. Xerox rose 3 5/8 to 120 1/8 after Salomon Brothers raised its earnings projection for the office-equipment company.
The Merix Corporation, which makes printed circuit boards and other products, fell 4 1/8 to 23 3/4 after a Montgomery Securities analyst lowered his rating to "hold" from "buy." Roberts Pharmaceutical's share price was down for a second day after the company reported disappointing drug dales for the fourth quarter. Roberts dropped 3 to 38.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was above normal, with 339.8 million shares changing hands, about 4 percent above this year's daily average of 327 million shares.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.77 points to 267.92, and the American Stock Exchange market value index rose 1.69 point to 456.47.
The most-active stock, at 6.1 million shares, was Telefonos de Mexico, which fell 3/8 to 26 1/8.

Bonds End Mixed After Early Rally Fades

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities ended mixed yesterday after a rally set off by signs of an economic slowdown faded.
A series of reports released yesterday indicated the economy had slowed enough to subdue inflation. These reports, which included a modest pickup in consumer prices in February, suggest that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise short-term interest rates when its policy-making committee meets on March 28. 
 The price of the 30-year bond fell 5/32 , to 1032/32 , after being up about a point in intraday trading. At that price, the bond was yielding 7.37 percent, up from 7.36 percent on Wednesday. Prices and yields move in opposite directions. Market participants said the yield had been down as low as 7.28 percent, the lowest in nine months.
In early trading, the market turned higher following the release of the Consumer Price Index for February. The index rose three-tenths of 1 percent. Its core rate, which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy, also rose three-tenths of 1 percent.
In a separate report, housing starts fell 2.6 percent in February, to an annualized rate of 1.323 million from 1.38 million in January.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, in a survey of regional business activity, said its index fell in March to 3.3 from 11.9 in February. Traders had been expecting the index to slip to 10.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Securities, said bond market participants paid close attention to both housing starts and the Philadelphia Fed business outlook because they were "statistics that further indicated a slowdown in business activity, although by now this is news only for those recently arriving from Mars."
The increase in the Consumer Price Index was duly noted, he said, but had little market impact because it was fully anticipated.
Mr. Fine says inflation as measured by the consumer index is a lagging indicator and is likely to increase further as the year progresses, though in a nonthreatening manner. "But inflationary expectations, which matter most for bond yields, have clearly lessened in response to the slower rate of economic growth," he said.
Some analysts, however, are not as optimistic that the threat of inflation has receded. Anthony E. Spare, chief investment officer of Spare, Kaplan, Bischel & Associates, a $2 billion San Francisco money management firm, sees the economy in transition. "We are going to go from the best of all worlds of rapid growth and low inflation to the worst of all worlds, higher inflation and slower growth," he said. "Everyone has built in their own expectations of a soft landing, but the odds are low for such an occurrence."
Bond prices were also supported for most of yesterday by a stronger dollar. But there was late profit taking after word of a large bond sale by a large institutional investor. There was talk among traders that an insurance company had sold substantial holdings in five-year notes and other longer maturities, though the identity of the insurer could not be determined.
In the municipal market, where investors have been hungry for new issues, the Virginia Housing Development Authority competitively priced $100 million of its commonwealth mortgage revenue bonds won by Prudential Securities.
Underwriters said the bonds were insured by the Municipal Bond Investor's Assurance Corporation, giving them a triple-A rating from Moody's Investors Services Inc. and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The maximum yield was 6.45 percent for a bond due in 2028, with the next-best yields at 6.40 percent for a bond due in 2022 and 6.35 percent in 2018. For shorter maturities, yields on serials bond range from 6.15 percent in 2011 to 6.30 percent in 2014 and 2015.

Dollar Rebounds Somewhat Aided by U.S. Bond Rally

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar staged a moderate recovery against leading currencies yesterday, helped by an early rally in the United States bond market.
But market analysts and traders said the dollar's recent tumble seemed far from over, with yesterday's recovery mostly tied to technical, not fundamental, factors. 
 "The general market feeling is the dollar is still going down," said Paul Downs, a foreign-exchange analyst with Technical Data in Boston. "The dollar is still very much under pressure."
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar rose to 90.20 Japanese yen from 89.50 yen on Wednesday. The dollar also rose to 1.3965 German marks from 1.3895 marks and to 1.1640 Swiss francs from 1.1520 francs. The British pound fell to $1.5885 from $1.5999.
The dollar initially strengthened overnight in Asia. Many currency dealers were speculating early yesterday that the German central bank would discuss cutting interest rates, which would make United States rates more attractive to foreign investors, thus supporting the value of the dollar.
The president of the Bundesbank had encouraged such speculation, saying yesterday that the central bank's policy makers would have to decide whether there was room to reduce rates.
Hopes for a drop in German rates, though, were deflated later in the day when the Bundesbank chose to leave key interest rates unchanged at its twice-monthly policy meeting.. German rates have been fixed since July.
The news sent the dollar skidding before it recovered in New York trading.
The dollar received support yesterday from a resurgent United States Treasury market. Treasury bond prices shot higher as fixed-income investors seized on a report by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank as a further sign of an economic slowdown in the United States.
The increased allure of the dollar-denominated securities encouraged further buying of dollars by foreign investors, traders said.
"Once you see a rally like this, everybody who wants to get in better get in now," said Elena Shperling, chief trader at Banco di Sicilia in New York.
While bond prices retreated late in the day, the dollar held onto its gains.

HEADLINE: New York Fed Names No. 2 Official

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said yesterday that it had promoted Ernest T. Patrikis, its general counsel, to be its No. 2 executive.
Mr. Patrikis, 51, will succeed James H. Oltman, 64, who is retiring as the first vice president of the bank. 
 Mr. Patrikis has been involved in the fraud investigation at Bank of Credit and Commerce International and in the recent enforcement action related to the sale of derivatives by Bankers Trust.
In his new role, he said, he wants to work on the continuing problems that arise when corporations and investors buy derivatives that they later say were too risky.
Mr. Patrikis has been active in the Fed's initiative to establish a code of conduct for banks selling derivatives and similar products.
"Derivatives are in their adolescent stage," he said. "Adolescents misbehave. Some people want to kill adolescents, and some people want to kill derivatives."
He said the New York Fed would push the derivatives industry to make better prices available to customers so they can monitor the value of their positions. Similarly it will work to make sure that derivatives dealers clarify whether they are acting as advisers or merely as suppliers.
In his new role, Mr. Patrikis will also be an alternate member on the key Federal Reserve body that sets interest rates -- the Federal Open Markets Committee -- serving in the absence of the New York Fed president, William J. McDonough.
Like many New York Fed officials, he has worked in the bank his entire career, joining in 1968 after graduating from Cornell Law School.
The New York Fed operates the bond and currency trading desk on behalf of the Federal Government, acting to influence foreign exchange and interest rate levels. It operates the Fedwire money transfer system that moves more than $1 trillion a day. And it supervises the bank holding companies based in New York, northern New Jersey and southern Connecticut.
The bank also announced two executives to fill Mr. Patrikis's role. Thomas C. Baxter Jr. will replace Mr. Patrikis as general counsel. Kathleen A. O'Neil will head the bank's staff functions.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Up 0.3%; Data Point to a Slowdown

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
A variety of fresh Government statistics released today showed that an economic slowdown, becoming more pronounced by the day, was helping to moderate the sting of inflation.
Retail prices climbed three-tenths of 1 percent for the second consecutive month in February, the Labor Department reported, a result that analysts considered in line with expectations that the inflation rate this year will be held to less than 3.5 percent. 
 Prices are rising, "but very glacially," said Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist for Paribas Capital Markets in New York.
Signs of the slowdown could be seen in other reports today. Higher interest rates are exacting a particularly heavy toll on the housing market, where builders broke ground on 2.6 percent fewer homes in February than in January, the Commerce Department found. It also reported that the January results were revised to a 12 percent decline, from the 9.8 percent originally reported.
In the industrial sector, where activity remained brisk last month, a survey covering March that was published today by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia indicated a sudden slowdown in the economy. Those who characterized activity as rising barely outnumbered those who thought it was declining.
Securities traders said it was this news that touched off a midmorning rally in the stock and bond markets, although bond prices later retreated.
In still another report, the Labor Department said first-time claims for unemployment insurance climbed 5,000 last week, to 343,000, with the average for the latest four weeks edging down to 339,250.
But it was the Consumer Price Index that held the biggest potential for unpleasant surprises. The February rise, though not without some unsettling aspects, was generally reassuring, economists said.
"Inflation seems to be right around 3 percent, which is taken as not enough for the Federal Reserve to do anything further" to raise interest rates, said Paul W. Boltz, an economist at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore.
Still, he noted that when the erratic food and energy components were excluded, the index had risen at a 4.2 percent compound annual rate in the first two months of the year. This could prove worrisome, he and others said, even taking into account that the index seems to have an upward bias in the winter.
Some important contributors to the February rise, including a 1.1 percent jump for personal and educational services, do seem unlikely to be repeated. The core index, excluding food and energy, climbed three-tenths of 1 percent last month compared with four-tenths of 1 percent in January.
Food prices staged a turnaround, to a rise of three-tenths of 1 percent from a rare January decline. The price of apparel slumped six-tenths of 1 percent as higher-priced spring and summer merchandise arrived in amounts that were somewhat smaller than usual for February.
The housing component showed higher prices for cable television, refuse collection and furniture and bedding, while fuel oil and telephone charges declined.
In transportation, automobile finance charges leaped another 2.4 percent to bring the 12-month advance to 29.3 percent while used cars posted another hefty increase to bring the yearly total to 14.3 percent, the report showed.
The cost of medical care rose three-tenths of 1 percent, with prescription drugs and other medical commodities easing one-tenth of 1 percent. The department reported Wednesday that drug prices at the wholesale level rose sharply last month.
Today's report on housing starts showed that the decline was concentrated in the South -- the other three regions actually had modest increases -- and mainly involved apartment houses and other multifamily dwellings.
Still, nationwide starts of single-family homes were down six-tenths of 1 percent, to a rate of just 1,053,000, a level that would once have been considered recessionary, observed Carol A. Stone, senior economist at Nomura Securities International. Saying that she had expected some snapback from January's double-digit plunge, she said that the February results only confirmed the weakness in housing.

HEADLINE: Ruling Keeps Alive Hopes for Bronx Railyard

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
A judge's ruling has revived the possibility that a moribund railyard in the South Bronx could be turned into a major center for transfering freight from trains to trucks.
Advocates of the proposal say the creation of the transfer point would lower the cost of shipping goods into New York City, create thousands of jobs and reduce air pollution. But the State Department of Transportation, which once supported the concept, had opted instead to lease the 96-acre Harlem River Yard, at the southern tip of the Bronx near Randalls Island, to a private developer who planned a smaller transfer operation. 
 Justice Jerry L. Crispino of State Supreme Court in the Bronx, voided that lease last week, ruling that the department had not given fair consideration to other options or to the environmental impact of the developer's plans.
The department plans to appeal the decision, said Michael R. Fleischer, a department spokesman.
The ruling came in a suit filed by several community and environmental groups in the Bronx. They wanted the state to return to a 1982 Department of Transportation plan that called for turning the unused yard, which the state bought that year, into the region's primary transfer point.
Little freight enters New York City by rail because, among other reasons, unlike most American cities, it does not have a site for transfering truck containers from trains to trucks. Most freight is trucked into the city, instead, which raises the cost of merchandise and adds to air pollution.
Bringing freight into the city by train is crucial to keeping the region competitive, said Robert D. Yaro, executive director of the Regional Plan Association, a private group that studies land use and other issues in the metropolitan area. "We simply don't have a modern rail-freight system in the region," he said. "Forty percent of the freight in the country is moving by rail, but in this region it's 4 percent, and in New York City it's only 2 percent."
Faced with legal and labor problems, the state backed away from the plan in the late 1980's, and in 1991 it agreed to lease the site for 99 years to Harlem River Yard Ventures, a group headed by Francesco Galesi, a developer. The group's plan, approved by the state last May, called for a much smaller rail-to-truck freight transfer yard, warehouses, a paper recycling plant and a truck-to-rail transfer site for solid waste.
The 1982 plan projected taking hundreds of trucks off the region's highways every day, while creating thousands of jobs at the transfer site and benefitting the entire city by lowering freight costs. The plaintiffs argued -- and the judge agreed -- that the Harlem River Yard Ventures plan would add thousands of trucks each day to traffic on Bronx streets, while falling far short of the demand for freight transfer.
To develop the Harlem River Yard, the 1982 plan called for building a rail line along the Harlem River so that freight trains would not have to cross or share lines used by Metro-North commuter trains. That work is nearly complete. The plan also called for increasing the height of several bridges over lines leading to the city so that modern freight cars could fit under them, and that work has been finished.
John McHugh, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said the transfer station is so close to being ready that it could start operations this year.

HEADLINE: World Bank Must Snap Out of its Midlife Crisis

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your March 12 news article on President Clinton's recommendation of James D. Wolfensohn as the new World Bank president was correct that the bank has been the subject of growing criticism, but mistaken in asserting that the "50 Years Is Enough" Campaign has the simple message that the bank "should mark its 50th anniversary by going out of business." 
 We have never made a statement to that effect. What this coalition, made up of more than 135 citizens' groups in the United States, is calling for is what will be on the table when world leaders gather in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in June for the G-7 economic summit conference: profound changes in an institution whose extended midlife crisis must come to an end.
Mr. Wolfensohn will need to be more than a "Renaissance Banker" (Man in the News, March 13) if he is to succeed at sorting out the problems that plague this institution: a legacy of environmentally and socially destructive programs and projects, a portfolio in which bank officials have identified a project failure rate of more than 30 percent, an inability to translate all manner of policies into action, a shrinking budget and a stunning inability to achieve its ostensible purpose of poverty alleviation.
Mr. Wolfensohn should already be familiar with some of the problems. This year, a high-level report prepared by the Bretton Woods Commission recognized the imminent need to reconsider the roles of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
That commission was headed by Paul Volcker, former head of the Federal Reserve and now chairman of the private investment firm James D. Wolfensohn Inc.
As if the legacy of problems is not enough, Mr. Wolfensohn must also deal with the Mexican disaster and the bank's role in it. Mexico is the bank's largest cumulative borrower and until recently its poster child, the country whose economic recovery was meant to vindicate the economists at the bank and the I.M.F., whose highly criticized structural adjustment prescriptions are failing the world over.
Internationally, thousands of nongovernmental organizations believe that restructuring of the bank should be based on principles of openness, accountability and democratic governance that will support development led by those most affected by it. Such changes will require a leader of extraordinary vision and courage.
Mr. Wolfensohn may have rebuilt Carnegie Hall; the World Bank is something else.

HEADLINE: PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW;
The Melancholy Images That Made an Era Real

BYLINE: By CHARLES HAGEN 

 BODY:
The first task some viewers will face when they look at the photographs in "Dorothea Lange: American Images," the stirring exhibition now at the International Center of Photography, is to strip the pictures of their dulling glaze of fame. Lange had an astonishing ability to make images that summed up the terrible impact of the Depression of the 1930's on people's lives, and many of the pictures here have become classics, not only of photography but of the history of America.
As a result, they have been endlessly reproduced, and it may be difficult for some people to break through the pictures' familiarity and to recognize the human realities they record. These are the images that have defined our understanding of Depression America, and particularly of its people, with their weary eyes and worn faces. 
 Take, for example, "Migrant Mother, Nipomo, California," Lange's 1936 photograph of a worried-looking woman in a farm-labor camp flanked by her children. That image seems to embody the anxiety and heroism of people confronting social forces beyond their control, and has been used on posters, postage stamps and book jackets around the world.
The show at the center includes not only two prints of this famous image, one with an intruding hand retouched out, but also two other shots Lange took of the same woman and her children. These alternative pictures break down some of the sense of inevitability that has made "Migrant Mother" an icon, and provide valuable insights into Lange's way of working.
The story of how Lange came to photograph the effects of the Depression is itself a famous chapter in the history of photography. She was born in 1895, and was working in San Francisco as a portrait photographer who specialized in genteel, dramatically lighted images when, in the early 30's, she took her camera into the streets to record the protests and social strife of that tumultous decade.
When Paul Taylor, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, saw her photographs in an exhibition, he enlisted her to illustrate reports on agricultural conditions. The two began a personal and professional relationship that lasted until Lange's death in 1965.
Many of Lange's best-known images were taken between 1935 and 1939, when she worked for the Farm Security Administration, the New Deal agency concerned with agricultural policy; in 1939, Lange and Taylor published "An American Exodus," a book that combines Lange's photographs with quotes from the people in them.
Lange's pictures from this period are rightly considered classics of documentary photography, but they are seldom neutral. Even the most rundown and bedraggled of her subjects are portrayed as heroic; a remarkable sense of generosity and concern pervades her pictures.
Lange's striking ability to gain the confidence of her sitters is apparent in the intimacy with which they present themselves to her. This skill may have stemmed from her experience as a portraitist. Her pictures also demonstrate a sophisticated command of expressive form; photograph after photograph draws its emotional charge from simple yet subtle compositions and lighting.
A gaunt woman photographed in 1938 in the Texas Panhandle, for example, holds one hand to her head and the other to her neck, creating an angular frame for her face. Lange photographed the woman from a low angle against a backdrop of wispy clouds, heightening the sense of her strength.
"Dorothea Lange: American Photographs" provides an extensive selection of her Depression-era images, as well as examples from other documentary projects she undertook, including a deeply moving series of photographs of Japanese-Americans in California forced into internment camps at the outbreak of World War II. Also represented is a study of industrial workers during the war, when the labor force was opened up to women and blacks, as well as images of rural communities in Utah, made in the early 50's.
But the show, which was organized by Sandra S. Phillips, curator of photography at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, is not a thorough survey of Lange's work. Missing are her early portraits, as well as examples of the photographs she took in the 50's and 60's, when Taylor, by then her husband, was invited to teach overseas and she went along. Also absent are the pictures she took of her own family as ill health increasingly limited her ability to undertake more ambitious projects.
What the exhibition offers instead is the official Lange, the New Deal propagandist and unabashed liberal who was able to show human faces behind the slogans and the statistics. And it is those faces that impress themselves most strongly on memory.
There's the little girl in a grimy shift in Oklahoma who stares at the camera with sunken eyes, the cotton picker in Arizona who holds his splayed fingers in front of his face, the water boy who stands in a cotton field in the Mississippi Delta with his bucket planted squarely on his head. These and many other faces linger in Lange's photographs, patiently encouraging us to try to understand not only the times in which the people lived, but also their own unique lives.
In Lange's extraordinary photographs, ordinary people are recognized as leading characters in a profoundly important social drama. Her pictures have the riveting interest of the best fiction, and the moral weight of history.
"Dorothea Lange: American Photographs" remains at the International Center of Photography, 1130 Fifth Avenue, at 94th Street, through April 30. It will then travel to the Phillips Collection in Washington (May 20 to Aug. 27) and the Joslyn Art Museum in Omaha. (Sept. 30 to Nov. 26).

HEADLINE: Prominent Black Americans Take Aim at Nigeria

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
A group of prominent blacks began a national campaign today to press Nigeria's military dictatorship to restore democracy, the first time African-Americans have embarked on a protest of such magnitude against a black African government.
"We must isolate Nigeria, politically, socially and economically, in the same way we were able to isolate South Africa and Haiti," said Randall Robinson, executive director of TransAfrica, the black lobby for Africa and the Caribbean that is leading the campaign. The effort will include newspaper ads and protests outside the Nigerian Embassy. 
 He added, "You change the color, and there is not much distinction between the South African situation of the past and Nigeria today, except you don't have people discriminated against as a group simply on the basis of their skin color."
Among the group of black Americans supporting the effort are the poet Maya Angelou; Bryant Gumbel, the broadcaster for NBC's "Today"; A. Leon Higginbotham Jr., a retired Federal appeals court judge; the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Danny Glover, Quincey Jones, Alice Walker, and Sugar Ray Leonard, the former welterweight boxing champion.
The organization sent a letter on Monday to Nigeria's head of state, Gen. Sani Abacha, protesting what it called the "absolute military dictatorship" that has led to the detention or killing of hundreds of the military junta's critics.
General Abacha's Government has banned political opposition, dissolved labor unions and removed elected political leaders from office. The general ousted Moohood Abiola, the alleged winner of a national election, in a bloodless coup in November 1993.
"Nigeria is not only harming their own people, but military leaders continue to line their pockets with drug payoffs to transport narcotics through Nigeria to our youth on the streets of every city in the United States," said Representative Donald M. Payne, a New Jersey Democrat who heads the Congressional Black Caucus.
Mr. Robinson said TransAfrica, best known for its successful anti-apartheid campaign against South Africa, also plans to lobby the Administration to increase its pressure on the Nigerian Government by refusing to buy Nigerian oil, which makes up 4 percent of all oil imported by the United States. Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer, and the United States is its biggest buyer.
"It would do major damage to Nigeria, and we think more than diplomacy is needed."
Although the Administration opposes the Lagos Government, it maintains a policy of "engagement" to effect change.
In the past the Administration has imposed some sanctions on Nigeria, and visas have been denied to those who have supported the military Government. In addition, Nigeria has been barred from receiving aid from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank because of drug trafficking.
Mr. Robinson said that on Monday he spoke to George E. Moose, an Assistant Secretary of State, about the group's proposed action and informed other members of the Administration. A copy of the letter also went to Anthony Lake, the national security adviser.
In the past, the group has condemned conditions in Ethiopia, Zaire and Angola, but Mr. Robinson said today's effort was the first time it had undertaken a major effort against a black African government.
"Nigeria should be the bellwether state of sub-Saharan Africa," said Mr. Robinson. "It is Africa's largest and should be its wealthiest country, given its great oil wealth. Instead, it is verging on economic collapse."
The Nigerian campaign is the latest political effort by TransAfrica, which was founded in 1977 and credited with elevating the influence of African-Americans in foreign policy through 1960's-style civil rights protests. Its anti-apartheid campaign, begun in 1984, featured several demonstrations outside the South African Embassy here that resulted in the arrests of prominent participants like Senator Edward M. Kennedy.
Last spring, Mr. Robinson engaged in a 27-day hunger strike that heightened public awareness of conditions in Haiti. Observers say this and the group's other efforts contributed to a change in American policy toward Haiti and ultimately helped lead to the military intervention in September that restored Haiti's democratically elected President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide.

HEADLINE: Entrepreneur Gets $30 Million To Establish For-Profit Schools

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

 BODY:
A few months after financial pressures seemed to put its future in jeopardy, the Edison Project, the media entrepreneur Christopher Whittle's groundbreaking venture into for-profit education, announced yesterday that it had secured $30 million in financing and would open its first schools next fall.
Mr. Whittle will provide half of the money himself and the president of the project, Benno C. Schmidt Jr., a former president of Yale University, is heading a group that will provide another $3 million. The rest will come from the Sprout Group, one of the nation's oldest and largest venture capital firms. By securing $12 million from the firm, Edison has allied itself with an investor with broad resources and far-ranging experience in start-up ventures. 
 After a harrowing period in which Edison scrambled for the financial backing it needed to say alive, the new financing gives Edison a chance to show whether it can deliver on its promise of innovative public schools that it says will both turn a profit and improve the education of the nation's children.
"This speaks to the strength of the idea," said Mr. Whittle, whose mixed record in other ventures, lavish life style and accounting practices were the subject of withering publicity, particularly in a long article in The New Yorker last October.
There is still enormous skepticism among many educators about Edison's assertion that it can lengthen the school day and school year, provide extras like a computer in every student's home and still turn a profit. The two original partners along with Mr. Whittle, Associated Newspapers, which owns, among other things, the Daily Mail in London and Philips Electronics, the Dutch conglomerate, made no new investments in the venture, which has spent $40 million in start-up costs.
"There's a lot of hype that may sell in the short run, but if you ask me if I think they'll recoup their investment, I'd say flat out, 'No,' said Henry Levin, a Stanford University economist, who founded that university's Accelerated Schools Program, which works with troubled students in 700 schools in 37 states.
But Michael Moe, who follows trends in for-profit education for Lehman Brothers in New York, said education was a fertile area for investors. "I know they've spent a lot of time studying the education market," he said of Sprout. "If you look at the education market, you see a classic situation where you've got a big problem and a huge market, and so companies with innovative solutions represent significant investment opportunities."
Edison originally planned to operate private schools and said it would open 100 schools in the fall of 1996. Later, it shifted its ambitions to operating public schools by contract with school districts. Dr. Schmidt said Edison would begin with 3 or 4 schools in the fall and perhaps 7 to 10 others a year later, far fewer than the company had talked about just a few months ago. The first Edison schools will include the Renaissance Charter School in Boston, and elementary schools in Mount Clemens, Mich., and Wichita, Kan.
He said the movement for charter schools, public schools operated autonomously at the school level, and the overall ferment in education made Edison right for the times. "Charters are a perfect avenue for us," he said. "But I also think they reflect just how widespread is the desire for the creation of alternative models for public schools."
Edison is a very modest investment for the Sprout Group, the venture capital affiliate of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, which since its inception in 1969 has raised or has under management a billion dollars. The $12 million Edison investment will be spread between two investment partnerships.
Mr. Whittle said his areas of responsibility would include capital formation and long-term strategic planning, while Dr. Schmidt would be in charge of the day-to-day management of the company.

HEADLINE: Republicans Lop $100 Billion from Budgets to Pay for Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
Much as they have promised for months, Republicans on the House Budget Committee voted today to lop $100 billion from future Federal budgets to pay for a hefty chunk of the tax relief promised in their Contract With America.
This, at least, is the way the Republicans tell it. Furious Democrats offer a different account. Others who were there remain uncertain of everything that occurred but would pay admission to see such a bar fight again. 
 "We think we have produced a truly amazing document here today," Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the Budget Committee chairman, said after the session ended. Few would dispute it.
In practical terms, Mr. Kasich and his fellow Republicans on the budget panel did take an important step today toward offsetting the $189 billion that their party's tax-cut proposals would drain from Federal revenues in the next five years.
By a 24-to-11 vote, the panel ordered the House Appropriations Committee to make $95 billion in unspecified cuts from the $2.8 trillion it had planned to spend over that period on discretionary programs, including space exploration, agriculture and foreign aid, to name a handful. And it voted to cut the anti-crime trust fund approved by the House only last month by $5 billion in the next five years, to a total of $23 billion.
Republicans intend to combine that $100 billion cut with legislation that would reduce projected spending on other programs like welfare and Federal pensions, and to approve them -- and the tax cuts -- in a single House vote later this spring. The package would then go to the Senate, where opposition to tax cuts is strong and its prospects are cloudy.
But what seemed clear on Republican charts quickly stumbled into a heap of conflicting numbers. The problem began when Mr. Kasich handed out a list of "illustrative" budget cuts, intended to show how $100 billion in savings could be found once the Appropriations Committee starts hunting.
Sharp-eyed Democrats studied the list. And they concluded that some $35 billion on it had been discussed by the full House the previous evening -- and specifically reserved for deficit reduction, not financing tax relief.
"You're double-counting," said Representative Charles Stenholm, a conservative Texas Democrat who is often Mr. Kasich's ally on deficit matters. Mr. Kasich replied: Am not.
In truth, it depends. To underscore their seriousness about budget-cutting, Republicans plucked $17.3 billion this month from programs in the current Federal budget and marked them for elimination. And to win Democratic support, they agreed Wednesday night, in a 418-to-5 vote, to apply most of those savings to deficit reduction and not to paying for tax cuts that many Democrats oppose.
Mr. Kasich believed that the amendment, dubbed a "lockbox" provision, applied only to savings from the current budget. But in fact, it covered any future savings from cuts in those programs through 1998, which was a $35 billion subtraction, potentially, from the $100 billion in Mr. Kasich's package.
"It's to buy down the debt, for deficit reduction," said Representative William K. Brewster, the Oklahoma Democrat who wrote the amendment. "It's not available for any spending: tax cuts, social programs."
Told of that, the irrepressible Mr. Kasich committed a faux pas and spoke the truth. "Frankly, the whole lockbox thing is going to get dropped" once legislation reaches the Senate, he said. "Everybody knows it's a big game on the lockbox."
Mr. Stenholm was shocked. "It's not a game," he said. "It's very serious. And those of us who think a tax cut is absurd are doing everything we can to insure that spending cuts go to deficit reduction, period."
Mr. Kasich and Mr. Brewster were later seen walking toward the House chamber, for a final vote on the $17.3 billion in cuts, engaged in an animated argument. Mr. Brewster was later spied on the House floor in another animated, finger-pointing discussion with Republican leaders.
Moments later, he voted for the cuts and said the Republicans had admitted that Mr. Kasich was mistaken. "I can explain it, but I can't understand it," Mr. Brewster said of Mr. Kasich's assertions. "He apparently never read the amendment."
For his part, Mr. Kasich returned to the Budget Committee to assert that his view was correct, but that it was really a moot point anyway. His "illustrative" spending cuts were just illustrations, he said; once the entire Republican deficit-cutting package is in place, there will be more than enough money to finance tax cuts and obey Mr. Brewster's deficit-cutting strictures as well.
Indeed, Mr. Kasich's panel still intends to produce a five-year budget plan in May that cuts at least $400 billion more from spending, and place the Federal deficit on a path toward zero by the year 2002.
"You're arguing about nothing, folks," he told the Democrats.
Democrats accused Mr. Kasich and the Republicans of playing fast and loose with the figures. But Mr. Kasich asserted that it was the Democrats, and specifically the White House, that is playing a "carny game" with the deficit issue.
Mr. Kasich stressed today that the panel's $100 billion reduction is a "real" spending cut -- that is, it would require the Government to spend less in each of the next five years than the $546 billion it will spend on discretionary programs in this fiscal year.
By comparison, he noted, the White House used standard Federal budget forecasts, adjusted upward for inflation each year, in calculating the $30 billion in spending cuts that it proposed in its five-year budget last month. Under that formula, Mr. Kasich said, the Budget Committee's $100 billion reduction balloons to $191 billion, with the excess available to reduce the annual deficit.
"This package has $60 billion more in deficit reduction than in the entire President's budget," he said, adding later, "You ain't seen nothing yet."

HEADLINE: Still Seeking Cuts, Senate Votes Extra $1.9 Billion for Military

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
The Senate today approved $1.9 billion in emergency Pentagon spending for unexpected overseas missions, but the bill called for a similar amount to be cut from existing Pentagon programs.
The vote was 97 to 3 to approve the spending that military commanders say they need before the end of this month to avoid canceling training exercises and halting purchases of spare parts. 
 But under pressure to avoid adding to the Federal deficit, the legislators offset the request by cutting existing Pentagon appropriations, including $300 million from environmental cleanup at military bases, $175 million from research and $200 million from a Democratic plan to encourage military contractors to develop products with military and commercial uses.
Senior Defense Department officials said they were concerned that the Senate was setting a precedent that could endanger future military readiness.
"The department is willing to offset a portion of the supplemental, but a requirement to offset the full amount will do unnecessary damage to the important technology and modernization programs," Defense Secretary William J. Perry and Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a letter this week to senior members of the Senate and House Appropriations Committees.
The Defense Department's budget, $264 billion this year, goes to pay, train and equip the armed forces. The Pentagon must request extra money from Congress to pay for wars, peacekeeping operations and humanitarian missions.
What started as a straightforward Defense Department request for $2.5 billion to pay for unanticipated operations in Kuwait, Somalia, Cuba and Haiti has in many respects turned into a tussle between the House and Senate for bragging rights on deficit reduction.
The House last month approved $3.2 billion, including additional money for troop salaries, but offset it largely with a combination of cuts in military and domestic programs.
The Senate slashed the $670 million for training and salaries that the House added to the Pentagon's original request, then cut $600 million more from the Pentagon's request, and offset the remaining $1.9 billion with other Pentagon cuts.
In the same bill, the Senate also cut $1.5 billion from existing domestic programs not related to the military and earmarked those reductions for reducing the deficit.
Congressional aides said House and Senate conferees would meet next week to work out a compromise version. Even some influential senators expressed reservations with the Senate's approach.
"I am concerned about the precedent we may be setting in offsetting Defense Department dollars," Senator Strom Thurmond, the South Carolina Republican who heads the Armed Services Committee, said last week on the Senate floor.
Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, added, "A complete offset sounds good in speeches, but the effect will be readiness will go down."
Senators also attached to the spending bill two amendments unrelated to the military. One would require the Clinton Administration to report on a monthly basis, beginning April 1, on a wide variety of Mexican economic indicators and policies. The second would withhold American aid to Russia's atomic energy ministry if Moscow goes ahead with its plan to sell nuclear reactor parts to Iran.

HEADLINE: Destructive Tuition Hikes

 BODY:
Politicians in Albany have discovered to their distress that slashing state aid to New York State's public higher education system would require closing down programs and even campuses as well as stiff tuition increases. The Legislature thus appears ready to restore some of the disproportionate cuts imposed on higher education in Gov. George Pataki's budget. Whatever else is done, the priority should be to ease up on the huge tuition increases proposed by Mr. Pataki and academic leaders -- even if that means cutting academic programs.
Until this week, many fans of Governor Pataki's calls for austerity lulled themselves into thinking that state aid to the City University and State University of New York could be reduced by nearly a third, with savings achieved from painless tuition increases and a few snips here and there in the mythically bloated administrative bureaucracy. 
 In reality, of course, scrapping even the entire administration of SUNY or CUNY would not save the money needed. This week the state university trustees warned that even after painfully high tuition hikes, as many as eight campuses would have to be merged or closed and hundreds of programs eliminated or curtailed.
There is little doubt that in an era of terrible fiscal problems, both the city and state university systems can find places to cut, especially when there are duplicative programs on different campuses. Several two-year technology and agriculture schools scattered throughout the state could easily be consolidated, were it not that they provide jobs and resources in the districts of powerful Republicans in the State Senate.
What the Legislature must be careful to do is observe first principles. A tuition increase between $1,000 and $1,600 now on the table for the State University, where tuition is already $2,650, and the City University, where it is $2,450, would impose a terrible hardship on working-class and poor families and undermine the historic role of the university as a route up for the next generation.
The huge tuition hikes are especially cruel in light of parallel cutbacks proposed in financial aid to students. If there are to be curbs on financial aid, they surely should be restructured to avoid hurting those with the highest need. It makes no sense to eliminate all aid to part-time students when more than 40 percent of the City University's students are part-timers trying to get a college education while holding down jobs.
Access to quality higher education is one of the proudest traditions New Yorkers have. But mere sentimentality is not at work here. An educated work force is surely as crucial to the city's and state's economic health as lower taxes, the goal to which higher education is being sacrificed. Ambitious but needy families, including immigrants from Africa, Asia and parts of Europe, are working in kitchens, sweatshops and cabs in New York City. Cutting off their access is not only unjust. It is economically self-defeating.

HEADLINE: Javits Center Figures Blame Each Other

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

 BODY:
The former head of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and a local labor leader pointed fingers at each other yesterday for appointing two men said to have ties to organized-crime figures to head the carpenters union at the convention center.
Fabian Palomino, who until January served as chief executive officer of the center, told a State Senate committee that he had nothing to do with Anthony Fiorino's and Leonard Simon's becoming shop stewards --with responsibility for doling out high-paying carpenters jobs and negotiating labor contracts. 
 But Frederick W. Devine, president of the New York City District Council of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, said he appointed Mr. Fiorino and Mr. Simon largely on Mr. Palomino's recommendation. A Federal investigation has linked Mr. Fiorino and Mr. Simon to members of organized crime families and has alleged that they are using the Javits Center to provide employment to mobsters and their friends and family members.
The testimony from Mr. Palomino and Mr. Devine came on the first day of a Senate inquiry into corruption and mismanagement at the Javits Center, Manhattan's primary center for trade shows and expositions. After a long history of allegations and investigations surrounding the nine-year-old center, state officials have begun an investigation aimed at rooting out organized crime and lowering the exorbitant costs of producing trade shows there.
Addressing senators from the finance, tourism and labor committees, Gov. George E. Pataki said the center, which is operated by the state, is "failing as an economic engine." He noted that of $73 billion spent directly on conventions around the country each year, only 2 percent, or $1.6 billion, is spent in New York City.
Citing the Javits Center's administration and 13-member board as part of the problem, Mr. Pataki repeated his call for the resignation of the board. He nominated Robert Boyle, the former head of the Hudson Valley Hospital Center and Mr. Pataki's campaign treasurer, to replace Mr. Palomino as chief executive officer of the center. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo had appointed Mr. Palomino, an old friend.
Mr. Pataki also nominated Gerald McQueen, a former New York City detective who currently investigates labor racketeering in the Manhattan District Attorney's office, to become the center's inspector general. Both nominations require approval from the center's board, and Mr. Pataki is unlikely to place the nominations before the governing body until he has the people he wants on the board in place.
For the fiscal year that ended on March 31, 1994, the convention center had total operating revenues of $35 million, but posted a net operating loss of $1.1 million, compared with a loss of $17,000 in the previous year, according to a private auditor's report. Although the report was completed last July, it still has not been approved by the entire board.
Yesterday's five-hour hearing was scheduled on short notice, and there were times when that short notice and the legislators' little preparation were apparent.
While questioning Mr. Devine, who in recent days has come under fire from a Federal investigator monitoring organized crime in the carpenters union, the senators relied heavily on newspaper clippings despite the extensive detail in court filings that are on the public record concerning Mr. Devine and activity by the carpenters union at the Javits Center.
With his lawyer at his side, Mr. Devine said his union members were being unfairly blamed for the high cost of trade show and convention business in New York City.
The problem, he said, is not labor costs, but the wide cost margins that show managers and contractors set. "Don't ask my members to take less than a decent wage so that national and international companies can profit on the backs and sweat of honest, hardworking New Yorkers," he said. "The New Yorkers I refer to vote for you. The contractors from out of town don't."
Mr. Devine tried vigorously to distance himself from Mr. Fiorino and Mr. Simon, saying he knew little about them when he gave them authority for carpenter job referrals last year. According to Federal court papers, Mr. Devine sent an April 25, 1994, letter addressed, "To Whom it May Concern," giving control of hiring at the Javits Center to Mr. Fiorino and Mr. Simon.
Since that time, Kenneth Conboy, an investigator appointed as the result of a Federal racketeering case brought against the carpenters union, has presented evidence showing that Mr. Fiorino and Mr. Simon are both in-laws of men involved in the Genovese crime family. Further, Mr. Conboy has charged, Mr. Fiorino and Mr. Simon used their authority to give jobs only to people on a preferred list of about 100 workers, instead of to the entire union membership.
Neither Mr. Fiorino nor Mr. Simon were invited to appear before the committee. Though both men still work at the center they have not returned telephone calls seeking comment. Mr. Fiorino, court papers show, is the brother-in-law of Liborio Bellomo, the reputed acting boss of the Genovese crime family. Mr. Simon is the brother-on-law of Ralph Coppola, also a member of the crime family, court papers say. Mr. Devine told the Senate committee that if he's given proof "other than them being related to family members, I will remove them."
Mr. Palomino told the panel that an associate had warned him that the two shop stewards might have mob ties, but he had continued working with them and turned all mob-related intelligence that he gathered over to Mr. Conboy. He denied that he recommended that Mr. Devine make the two men shop stewards and insisted that he never even talked to them until "I got the letter from Devine."
Appointed in 1991 by Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Palomino has worked in the administration of three New York Governors. He vehemently denied accusations that he acted improperly in awarding contracts at the Javits Center without putting them out for competitive bidding.
"I wasn't running around looking to do business with my friends," he said. "Look, I never did that in my life."
Yesterday's hearing, held in the midtown offices of the State Power Authority, was the first of several that will explore the problems at the Javits Center and search for ways to rid it of corruption and to make it a more cost-effective and attractive venue for events.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani appeared before the panel and outlined several steps that he said the state should take to make the center competitive with exhibition halls in other cities.
Mr. Giuliani, a former prosecutor, said that a Federal racketeering case against the center was likely the most "comprehensive and expeditious" way to root out organized crime. Once the center is free of the mob, he said, it should be put in the hands of professional managers. Privately managed centers in San Francisco, Miami and Denver operate "at a much lower cost and greater efficiency than the Javits Center," the Mayor said.
He also noted that his recent attempts to attract the Republican and Democratic National Conventions made it clear to him that the Javits Center is not big enough to meet the space requirements for such large conventions.
Others who addressed the panel also noted that the Javits Center may eventually need to be expanded or another center like the Coliseum, renovated and reopened.

HEADLINE: Cortines Has Plan to Coach Minorities Into Top Schools

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN 

 BODY:
With white and Asian students dominating enrollment in the city's best high schools, Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines yesterday proposed opening a new math and science institute to coach 350 seventh and eighth graders, most of whom would be black and Hispanic, for the notoriously difficult entrance exams to Stuyvesant High School, Bronx High School of Science and Brooklyn Technical High School.
At Stuyvesant, a school nationally renowned for its academic excellence and the most selective of the three, only 4.8 percent of the students are black, down from 12.9 percent in 1979. Half the students at Stuyvesant are Asian, 40 percent are white and 4.3 percent call themselves Hispanic. Total enrollment at the three high schools is 10,145. 
 By giving special training aimed at enlarging the pool of black and Hispanic candidates eligible for admission to the selective schools, Mr. Cortines would avoid setting quotas, which are currently under challenge in several cities.
In San Francisco, for example, Asian parents have brought a Federal suit saying that racial quotas limiting Asian students to 40 percent of enrollment have kept some talented Chinese-American students from attending the city's best schools, even though their entrance test scores may have been better than those of students in other groups.
"I am not offering any free rides," Mr. Cortines said in a statement released yesterday.
Under the plan, to begin this summer, seventh and eighth graders will be selected by the superintendents of the 32 local community school districts, working jointly with the staff for the new program, which has yet to be hired. Many details have not been worked out -- for instance, there are plans to house the institute at one of the three elite high schools, but that is not certain.
Students will attend classes during the summer, and in some cases on weekends or after school, though they will get no extra academic credit toward admission. Classes will try to improve time management and study habits, as well as critical thinking and research skills. The staff will also work with students' families to help them support the rigorous academic exercises.
Mr. Cortines is not acting out of any mandate to make changes at the high schools, said Dr. Beverly Hall, the deputy chancellor for instruction, nor has he particularly felt pressure from community groups to offer such help. Instead, she said, Mr. Cortines is adhering to a plan he set when he became Chancellor in 1993 that the schools should be raising the standards for all students, regardless of race and economic background. (Mr. Cortines was on vacation yesterday and could not be reached for comment.)
Dr. Hall said Mr. Cortines and other officials studied data that showed students entered the specialized science schools more often from some districts than from others, and they concluded that poor preparation by teachers and socioeconomic pressures may be to blame.
District 2 in Manhattan, which includes the affluent Upper East Side, sent the most children to ninth grade in the specialized schools in September, and District 7, in an impoverished area of the South Bronx, sent the fewest.
"As educators, we have a responsibility to insure that every child has an opportunity to excel," Mr. Cortines said in his statement. "The data suggest to me that we are not meeting this responsibility."
And part of this may also have to do with the feelings of some black and Hispanic children about the specialized schools. On the sidewalk outside Intermediate School 54 on West 107th Street, some seventh and eighth graders said that they had never considered attending any of the specialized high schools.
"Why would I want to go there?" said Josue Mendez, a seventh-grader, referring to Stuyvesant. "It's a white school."
Students of any race and from any part of the city will be accepted at the planned institute, tentatively named the Math-Science Institute, but the emphasis will be on the districts that are now underrepresented at the specialized high schools.
"If we're talking about higher standards for all students, and if we believe that all children can learn and learn at the highest levels, then the question became, shouldn't we be addressing some of these problems?" Dr. Hall said. "These schools are considered among the finest schools in the country. Why shouldn't they represent the children of this school system?"
The school system is projecting that the cost of the institute will be $680,000 the first year, and $880,000 per year after that. The financing is expected to come from Federal funds or from private foundation money, she said, although that also has not yet been decided.
Reaction to the plan from parents and students was mixed.
Monique Little, a seventh grader who said she planned to apply to Brooklyn Tech, said that schools would be better environments for learning if all ethnic groups were better represented.
"It gives other races the opportunity to learn about each other," she said. "There's the stereotype that white schools are good and black and Hispanic schools like this are bad."
At Stuyvesant High School, in lower Manhattan, some students said the rigorous curriculum required students to be self-motivated as well as academically prepared.
Howard Hua, a 17-year-old senior from Manhattan, said that offering what he called a prep test program aimed at minority students was "reverse racism."
"If you're going to do it, you've got to do it for everybody," he said. "People who are here know they are here because they earned it. Doing something like this would change a lot of the academic scene here."
But his friend, Johnny Eng, 17, from Queens, said many Stuyvesant students do have the advantage of extra help.
"There are students here whose families are rich enough to pay for courses that helped them do better on the exams, and that gave them an unfair advantage, so this could even things out for others who can't afford something like that," Mr. Eng said.
Jamil Ellis, 17, the senior class president, who is black, said that offering a prep course to minorities, especially black students, was a good idea.
"Right now, the demographics of the school aren't representative of the city," he said. "Preparation for the exam is essential, and in some other districts that are predominantly black, the kids aren't as prepared as they need to be."
Stoney McMurray, whose son attends Brooklyn Technical High School, which has higher black and Hispanic enrollment than the other two schools, said that not all poor districts did a bad job of preparing children.
"There are some junior high schools that don't even tell their black and Hispanic kids about the exams and don't encourage them," said Mr. McMurray, a co-leader of the parent association at Brooklyn Technical. "But then, there are districts in poor minority neighborhoods that have run their own little courses to help them on tests."
Mr. McMurray said he worried that some white parents would see the institute as giving an unfair advantage to minority students.
"I don't feel that way," he said. "It really is a shame to waste the kind of mind that can do math or science. We need those folks, whatever they are and wherever we get them from."

HEADLINE: President of Serbia: A Pendulum Halted in Mid-Arc

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia

 BODY:
During a recent spell in prison, the leader of Serbia's extreme nationalist Radical Party taught wardens and other inmates rousing songs about the day President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia hangs from a pylon in central Belgrade.
"It was my best spell ever in prison," said the party leader, Vojislav Seselj, who was once a close ally of Mr. Milosevic. "The songs were really popular with the guards. One had a chorus about Milosevic hanging there and all his secret police were crying." 
 Ultranationalists like Mr. Seselj, who was imprisoned for spitting at the Speaker of the Serbian Parliament, are not strong enough to pose a direct threat to the Serbian leader. But their attacks are a reminder of the political distance traveled by Mr. Milosevic, who once used Mr. Seselj's volunteers to spread terror in Bosnia.
The contradictions of this political voyage -- from bellicose Serbian nationalist to calculating peacemaker -- are now closing in on Mr. Milosevic, leaving him in a state of unusual indecision, senior Serbian officials and Western diplomats say.
This uneasiness stems from the fact that the abandonment of virulent nationalism, an abandonment symbolized by the imposition of a blockade on the Bosnian Serbs last August, has not won Mr. Milosevic any new constituencies, leaving him increasingly dependent on repression to maintain his hold on power.
In recent weeks Mr. Milosevic, 53, has embarked on a ferocious attempt to stifle the remaining independent news outlets, especially through an attempted takeover of Belgrade's most important independent television station, Studio B.
The attack on Studio B follows that on the opposition newspaper Borba, and has been based on the same dubious allegation that the properties were never legally transferred to private hands.
Behind the onslaught there appears to lie a sudden concern that all dissenting voices should be silenced.
Business executives and politicians say Mr. Milosevic has also increased harassment of opposition parties and private companies through his police force, now thought to number as many as 130,000 armed men, and stepped up repression of ethnic Albanians.
"Milosevic is trying to centralize and control everything because he is nervous," said Zoran Djindjic, the leader of the opposition Democratic Party. "He abandoned the nationalist card that brought him to power but has no economic benefits to show in return. So he is tightening the police state because he does not know which way to turn."
The increased repression has come at a time when Serbia's economy, battered by sanctions, is showing signs of renewed inflation. Money-changers have abruptly reappeared on the street offering 1.7 dinars for a German mark, while the official exchange rate is one to one.
It is against this background that Mr. Milosevic was recently presented by the United States and Europe with a crucial choice: bring about the lifting of sanctions and shore up your economy by recognizing the international borders of Bosnia and Croatia, or remain in isolation with your thinly veiled ambitions for a Greater Serbia intact.
Officials close to Mr. Milosevic -- who, true to his reclusive style, declined to be interviewed -- say he was angered by the offer because he believes that his blockade of the Bosnian Serbs should have been enough to end the sanctions. Instead some minor concessions were made, including an opening of the Belgrade airport.
"The immediate lifting of all sanctions is the key question," said Vladislav Jovanovic, the Foreign Minister of Yugoslavia, which is dominated by the Serbs. "Serious negotiations are impossible until we have been placed on an equal footing."
Behind this official bluster, however, lurk deeper concerns. The fact is that Mr. Milosevic has to demand a lifting of sanctions without recognition of Croatia and Bosnia because recognition is an almost impossible political step for him at this stage.
Several Serbian and Western officials said that beyond the attacks by people like Mr. Seselj, there lurks a solid body of opinion in the army, in the police and in the population at large that simply would not accept the formal abandonment of the Serbs of Bosnia and Croatia that recognition would represent. Serbs currently hold 70 percent of Bosnia and 30 percent of Croatia.
"Milosevic now feels he cannot risk an all-out attack on Karadzic," a Western official said, referring to the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic. "He's a little nervous and surprised that he had been unable to deal with Karadzic. He turned the propaganda machine on him for a couple of months, calling him a scurrilous crook, but then he saw the lie of the land, especially in the Yugoslav Army, and he dropped it."
A sharp enmity now exists between Mr. Milosevic and Dr. Karadzic, who has become ever more outspoken in his support for the Serbian Orthodox Church, private enterprise and even the possible return of the Serbian royal family.
Banished from the Government-run television since last August, Dr. Karadzic has been appearing regularly on Studio B -- one possible reason for the attack on the station.
Thus, almost six years after Mr. Milosevic descended in a helicopter onto the sacred Serbian battlefield of Kosovo, where Serbs were defeated by the Ottoman Turks in 1389, and warned of the war he saw looming in Yugoslavia, he finds himself transformed from the acclaimed hero of a resurgent Serbia into the cornered strongman of a devastated country.
He is in no immediate danger because his police force is strong and intensely loyal, but his policies appear to have led his country to economic ruin and a political dead end.

HEADLINE: Ahmed Khomeini Is Dead; Son of Ayatollah Khomeini

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Ahmed Khomeini, a leading Islamic radical who was Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's son and a member of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, died yesterday at a hospital in North Teheran. He was about 50 and lived in the Teheran area.
Mr. Khomeini had been in a coma since Sunday, when he suffered cardiac arrest and was admitted to the hospital, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported. 
 One of his doctors said he died some hours after he was put on a life-support machine.
"He was a prominent face in the struggle against the oppressors," the news agency said, "and spared no efforts to safeguard the legacy of his immortal father." The Government announced two days of national mourning.
A torch-bearer for his father's anti-Western radicalism, Ahmed Khomeini was viewed as Ayatollah Khomeini's closest aide during the decade after the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Many speculated he might eventually succeed his father as Iran's political leader, but he lost a brief power struggle with the pragmatic Speaker of Parliament, Hashemi Rafsanjani, who was elected President after Ayatollah Khomeini's death in June 1989.
Mr. Khomeini instead became the overseer of his father's mausoleum south of Teheran and was named to the Supreme National Security Council, which oversees defense and security policy and coordinates intelligence activities.
As his father's chief of staff, Ahmed Khomeini played a prominent role in the Iran hostage crisis of 1979 to 1981, making tough anti-American statements and visiting the United States Embassy compound to congratulate the captors of more than 50 American hostages there. The hostage-takers were said to have told him in advance of their plans to invade the compound.
He spoke out frequently against the United States and Israel and what he described as exploitative Iranian capitalists.
In 1993 he denounced the peace accord signed by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization as "treachery to the aspirations of the Palestinian nation and the world of Islam."
Addressing himself to the United States during a speech last month marking the 16th anniversary of the Islamic revolution, he cried "Death to you!" as thousands of Iranian listeners cheered.
Mr. Khomeini also wielded influence over Iranian Government policy through allies in the Revolutionary Guards militia and in other centers of power.
News reports have suggested recently that he may have been connected to the Iranian Government's smuggling of military equipment and parts from Europe.
A Shiite Muslim cleric who held the religious title of hojatolislam, Ahmed Khomeini first came to international attention during the Islamic revolution that ousted the pro-Western regime of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlevi in 1979.
Television broadcasts showed him at his father's side when the Ayatollah returned to Teheran on Jan. 31, 1979, after 15 years in exile. The Shah's Government was toppled 10 days later.
As the Ayatollah's chief assistant and only surviving son -- two others had died -- Mr. Khomeini wielded immense power by controlling access to him.
He quickly assumed a prominent role when the hostage crisis began on Nov. 4, 1979. By some accounts militant Iranian students informed him in advance of what they originally planned as a sit-in at the United States Embassy.
Recalling the days after the takeover, Gary G. Sick, a White House aide at the time, later wrote: "It was with relief that we learned that Ahmed was on his way to the embassy. What we had not expected was that Ahmed would clamber excitedly over the embassy wall, losing his turban in the process, and congratulate the students for their action. As that fact became known, the deadly seriousness of the situation became apparent for the first time."
Scores of Americans in the embassy were held prisoner until early 1981, when the United States released more than $7 billion in Iranian assets and the captives were set free.
Later a former hostage, Robert O. Blucker, an embassy economics officer, described watching Mr. Khomeini visit the compound "to see the Persians and greet them and encourage them in what they were doing."
"He was fingering his worry beads and smiling and talking to them," Mr. Blucker went on. "He didn't want to look at any of us."
Mr. Khomeini asserted that documents found at the embassy showed that "some of the hostages are officially C.I.A. agents," and repeated a threat by his father to put some of the captives on trial for spying if the recently dethroned Shah was not returned to Iran.
Accounts of Khomeini family history vary, but the Egyptian editor Mohamed Heikal, in his book "The Return of the Ayatollah" (1981, Deutsch), and the Indian author Dilip Hiro, in his book "Iran under the Ayatollahs" (1985, Routledge), have written that Ahmed was one of eight children born to Ayatollah Khomeini and his wife, Khadijah.
Before the revolution, Ahmed Khomeini underwent military training in 1974 and 1975 with Palestinian fighters outside Tyre in Lebanon.
He is survived by his wife and three sons, of whom the eldest, Hassan, 23, is studying theology in Qom, a religious city 75 miles south of Teheran.

HEADLINE: Beliefs

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels 

 BODY:
Religion played a leading role in the story of the United Nations Conference on Population and Development, which was held in Cairo last August. The Vatican rallied Muslim leaders and some other religious believers to eliminate language in official statements that could have become the basis for an international right to abortion.
That jousting continued this week. The Religion News Service reported that for the moment, the Vatican had kept an American abortion rights group, Catholics for a Free Choice, and sister organizations in Brazil, Mexico and Uruguay from gaining credentials to September's World Conference on Women, to be held in Beijing. 
 But what about the United Nations World Summit for Social Development, which concluded in Copenhagen last weekend with fresh pledges from Vice President Al Gore and more than 120 other world leaders to eradicate global poverty? Was religion absent? Or was this a classic example of "no conflict, no news"?
Definitely the latter, said the Rev. Joan B. Campbell, General Secretary of the National Council of Churches, and William F. Vendley, Secretary General of the World Conference on Religion and Peace, two religious leaders who had been active at both Cairo and Copenhagen.
They pointed out that similar religious forces -- the Vatican, the World Council of Churches and an array of Muslim, Buddhist and other religious groups -- were represented at both gatherings. But this time the forces of faith agreed, with each other and their secular counterparts.
Muslim leaders, the Vatican and Hillary Clinton, who spoke at the meeting, all insisted that education for girls and young women was essential to economic and social development. Religious groups participating in a parallel conference of nongovernmental organizations were among the loudest voices calling for the forgiveness of poor nations' international debts. The Vatican converged with feminist lobbies, Ms. Campbell pointed out, in demanding that the economic value of women's work at home be recognized in the kind of economic statistics that underlie every nation's planning and policy making.
The conference on social development was "ready-made for people of faith," Ms. Campbell said. She noted that at the beginning of the gathering's official declaration and program of action, world leaders acknowledged that their societies must meet the "spiritual needs of individuals" as well as the material ones.
"The United Nations document read more like something from a church," she said.
Dr. Vendley suggested, by way of explanation, that when the United Nations tried to flesh out what it meant by a notion like "social development," it was "being forced into language familiar to religions" by addressing questions like "who are we?" and "where are we going?" and "what do we owe one another?"
The organizers of the Copenhagen conference even held a preparatory "Seminar on the Ethical and Spiritual Dimensions of Social Progress" last October in Bled, Slovenia. In this and other conversations that took place in connection with the gathering, Dr. Vendley sees the first steps toward "elaborating a positive vision of a common human destiny, although obviously in the appropriately this-worldly terms."
Much in these gropings toward a new vision is sharply at odds with the market-based, growth-oriented, technology-driven economic development plans that are in use.
"Our current dilemma is that we use a social development model when we state our intentions, but that we apply an economic growth model when we act," Konrad Raiser, General Secretary of the World Council of Churches, told a plenary session of the Copenhagen conference.
Of course, the resemblance of Copenhagen to the Sunday pulpit may also spring from the fact that exhortation, fervor and pledges are generally the stuff of such conferences.
Ms. Campbell wryly noted the parallel between the gathering and her own National Council of Churches, which can advise, prod, inspire and assist its 32 member churches but cannot tell them what to do.
Both Ms. Campbell and Dr. Vendley contrasted the charged atmosphere of Cairo with the urgent but cooperative mood of Copenhagen. At Cairo, the abortion debate created such acrimony that even a proposed prayer service aimed at healing the divisions was abandoned, Ms. Campbell recalled.
At Copenhagen three interfaith services were among the religious events marking the gathering. Still more significant was the formation by some of the world's largest Christian and Muslim relief organizations of a joint Committee on Interreligious Development Action.
The new committee, organized with the help of the World Conference on Religion and Peace, is taking a step beyond Christian-Muslim dialogue, said Kamel al-Sherif, who heads the International Islamic Council based in Cairo. "We are undertaking concrete projects in development and relief," he said. "Now we are getting practical."
The committee, which brings together Orthodox Christian, Protestant and Catholic as well as Islamic groups, is organizing a joint delegation to Russia to insure the flow of humanitarian aid to Chechnya, where Christians and Muslims, as in Bosnia and the Sudan, are divided by war.
"Religion has been exploited and misused to promote hatred," Mr. Sherif said. "It is time to present religion in its true spirit."
This initiative alone speaks volumes about the spirit of Copenhagen.

HEADLINE: G.M. to Delay Introductions of Several Vehicles

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that several new vehicles, including its next generation of mini-vans, would reach showrooms three to six months later than it had planned.
G.M. portrayed the decision as a result of a routine reappraisal of product schedules. But Wall Street analysts said G.M.'s seven-month struggle to introduce two new small cars had diverted engineers from the other vehicle programs, contributing to the delay. 
 Whatever the cause, the scheduling change will give G.M.'s competitors more breathing space in crucial market segments. The Chrysler Corporation, for example, plans to start selling a new mini-van this spring, and can now look forward to a year and a half without serious competition from G.M.
G.M. brought out its current line of front-wheel-drive mini-vans, including the Chevrolet Lumina, in 1989, and their doorstop shape never caught on.
Further, the later the new cars and trucks arrive in showrooms, the more likely that G.M. could find itself with more new vehicles than buyers, should the economy weaken.
But Wall Street analysts said that if the delay prevented in future introductions the kind of production problems G.M. has experienced lately, it would be a boon.
"They could rush the program, and then you end up with problems," said Joseph S. Phillippi, an auto stock analyst with Lehman Brothers in New York. "The delay is more than likely going to result in -- I would hope, I would expect -- in launching cleaner."
John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s president and chief executive, has made establishing a strict "cadence" for new product introductions a cornerstone of his turnaround strategy. Too often, he has said, G.M. postponed or canceled product plans when the economy went sour, allowing its lineup to grow stale.
While G.M. has managed new light-truck introductions without serious delays, it has had great difficulty bringing out some cars. G.M. began producing the new small cars -- the Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunfire -- last August, but executives say the plant where they are made might not reach full production before the third quarter of 1995.
G.M. denied that the scheduling changes would cause even short-term competitive woes. "We can assure you that our product lineup of offerings will be very competitive, in terms of their timing," said Linda Cook, a G.M. spokeswoman. "There were some minor adjustments made in a few programs, but no more than a few months."
She acknowledged that G.M.'s next generation of mini-vans was among those programs. The vans were originally set to arrive in late spring 1996, but are now unlikely to reach showrooms until fall 1996.
At a meeting with securities analysts near New York on Wednesday, G.M.'s top executives indicated that the new Pontiac Grand Prix would also be delayed from mid-1996 to late 1996, analysts who were present said. And an all-new model, the Chevrolet Malibu, is also likely to be delayed, since it shares a basic chassis with the two other vehicles.
David Healy, auto industry stock analyst with S. G. Warburg, said he had already expected the vehicles to arrive late. "It appeared to me that G.M had almost nothing for 18 months, and then a lot coming all at once, which sort of conflicted with the objective of a smooth regular introduction of new models," he said.
The bunching of new models at G.M. means that at least for the next two years, its "market share will tend to continue to drift down," Mr. Healy said.
But David Bradley, a stock analyst at J. P. Morgan, said that the new vehicles would be worth the wait. "They're stunning," he said after getting an early look at them.

'GM' Is Gone From Unit's Name
 (By Bloomberg Business News) -- LOS ANGELES, March 17 -- The General Motors Corporation said today that it had dropped its name from the GM Hughes Electronics Corporation, leading some analysts to speculate that the auto maker might be preparing to sell all or part of the military and electronics unit.
GM Hughes Electronics, which is based in Los Angeles, will now be known as the Hughes Electronics Corporation. In a second name change, the unit's military, electronics and information-systems business, the Hughes Aerospace and Electronics Company, will operate under the name Hughes Aircraft Company.
Industry analysts said that by dropping GM from the name, the company could be moving closer to selling the electronics unit.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Hits Low vs. the Yen And Mark Continues Surge

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled yesterday, falling to a record low against the Japanese yen in New York trading.
 The dollar was weakened by the continued advance of the German mark, which surged to record highs against the British pound, Italian lira and Spanish peseta. 
 When the mark rises against European currencies, it tends to rise against the dollar also, as currency dealers around the world buy the German currency. "The mark is again dominant in Europe, and that filters into the mark against the dollar as well," said Belal Khan, chief customer dealer at the Bank of Tokyo in New York.
 A surplus of dollars on the world's currency markets has also worsened the dollar's slide against the yen. And the slide has accelerated in the last two weeks as Japanese companies and funds sell foreign currencies -- and the dollar in particular -- for yen ahead of the close of their fiscal year on March 31.
 In New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 89.06 yen from 90.20 yen on Thursday, and the lowest late New York price since Wednesday, when it settled at 89.50. The dollar is near its intraday trading low of 88.76, which was touched on March 8. The dollar fell to 1.3865 marks, from 1.3965 marks on Thursday.
 The mark has gathered strength in recent months from continuing political uncertainty in Britain, Italy and Spain. As the currency of Europe's strongest and most stable economy, the mark typically benefits from political and economic volatility elsewhere on the Continent.
Yesterday's buying was also bolstered by a decision by the Bundesbank on Thursday to leave interest rates unchanged. Higher rates help a currency by making bank deposits denominated in it more attractive.
 The pound dropped to a low of 2.1872 marks late yesterday, from 2.2176 marks, in New York. The mark hit a high of 1,275.92 lire yesterday, up more than 60 lire from 1,213.96 lire, and a high of 93.45 pesetas yesterday, up from 91.92 pesetas.
 The central banks of Italy and Spain bought their currencies for marks in an effort to stem the rout, traders said.
 The market is rife with speculation that the peseta will withdraw from Europe's exchange rate mechanism, which prescribes trading bands for nine currencies.
 The currencies are allowed to move 15 percent in either direction from their assigned parity levels against other currencies. When they reach their outer limits, the countries' central banks must buy or sell them to keep them within their bands. Italy and Britain were forced out of the exchange rate mechanism more than two years ago.
 "The E.R.M. is unraveling," said Robert White, manager of currency trading at the Standard Chartered Bank in New York. "You have to question its ability to stay intact."

HEADLINE: Opening the Fed's Doors From Inside;
Alan Blinder Preaches Communication at Tight-Lipped Central Bank

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
What is most striking about Alan S. Blinder's large, sunny office at the Federal Reserve is how quiet it is. That's partly tradition. The men and women who set the nation's interest rates don't drop in on one another very often. But for Mr. Blinder, who came aboard last summer as the Fed's vice chairman, hoping to make his voice heard, the isolation was a big obstacle.
"I thought there would be more governor-to-governor chitchat," Mr. Blinder said in an interview. "I thought the staff would be walking in to my office more, telling me, 'You ought to know about this; you ought to know about that.' That happens to some extent, but not nearly as much as I had imagined it would." 
 Mr. Blinder found his impact inside the Fed largely limited to what he had to say at meetings of the central bank's policy makers -- meetings dominated by the chairman, Alan Greenspan. But he also took his case to the public, revealing in speeches and interviews the dynamics of the Fed's private policy debates. And gradually Mr. Blinder's influence is starting to be felt.
"My biggest disagreement with my colleagues at the Fed is over openness," Mr. Blinder said. "I believe we should talk to society more and say what we are doing and why we think it is right. But the position of this institution has always been to be extremely tight-lipped."
In breaking with that tradition, he has emerged as the highest official in Washington to publicly caution the Federal Reserve -- his colleagues -- against raising interest rates too much before it is clear to what extent earlier increases will brake the economy. In the past, the White House and Congress played this role. Mr. Blinder's efforts are aimed partly to offset pressure from bond traders who want more rate rises to fight inflation.
"Someone asked me during a recent speech, do I think we can ever achieve zero inflation," Mr. Blinder said. "I said, 'Absolutely, yes.' We can get there in only a couple of years if we are willing to pay the price. But I think if you put the question to ordinary people -- 'Would you like right now to have a recession like the one in the early 1990's to get inflation to zero by 1997?' -- you would be hard put to find a single vote. You can have a more moderate strategy, arriving more slowly with less pain."
Mr. Blinder's impact on the Federal Reserve's actual decisions -- as the first vice chairman appointed by a Democratic President since the 1970's -- is harder to measure. While his predecessors as vice chairman, David W. Mullins Jr. and Manuel H. Johnson Jr., were mainly inflation fighters like Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Blinder provides a different counterpoint. For him, unemployment and inflation should be of equal concern.
Most of the Fed's policy makers -- its governors and the presidents of its regional banks -- endorse at their periodic gatherings the decisions on interest rates their chairman favors. But one or two are beginning to acknowledge the influence of Mr. Blinder and of another Clinton appointee, Janet L. Yellen, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley who also became a Fed governor last year.
"Hopefully, when the time comes to move in the other direction and ease interest rates to avoid a recession, we will be able to move sooner than we otherwise might have," said a top Fed official who declined to be identified. "The Blinder-Yellen analysis may be part of that change."
But not yet. Mr. Blinder's first two attempts to buck rate increases fell short, Fed officials say. Last November, four months after joining the Fed, he argued unsuccessfully against Mr. Greenspan's proposal to raise short-term interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point. Mr. Blinder and Ms. Yellen instead favored an increase of half a percentage point, Fed officials said. Two meetings later, they reportedly argued against the half-point increase that the Fed's policy makers approved on Feb. 1.
"I believe the classic mistake of Fed policy is to not look far enough ahead and to overreact," Ms. Yellen said. "You have to guard against a possibility that we could say, 'Let's clobber the economy because it has not slowed down enough yet.' "
For all their resistance to higher rates, however, Mr. Blinder and Ms. Yellen voted with the majority in November and in February. "Dissent around here, any dissenting vote, is a big deal," Mr. Blinder said. "This is not like the Supreme Court, where you regularly get 6-3 or 5-4 votes. So you hold your fire until you feel you must shoot."
That dissenting vote almost certainly will not come at the next meeting, on March 28. Evidence in recent weeks of a slowing economy seems likely to keep the policy makers from making any changes in rates.
What's more, the talkative Mr. Blinder, who is 49, shares with the more solemn Mr. Greenspan, who is 69, a basic view that softens their differences. Rate increases are indeed necessary, Mr. Blinder says, when future inflation threatens. He had no problem, he says, with the Fed's rate increases through most of last year. And these increases should curb rising prices over the long run.
Where Mr. Blinder's differences with Mr. Greenspan show up is in the short run, the two or three years of hardship that rising interest rates often bring. Mr. Blinder argues that unemployment might rise to unnecessarily painful levels starting next year if he and his colleagues go too far now in their effort to slow the economy with rate increases.
Mr. Greenspan, as Fed chairman, has argued that whatever this risk, fighting inflation should be the primary goal -- a view he repeated in Congressional testimony this month.
There are other differences, which seem to work against Mr. Blinder's being considered for Fed chairman when Mr. Greenspan's term expires next year. While Mr. Blinder argues that reversing an increase in inflation is no more difficult than reversing disinflation and a declining economy, Mr. Greenspan says an uptick in inflation is the greater danger and the more difficult to reverse.
Mr. Blinder, the theoretician, relies heavily on computer models that demonstrate the long lags between changes in interest rates and their effects on the economy. Pay less attention to what is happening today, he says. The real impact on employment and inflation from the rate increases of the last year will not begin until months from now.
Mr. Greenspan, on the other hand, puts more faith in projections based on what he sees happening now in various crucial sectors of the economy, which is how he built his reputation as a private economist.
Finally, Mr. Blinder, an economics professor at Princeton University before he joined President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers in 1993, has not yet built the alliances within the institution that some of his predecessors had. Mr. Blinder's sway with his Fed colleagues is concentrated in the appeals he makes at the Fed's periodic meetings. They rely heavily on his skill as a theoretician, laced with what Edward W. Kelley Jr., a Fed governor, called Mr. Blinder's "wry sense of humor and a way of expressing himself that is really nice."
But Mr. Greenspan is the more skilled and experienced politician, having developed close ties over the years to the Fed's other leaders -- ties that Mr. Blinder lacks.
Mr. Blinder has instead taken his views much more to the public, offering to outsiders an insider's glimpse of the debate that takes place when the policy makers gather around the huge oak table in the closed-off board room at the Fed's headquarters. Although the Fed has gradually become more open in the last year -- announcing its decisions on interest rates, for example, on the day they are made -- there is resistance among the policy makers to going further.
Mr. Blinder has argued for an essay-style communique to accompany announcements of rate changes, instead of the two-sentence releases that are now the standard. Under current practice, the heavily edited minutes are only issued six weeks after each meeting.
But don't look for more detailed explanations on the day of decision anytime soon. Too much of each meeting, Mr. Greenspan has argued, would have to be devoted to writing carefully worded releases rather than to debating policy.
Still, Mr. Blinder plans to keep plugging away. "If the central bank makes good decisions," he said, "we should not have any trouble explaining them."

Mom-and-Pop Travel Agencies Fight to Survive

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

DATELINE: CLARK, N.J.

 BODY:
On one wall of the Travel Wise agency here are rows of glossy brochures beckoning adventurers to the Himalayas, lovers to the Caribbean and families to Disney World. And there are plenty of pictures of Hawaii, Europe and other places that also promise once-in-a-lifetime vacations.
 These days, vacations are something Carol A. Poppel, Travel Wise's owner, sends clients on but no longer takes herself. 
 Buffeted throughout the 90's by downturns in the travel industry, Mrs. Poppel has been the self-described "chief cook and bottle washer" at the agency for quite a while, putting in long hours and six-day weeks to make up for the two fulltime employees she had to drop several years ago. Lately, only one part-timer has been around to help her run the agency, which she has owned since 1977 and is one of five in this city of 15,000, some 20 miles south of Newark International Airport in Union County. Mrs. Poppel no longer even has the time to take advantage of the travel agent's greatest perk: the familiarization, or fam, trips that many resorts and other tourist destinations offer agents at big discounts.
 Now, Mrs. Poppel is trying to adjust to the latest pocket of turbulence to hit her industry: the decision early last month by the major airlines to put a cap on commissions. And while she thinks she will make it through this newest rough spot, others may not be so lucky.
 "For many agencies our size, this is definitely survival time," the 60-year-old Mrs. Poppel said the other day in her cheery storefront.
 Indeed, the American Society of Travel Agents, a trade group, has estimated that as many as 20 percent of the nation's 250,000 agents could lose their jobs as a result of the cap. Under the change, the traditional 10 percent commission on domestic air fares is limited to $50 for a round-trip ticket and $25 for a one-way fare.
 The trade group has plenty of reason to paint the bleakest picture, but it is unclear whether the situation is quite that dire. In any event, the group has filed an antitrust suit against the airlines and asked that the cap be lifted in the interim.
 Travel agents, particularly mom-and-pop operators like Mrs. Poppel, were having a tough go of it even before the cap.
 In the last three years, more than 7,500 travel agencies closed, victims of everything from the recession to travel jitters caused by the Persian Gulf war, and many others affiliated or merged with larger agencies to survive. Small, unaffiliated agencies like Travel Wise still outnumber the big ones -- there are about 32,500 agencies in all -- but they are the most vulnerable to the vagaries of the economy and to the growing incursion of electronic ticketing through on-line computer services.
 Now comes the commission cap, which threatens the bedrock of most agent relationships with customers: the free ride.
 "We don't have any choice but to charge fees," said Mrs. Poppel, who hasn't set a date yet for imposing them after years of running advertisements boasting, "No charge for our service." She added, "Except for our steady clients, we're going to have to charge for things like reissuing tickets, long-distance calls, sending faxes -- the kinds of services we always did for free."
 Industry giants like American Express/Thomas Cook and Carlson Wagonlit have already imposed some fees, followed by a growing number of smaller agencies. Some are charging for the booking itself. Even if the cap is lifted, fees for reissuing tickets and other loss leaders are likely to stay and spread, industry experts say, given all the other cost pressures in the business.
 The danger, of course, is that such fees will drive customers away, either to book directly with airlines and hotels or to do so electronically.
 For Mrs. Poppel, the commission cap crisis could delay her journey back to the high point of her business, in 1989, when Travel Wise had bookings of $1.03 million. Bookings declined every year since, until last year, when they started back up, along with the economy, and hit about $900,000. When this year began, Mrs. Poppel had hopes of reaching the $1 million mark again.
 Until the commission flap started, her cut of most bookings had averaged slightly more than 10 percent, with tickets for cruise ships and many international flights paying more. Out of those commissions, roughly $90,000 last year, Mrs. Poppel, who is divorced and the mother of two adult children, has to pay her overhead. That includes all those fee-free long-distance calls and faxes as well as the cost of her office and the salary of her part-time employee, Angela Beninato-DaSilva, who does the paperwork.
 Mrs. Poppel thinks she will be hurt less by the commission cap than will most other agencies because of the nature of her clientele. About 60 percent of her bookings come from corporate accounts, typically engineering, environmental and electronic companies with 5 to 20 employees whose travel budgets are too small to interest the big agencies.
 In general, the cap will fall heaviest on corporate air fares, since business travel is largely spur-of-the-moment and therefore does not qualify for advance purchase discounts. But because of their tight budgets, many of Mrs. Poppel's clients tend to be thriftier than other business travelers, making the imposition of the cap less of a jolt to her bottom line while keeping the clients eager for her services.
 "Carol gets us good deals," said Eric Kash, president of Organica Inc., an environmental technology company based in Great Neck, L.I. Organica had two employees when it started in January 1994 and now has 18, and it has done about $100,000 worth of business with Travel Wise.
 Still, Mrs. Poppel is nervous. There isn't that much she can do to generate more income. Much of the lucrative cruise business, for instance, is bypassing small traditional operators in favor of the growing number of agencies, more than 2,000 at last count, that deal exclusively with cruises and generally offer a better price.
 She got her foot in the door, however, with honeymoon trips, a specialty mentioned in many of the agency's ads. Booking the cruises and all-inclusive packages favored by honeymooners provides commissions far higher than on air fares alone.
 But whether the commissions are high or low, Mrs. Poppel said, she earns her keep by winning clients' loyalty, and she does that by scrambling to get them the best deals.
 Larry Kaimowitz of Rahway, N.J., said she did exactly that in planning his honeymoon to Tahiti this July. "We wanted to include a cruise, some time to see the South Pacific and some time to settle down," said Mr. Kaimowitz, who publishes The Commonwealth Courier, a Union County shopper. "She created an itinerary to match. She's very dollar-conscious, so most times she suggested options to save us money."
 But all that takes time. "You can't sit back and rest in this business," Mrs. Poppel said, as she juggled calls and pored over faxes amid all the bucolic images of beaches and mountains. "Especially now, when we're in the battle of our lives."

HEADLINE: Fiscal Monitors Say Plan For Budget Has Pitfalls

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
The state's Financial Control Board said yesterday that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had proposed significant steps toward straightening out New York City's finances. But it also warned that his plan to close a $2.7 billion budget gap relied heavily on risky assumptions and actions by the state that could fall through, forcing deeper cuts.
 In its report on the Mayor's budget plan, the board, which monitors the city's finances, also said the city faced persistent imbalances in the years ahead because spending would continue to outpace revenues, leaving future budget gaps that will require still more austerity. 
 The board's report underscored the severity of the city's nagging budget problems -- present and future -- despite $2 billion in cuts in the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, and the austere $30.5 billion preliminary budget that Mr. Giuliani proposed in February for the fiscal year that begins in July 1.
 The Mayor's preliminary budget would reduce total city spending by $1.3 billion, or 4 percent, the largest percentage reduction since the Great Depression, by cutting programs that affect millions of New Yorkers, including those for welfare, health care, foster care, education and sanitation.
 "I don't think anyone is fooling themselves that the problem can be solved in one year," said Jeffrey A. Sommer, the acting executive director of the board. "The Mayor has made that clear."
 In the near future, Mr. Sommer said, "There will have to be more cuts," but he added that the Mayor's preliminary plan addressed those, at least in general.
 In contrast to reactions to earlier reports of the board, the Mayor's office responded favorably yesterday. His budget director, Marc V. Shaw, said the report showed that Mr. Giuliani had confronted the city's budget woes head on.
 "It reflects the reality of the tough fiscal situation the city is in," Mr. Shaw said of the report. "And it was very positive in the sense that it complimented the Mayor in addressing that reality."
 In general, the board welcomed the Mayor's preliminary plan to close the $2.7 billion gap in the next fiscal year, saying it relied on far fewer one-time savings. In this fiscal year, the board said the Mayor has used $1.8 billion of these "one shots," including $395 million in savings by refinancing debt and $120 million from the sale to the state of two prisons the city built in upstate New York during the 1980's.
 But the report also noted that the Mayor's plan relied on $600 million in savings from the unions that must still be negotiated and nearly $1.4 billion in savings that require legislative approval in Albany.
 The savings from the state are far from certain. The Mayor, for example, hopes to receive $1.2 billion in savings by cuts in welfare and Medicaid, the cost of which are shared by City Hall and Albany. But Gov. George E. Pataki's budget would save the city only about $800 million.
 Thomas L. McMahon, the finance director for the City Council, which will negotiate the final budget with the Mayor, said the board's report failed to consider the impact on the economy of the state and city cuts in Medicaid and welfare, which, he said, could worsen the city's budget problems.
 "The Council is concerned that many of the proposals in the Mayor's gap-closing plan will have significant social and economic costs and should not be adopted," he said.

HEADLINE: Sports of The Times;
Stanford Finally Wins One

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY 

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
FIFTY-THREE years is a long time, even for people who take the long view. The scholar-athletes of Stanford University are currently taking exams in their hotel rooms here, and you'd like to think their subject matter is a bit weightier than "When was the last time Stanford won a game in the N.C.A.A. tournament?"
 You could even say it's trivia. But the year 1942 stuck in their minds, even though none of them was born then. 
 "I could have sworn I saw you in that picture," Darren Allaway said to his coach, Mike Montgomery, who wasn't born then, either.
 A lot of things happened between the time Stanford won in 1942 (you have a few seconds to come up with the circumstances) and yesterday, when Stanford beat the University of North Carolina-Charlotte, 70-68, in the first round of the national tournament.
This is what makes the first two days of the tournament such a delight, year after year. There is always an Old Dominion, Manhattan, a Miami of Ohio, to beat a higher-rated team, and there is always a Texas Southern to scare an Arkansas or a St. Peter's to push a Massachusetts, all of which happened on the first two days.
 Or it's a chance for a distinguished university like Stanford to break a 53-year streak, while its cone-shaped green mascot named Tree, wearing what look like $1.98 pajama pants, frolics on the court.
 Among the people who attended Stanford between N.C.A.A. victories were: Dianne Feinstein ('55), Ken Kesey ('59), Sandra Day O'Connor ('50), Sally Ride ('73), Charles Schwab ('59) and Sigourney Weaver ('72).
 With all that talent on campus, Stanford did not qualify for the tournament again until 1989, when it lost in the first round. It also lost in 1992. It did win the 1993 National Invitation Tournament, which, for the last few decades, hasn't meant that much.
 "I don't think about it," Allaway said about the N.C.A.A. gap. "Hank Luisetti -- he was on that team, right?"
 Nice try. Since it's exam week, how do we grade Allaway? Bear in mind, he's from London, the real London, and his pronunciation includes "we had a chawnce." So does he get a B for knowing that Hank Luisetti, the great all-American, even existed? Or does he get a C because Luisetti's last season was 1938? I'm going with the B.
 The first weekend of this national tournament is fun because all sorts of history and people and teams and fans and mascots come winging into an eight-team, four-game opening day. I wasn't aware that Jeff Mullins is the Charlotte coach until he materialized at a news conference. Check the ponytail on scrawny Mike Frensley of St. Peter's. Look at Edgar Padilla dunk for UMass. And watch Tree frolic on the court for Stanford.
 The Stanford mascot used to be an Indian, but in these politically correct days the mascot is Tree. "I think that I shall never see/A column written on a Tree." (Apologies to Joyce Kilmer.) And not only that, but a fighting Tree. Earlier this season, Tree duked it out on court with Oskie the California bear, and both of them got hauled off by the authorities. Tree is actually a sophomore from Chicago named Ari Mervis, and someday he'll be back for the Tree Reunion. There have been three, so far.
The Stanford basketball history is still evolving. This team still hears about the loss to tiny Siena in the first round in 1989. Montgomery took his players to work out in the Siena gym in nearby Loudonville the other day and suddenly realized what a big deal the upset was.
 Now it's up to Stanford to produce the upset. It gets Massachusetts tomorrow. The Stanford players rushed back to work on their papers and their exams yesterday, so they missed Massachusetts swatting St. Peter's, 68-51. But they're thinking big.
 "We can keep taking our finals on the road," said spindly Brevin Knight, the point guard from East Orange, N.J.
 It's a three-weekend endurance haul now. There's a lot of money involved. Stanford's last victory was for the championship in 1942. It was over Dartmouth, of all schools. According to the Stanford media guide, the entire gross for the 1942 tournament was $23,500. After deducting expenses, the champions' share of the booty was exactly $93.75. This year's swag will be slightly more. Sounds like a good economics paper for one of the Stanford players.

HEADLINE: Don't Spend $1 to Move Yankees to Manhattan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your March 9 article on the Yankees' dissatisfaction with the most recent plans by New York City for renovating Yankee Stadium highlights the absurd lengths to which the Yankees have been successful in dragging the city in their quest to build a state-of-the-art showplace. 
 For years the city has been advancing increasingly more elaborate schemes to transform the structure and environs of Yankee Stadium into a complex that would be more in keeping with the ambiance of Anaheim, Calif., or Central Florida than the Big Apple.
It is becoming clear that no renovation plan, no matter how sound, will satisfy George M. Steinbrenner 3d, the team's principal owner. It can be assumed that what the Yankees really want is a location in midtown Manhattan, most likely the type of structure former Gov. Marion M. Cuomo proposed last year.
As a native-born New Yorker who served last year on a committee organized by former Assemblyman John C. Dearie to keep the Yankees in the Bronx, I feel it is time for the city to put its final offer on the table without the possibility of a midtown location. Until the city makes clear that no midtown option exists, it is unlikely Mr. Steinbrenner will agree to any plan that calls for the team to remain in its historic home.
The Yankees are only worth the vast contemplated expenditure if they remain in the Bronx. As a cornerstone for a renewal that will improve the face of the South Bronx, the $600 million plan recently proposed would be justifiable in this time of massive city budget deficits. Spending that sum on the economically viable West Side of midtown Manhattan is not so justified.
There are alternative uses for that site more beneficial for the city, like housing, office development, entertainment or even recreation for average citizens. A midtown stadium site provides little in the way of return to New York that the city could not duplicate without the expenditure of $600 million or more of public funds.
The site discussed is one of the least accessible parts of Manhattan by public transportation. Indeed the Bronx site, located on two subway lines serving both sides of Manhattan, as well as large parts of the Bronx and Brooklyn, is easier to reach for New Yorkers.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani should no longer sacrifice the dignity of his office in playing along with Mr. Steinbrenner's endless games. If the price of sanity is to lose this once-fabled institution to the New Jersey swamps, that is unfortunate. But spending $1 to relocate the Yankees to Manhattan when city employees are being fired because of lack of money not only is questionable morally, but also makes no economic sense.

HEADLINE: Iraq Holding 2 Americans Seized Near Kuwaiti Border

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
The State Department said today that Iraq is holding two Americans who apparently strayed from Kuwait into Iraq by mistake earlier in the week.
The two civilians were working for an American company in Kuwait, Administration officials said, and were visiting friends near the Iraqi border when they lost their bearings. 
American officials said they did not know how the two men could have mistakenly crossed into Iraq because last year Kuwait built a 10-foot-deep, 16-foot-wide trench and a 13-foot-high rampart along its 130-mile-long border with Iraq.
Iraq's detention of the Americans is expected to aggravate already bitter relations with Iraq, which was defeated by an American-led coalition in the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
The United States has no diplomatic relations with Iraq and has taken the lead in maintaining severe economic sanctions on President Saddam Hussein's Government.
The Administration has succeeded in lining up a majority in the United Nations Security Council to overcome a drive by France, Russia and China to ease the sanctions that have wrecked Iraq's economy and imposed hardships on the Iraqi people.
The State Department said the United States Embassy in Kuwait had asked the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission to make inquiries in Iraq about the two Americans.
"We have also been in contact with Polish officials in Baghdad, who provide service to American citizens in Iraq," said David Johnson, a State Department spokesman.
According to American officials, the two men were arrested Monday night and the United States learned about their detention on Tuesday. One American official said the Administration was seeking to play down the arrests for fear that it would be harder to persuade Iraq to release the two should the episode blow up into a major confrontation.
The State Department said it had contacted the families of the two Americans, but refused to release their names for reasons of privacy.
Officials with the United Nations observer mission based in Kuwait told the Reuters news agency that the mission had been in touch with the Iraqi authorities to confirm the whereabouts of the Americans and to insure their safety.
Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, said, "The President has been following this and is satisfied that we are taking the appropriate steps to secure the expeditious release of the Americans."
A spokesman for the United Nations observer mission said the two Americans went to the mission's headquarters in the southern Iraqi town of Umm Qasr, but either turned back because they realized they were in the wrong place or were denied entry because they did not have the proper papers.
It was then that the Iraqi police seized them.
The United Nations mission in Iraq and Kuwait has been stationed along the border since the end of the six-week Persian Gulf war, which forced Iraq to end its seven-month occupation of Kuwait.
In the past, Iraq has charged some people who have crossed the border with espionage. Some have been released in less than a year; others have been held for eight years.
On the same day the two Americans were arrested, the United States succeeded in persuading the United Nations Security Council to vote to extend economic sanctions against Iraq.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 19, 1995, Sunday

An article yesterday about the arrest of two Americans at the Iraq-Kuwait border misidentified the country that built a trench there in some editions. It was Kuwait, not Iraq.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Market Mixed for Second Day in Slow Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities ended mixed yesterday for the second consecutive session.
Trading was lackluster, and a weaker-than-expected consumer sentiment report failed to draw many buyers from the sidelines. 
 The market was "dead, dead and dead as a doornail," said Charles Roden, managing director and head of fixed-income investing for Josephthal, Lyon & Ross.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 2/32 , to 1034/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, slipped to 7.36 percent, from 7.37 percent on Thursday. Other maturities were down slightly, with the exception of the 10-year note. The yield on the 10-year note rose 2 basis points, to 7.10 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Prices of Treasury bills were mixed.
The University of Michigan released its preliminary consumer sentiment index yesterday, and traders said the number was 91.8 for March, compared with 95.1 in February. Although the number was lower than expected, it had no apparent impact on the market.
"What you have here with the long-term bond at about the 7.36 percent level, is a market saying two things," Mr. Roden of Josephthal said. He said they were that the Fed would induce the economy to make a soft landing or would be forced to reduce rates if the economy fell into a real recession.
There is a tug-of-war in the market, Mr. Roden said, between those who still believe despite recent data that the economy is robust and that inflation is a threat and those who believe that the economy is landing softly or is headed for recession.
"My guess is that the Fed will not increase interest rates," Mr. Roden said. "They read the papers like we do. Inflation is not a threat, especially if the consumer is not going to buy."
But other analysts remain vigilant for signs of accelerating inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income investments like bonds.
Eugene J. Sherman, director of research for M. A. Schapiro & Company, said he expected the Fed would tighten "probably three more times this year and that the whole scale of interest rates is headed higher."
He said the rate of growth had slowed in the first quarter but that the slowing would prove to be temporary. "We anticipate a snapback in the spring," he said. "Inflation, in contrast, appears to be accelerating, and that is likely to be longer lasting."
By the time the Fed's policy-making committee meets on March 28, he said, there will be enough new data showing strong growth and a pickup in inflation "so that the Federal Reserve will be duty-bound to tighten once again."
In the municipal market, yields remained low yesterday as demand from mutual fund investors offset concern that bonds were too expensive. Investors continued to buy bonds amid expectations that securities would be harder to find later, with new sales down 60 percent this year so far and demand for tax-exempt paper constant.
For example, this week insured general obligation bonds with a maturity of 10 years showed a Bloomberg Fair Market Value yield of 5.34 percent, down 12 basis points from the previous week.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 20, 1995, Monday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Saturday about trading in the bond markets misstated the date of the Federal Reserve meeting at which one analyst expects interest rates to be raised. Eugene J. Sherman, director of research for M. A. Schapiro & Company, said he expected the higher rates to come at the Fed meeting of May 23, not at the one on March 28.

HEADLINE: FILM;
The Oscars Upstaged (Almost)

BYLINE: By ALJEAN HARMETZ 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
IF 1994 WERE A MOVIE, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN called "Revenge of the Little Ones." Thirty-three Academy Award nominations this year -- including two for best picture, two for best actor, all five nominations for best supporting actress and all five for original screenplay -- went to films that were not made by the major studios. And that's not counting all five nominees for best foreign-language film. Paramount Pictures, a major studio with 17 nominations, had to settle for second to scrappy Miramax, an independent that had 22.
Those nominations and the box-office success of movies like Miramax's "Pulp Fiction" and Gramercy's "Four Weddings and a Funeral" have pushed independent films, not for the first time, into the spotlight. Paradoxically, this has happened when the line separating studio and independent has become blurred. 
 Miramax, the feistiest and most successful of the independent companies, was purchased a year ago by Disney. New Line has been bought by Ted Turner. Universal is a co-owner of Gramercy. And 20th Century Fox has just created Searchlight Pictures, which will make movies aimed at sophisticated adults.
When the nominating committee for the independent film world's top prizes -- the Independent Spirit Awards -- met last December, its toughest decision was not which movies to nominate but which movies to make eligible. "Because of the murkier origins of films today, the board looked for solutions that didn't cut off one's nose to spite one's face," says Geoffrey Gilmore, the director of the Sundance Film Festival, who was the chairman of the Spirit Awards nominating committee.
One solution was to throw out the standard definition of an independent film: that it was not financed by a major studio. Instead, the new regulations allowed the committee to consider "percentage of financing from non-studio sources," along with "uniqueness of vision," "economy of means" and "original, provocative subject matter." Among the movies declared eligible were New Line's "Dumb and Dumber," Woody Allen's $19 million "Bullets Over Broadway" and "I Like It Like That," a low-budget first feature that was made by a major studio, Columbia Pictures.
The Independent Spirit Awards (which are administered by the Independent Feature Project/West) are handed out two days before the Oscars, an act of self-promotion that may be unnecessary this year. The ceremony on Saturday, to be held in a tent on the Santa Monica beach, sold out its $10,000 tables and $125 tickets immediately.
"Ten years ago, the I.F.P. director used to pop her own popcorn and take it to our screenings in an effort to get people to come see independent films," says Dawn Hudson, director of the Independent Feature Project (I.F.P.)/West. "The Spirit Awards used to be 200 people crammed into a restaurant. Now we've sold all 1,100 tickets and have a waiting list." The event is sponsored this year by the Independent Film Channel, Bravo, Entertainment Weekly magazine and Panavision.
Portions of the event will be broadcast on March 27 on the Bravo cable channel, during commercial breaks in the Academy Award telecast. Among the actors who will present Spirit Awards this year are Bridget Fonda and Linda Fiorentino.
After 10 years of handing out awards, however, the Independent Spirit can hardly be mistaken for the Oscars. Although Oscar nominees like "Bullets Over Broadway" got four Spirit nominations and "Pulp Fiction" got five, "Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle," which also got five, was nominated as best picture by the Spirit Awards, and shut out by the Academy. "Eat Drink Man Woman," which got only one Academy nomination, for best foreign-language film, led the Spirit nominations with six, including best picture. And the fifth film nominated for a Spirit Award for best feature, "Wes Craven's New Nightmare," would never have crossed the collective mind of the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
First-time film makers are not required to compete against Woody Allen and Quentin Tarantino at the Spirit Awards, which hand out prizes for best first film, screenplay, director and performance. Nominees include "Clerks," which Kevin Smith made for $27,000. Mr. Smith is now shooting his second movie, the $10 million "Mall Rats," for Gramercy Pictures. The movie will star Shannen Doherty.
"The purpose of the I.F.P. was -- working within the belly of the beast -- to foster the kind of film making that was outside the studio system, that worked forward from a passion rather than backward from a deal memo," says Howard Rodman, a screenwriter and former I.F.P./West board member. "Now, at festivals like Sundance, the studios view independent film makers as a farm team. The industry is always looking for people who make inexpensive, interesting films so they can offer them employment on films that are neither."
The blurring of the line between independent films and studio movies is exhilarating to Harvey Keitel, an actor who has usually chosen the lower salaries and more complex characters that are the bailiwick of independent films. "The idea is to synthesize the spirit of the independent with what the majors have to offer," says Mr. Keitel, who will be seen next summer in Miramax's low-budget "Smoke" and in Universal's not-so-low-budget "Clockers," directed by Spike Lee. "Don't forget that Tom Pollock of Universal made 'The Last Temptation of Christ' six years ago when nobody else would."
That same blurring of the line disturbs Haskell Wexler, a two-time winner of the Oscar for cinematography who shot John Sayles's new independent film, "The Secret of Roan Inish." "Studio films are filtered through marketing, bankers and completion bond people. They're made the way a product is made, not unlike what you'd find in a grocery store. In 'The Secret of Roan Inish,' John and I talked about the transformation of the seal into a woman and decided we'd do it without any digitalizing or effects. That was a crucial decision, but there were no cables back to Hollywood and no tests we had to run for anyone."
Is the rise of the independents something new, or is it part of a cycle? In Hollywood, ideas are constantly being raised up, only to be cast down again. Westerns fall out of favor, and then they're hot. Science fiction nearly disappears and then becomes trendy again. Twelve years ago, the major studios formed classics divisions to make and distribute smaller, artier films. Within two years, all but one of those art-film wings had failed.
"IT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT now," says Tom Rothman, who was wooed away from the Samuel Goldwyn Company to create Searchlight Films for Fox. "Because the baby boomers are getting older, the audience for these films has expanded substantially. 'Much Ado About Nothing' did $25 million in America and $50 million worldwide. 'Four Weddings,' a $4 million British picture, is going to do over $250 million worldwide. It's not a fad. It's a change."
Other factors cited by Peter Chernin, chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, include the growth of video and cable television and the building of new movie theaters in Great Britain and elsewhere, which are attracting "older, better educated and more sophisticated audiences" bored with studio fare.
Hollywood films often fall victim to a pedestrian repetitiveness -- what Mr. Wexler calls "vacuity" -- because they are based on high concepts and stale formulas. In 1989, three independent films excited Hollywood: Steven Soderbergh's "Sex, Lies and Videotape," which became a commercial success, and Gus Van Sant's "Drugstore Cowboy" and Michael Lehmann's "Heathers," which did not. Over the next few years, the quality of such Spirit Award winners as "The Grifters," "Rambling Rose" and "The Player" made mainstream studios hungrier for smarter movies -- as long as they could be made and marketed cheaply enough to insure a profit.
"The independents are usually out there forging into new territory, and then everybody jumps on the bandwagon if they think they can make a buck," says Victoria Wozniak, a founder of the I.F.P./West and the director of "Purple Haze," which won the grand prize at Sundance in 1983. Ms. Wozniak and Greg Nava (who directed "El Norte") had already founded the I.F.P./West a year earlier so that maverick film makers could share information. "If one person could figure out where to get the money, how to sell their movie, it would be cool," says Ms. Wozniak.
Martha Coolidge, the director of "Rambling Rose," says the difference between then and now is apparent in the fact that she is currently finishing a $30 million movie, "Three Wishes," which stars Patrick Swayze and will be distributed by an independent, Savoy. That sum is about average for studio-made films.
"If the small movie were to become the purview of the studios and they start dictating everything from casting to hair styles, the diversity of film making would be severely limited," she says. "But if the studios buy small companies and keep them entities with artistic autonomy, it's not a bad thing."
Ms. Coolidge pauses, then adds, "So long as it's not a mass group grope that messes up the movie."

HEADLINE: Golf Courses Proliferate, But Welcome Isn't Assured

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

DATELINE: WEST NEW YORK, N.J.

 BODY:
PING. The sound is everywhere these days. Even here, hard by the Hudson River, with the Manhattan skyline looming like a scoreboard, on a blustery, bone-chilling March afternoon.
"It's like this every weekend," said David Borngesser, the manager of Port Imperial Golf Center, a deluxe two-tiered driving range, putting green and miniature golf course that can be reached by ferry from Manhattan. "Sometimes even at lunchtime during the week." 
 There was a time, not long ago, in the 60's and 70's, when golf seemed to be fading in fashion, if not in the actual number of players then at least in the national sports consciousness. Weekend athletes whacked tennis balls; they wore out running shoes; they aerobicized; they Nautilusized.
Golf was a game for middle-age suburbanites tooling around in canopied carts.
Then, when land prices soared, some real estate developers subdivided courses, both potential and existing, into more lucrative housing and office projects.
By the late 1980's and early 90's, though, the sport's appeal appeared to be resurging -- to the chagrin of some environmentalists and non-golfers who apparently fail to see beauty in a fairway.
Suddenly, baby boomers -- including large numbers of blue-collar workers and women who had shied away from the game in the past -- had become golfers (and middle-age suburbanites).
"We fully expect that the trend in golf courses is that they will increase over the next few years," said Richard L. Norton, vice president of operations for the National Golf Foundation in Jupiter, Fla. "Golf is a game you can play at any age, and as the baby boomers move into retirement and preretirement, we expect them to play more golf."
Indeed, lines of die-hard duffers routinely queue up in the predawn hours on weekends these days at many public courses in the New York area, even though 22 courses opened in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and eastern Pennsylvania in 1994 and 45 more are under construction.
Thanks to heated stalls, driving ranges are also often packed year-round, sometimes from dawn to dusk and, thanks to lights, into the wee hours in some places. The number of ranges in the nation has increased in the last year by 9 percent to 1,731, almost triple the number in 1990, according to Golf Range & Recreation Association, a Manhattan-based trade group. A new four-tier, 52-tee driving range and learning center is scheduled to open this fall on 18th Street and the Hudson River in Manhattan, as part of the Chelsea Piers sports complex.
"We expect growth to continue in the 5 to 8 percent range for the next five years or so," said Steve di Constanzo, founder of the Golf Range & Recreation Association. "There is a little bit of a consolidation going on, however, as smaller ranges are being sold for better or higher use.
"The most dramatic development has been larger or more full-service practice facilities that combine teaching programs, some pro shop sales and some family entertainment, such as miniature golf and batting cages," he added. "The industry is maturing."
THE boom in golf is evident in the number of new players; there were about 24.5 million golfers in 1993 (the latest figure available) compared with 23 million in 1988, according to the National Golf Foundation.
"I never ever thought I'd play golf," said Marla Glick, teeing up a shot at the Port Imperial Center. Ms. Glick is 31 years old, lives in the West Village in Manhattan and plans to soon open a small restaurant.
"I thought, what a waste of time, tearing up land just so people in funny clothes can hit a ball in a hole," she added, smacking a drive in the general direction of the Upper West Side.
Not everyone, though, is enamored of the increase in golf-related development. Some environmentalists complain that chemicals used to irrigate courses can pollute groundwater, or, in the arid Western states, that courses use too much water.
Mr. Norton, however, said that most of the environmental concerns are largely unfounded. "They have been addressed by recent research conducted by the U.S. Golf Association and the findings indicate that when chemicals are applied appropriately, the impact is negligible on the environment," he said. "Golf courses are good for the environment."
Some conservationists, however, believe that even if golf courses don't pollute the groundwater they visually scar the landscape, turning it into an ersatz environment, a sterile substitute for nature.
Mr. Norton scoffed. "Golf courses are some of the most beautiful landscape that you are going to ever find, and that is borne out repeatedly by market research," he said.
Nevertheless, examples of the conflicts between golf developers and local residents abound. In East Hampton, L.I., for example, some residents are trying to stop a local sand-pit owner, Barry Bistrian, from building an 18-hole course on land his family owns in the Springs. Some opponents fear pollution. Others fear increased traffic and a potential change in the area's bucolic quality of life. They also note that the East End of Long Island is already crowded with golf courses; there are 40 public courses and 30 private courses in Suffolk County.
The Bistrian family plans to go ahead with the project, which has received the necessary approvals from local officials, and possibly open the public course by sometime next year. "The alternative here is to build 57 homes," Mr. Bistrian said, adding that there may be many courses in the area but there are also many golfers and many early-morning lines.
At the 578-acre Liberty State Park in Jersey City, nongolfers have fought plans to build a course on 150 acres of undeveloped land, even though greens fees from the course would be used to provide a playground and other amenities at the park.
Critics of the plan contend that the land would be put to better use if the entire area were turned into a park with free playgrounds, lawns and meadows, gardens and picnic groves, especially considering the need for such space in heavily urbanized Jersey City and Hudson County.
"They, in essence, would like a family park funded with taxpayer money, and could care less if it takes 10 or 20 years to develop those facilities," said Peter L. Ylvisaker, president of the Liberty State Park Development Corporation, a nonprofit organization created 10 years ago to finance the development of the park. "We, on the other hand, have developed a consensus for a project that includes a golf course, which is a revenue-generator."
"It will complete the greening of Liberty State Park, and provide the amenities people want, and do it immediately," he continued. "We're sort of mystified as to what all the fuss is about. Some people say it's not in the spirit of Ellis Island. Well, when people arrived at Ellis Island, it was a mess."
A decision on whether the course will be constructed is expected from the Governor's office this spring.
OTHER parts of New Jersey have been more welcoming to golf courses. Two years ago, Sussex County, in the rural northwest corner of the state, started an initiative called the Sussex Golf Preserve.
Initiated by a nonprofit group, the Sussex Golf Preserve Foundation, its aim is to promote private investment in open space recreation and economic growth to the area by building 15 to 20 golf courses and related projects in the county by the year 2007.
One course is already under construction -- the Black Bear Golf and Country Club in Franklin -- and four more are planned.
"The theory is that with the baby boomers and the seniors that are going to live a lot longer, there is a tremendous demand for golf," said Davis R. Chant, a real estate agent in neighboring Milford, Pa., who is active in the Sussex County golfing community. "It's an activity that almost anyone can take part in. People will drive an hour to two hours to go to a golf course."
He added that the Sussex County courses would offer a refuge for golfers who wait in long lines at odd hours at suburban courses.
"There are also many people, empty-nesters, who may choose to trade down and move here to be part of a golfing community," he added. "They are the same people who might have a winter place in Hilton Head or Myrtle Beach, so they can golf all year around. Golf people are like that. They are almost fanatical."
Golf course development, however, is not cheap, especially considering that a full-size 18-hole course requires at least 140 acres of land, and often additional acreage. The land often includes water hazards, woods that cannot be cut down and other landscape elements that cannot be disturbed.
With land in the suburban New York area often costing about $100,000 an acre, that means that the land costs alone for a golf course are, generally, at least $7 million. Many courses are also part of larger "golf communities." About 12 percent of all golf facilities today are associated with residential or commercial real estate development. In 1993 alone, about 34 percent of the new courses built included housing or offices.
THAT figure is higher than in 1992, when it was 27 percent. It is, however, lower than in the mid and late 80's when it was about 50 percent. "It has decreased from what it was in the roaring 80's," Mr. Norton said. "We had so many planned communities built in the 80's, and a lot of them had golf courses as real estate amenities, and during the 90's you saw it become hard for large communities to get funded.
"So, we are seeing more golf courses being built because they make economic sense, rather than just to sell real estate," he added.
Still, golf communities remain popular, particularly in suburban areas, like Westchester County, where there are 40 private and 6 public courses. In Harrison, N.Y., ground was broken in late 1993 on a 73-home, Jack Nicklaus-designed, 18-hole, 7,100-yard championship course complex called the Country Club of Purchase.
"The town is looking forward to getting it on the tax roll," said Harrison Town Attorney Bob Weinginger.
Falling land prices in the late 80's and early 90's have helped make golf courses more appealing to some developers. In fact, the 12-acre Port Imperial golf center, which has 90 tee stations, half of which are heated, is a temporary facility; it was constructed, for under $2 million, in 1990 as an interim use for part of a 250-acre tract of riverfront land in Weehawken, N.J., and West New York. The developer, Arcorp of North Bergen, N.J., had hoped to build 800 to 1,000 apartments and offices on the property.
"The market collapsed," said Arthur Imperatore Jr., a vice president at Arcorp, which bought the property in 1981 for $7.5 million and also owns and operates the New York Waterway ferry service.
"So, we thought about it," he said, "and we felt that there was a great demand for a golf facility in the area, and it could be done easily and quickly and enhance the value of the surrounding property."
"The highest and best use for the property is still residential, and at some point it will be redeveloped," he added. "But for the foreseeable future it will be a golf range."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/United Nations;
Other Cities and Countries Woo the U.N.'s Agencies

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
IT must be a strange feeling: courted by so many, yet still waiting for concrete overtures from the one whose courtship would be most welcomed -- and, in fact, most expected.
That is the position that many United Nations agencies find themselves in these days. Bonn, facing the specter of empty buildings as the German Government moves to Berlin, wooed Unicef, and now is wooing the United Nations Development Program. Vienna and Geneva have made rich offers to agencies as well. 
 In the United States, New Rochelle, which almost snagged Unicef in 1993, has made it amply clear it would welcome other agencies. So have Atlanta, San Diego and San Francisco, although lack of support from the United States Mission to the U.N. has kept them from making a full-court press.
And then there is New York City. The administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has scuttled a plan to elicit bids from private-sector companies to do a study, to be jointly financed by the city's Economic Development Corporation and the state's Urban Development Corporation, to delineate the United Nations' needs.
"The Mayor recognizes that the U.N. is a multimillion-dollar contributor to the city's economy, but the planned study was not cost effective," said Clay B. Lifflander, the Economic Development Corporation's chief. He says that this fall the city will unveil a plan for "addressing the U.N.'s needs into the 21st century." But such promises do not mollify all U.N. officials.
"We are paying $10 million each year in New York rent, and we are outgrowing our facilities," said Kerstin Leitner, acting director of the U.N. Development Program's division of administrative and information services. "You'd think the city and the state would try to make our lives easier."
The growing isolationism in Washington is not helping matters, either. "The mood in Congress is not favorable to things U.N.," said James P. Rubin, a spokesman for Madeleine Albright, the chief United States delegate to the U.N. Mr. Rubin says that Ms. Albright plans to give speeches pumping up the importance of the U.N. in at least six cities where isolationist feelings seem to run high. Another U.N. official said that Ms. Albright had been prodding Mayor Giuliani into "being more proactive in keeping the United Nations here."
The question of U.N. facilities is coming into sharp relief now for a host of reasons. In July the Ford Foundation issued a study called "Renewing the United Nations System" that recommended that the U.N. concentrate its offices, currently dispersed around the world, in one location. But the study made it clear that New York was not the only location that would do.
The U.N. itself is for the first time studying its own costs and administrative methods. Some of its largest agencies are exploring whether they would be better off owning their buildings rather than paying exorbitant rents in some high-cost countries, particularly in Latin America and Africa.
AN informal committee, spearheaded by Nicholas Sardegna in the Secretariat, is taking a similar look at costs in New York. The committee will probably try to determine how to finance repairs to existing U.N. buildings, and how to handle a growing shortage of back-office space and housing for U.N. employees.
Local developers are not waiting for such studies to be completed. Albanese Development says it is negotiating with a foreign government to build it a 23-story mission at 871 First Avenue, opposite the main U.N. buildings. The mission will own the building.
David A. Falk, a Williams Real Estate senior managing director who handles leasing for 801 Second Avenue, at 43d Street, has stepped up marketing to foreign missions. He already has three -- Haiti, Madagascar and St. Vincent -- and he says he is negotiating with two more, who are now located about five blocks away. "They really want to be around the corner from the General Assembly," Mr. Falk said.
City officials cannot take such locational preference for granted, as the close call with Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund, proved. "Unicef took the offers from Germany and Austria and New Rochelle very seriously, and that made New York take the fact that Unicef might leave seriously," said Peter C. Roberts, a senior vice president with La Salle Partners who, during the Unicef negotiations, was an adviser to the United Nations Development Corporation, the quasi-governmental group that handles U.N. real estate.
Former city officials remember it that way, too. "Until Unicef really put itself in play, the city always looked at the U.N. and its agencies as a captive industry," recalled Carl Weisbrod, Mr. Lifflander's predecessor at the Economic Development Corporation.
Unicef's seeming willingness to defect has kindled other cities' interest in U.N. agencies. New Rochelle went after the Development Fund and the Population Fund when Unicef decided to stay in New York. Joseph G. Madonna, New Rochelle's development director, says his city was ready to set up a United Nations district, large enough to accommodate five large agencies, and offer free buses to Manhattan.
Mr. Madonna says that a U.N. oversight committee twice concluded that New Rochelle's proposals were more economical than Manhattan's counterproposals. "We just could not counteract the intensive lobbying by the U.S. Mission to keep the agencies in New York," Mr. Madonna said.
Within New York City, internecine warfare for U.N. business may cause divided loyalties. Manhattan developers and officials want the U.N. to expand within the borough. Queens Borough President Claire Shulman wants the U.N. to expand across the East River, to the state-owned Queens West development, which could easily be linked by ferry to United Nations Plaza.
"There shouldn't be these artificial borders between boroughs," said Rosina K. Abramson, an attorney who resigned last month as president of Queens West and now practices development law. "New York must show the U.N. that its resources go beyond a square mile of Manhattan."
Real estate industry sources who insisted on anonymity say Queens West people have, in fact, actively pursued two agencies, the Population Fund and the International Training and Research Institute. Vincent M. Albanese, the developer who also is chairman of the Queens West Development Corporation, denies that he is soliciting agencies. But, he adds, "When we hear of an agency that is looking to move, we certainly will contact them."
Chances are good that, despite the studies and grumblings, New York will remain the hub of U.N. activity. No one seriously suggests that the General Assembly will move, and administratively, it makes sense to cluster all U.N. activities around that body.
"It helps if everyone is a local phone call away," said Bruce Russett, director of Yale University's U.N. Studies Program.
MOREOVER, despite appearances of apathy, New York is unlikely to let the U.N. go without a fight. No mayor wants to preside over the departure of any part of a body that means so much to New York's reputation as an international center and that provides $1.2 billion a year in revenues.
Past and present city officials say that Mayor Giuliani's administration would combat any threatened defection today as quickly as the former administration did when Unicef threatened to move. At that time the city let the U.N. Development Corporation take title to the Unicef building at 3 United Nations Plaza. City officials also helped facilitate a deal in which the Development Corporation will buy 18 floors of condominium space for Unicef at 633 Third Avenue, the building that Travelers Insurance owns at 40th Street.
The deal obligates the Development Corporation to take several more floors now occupied by the Mobil Corporation if Mobil does not renew its lease, which expires in 1998. And, it gives the Development Corporation options on several other floors.
"We could certainly find other U.N. agencies to take that space," said Thomas Appleby, president of the Development Corporation. (Another possibility: The state's Urban Development Corporation, currently at 1515 Broadway, is seriously considering moving to 633 Third Avenue, to one of the floors that Mr. Appleby's group would otherwise be contractually obligated to buy.)
For U.N. agencies, ownership is key. While they pay taxes on space they rent outside the U.N. district, they are exempt from taxes on property they own.
That might be a moot point if Washington agrees to requests to add more buildings to the U.N. District, which already includes some isolated buildings outside the official territory of 42d to 48th Streets, from the East side of First Avenue to the F.D.R. Drive. And, although no city official will say that the city would exercise eminent domain to force existing tenants out of space that U.N. agencies might favor, no one will categorically rule out that possibility, either.
"Whatever it takes to win U.N. business, it is prudent for us to do," Mr. Lifflander said.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut;
Historic Brass Mill Giving Way to a Waterbury Mall

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

DATELINE: WATERBURY

 BODY:
THE Scovill Brass Works in Waterbury, a 200-year-old icon of the Naugatuck Valley's glory days as the industrial engine of Connecticut's economy, is being dismantled to make way for a $120 million shopping mall that will be built by the Homart Company of Chicago.
Occupying 87 acres off Interstate 84 adjacent to the business district, Scovill's 63 deteriorated, empty buildings are being turned into recyclable piles of steel, brick, wood and concrete. 
 Once the site has been cleared, some 118,000 tons of soil, contaminated with PCB's, lead paint, oils and asbestos will be carted off, leaving the land environmentally clean and scraped bare of its history.
When the mall opens in the fall of 1997, anchored by Sears, Lechmere's, J.C. Penney and Filene's department stores, it will be called Brass Mill Center. In addition to the anchors, 120 stores and restaurants will fill a 900,000-square-foot building, joined by landscaped walkways to a 220,000-square-foot open shopping plaza.
Filene's and Sears will move from the 25-year-old, 500,000-square-foot Naugatuck Valley Mall on the other side of town. The stores will be replaced, according to Anne Marie Powers, spokeswoman for the Naugatuck mall, possibly by outlet stores. "There is no rivalry," she said. "Homart is regional, we are very local."
The Homart project will include 5,445 parking spaces and a linear park along the Mad River, an 800-foot stretch of which will be moved closer to East Main Street, consolidating land for the park. Mall construction is expected to begin in the spring of 1996.
Homart, builders of nearly 79 million square feet of retail space nationwide, almost all of it in malls, has optioned the land and received the enthusiastic support of the city, which rezoned the tract from industrial to commercial use.
But Homart will not take title until the state's Department of Environmental Protection certifies that a $36 million demolition and decontamination process financed by state and Federal money has been successfully completed.
"We have agreed to pay back $31 million to the state if we do not build the mall," said Cathy Shields, spokeswoman for Homart. The $5 million in Federal funds does not have to be repaid.
Dismantling the 2.2 million square feet of buildings started last month and will take almost a year of manipulating wrecking balls and bulldozers. "We cannot dynamite," explained Jack Barlow, head of Brass Center Ltd., the demolition company. "Most of these buildings were constructed in the 1800's and during World War I and some, we understand, were bombproof. Construction methods were secret and are unknown. You can't implode a building without detailed drawings."
From the War of 1812 through the Vietnam War, Scovill, which shut down its plant in the late 70's, fabricated brass buttons, time fuses, cartridge casings and vehicle and aircraft parts for the military. It also made kerosene and whale-oil lamps, buckles, hinges, paper clips, zippers, photographic equipment, small appliances under the Hamilton Beach trade name and blanks for coins.
Totally self-sufficient, it had its own fire and police squads, a water-treatment plant, forges, and a power plant paid for during World War I by Czar Nicholas II of Russia in return for munitions that he could not produce at home.
Only two mid-1800's German Romanesque buildings are to be preserved for as yet undetermined uses. The whistle that signaled shifts for 12,000 workers and an extensive collection of photographs dating back more than a century will be housed in the Mattatuck Museum of the Mattatuck Historical Society on West Main Street.
"IT would have been nice to have saved more buildings," said Jack Shannahan, executive director of the Connecticut Historical Commission in Hartford. "But Homart could not have done that and had the space it wanted, and Waterbury didn't want to lose this project."
Indeed, the mall proposal breezed through public hearings with hardly a dissenting word. Even downtown retailers, whose counterparts in other cities complain bitterly about the loss of customers to malls, rallied to the cause.
"Our downtown retail has been tremendously weakened over the years," said Henry R. Paine, president of Howland-Hughes, a 105-year-old department store on Bank Street that is the only such establishment remaining in any Connecticut downtown outside a mall. "I will lose a large percentage of my customers and possibly have to close, but the mall will accomplish a tremendous number of positives for the city."
"This is a piece of an economic base that the city must develop to survive," said Mayor Edward D. Bergin. He recalled how the flight of industry to the South during the energy crisis of the 70's was exacerbated in Waterbury by the extensive use of plastics.
"Metal objects produced here by Scovill, Anaconda and Chase Brass were replaced by plastic," said the Mayor, "and the companies couldn't or wouldn't retool."
Nonfarm jobs declined from 52,790 in 1985 to 44,620 in 1993, according to the state's Department of Economic Development.
Today, 40 percent of downtown Waterbury's stores and offices are vacant, according to Michael Pacowta, president of the Greater Waterbury Chamber of Commerce. "We have become a city known for its desolation instead of its thriving smokestack industries," he said. "We hope that the mall will produce a more positive image to the commercial office sector and retailers that have been passing us by."
On the theory that malls create satellite retail activity, as the Danbury Fair Mall has done, Mayor Bergin has been a staunch advocate of the Homart project as a catalyst for downtown redevelopment. He expects to reclaim even students who drifted away from downtown during the 1970's when Waterbury's three high schools were moved from the business center to the periphery of the city for desegregation purposes. "Kids spend money in downtowns and malls," said the Mayor. "They have cars and there are buses."
Unlike suburban malls, which draw taxes out of cities, Brass Mill Center is expected to enrich Waterbury by $3 million to $5 million in tax revenues annually. The higher figure reflects Connecticut's tax on business equipment. "The shift of property taxes from commercial to residential will shift back to commercial," the Mayor said, adding that the shift would ease the pain of tax increases that will result from the revaluation that Waterbury is under state order to complete by Oct. 1, 1996.
Like children with their noses pressed against the candy store window, many small business owners like Joseph Begnal can't wait for the mall to begin building. A former machinist at Scovill himself, he has owned Begnal's Brown Derby bar opposite the plant on Main Street since 1956.
"I used to tell time by the 3, 4 and 5 o'clock shifts coming in for a shot and a beer," he said. "I lost 80 percent of my business when the plant closed 15 years ago. Downtown is so dead my son-in-law closed his sports shop on Grand Street last month, after seven years."
But now Mr. Begnal plans to open for lunch for the first time in years, he said, "for the construction workers and then for spillover from the mall."

HEADLINE: Veteran Jazzman Swings With the Young

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON 

 BODY:
BILLY MITCHELL does not refer to his traditional weekly engagement at Sonny's Place in Seaford as a jam session.
"At a jam session," said the 65-year-old tenor saxophonist, "a guy will choose a tune he's been practicing all week, play his solo, and then walk away and start a conversation on the other side of the room." 
 One main lesson that Mr. Mitchell teaches every Wednesday night, when he invites guests to play with his quartet, is that it is not enough to play in the band. They have to play with the band.
But for two weeks this month, the band does not have its leader to maintain the high standards of jazz protocol, which Mr. Mitchell takes to Sonny's Place from as far back as his early days in Detroit in the late 1940's. Mr. Mitchell is in Stuttgart, Germany, where he is playing six concerts. He is leading a band made up of top German musicians called the Alexander Swingtime Band.
"He has to make these trips every so often so he can afford to play at Sonny's Place," said the club owner, Sonny Meyerowitz.
Although Mr. Meyerowitz said his business was also feeling the effects of the slow economy on Long Island, Mr. Meyerowitz runs the lone Long Island club, which features jazz seven nights a week, with a quality that rivals that of top Manhattan clubs. Much of the reason is Mr. Mitchell's long association with the club.
When Mr. Meyerowitz started the Steer Inn in Freeport in 1963, he called on Mr. Mitchell for the music. When Mr. Meyerowitz opened Sonny's Place in 1972, Mr. Mitchell followed, and the club has been his home bandstand ever since.
"If it weren't for Billy, there wouldn't be a Sonny's Place," Mr. Meyerowitz said.
As the Wednesday night host for 11 years, Mr. Mitchell has maintained a high level of musicianship, reaching beyond technical expertise. "It takes 20 years to learn what to play," he said, "and five years to learn what to leave out."
Born in Kansas City, Mr. Mitchell moved to New York in 1948 with the Lucky Millander Orchestra and was taken by another tenor saxophonist, Ben Webster, to Minton's Playhouse in Harlem. "I walked in and on the bandstand was Charlie Parker, Lester Young, Dizzy Gillespie and Kenny Clarke," Mr. Mitchell recounted. "You'll never see anything like that again."
He then settled in Detroit, where he led the house band at the Blue Bird Club, a band that had Tommy Flanagan on piano and Elvin Jones on drums. Frequent guests included Miles Davis, Cannonball Adderly and Paul Chambers.
After tours with the big bands of Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Woody Herman and others, Mr. Mitchell settled on Long Island, whose musical culture, he said, was a far cry from that of Detroit in his early days.
"In those days," he said, "I could leave my house with my horn at 9 P.M. and play at 10 different clubs and learn from 10 different musicians, fine musicians."
That tradition of jazz education is what Mr. Mitchell is trying to keep alive at Sonny's. He says that young jazz musicians today have nowhere else to play on Long Island.
The first thing he looks for in an aspiring musician hoping to sit in with his band is a spark, a desire to learn. "You see someone with some talent but looking for more," Mr. Mitchell said, "and you help him."
Young musicians find no shortage of qualified teachers on Wednesday nights at Sonny's, when Mr. Mitchell takes the bandstand, often accompanied by colleagues like Frank Wess, Tootsie Bean and Frank Foster. Indeed, the club has been visited by such jazz legends as Count Basie, Sarah Vaughan, Lionel Hampton, Betty Carter and others, whose presence is documented in pictures on the walls.
Mr. Mitchell, who has lived on Long Island for 35 years, said he preferred his limited engagements and traditional weekly gig at Sonny's to the strenuous schedule of the big-band days.
"When I was with Count Basie," he added, "we were on the road 13 months out of the year."
Although he has trimmed his schedule, Mr. Mitchell can continue to lean back in midsolo on the bandstand, close his eyes, slowly cross one leg over the other and start to roar.
"This joint," he said in a quiet moment at the bar, "is a part of me, part of my heart."
With his feel for timing and symmetry, he took a slow drag of his cigarette and added, "All we need is more people to be aware of what is really here."

HEADLINE: Social Studies and an Economist

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON 

DATELINE: PORT CHESTER

 BODY:
WHEN Dr. Peter F. Bell accepted the year's Distinguished Social Studies Service Award from the New York State Council on the Social Studies recently, he spoke about the issues that were on his mind: his shock at the country's limited knowledge of economics, the subject he has taught at Purchase College since 1972; policies that he suggested would "end welfare and create poverty" and the "political ideologues of a very dangerous kind" who had found power.
To his surprise, spontaneous applause greeted his brief remarks. This was the most charged moment of an award banquet held during the council's three-day yearly conference at the Rye Town Hilton here. It was the 57th conference sponsored jointly by the council and the New York State Social Studies Supervisory Association. 
 Nearly 800 social studies teachers, local historians and others converged on the hotel at a time when the national debate over multiculturalism raged on and a framework for a new social studies curriculum had not yet been accepted by the state. In sessions held throughout the conference, teachers considered questions like how can students be kept interested in current events, what issues should be covered when teaching about a third world country and are interdisciplinary courses valid?
Steven A. Goldberg, president of the Council on the Social Studies and chairman of social studies for the New Rochelle School District, said discussions also centered on the future of social studies during a time of flux in the State Education Department. Commissioner Thomas Sobol, who did not accept a committee's recent efforts to design a new social studies curriculum, has announced that he will resign at the end of the year.
Dr. Bell also directs the New York State Council on Economic Education, a teacher-training organization with 15 centers statewide. He received a plaque for his 10-year effort in helping teachers become more knowledgeable about economics, a subject many must teach but few have studied. He was the only county educator to receive an award at the conference, which also honored outstanding teachers in elementary school through high school.
"He deserves it -- he has been wonderful," said Sandra G. Abt, chairwoman of the social studies department of the Byram Hills School District in Armonk. In 1989, Byram Hills was one of 10 school districts nationwide to be cited for excellence in its economics program. Dr. Abt said Dr. Bell, working through the SUNY-Westchester Schools Partnership of Purchase College, helped shape a course of study for teaching economics at every grade level. Dr. Bell, an Armonk resident who received the Chancellor's Award for Excellence in Teaching from the State University of New York in 1982 and the Outstanding Service Award from the Westchester Council for the Social Studies in 1991, also directs the Westchester Center for Economic Education at Purchase.
Mr. Goldberg said Dr. Bell "serves as a good model of how university people can collaborate with secondary-school people to do the best for kids." Mr. Goldberg added, "He sees us as equals."
A native of England, Dr. Bell is a specialist in the economies of third world countries, and is an internationally known expert on Thailand. At a session devoted to global studies earlier in the conference, he was on a panel of teachers that also includedTimothy Miller of Fox Lane High School in Bedford, Judith Mella of Blind Brook High School in Rye and Douglas Young of Croton High School in Croton. Dr. Bell suggested that the more than 60 teachers at the session focus their third world lessons on issues like women's role in the global industrial labor force, women and underdevelopment and what he called "the feminization of poverty."
"The core of what we call development is built on cheap female labor for cheap imports in the rest of the world," he told the group. "Why are women chosen? That's a good question to discuss with your students. Women are at the bottom of the development tier and are seriously disadvantaged in education, health and access to jobs."
He added that the Thai Government counts on prostitution for billions of foreign dollars. Development in Thailand, he said, is "literally built upon the backs of women."
Ms. Mella described her use of novels and films in teaching global studies, while Mr. Young showed a video on his students' use of CD-ROM's and other technology in preparing reports. Mr. Miller acknowledged that it was "impossible to cover every issue" in the vast amount of social studies material that must be taught. He suggested that teachers pose general questions that will stimulate class discussions like: "What would make a better world?"
"That's a loaded question," he observed. "Better for whom? We want children to question the vocabulary we use."

What Do I Hear for This 1988 Burgundy? Fine Wine on the Block.

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
LOOKING for an insouciant little Bordeaux with a supple body -- something, perhaps, with an unadorned bouquet, a hint of humus on the tongue and a finish of ripe pear with overtones of persimmon, plum and clover? Until recently, the only place New Yorkers could hope to buy such a bottle (with or without that elusive persimmon overtone) was ye olde friendlie neighborhood spirits shoppe. For after the end of Prohibition the State Legislature endowed liquor retailers with a monopoly on the wine trade, much the way 16th century monarchs parceled out monopolies in spices.
But in 1993 New York retailers specializing in upscale wines hammered out a deal with New York's two international art auction houses, which run wine exchanges in Europe and have long been lobbying Albany for a piece of the local action. Now anyone can auction wines if they can find an established retailer to serve as a partner. Indeed, New York City is on the verge of becoming the wine auction capital of America, rivaling the markets in Chicago and California in both variety and dollar volume. 
 The next New York auction, jointly sponsored with Zachy's, the big wine store in Scarsdale, is scheduled for Christie's Park Avenue gallery on April 8. And while auctions are no place for those who don't know the difference between Muscadet and muscatel, the promoters are going out of their way to make it easy for amateur enthusiasts to try their hand at the bidding game.
CATALOGUES, available a few weeks before the auction date, spell out the rules in plain English. And while Christie's is hoping to fetch at least $60,000 for 21 rare bottles of Burgundy from the collection of Rusty Staub, the former New York Mets star, every auction includes dozens of lots likely to sell for less than $500. Perhaps the best part of the scene is the pre-auction hoopla designed to loosen up billfolds. The auction houses generally sell tickets to tastings and blowout gourmet dinners, with rare wines in abundance and commentary from the most sophisticated palates in the business.
Actually, anybody who has been to an art auction should feel at home with the mechanics of bidding at a wine auction. Auctioneers start the bidding at prices below the low end of the estimated range printed in the catalogue and go up in specified increments. At Sotheby's, for example, a bid of $300 can only be topped by a bid at least $20 higher, while a bid of $3,000 must be topped with a bid of $3,200.
Bids made in advance by mail or during the auction by telephone are welcome. "An absentee bid is identical to one from the room," explained Serena Sutcliffe, the head of Sotheby's wine department. Thus, even if a mail bidder had indicated that he would pay up to $1,000 for a lot, he would still be able to buy the wine for just $20 more than the next highest bid of, say, $600.
Don't even dream about walking away with the odd unwanted case of wine for pennies on the dollar. For one thing the auction houses are eager to avoid the embarrassment of very light bidding and commensurably low gavel prices, and thus don't accept wines for auction that lack a real market. More important, wines are generally assigned "reserve prices" -- unannounced minimums that must be topped. At an auction run in February by Morrell & Company, the New York wine dealer, roughly 1 lot in 20 (among them a lot of 15 half-bottles of Chateau Lafite Rothschild 1953) was withdrawn for want of an adequate bid.
Both sellers and buyers pay commissions. The bite on the seller, usually about 15 percent, is often negotiable. "It depends on the amount of wine being sold, its value and the difficulty of tracing provenance," said Bruce Kaiser, director of the wine department at Butterfield & Butterfield, the auction house in San Francisco.
The buyer's commission is added to the winning bid, along with state and local sales taxes. At Morrell's February auction, the high bid for a case of prized red Burgundy, an Echezeaux from the 1990 vintage, was $800. But the actual price was increased 10 percent to cover the buyer's commission. And unless the buyer proved to be a reseller like a restaurant or lived out of state, sales tax of 8 3/4 percent would be tacked on to both the bid price and the buyer's commission.
Auction houses are go-betweens, not sellers. Hence, in theory it is the buyer's job to judge the quality of older wines with uncertain histories. In fact, says Michael Broadbent, head of the wine department at Christie's, quality assurance is much less of a problem than might be expected.
Bottles are checked for deterioration -- broken "capsules" covering the corks, unexpected color, seepage through corks -- and the signs are listed in the catalogue. Generally, auction houses will not accept wines unless they have been stored properly. "If we're not sure," said Peter Morrell, chairman of Morrell & Company, "we send someone to look at the cellar."
The catalogues also note any decline in the level of wine in the bottle. Young wines should reach the neck, or close to it. But wines older than 15 years will often be perfectly good even if they only reach midway up the rounded "shoulder" of a Bordeaux or Burgundy-style bottle: very slow evaporation need not damage the wine.
"It's in our interest" to auction good bottles only, Mr. Broadbent said. And while neither Christie's nor its competitors offer unconditional guarantees, they generally do allow buyers to return wines that have been damaged.
"If the issue is really in doubt," Mr. Kaiser of Butterfield & Butterfield said, "I take home a bottle and drink it."
Where are the bargains likely to lurk? Orley Ashenfelter, publisher of a semiannual newsletter on wine economics called Liquid Assets, says there is little sense in bidding for wines from recent vintages because prices will generally be no better than those from discount retailers. But not all recently made wines are easily available at retail. If you are pining for a collector's wine the auction may still be your best bet.
The wines being sold by Mr. Staub, for example, come from the 1988, 1989 and 1990 vintages. But it is hard to find all seven from the rarest of rare Burgundy estates, the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti. And it would be virtually impossible to buy them in six-liter bottles known as Methuselahs.
"If I had my druthers I'd keep these babies, but I have to think about my family," said Mr. Staub, a restaurateur who maintains a spectacular personal collection of top-rank wines from Burgundy, Bordeaux and California. Translation: It is best to sell when the market is hot.
MOST of the action, however, is in mature red Bordeaux wines from the better vintages of the 1960's, 1970's and early 1980's. Good selections of these are found in only a few dozen stores in America, and generally at prices far above those at auctions.
So-called first-growth Bordeauxs (Chateaux Latour, Margaux, Lafite-Rothschild, Mouton-Rothschild, Ausone, Haut-Brion, Cheval Blanc, Petrus) are so well known that auction prices are fairly stable. That is not the case, though, for lesser Bordeaux wines from lesser vintages where, Mr. Ashenfelter says, "prices bounce all over the place." And it is certainly not true for older wines that do not fit into the life style of the local rich and famous.
In New York that latter category includes most California wines, most Burgundies, most Rhone wines, most Italian wines and virtually all whites from Germany. "There are endless bargains in German wines -- people just don't understand the labels," said Mr. Broadbent, referring to Germany's incredibly arcane system of grading and classifying the estates along the Rhine and Moselle Rivers.
The auctions also assemble interesting lots that give aficionados unique opportunities to create tastings. In February, for example, Sotheby's auctioned a "vertical" -- a case of one wine, Chateau Haut-Brion Blanc, with bottles from the 1970, '71, '75, '82 and '83 vintages. The high bid, incidentally, was $1,150, plus a 15 percent buyer's premium. The Sotheby's auction also included a case of a great white Burgundy, Batard-Montrachet, all from the same vintage (1986) but from four different producers. The price: $1,840, plus commission.
Ready to put your money where your mouth wants to be? A solid bidding strategy is to use recent London auction prices for European wines and California auction prices for California cabernets as benchmarks. Liquid Assets, available for $30 a year, (169 Nassau St., Princeton, N.J. 08542) lists prices and sales volumes for hundreds of wines. If you know what you like to drink, do your homework and are patient, the rewards will be bountiful.

EVEN the detectives stalking Guy Gralto admitted a certain admiration for his devotion to work and family. Each morning, at 6:30 A.M., Mr. Gralto, a swarthy dark-mustachioed man who favored off-the-rack jogging suits, left his home in East Rockaway, L.I. Driving east against the traffic, he arrived within half an hour at his small junkyard in Oceanside. Inside his trailer-office, he phoned home. "Vera, I'm here," he reassured his common-law wife.
 Mr. Gralto then fed the junkyard's guard dog, a 125-pound German shepherd named Bandit, before his employees arrived promptly at 8 A.M. and the orders came ringing in. A hard worker and a hard-driving boss, Mr. Gralto typically ordered in lunch, worked untgil early evening and drove straight home. At his modest six-room home, a converted one-story bungalow on the waterfront, he and Vera Marino usually shared quiet dinners, though occasionally they dropped in on her daughter and son-in-law's. In the summer, the couple sometimes went boating, or had the kids over for a cookout.
 "He put in long days," said Detective Paul Vitucci of the Nassau County Police. "He demanded punctuality from his workers. He demanded very high productivity. One time, he had a guy out there who had nothing to do. Gralto had him work in the yard, sweep up the yard, rake it clean."
 But the admiration ended there. The orders coming in, according to an indictment in State Supreme Court in Queens, were from traffickers in stolen auto parts. Someone would ask for the nose of a 1992 Nissan Maxima. The fender of a 1991 Plymouth Acclaim. A couple of phone calls later, the indictment charges, Mr. Gralto had arranged for one of his trusty "steal men" to cruise parking lots and residential streets, mostly in Queens, occasionally in Nassau County. He would then "chop up" the cars, fulfill the order with the buyer and stockpile the remaining parts, the indictment says.
To business associates, Mr. Gralto's favorite comment was: "I'm an honest businessman trying to make an honest day's dollar." But law-enforcement officials say this case, broken last month and based on hundreds of hours of wiretaps of his conversations as well as video surveillance, offers an unusually vivid glimpse into the workings of an auto theft ring, a core group of 13 that extended from a reputed captain in the Bonanno crime family to Mr. Gralto, down to the "cutters" and the "steal men." The case sheds light on why more than half the cars stolen in New York vanish in Byzantine networks of thieves, chop-shop owners, thieves who specialize in certain parts, illegal parts suppliers and unscrupulous mechanics -- all of whom create an artificial demand for the supply of auto parts.
Organized crime syndicates have been involved in auto theft since at least the 1960's. But since the 1980's, car theft has grown increasingly organized, as a new breed of expensive and sophisticated cars, equipped with a growing array of gadgets and parts, multiplied the potential profits from theft. And because a police department overwhelmed with more serious crimes virtually ignored auto theft until the early '90s, the risk of punishment was low.
Beleaguered by perhaps the most skillful auto thieves in the nation, the city's car owners -- already suffering from a scarcity of garages and monthly indoor parking fees of up to $700 -- can take some comfort in statistics, if nothing else. Partly because of rising police attention, the number of reported thefts has fallen steadily since a record 146,309 in 1990. Still, 94,525 were reported stolen last year, or almost 260 cars a day. Of the 30 biggest American cities, only drivers in Detroit and San Francisco were more likely to have their cars stolen in 1993, says the Highway Loss Data Institute, an insurance trade organization.
But because of New York's sophisticated rings, its 1.8 million car owners paid the highest theft premiums: $248, or five times the average for the 30 cities. "Though the theft claims are not as frequent as in Detroit or San Francisco, the average loss is higher because the chances of recovery are far lower," said Kim Hazelbaker, senior vice president of the Institute.
So pervasive is the problem in some neighborhoods that drivers have adopted an almost fatalistic attitude -- particularly in Queens, home to 38 percent of all cars registered in the city in 1993. Near the Fresh Meadows shopping mall, one of the hardest-hit areas in the hardest-hit precinct of the city and a favorite target of the ring, so many cars were stolen last year that officers were posted on high-rise rooftops to watch the streets and residents could rattle off the names of victimized neighbors.
Under pressure to combat auto theft, law enforcement officials involved in the yearlong investigation by detectives assigned to the Queens District Attorney and by the Nassau County police were eager to talk about the case, which they describe as a benchmark in their efforts.
"This is the first auto-theft prosecution under the state's Organized Crime Control Act," said Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown. "These weren't isolated thefts. You're talking about a highly sophisticated enterprise that stole and dismantled cars and set up a business in stolen parts."
At the arraignment last month, all the defendants pleaded not guilty. Joseph Mure, a lawyer representing Mr. Gralto and Ms. Marino -- as well as her son-in-law Frank Merendino, who is also charged with assisting Mr. Gralto -- said recently that they maintain their innocence and denied any connection to organized crime. Lawyers who represent the other suspects and who chose to comment said their clients also declare their innocence.
Vincent Asaro, 60 -- who is charged with being a captain in the Bonanno crime family and with being at the top of this theft ring -- further denies that he controlled Mr. Gralto. "He denies any involvement with organized crime, period," said his lawyer, Stephen G. Murphy, who has been involved in many high-profile cases in New York.
 
THIEF, CUTTER, BROKER: THE CAR-THEFT LADDER
 Guy Gralto, 34, grew up in Ozone Park. Investigators believe he has been involved in the auto-theft business for at least the last 11 years, climbing his way up, from thief to cutter to broker, in the tightly knit car-theft industry in southeastern Queens. He had been arrested only once, for possession of two stolen vehicles with illegal vehicle identification numbers, in 1988, and that case was later dismissed. Detectives who shadowed him for a year described him as an excitable man, who spoke in a loud voice even during normal conversations, barking into his telephone. At work, he kept his phone conversations short and businesslike, though last Sept. 5, unsure of the holiday, he spent minutes trying to persuade every caller that it was actually Memorial Day.
Not all his business associates were privy to Mr. Gralto's softer side, his love of pets. Besides Bandit, the German shepherd he had taken in as a sickly stray in Howard Beach, he poured affection on a small dog and three parrots at his East Rockaway home. Last summer, when a friendly chop shop was raided by the police and its guard dog was shot, Mr. Gralto's first telephone call, say detectives listening to wiretaps, was to inquire about the pit bull. "Oh no, jeez, they shot the dog. Poor dog."
According to the indictment, Mr. Gralto's Oceanside business traced its roots to another auto-theft ring that he and a former partner set up in an inconspicuous warehouse in Maspeth, Queens, in November 1993. In Queens' auto-theft industry, a tight network where everyone knows everyone else, it was perhaps natural for Mr. Gralto to join forces with Martin Bosshart, a Woodhaven resident with a criminal record, law enforcement officials said. It was also natural that in an industry with its own peculiar hierarchies and codes of advancement that Mr. Bosshart, who was only 25, became the junior partner, with Mr. Gralto taking the lion's share of the profits. But Mr. Bosshart's inexperience was more than compensated for by his extremely violent behavior, officials said, pointing out he had been arrested on charges of attempted murder in 1990, though never convicted. In 1988, he pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of attempted grand larceny in another case.
The joint operation earned millions of dollars by stealing and chopping up roughly 20 cars a week, Detective Vitucci and other officials said. But they said there was a conflict larger than both men: Mr. Bosshart paid tribute to the Gambino organized crime family. But Mr. Gralto, who had been loosely allied with Mr. Asaro for a number of years, was holding back payments from the reputed Bonanno captain.
The indicted individuals -- all "stand-up guys who don't rat on each other," according to Detective Vitucci -- have provided few details of the ensuing fallout. But investigators believe that on Feb. 25, 1994, with the Bonanno captain's consent, Mr. Bosshart and two accomplices forced Mr. Gralto out of the Maspeth business. Inside the warehouse, the indictment says, Mr. Bosshart and two associates severely beat Mr. Gralto, stole thousands of dollars and then dragged him into an office and shot him in the leg.
After the shooting, Mr. Gralto -- to continue his career in the auto-theft business -- had no choice but to turn to Mr. Asaro for protection, law enforcement officials said. Mr. Gralto moved to Long Island, abandoning a salvage yard, Conduit Auto Parts, he owned in Howard Beach. In an industrial corner of Oceanside, he rented space in a carpet warehouse where he showed up to work, six days a week, dressed invariably in jogging suits.
Mr. Asaro shielded Mr. Gralto against other auto-theft rings looking to expand, steered business his way and sometimes provided him with his own car thieves, said Detective Cary Brenner, of the Queens District Attorney's Office Squad. A flat weekly fee, typically around $500, was delivered to the Great In Pasta, a restaurant in Hewlett, L.I., where Mr. Asaro spent his evenings.
 
 
A SMALL CIRCLE OF TRUST
 In Oceanside, or sometimes at his home, Mr. Gralto received orders and dispatched his thieves, the indictment says. Whenever he did not perform those tasks himself, Mr. Gralto trusted only Ms. Marino, 49, her son-in-law Mr. Merendino, 32, or Louis Scarantino, 31, a childhood friend accused of financing a warehouse for stolen parts in East Rockaway. They were all indicted.
Two others indicted were acquaintances from Mr. Gralto's years in the auto-theft business -- Anthony LaGreca and Keith Hillman, who worked at auto-supply shops in Jamaica, Queens, and Bay Shore, L.I., respectively -- regularly called him with orders, said Detective Brenner, who eavesdropped on hundreds of conversations.
"Nose off a '91 Max, white, two-door," was a typical order for a Nissan Maxima.
"O.K. I'll buy it," Mr. Gralto said, after haggling over a price.
Mr. Gralto then paged one of his steal men, who were paid between $400 and $600 to find the car and drop it off at a pre-arranged location, Detective Vitucci said. One of Mr. Gralto's employees would pick up the car and drive it to a friendly chop shop where it would be dismantled, generally for $1,800, the detective said.
"I bought it," Mr. Gralto would say, calling back the orderer of the part. "I'll have it to you in a day or two." The parts were delivered to Mr. LaGreca, 30, who had previously been convicted of insurance violations, burglary, attempted possession of stolen property and attempted forgery. Other valuables were warehoused, and, after everyone was paid, Mr. Gralto could clear several thousand dollars.
The indictment says that two of Mr. Gralto's regular thieves were Victor Norwood, 35, and Thomas Parker, 42, two tall, thin men from Jamaica who over the years had acquired reputations as dependable steal men, Detective Brenner said. Although the operators of an auto-theft ring are often shielded from scrutiny, the steal men are the organization's foot soldiers, often desperate people who are willing to expose themselves to great risks for a few hundred dollars and, unlike their bosses, are unable to afford top-notch lawyers.
Mr. Parker's criminal record, dating to 1970, includes multiple convictions for grand larceny, possessing an illegal vehicle identification number and making a false report of a stolen vehicle; Mr. Norwood, with convictions for harassment and the unauthorized use of a vehicle, also spent five years in prison for first-degree manslaughter.
 
 
THE M.O.: DAYLIGHT, PARKING LOTS, TRAIN STATIONS
 Dressed in dungarees, driving junk-cars with stolen out-of-state license plates, the steal men favored spots in northeast Queens -- parking lots at the Fresh Meadows shopping mall, St. John's University and at Long Island Rail Road stations, say the detectives. They stole not at night, but during working hours.
From their surveillance investigators inferred that the two suspects worked like other professional car thieves. They usually broke in by smashing a small window. If an alarm blared, they popped open the hood, went around to the front and smashed the alarm, housed usually next to the engine. If a Club was used, they simply cut through the steering wheel. Finally, they started the car by breaking the steering column.
"It took them usually less than 20 seconds to start a car," Detective Brenner said. "What made them good? Experience. Most car thieves are young, and not as reliable."
Admired for his efficiency, Mr. Gralto, investigators pointed out, possessed another quality that led to his downfall: foolhardiness.
A simple, unostentatious man, Mr. Gralto eschewed the grand ambitions that drive many of his peers, Detective Vitucci said. Unlike a John Gotti who used car theft as a stepping stone into one of New York's five traditional crime families, Mr. Gralto apparently had no aspirations of joining the Bonanno family, of ever becoming a "made man."
Instead, Mr. Gralto revealed a more pedestrian goal in phone calls: "I want to make a million a year." That goal, investigators said, pushed him to grow reckless.
When an industry associate alerted him that his Oceanside yard was under surveillance, Mr. Gralto ignored the tip. When detectives, waiting in ambush a stone's throw from Mr. Gralto's home, phoned him on Feb. 15 at 6 A.M., to warn him that they were coming to arrest him, Mr. Gralto simply said, "Knock it off," and hung up. When the police called back immediately, he still believed it was a joke. Spitting out an expletive, he slammed down the receiver. It was only when the police began breaking down his front door that the truth hit him, Detective Vitucci said.
Mr. Gralto tried to save the door by opening it. But it was too late.
By the time all 13 suspects were arrested last month, the ring had operated 10 months, from May 1994 to February 1995, the indictment charges. During a period of intense surveillance, from May 9 to Aug. 11, 1994, the ring chopped up and sold parts from 21 cars -- worth $244,000 on the used car market but almost $1 million in parts, the District Attorney's office charged.
In a related indictment, Mr. Bosshart, the alleged Gambino loyalist, and his two associates from Maspeth were also charged last month with possessing and dismantling stolen vehicles, and with assaulting Mr. Gralto. Murray Richman, Mr. Bosshart's lawyer, said his client denies all the charges against him.
 
THE TOP CARS AT HOME AND ON THIRD WORLD ROADS
 Because of the immense profits from cannibalizing cars, the police estimate that more than half of all cars stolen in the city are taken for their parts, said Lieut. Robert Martin of the Auto Crime Squad.
Not surprisingly, the cars most frequently stolen are made by General Motors -- because of the greater demand for used G.M. parts.
By contrast, Lieutenant Martin attributed the theft of three cars in the top 10 list of most stolen cars -- 1994 Toyotas, Hondas and Nissans -- to the growing number of stolen cars exported to Third World nations, where there are few or no dealerships that sell new cars and where vehicle registration is often nonexistent.
The Japanese makers' reputation for durability make them popular in underdeveloped nations with unreliable roads, Lieutenant Martin said. This market is controlled by recently established rings, based among the new immigrant groups, specialize in illegal exports. They steal new cars and resell them, for double or triple their original worth.
In the end, organized crime rings account for almost nine out of 10 car thefts in the City, Lieutenant Martin said.
Faced with the disquieting statistic that more than nine cars a day were reported stolen in the 107th Precinct last year, Linda Leuzzi thinks her Jeep Cherokee could be next. She and her husband, Vincent, live in Jamaica Estates, on a block where brazen thieves have been known to career down the street, searching for cars in broad daylight -- even on Mother's Day.
Three times in the last three years, inside their second-floor bedroom, which faces the driveway, the couple were awakened in the predawn hours by breaking glass. Each time, they chased away the thieves in time.
"Now, if we hear a noise outside, we jump out of bed and go to the window," she said. "We have the window open, even in the middle of winter. We want fresh air, but it's also because we want to know what's happening out there."
 
 
The Indicted: A Flow Chart"
 Though it is on the decline, auto theft remains a scourge in many neighborhoods. As cars have become more sophisticated, so has car theft. Law enforcement officials in Queens and Nassau County say a recent indictment is a key step in efforts to combat the crime and illustrates the power of market forces for blackmarket auto parts. Their case: Vincent Asaro, a reputed captain in the Bonanno crime family, was at the top, receiving $500 per week in tribute from the man they say operated the ring, Guy Gralto. They say Mr. Gralto connected with buyers and helped hire car cutters and thieves. All those charged have pleaded not guilty.
 
 
You and the 'Steal Men': Get Protection and Say a Prayer
 IN a densely populated city where few residents own private garages, and where monthly indoor parking fees can cost as much as a studio's rent, New Yorkers must leave their cars to the gods of the streets. Experts say that in New York -- especially in New York -- nothing will stop a thief. But there are devices that will make stealing your car more difficult, and maybe persuade the thief to move on to your neighbor's car. Here's a look at the most popular.
 
 
IGNITION CUT-OFF SYSTEM
 HOW IT WORKS: If the proper encoded ignition key is not used, or if an attempt is made to start the car without a key, electronic sensors built into the ignition lock automatically cut off the electric power. Usually, the system also activates an alarm. Some sought-after cars, like the Corvette and Lexus LS400, come already equipped with the system. But it can be installed in any car for a few hundred dollars.
 THE BOTTOM LINE: The best, experts say. "We've seen this to be effective even in very high-profile vehicles, like the Camaro or Corvette," says Kim Hazelbaker, senior vice president of the Highway Loss Data Institute. "Compared to previous models that did not have this system, the thefts have come down, and have stayed down. Now the theft of Corvettes is only twice above average, whereas in the past it used to be 10 times the average."
 HOW THIEVES GET AROUND IT: Tow the car away.
 
 
 
ALARM
 HOW IT WORKS: Sirens, flashing lights, or robotic voice warns thieves to "stand back."
 THE BOTTOM LINE: "They don't do much good," Mr. Hazelbaker says. "It's a harsh statement. But we simply don't find the difference in the theft records of cars that have these alarms and those that don't." Especially in New York, people tune them out.
 HOW THIEVES GET AROUND IT: One thief breaks into the car and immediately releases the lever of the hood. An accomplice pops open the hood and smashes the alarm, which is usually installed near the engine. Frank Vasquez, an officer with the city police's crime prevention division, recommends adding a lock to the hood latch.
 
 
 
LOJACK
 HOW IT WORKS: A radio transceiver is hidden somewhere in the car. When the car is stolen, the police enter the vehicle identification code into a computer system, and a broadcast system emits radio signals to turn on the transceiver in the car. Each precinct has at least one patrol car equipped with a tracking computer, says Officer Jim Muller of the crime prevention division.
 THE BOTTOM LINE: The recovery rate in several states for stolen cars with Lojack is 95 percent, according to the manufacturers. But the unit, which costs $595 or less, is unproven in New York City, where here it has just been introduced and where there are special problems.
 HOW THIEVES GET AROUND IT: The owner must report the theft to the police immediately. If the owner dallies, especially in New York, the car could be in a chop-shop by the time the owner makes the call.
 
 
STEERING-WHEEL IMMOBILIZERS
 HOW IT WORKS: The most famous is the Club, a device that is locked to the steering wheel and limits turning.
 THE BOTTOM LINE: Many auto-security experts regard these devices, used by themselves, as minor deterrents.
HOW THIEVES GET AROUND IT By spraying Freon, a refrigerant, on the immobilizer's lock, thieves can easily smash it. Most don't even bother doing that. They simply cut through the steering wheel, which (to prevent injuries during accidents) is usually made of an aluminum wire covered with foam and vinyl.
 
 
COMBAT AUTO THEFT
 HOW IT WORKS: Under a police program, car owners stick a notice on their windshields, allowing the police to stop their cars between 1 A.M. and 5 A.M.
 THE BOTTOM LINE: It deters car thieves who don't want to needlessly increase their chances of being stopped. For no cost, drivers who register cars at the local precinct can get between 5 and 15 percent discounts on insurance premiums, Officer Vasquez said.
 HOW THE THIEVES GET AROUND IT: Once the car is stolen, the chances of recovery are no different from cars not registered in this program. Since the program's inception in the mid-1980s, 126,000 cars were registered, said Barbara Keimes, an officer in Crime Prevention. Of that total, 1,000 cars were stolen. But only 45 cars were recovered, and 20 thieves were arrested.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
If the Market Hates It, He's Buying

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
Over the last decade, the Clipper Fund, a no-load growth fund run from Beverly Hills, Calif., by James A. Gipson, has put together a good record by searching for value, often among the stocks that Wall Street hates. The fund stumbled a bit in 1994, losing 2.4 percent in a year when the hot sector was technology, an area where the fund rarely ventures. But this year, through Friday, the fund is up 11.1percent.
When asked last week, Mr. Gipson said he loved brokerage houses, thought some health care stocks were still good values despite their recent rally and generally found that some of the best companies were the best buys.
Floyd Norris 
 Q. Your portfolio is extremely heavy in financial stocks. Why?
A. Basically, it is high-quality companies that are the cheapest in the current market. There's an old saying: In investing you can choose to eat well or sleep well, but not both. This is one of those rare occasions when in fact you can do both. The structure of values in the market makes high-quality companies cheap, and that's what we have in the portfolio. The average price/earnings multiple of our portfolio is about 12, using 1995 estimates. So, the price is cheap but the quality is quite high.
Some of the best financial service companies in the country are among the cheapest right now. And basically we have two commitments there. One is to the Government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with about 20 percent of the portfolio. They are some of the best and highest-return financial services companies in the country, selling for about nine times earnings. They have a very low cost of funds. They share a duopoly and have reasonable growth prospects.
Q. Why are they cheap?
A. I'll go back over the last three years. People were afraid, as short-term interest rates were going down, that this would cause problems for Fannie and Freddie. And then when rates went up a year ago, people were afraid that, oh, this would cause problems for Fannie and Freddie. In fact, both companies have matched their assets and liabilities very well and have come through one of the more volatile interest rate environments in recent years with their profits and their growth rates largely intact. Yet people really don't seem to care.
Q. How fast do you think they will grow?
A. Both of them have a pretty high probability of being able to grow their earnings at 12 to 15 percent per year over the next five years. Fannie and Freddie are two companies that, if the economy does slow down or, worse yet, goes into a recession, still have a reasonable prospect of being able to grow with their earnings at double-digit rates.
Q. You've also got a lot of money in brokerage stocks. Haven't you heard that higher interest rates have killed off that industry?
A. There is a good deal of controversy about those stocks. One of the cheapest assets on Wall Street is stock in Wall Street itself. And to take the negative for a moment, they made very good money in 1991 to 1993. Last year was not a banner year, and this year is turning out the same. And for people who focus on earnings momentum, the brokerage place is not the place to be.
If, on the other hand, you are looking for a good long-term business in which to become a long-term partner, this is a good opportunity to buy some of the best investment banking franchises in the country very cheaply and to buy them when their own managements are buying back their shares.
Q. Name names.
A. Two good examples are Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch. In both cases you're paying only a very small premium over stated book value. Book value, remember, is largely stock and bond inventory. So that is a hard book value not a soft one. But they are both fine companies with very good franchises, very good long-term prospects.
Q. Merrill isn't very popular in some parts of your home state of California, such as Orange County.
A. We significantly increased our position in Merrill back in November, during the crisis. Interestingly enough, the company itself repurchased 6 percent of its shares in the fourth quarter of last year. So, they were making a very large bet. It turned out to be a correct one that the market had gone off the deep end in worries over the Orange County crisis. The shares have rallied substantially since then.
Q. You bought Salomon a few years back when everyone hated it. And you still own some, although you've cut back. Its stock has slumped lately because people wonder whether they can make money and whether they can get the accounting right.
A. A financial firm that can't perform its basic bookkeeping well doesn't inspire confidence that it can do other things well. But the accounting problems are not central to Salomon's future. They say they fixed them; they probably have.
What is much more central is their capacity to build and defend a good trading franchise, and Salomon has slipped in that.
Q. So why own Salomon?
A. We've cut our position back from about 9 percent of the portfolio to around 2 percent. In retrospect, I wish we'd eliminated it.
Q. You've moved into some consumer products companies.
A. Right. That is another example of what I said at the beginning, that some of the nation's highest-quality companies are the cheapest. Pepsico, McDonald's are new to the portfolio in the last year. Frito-Lay is Pepsi's biggest profit contributor. But they are enjoying 10 percent unit growth. I don't know where people put all those pretzels. They've got 45 percent of the market, while the next two competitors are around 6 percent and losing money. Pepsi just coins money in the market.
Q. You've got almost 10 percent of your portfolio in three health-care companies. Have they been there long?
A. I never bought a drug stock in my life until two years ago. And at that point, there was nothing but fear that the Federal health care reform was going to wipe out profits. That gave us an almost unique opportunity to buy some of the world's best pharmaceutical companies very cheaply.
They've come back. We sold off Schering-Plough, but we still have Merck, Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer. I would classify them today as excellent highly profitable businesses that are moderately cheap.

TRADE
Conoco Gets Its Wrist Slapped
Boy hits little sister on head. Father scolds him. Boy, a budding defense lawyer, says, "You didn't tell me not to hit little sister on the head." Conoco's recent oil deal with Iran had a bit of that flavor: Iran has been firmly in the doghouse for a decade and a half, but no, nobody said, "Thou shalt not make this kind of deal." Conoco went ahead. So last week, after cries of anger on many fronts, the Administration made it perfectly clear: Don't hit little sisters on the head, don't stick beans in your ears and don't make such deals with Iran. Conoco promptly backed off. 

TIMING
And Now, a Tip From Baring
Newspapers have it easy: Something happens, it's in print within hours. But pity, for a brief moment, the folks who put out those glossy bound reports -- so much can happen in the weeks between cup and lip. Take a report that landed in the mail last week, one that hinted strongly of time travel: the first of its two picks for the world's "best developed stock markets" was Japan. That, to put it mildly, seems a bit odd when you notice that the issuer of the report was Baring Securities, which, you may recall, had a bit of trouble when one of its young go-getters bet big on Japanese stocks. And that was nearly three weeks ago.
 
AFTER THE DELUGE
Far More Than Pricey Broccoli
It's been said that California is simply too precarious to live in, and that certainly seemed the case in last week's killer floods. But people do live there, so the economic costs must be sorted out. First estimates of mopping up are $2 billion or so, including at least $350 million in damage. Broccoli and other items might be costlier, but not for too long. But the real pain will be for homeowners without flood insurance -- there are a lot of those -- and for farm workers. When things dry out, most people's jobs will be intact, but many of the state's 40,000 farm workers will lose their livelihood. In the words of one grower, "They don't really have anywhere to go."
 
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
White Men Still Jump
"You do not have to be a brain surgeon to deduce that something is wrong out there," said Bob Dole, referring to workplace discrimination. That was in 1991, when he helped create the Glass Ceiling Commission to look into it. But last week -- as he proposed an end to affirmative action for women and minorities -- Mr. Dole, a white male, said, "The race-counting game has gone too far." How far is too far? Well, that commission made its report last week, and for all the screams by white males about being an endangered species, it seems that they're still running the corporate show. Even though white women are now 40 percent of the work force, white men hold 95 percent of top management positions. These men, the report said, see women and minorities as "a direct threat" to their career goals.
 
CHARITY
Yale Has to Say, 'No, Thanks'
As donations flow to colleges and universities, that old axiom -- the rich get richer -- is in full flower. Why, just last week John Loeb, of Wall Street fame, and his wife, Frances, gave $70.5 million to Harvard, already the nation's richest university. For the Loebs -- he's 92, she's 88 -- that's most of their earthly wealth. Yale, though, got a bit poorer last week. Lee Bass -- yes, one of those Texas brothers -- had given $20 million to his alma mater four years ago, but he'd put strings on it: it was for more Western civilization courses. Those pushing multiculturalism didn't like that idea much, and the gift caused all sorts of trouble. And the last straw came recently when Mr. Bass tacked on a new condition: he'd approve the faculty. So Yale finally decided to give the money back -- plus interest.
 
CONGRESS
Attacking the Budget
The Republican budget-cutters moved solidly ahead last week, passing a record $17.3 billion in budget cuts for this year, but it may not prove the victory it seemed. Only six Democrats joined them, so the vote was 227 to 200 -- far short of what would be needed to survive a promised Clinton veto. The President said the measure would "cut too much people and not enough pork" -- since the cuts fall heavily on social welfare programs. But the Republicans weren't buying what they called the "rhetoric about compassion." Representative Gerald Solomon of New York asked, "What is so compassionate about saddling our children and grandchildren with such staggering debt?"
 
EDUCATION
New Way to Invest in Students
Education is looking more and more like just another business. For one thing, Christopher Whittle's Edison Project -- which recently seemed precarious -- said last week that it had gotten $30 million in financing and would open its first for-profit schools in the fall. Also last week, the S.E.C. approved the public sale of bonds backed by private student loans. And while Sallie Mae loans are based on both need and good credit, these loans have no such tests. The loans are offered by colleges and universities, and the bonds they back are issued by a nonprofit group called the National Collegiate Trust. The loan rates -- set by each college -- will probably be a bit higher.
 
AUTOS
Jobs Come, Jobs Go
The nation's auto industry seems to have a split personality these days -- it can't make some models fast enough, but many plants are still slated for closing. The sense of dislocation was readily apparent last week when 900 people lined up for jobs at General Motors' North Tarrytown plant. That's right -- the one G.M. says it's closing next year. What's up? Well, union workers -- the ones G.M. must stick by -- are gradually being offered transfers to other plants. But the assembly line must go on -- so it's hiring up to 1,500 temporary workers, and a lot of people want the jobs. The pay -- $12.90 an hour -- is about $6 less than union workers get, but it's far better than minimum wage. And as one applicant said, it's "better than standing on the welfare line."
 
TECHNOLOGY
Today's News? You Pick It
Yes, it's often said that people hear what they want to hear, see what they want to see. But that's just fuzzy psychology -- it has no place in a world overrun by technology. Today's computers allow you, more and more, to truly customize your own little universe. Want to watch the news, but don't care about half the stuff? Simple. Create your own newscast. That's the goal of Oracle, the software company, which is talking to various telephone, computer and news outfits about setting up a nationwide service that would let PC users pick and choose items for a video newscast. Want some crime? Click once for a dose of blood and cops. Something heartwarming? A lost-puppy-found tale is surely available. Nonstop O.J.? Well, of course.
 
THE NUMBERS
It All Adds Up for the Dow
It's often hard to know what the markets want from the economic numbers, but last week's mix seemed to be the right one. The numbers showed strength in factory production, but only moderate inflation, with consumer and producer prices both up just 0.3 percent for February. That signaled that things were on track for annual inflation, as hoped, to stay under 3.5 percent. And those who feel better if things cool off a bit got just that in a report that housing starts had slowed. What this added up to in the markets was three more record closes for the Dow industrials, which closed the week comfortably above the 4,000 threshold at 4,073.

Plastic That Pays You Back May Not Be Your Best Payoff

BYLINE: BY SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
WOULD you sign up for a weight-loss program that promises you can eat as many gallons of chocolate ice cream as you want because all the extra pounds will melt away -- after 20 years?
The Mellon Bank of Pittsburgh is making a variation on that offer with its unusual Cornerstone Mastercard, which promises to let you indulge now and get back all the finance charges you pay over the years. For people struggling to make their credit card payments, it sounds great. And 700,000 people have taken the card. 
 But there are two significant catches. First, you have to wait 20 years before you can get the full rebate, although a partial rebate is possible after only two years. Second, the interest charged is much higher than average, and almost double that of the best offers in the market.
The Cornerstone card charges the prime rate plus 11.9 percentage points, which would be 20.9 percent today given the current 9 percent prime. Mellon's gold Cornerstone card charges prime plus 8.9.
Standard pricing these days is 7 to 10 points above prime. And there are a number of cards that offer rates of no more than 5 points above prime.
With the rebate, a few people could come out ahead if they stay with Mellon's deal for five years or more, but consumer advocates say don't bother.
"There is so much competition out there," says Ruth Susswein, director of the Bankcard Holders of America, Salem, Va. "The low-rate offers are far more tempting than getting your interest back down the road but paying a high rate now."
Because inflation eats away at the value of money year after year, a dollar is worth more today than it will be 20 years from now. What's more, you are taking the risk that Mellon will continue the program and even continue to exist for two decades. The bank reserves the right to change the terms, charge higher interest or cancel the plan altogether, leaving you little choice but to cash out with a partial rebate.
Moreover, you have to remain attentive. You will lose your entire rebate if you don't use the card for any 12-month period in that 20 years.
As an alternative, Ms. Susswein pointed to the Wachovia Bank, of Winston-Salem, N.C., which offers cards with rates of prime plus 3.9 percentage points (12.9 percent today) for an $18 annual fee. The bank offers other cards with even lower rates in return for higher fees.
It's rarely a good idea to get into a deal you don't understand, and the sheer complexity is one good reason to avoid the Cornerstone card. It takes a penchant for algebra or nimble fingers on the spreadsheet to figure out how much the Cornerstone card actually costs. Whether it's a good deal depends on how long you keep it and what the interest rate is of the card you would use instead.
Kerry Ryan, senior vice president for credit cards at Mellon, says the Cornerstone card is a better deal than a standard card with a rate four or five points lower if you keep it for three to seven years.
But a truly low-rate card, like the one from Wachovia, beats Mellon's basic card no matter what.
Let's say you have a constant balance of $2,500. On the regular Cornerstone card, at current rates, you would pay $523 a year in interest. If you had the Wachovia prime plus 3.9 card, you would pay $323 a year, savings $200.
But what if you kept each card for five years? You would pay Mellon $2,613 in interest, and you would be entitled to a rebate of 25 percent of that amount, or $653. That's a nice rebate, but the Wachovia card would have saved you $347 more, even before any interest you might have earned by investing the savings.
But why invest the savings? Consider doing something really bold, namely paying off that balance. If you took the Wachovia card and applied the $200 a year you saved in interest to your balance, in five years you would have slashed the amount owed by more than half and would have saved $640 more than with the Cornerstone card, even after the rebate. In eight years, the bill would be paid off.
Such savings will buy a lot of ice cream. Or aerobics classes. Or both.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
Are You Your Own Boss? Only if the I.R.S. Says So

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
IT'S a question, it might seem, that only an accounting professor could love: when is a job a job, and when is it a business deal?
But for five million Americans who consider themselves their own boss, the issue is much more than an academic curiosity. It's a matter of money. 
 For the past 10 years, the Internal Revenue Service has been busily stripping away the tax advantages that have been enjoyed by more than a million doctors, computer programmers and others who sell their services as independent contractors. The I.R.S. has decided that these contractors are actually employees of the hospitals and businesses for which they work. And employees can't deduct most business expenses and travel costs, or shelter serious money for retirement, as contractors can. All of which translates into many more tax dollars for the agency.
The contractors, not surprisingly, don't like this development a bit, and their lawyers have made it the most contentious employment tax issue in the nation today.
But there is another group of contractors who would like nothing better than to be employees -- the poor ones like farm workers, janitors and seamstresses toiling in Brooklyn sweatshops.
Many of these workers want to be employees just to be covered by the minimum wage laws. As employees, they also would have taxes withheld from their pay, making them eligible for jobless, disability and old-age benefits.
But the I.R.S. is not spending much time reclassifying these low-wage people. Why? Because their tax bills are so small that the issue is not an agency priority.
"The service does take into account the practicalities of where to place its resources to get the best long-term results in encouraging compliance," explained the I.R.S.'s chief spokesman, Frank Keith.
In other words, there are five million people whose job status may be in question. Some want to remain as independent contractors; the I.R.S. is turning them into employees. Some want to become employees; the agency is continuing to call them independent contractors.
This leaves virtually everyone angry, and that includes the I.R.S. The agency is trying to apply tax laws that were largely written for an age of manual work and factories to an era of intellectual labor, often conducted in home offices.
And while Congress has held repeated hearings on the problem, more than two dozen tax experts and lobbyists said in interviews that they did not expect corrective legislation this year.
This is just one example of how the classification of workers for tax purposes has vexed businesses and individuals for many years. The problem began in the 1960's, when the I.R.S. started looking at the underground economy -- home gardeners, nannies -- as a source of unreported income and uncollected taxes.
In the 1970's the issue expanded, as some companies began paying significant numbers of workers as independent contractors in order to avoid a growing list of payroll and other taxes.
And the problem persists today. Laws that no one likes remain on the books. Business owners are distracted from their jobs by time-consuming tax intricacies. Workers and bosses cross swords over who wanted which job classification. Here is how three people have had their lives -- and their pocketbooks -- shaped by the continuing confusion:
Dale B. Rostad likes living in Bloomington, Minn. And so when his employer asked him in 1982 to transfer to Boston to work in its finance department, he quit. But the company did give him a contract to work on its computers while he remained in Minnesota and, with that first customer, Mr. Rostad founded his own computer services business.
Today Mr. Rostad, 41, has a long list of clients for his company, Business & Business Systems Consulting. Last year, though, one minor client paid him $6,000 as an independent contractor. And now the I.R.S. is trying to make him an employee of that company.
That worries Mr. Rostad for two reasons. If the I.R.S. does this with all his clients, then he will lose all the tax deductions he gets as an independent contractor -- deductions upon which he and his business have come to depend. But he also has more work than he can handle on occasion, and when he does he sometimes farms this work out to others. And he worries that the I.R.S. may do to him what it did to his $6,000 client: reclassify as employees the people he retains as independent contractors.
The uncertainty creates headaches for a busy businessman.
The law at issue is Section 1706 of the Internal Revenue Code, which targets computer programmers, engineers and other technical services workers. The law requires them to pass a 20-part test for distinguishing between employees and independent contractors.
For example, if Mr. Rostad's hired programmer travels to the client's facility, the I.R.S. hears "employee." If Mr. Rostad pays him by the job instead of the hour, that means "contractor." If the programmer submits a report to Mr. Rostad, that means "employee." If he does work for others, though, "contractor" it probably is. And on and on.
The laundry list certainly distracts Mr. Rostad from his business, but the stakes are indisputably high. If Mr. Rostad guesses wrong and his programmers are deemed employees, he will be on the hook to pay taxes for unemployment compensation, workers' compensation and Social Security. At worst these levies can kill a business; at best they can hobble it competitively.
Mr. Rostad's solution is to limit the size of his business. That results in less income for himself and the I.R.S.
"I do a little bit of farming work out, but I don't let it grow ," Mr. Rostad said. "I know there is a lot of business out there, but getting it just is not worth the hassles with the Government."
Christine Macke, a registered nurse who owns a nurse-placement agency, said her company would be 50 percent larger if it were not for another tax law, Section 530. Under that statute, her competitors can treat workers as independent contractors if they formed their companies in 1977 or before.
But Mrs. Macke's enterprise, Med-Force, of Arlington, Va., was launched in 1987. And so her company, which places nurses in temporary jobs, is of modest size, with a work roster equal only to about 50 full-time jobs.
"I have had large contracts I have been underbid on because the law lets some of my competitors have independent contractor status," she said, thus freeing them from Social Security and other taxes. The handicap "forced me to redirect my business away from traditional medical-surgical and intensive-care staffing to a niche market, psychiatric staffing."
Confusion reigns over this tax question, too. Mrs. Macke doubted that any nurse, at a hospital or elsewhere, can really be an independent contractor no matter how old his or her company is. Why? Because nurses work at the direction of physicians.
A hallmark of independent contractors -- indeed, it is a main theme of the 20-part test Mr. Rostad must puzzle over -- is that they can proceed as they see fit as long as they get the job done, while employees must follow the detailed directions of bosses.
Ramiro Murillo, a native of Mexico, was paid $200 to $250 a week as an independent contractor to hoe weeds and do other work for Robert and Pat Criswell, who live near Plainview, Texas. Now the I.R.S. is garnishing his pay at his new job; the agency says he and his wife, Berene, owe $3,155.80 in taxes, penalties and interest from that past job.
Mr. Murillo told a Congressional committee that he asked the Criswells to deduct his taxes, but they declined. In 1990 he was fired.
When he applied for unemployment, "they said I could not get benefits because nothing was submitted under my Social Security number," Mr. Murillo testified, through an interpreter,
Kay Drought, an attorney with Texas Rural Legal Services, said Mr. Murillo eventually received his jobless benefits. But that has become a hollow victory because his wages are being garnisheed. "They are having trouble getting enough money together just to eat," she said.
Tens of thousands of farm workers in Texas are still paid as independent contractors, she said.
But, here too, there is confusion and finger-pointing. Robert Criswell said in an interview that Mr. Murillo did not want any taxes withheld from his checks. He said this was a common request among farm workers in the Texas Panhandle who emigrate from Mexico but who plan to return there someday.

Charts: "What You Are. . ."
The Internal Revenue Service uses a 20-part test to see if a person is an independent contractor or an employee. Here are some of the elements.
 
WHOSE RULES?
If a worker must follow rules about the manner of work -- the how, when and where -- that's a sign of an employee. But an independent contractor can proceed as he wishes, as long as the job gets done.
 
ENDING IT.
Most employees can be fired or quit without reason or notice. But with independent contractors, both the worker and the company must follow their agreement's rules about when and why they can part ways.
 
OTHER GIGS.
You are more likely to be considered an independent contractor if you are able to work for more than one busoness at a time, the I.R.S. says. But an employee often works full time, or must be available to do so.
 
WHOSE TOOLS?
Do you furnish your own tools and material for your work? Then the I.R.S. hears "independent contractor."
 
RISKY BUSINESS
Independent contractors make make money or lose money on a job. But employees will get their paychecks however a project turns out.
 
". . .and Why It Matters"
Some major differences in the tax treatment of an independent contractor and an empployee.
 
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR
Can deduct work expenses
Makes quarterly estimated tax payments
Pays full Social Security and Medicare taxes
May be able to deduct part of residence as home office
Can shelter 15 percent of income, up to $30,000, for retirement
Can deduct work-related travel
 
COMPANY EMPLOYEE
First 2 percent of work expenses not deductible, and the deduction is phased out above $55,900 in income ($111,800 for couples)
Taxes withheld by employer
Pays only half of Social Security and Medicare taxes; other half paid by employer
Hard to qualify for home officer deduction
Retirement savings usually capped at $9,500 or less
no deduction for paying salaries to other people
Can deduct only unreimbursed travel expenses

HEADLINE: Parents, Schools And the 'Extras'

 BODY:
Re: "A New Way to Pay for School Extras" (Feb. 26): The energetic, enthusiastic fund-raising efforts of all these volunteers for their children and the schools they attend are commendable but misguided.
If they truly wanted to achieve economic efficiencies, and lower their property tax bills in the bargain, they would seriously address two overriding issues: first, the inane duplication of educational efforts that makes virtually every community in the state a school district, frequently without any logical basis; and second, the economic ramifications of this duplication, which create a highly paid superintendent and almost as highly paid principals plus support staffs in each of the about 600 districts. 
 That a large number of these superintendents earn as much as New Jersey's Governor and Education Commissioner, yet have far, far less supervisory responsibility and almost no direct accountability to taxpayers/voters, is worse than illogical. It is ludicrous.

If Gingrich Only Knew About Victoria's Secret

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI 

 BODY:
It wasn't so long ago that the term "Victorian" was a pejorative one, conjuring up images of Dickensian slums, uptight moralists, pompous prigs, paternalistic moralizers, fussy architecture and overstuffed furniture. Taking our cue from Lytton Strachey -- whose classic book "Eminent Victorians" (1918) lanced that era's pretentions with malicious wit -- we tended to shrug off the Victorians as sanctimonious imperialists or faintly ridiculous prudes.
 All this is changing now, and it's not just the current vogue in Pre-Raphaelite paintings, Laura Ashley furnishings, Gothic revival architecture and neo-Victorian novels. Victorianism has suddenly become a social model -- for both the left and right. 
 The Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, has not only praised that most Dickensian of institutions, the orphanage, but last week he also hailed the Victorians' "moral leadership," their willingness "to look at people In the face and say, 'You should be ashamed when you get drunk in public; you ought to be ashamed if you're a drug addict.' "
 His remarks, as he acknowledged, owe a decided debt to the arguments laid out by the historian Gertrude Himmelfarb in her new book "The De-Moralization of Society: From Victorian Virtues to Modern Values" (Alfred A. Knopf). Ms. Himmelfarb's arguments, in turn, recall those of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher during the 1980's, hailing the "Victorian values" of hard work, self-reliance, thrift, self-respect, neighborliness and national pride.

 
 
Women on a Pedestal
 But Victorian values, or at least our perception of them, belong not just to the right wing. On the left, radical feminists like Catherine MacKinnon, Andrea Dworkin and Robin Morgan are promoting views of women that consciously or unconsciously recall Victorian sexual stereotypes. Not only do many of these feminists want to ban pornography and curtail free speech in the name of protecting women, but they also promulgate a kind of sexual paranoia, suggesting that men are beasts and women are in constant danger of physical or emotional rape.
 As Katie Roiphe pointed out in "The Morning After: Sex, Fear, and Feminism on Campus" (Little, Brown), some of the current pamphlets warning college women of date rape are reminiscent of those Victorian guides to conduct that used to teach young women how to avoid "vulgar familiarity." Rene Denfeld goes even further. In her new book "The New Victorians" (Warner Books), she writes that "the women's movement has come to duplicate Victorianism in all its repressive glory: the woman revered on the pedestal, charged with keeping society's moral order yet politically powerless and perpetually martyred."
 What's behind this Victorian revival? In part, of course, it's simple nostalgia for a seemingly simpler, more innocent age -- a time when the notions of progress and technology could still summon hope instead of anxiety, the last era before the terrors of the 20th century were brought home by two World Wars. The Victorian era seems, at once, close enough to embody recognizable problems, and yet distant enough to elicit more than just the sort of knee-jerk, filial rebellion purveyed by members of Bloomsbury.
 But is it Victorianism that we are reviving or a caricature? As A.N. Wilson noted in his recent book "Eminent Victorians" (W.W. Norton & Company), a kind of response to Lytton Strachey's book of the same title, popular attitudes toward the Victorian age have been strongly shaped (until recently at least) by the savagely satirical portraits drawn by Strachey, Virginia Woolf and their peers. The problem with much of the current commentary on the Victorians, both pro and con, is that it tends to be similarly arbitrary, selective and in some cases, downright cartoon-like.
 In "The Rise of Selfishness in America" (Oxford University Press), the jazz historian and social critic James Lincoln Collier attributes most of our current social ills to the demise of the Victorian belief system and its replacement by "the new ethic of the self," but he virtually ignores such 19th-century realities as child labor, debilitating poverty and high unemployment, noting simply that the Victorians prided themselves on "a willingness to protect the weak."

 
 
Cleanliness Without Sanitation
 As for Ms. Himmelfarb, she has written with great subtlety and insight about the Victorians in the past, but in her new book and recent essays, she seriously downplays the era's gross social inequities and the often yawning gap between its professed values and its day-to-day realities.
 She writes in one op-ed piece, for instance, that "we might rediscover the ideas of cleanliness and orderliness, which Victorians elevated to the level of virtues," and yet she overlooks the fact that for most of the poor, simple sanitation was often an unaffordable luxury.
 She also asserts that the Victorians managed to achieve "a substantial decline" in illegitimacy rates, neglecting to deal with the findings presented by Michael Mason in his new book "The Making of Victorian Sexuality" (Oxford University Press): during the first half of the 19th century, he writes, prenuptial pregnancy was prevalent; 40 percent of the brides in many small English town were pregnant before they were married, and "in some areas the rate pushed up past the half-way point as the century advanced."
 In fact the work of such scholars as Peter Gay, Steven Marcus and Thomas Boyle has revealed that beneath the prim, respectable surface of Victorian life were deep currents of sensuality and even violence -- currents that have been glossed over by many recent commentators on Victorian values. Rene Denfeld's attack on what she calls neo-Victorian feminists, for instance, revolves around the Victorian ideal of feminine purity; she never really comes to terms with the fact that that cliched image of frigid frailty often belied a spirited interest in sex.
 In calling for a revival of Victorian values, does Mr. Gingrich realize everything that his support may embrace? What would he think of Mr. Wilson's observation that in England, divorces could not be obtained through the law courts until 1857 or his finding that women were not given equal guardianship of their children until 1925? What would he make of Mr. Marcus's assertion that pornographic writings were "produced and published in unprecedented volume" during the middle and latter decades of the 19th century? Or of his finding that "there grew up in the latter part of the Victorian period a veritable and unique cult of homosexuality" whose "influence in the society at large was in disproportion to the number of its members"?

 
 
Diversity and Perversity
 No doubt a measure of reductionism and over-generalization adheres to any historical inquiry, but Victorian England seems particularly resistant to easy characterization, for it was a culture in flux, a culture that changed fundamentally between the beginning and end of Victoria's long reign from 1837 to 1901. As Ms. Himmelfarb herself has pointed out in an earlier book called "Victorian Minds," "it managed, at different times and in different degrees, to absorb quite distinct and even contrary ideas, ideologies, sentiments, and policies." Indeed, "the Victorian age exhibited, and not at its periphery but at its very center, all the diversity, and much of the perversity, of which the human mind is capable."
 While the Victorians were grappling with problems that may appear to be familiar to us (growing urbanization, accelerating social changes, concerns about education and health) they also inhabited a vastly different world, a world that was far less heterogenous, far less egalitarian than our own. Analogies between that age and our own can, therefore, be highly deceptive.
 In fact the more one thinks about the Victorians, the more one is inclined to agree with the British novelist L.P. Hartley, who once declared: "the past is a foreign country; they do things differently there."

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Name That Era;
Pinpointing A Moment On the Map Of History

BYLINE: By JAMES ATLAS 

 BODY:
WHEN does an era end? Sometimes a momentous event -- the beginning of the Civil War, the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt -- provides the definitive finale to what historians can later give a name -- the Antebellum period, the Age of Roosevelt. The end of the Cold War had a literal end: on Dec. 25, 1991, the Soviet Union "went out of business," as the historian Michael Beschloss puts it, and the red flag was lowered over the Kremlin, never to be raised again.
 But what about the era we find ourselves in now? Historians and journalists operate on the assumption that world politics has entered a new phase, that we find ourselves in a pattern of events radically distinct from that of the last 50 years. The trouble is, it doesn't yet have a compelling name. The phrase routinely employed by political pundits -- the post-cold war era -- is tentative, vague; it lacks authority. Unlike, say, the Era of Good Feelings (1815-1825), when the United States dwelled in apparent harmony, untroubled by foreign wars and prosperous at home, the tepid label we reflexively invoke these days carries a suggestion of self-doubt. It's as if our own historical moment is somehow after the fact, overshadowed by the more significant era that preceded it. 
 Our age is fixated on the notion of being post-. The prefix is ubiquitous. The cultural critic Russell Jacoby, writing in Harper's magazine, remarks on the pervasive influence of "poststructuralist, post-Marxist, and post-everything thinkers." Scan the shelves of any decent bookstore and you're likely to find these titles: "Postmodernism," "Post-Modernist Fiction," "A Poetics of Postmodernism," "Postmodernist Culture."
 But isn't this obsession with post-ness simply another way of acknowledging that we don't know where we are? Aren't the labels we apply -- the Renaissance, the Age of Exploration -- simply titles for narratives that historians have contrived to unify the disparate events of an arbitrarily designated age?
 "History is lived forward, but it is written in retrospect," wrote the great English historian C. V. Wedgwood in "William the Silent," her biography of William of Orange, the 16th-century liberator of the Netherlands. "We know the end before we consider the beginning and we can never wholly recapture what it was to know the beginning only." In "The Proud Tower," Barbara Tuchman's magisterial "Portrait of the World Before the War, 1890-1914," the author created a portrait of an age of optimism without referring to the then-invisible slide toward Armageddon in which it would end. Why? Because "it was not a part of the experience of the people of this book. I have tried to stay within the terms of what was known at the time." That kind of approach would put journalists and political commentators out of business.
 This tendency to identify as eras the short bursts of experience that live in our memory is a new phenomenon in historical scholarship.
 "The concept of generations has only recently emerged as a unit of historical analysis," Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. writes in "The Cycles of American History." But with the increased pace of change, the need to impose a narrative on events becomes more urgent than ever. To name an era is to classify what otherwise feels random, to give what is still indistinct a clear identity.
 Compare and contrast -- as they say on exams -- the approach taken by Stanley Hoffmann, the chairman of Harvard's Center for European Studies and that taken by Samuel Huntington, the Eaton Professor of the Science of Government at Harvard, to categorize the era we are entering. Professor Huntington -- in an essay portentously titled "The Clash of Civilizations?" which appeared in the journal Foreign Affairs in 1993 -- tries to find a pattern in events that haven't happened yet. Ideological struggles are being replaced by cultural struggles, he argues. The political boundaries of the cold war are being replaced by "fault lines" between Western and Orthodox Christianity, Western and Islamic civilizations: "The Velvet Curtain of culture has replaced the Iron Curtain of ideology as the most significant dividing line in Europe."
 Professor Hoffmann offers a very different scenario. "On the one hand you have disintegrating states, fragmentation, and ethnic conflict," he says. "Then you have a trend that goes in the opposite direction -- the formation of a huge transnational capitalist economy that consists largely of private investors and private banks that can move money around the world in a matter of minutes. So that when we talk about nation-states we're really talking about only a small amount of what goes on across borders these days." In essence, he says, it is "a completely unprecedented world. It's very difficult to call this world anything." But if he must? "When you don't know what a thing is, you call it post-something else."

 
 
Some Other Event
 All definitions are provisional, limited by our inability to see beyond the moment. We are "prisoners of our own epoch," as Mr. Schlesinger observed. What we now think of as the post-cold war era may well turn out to have been defined by some other event. Are we already in the Age of Global Communication? Of Balkanization? Of Religious War? Of Social Austerity? Or several of the above. What Mr. Schlesinger named "the Age of Roosevelt" could have been named the Age of Fascism or the Age of Totalitarianism. The main event of our age, its consequences as yet ungrasped, could be the carnage in the Balkans, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism or the unraveling of European unity.
 There is a certain narcissistic pleasure in thinking of ourselves as living past the end -- as outliving history. "The grand narratives have become scarcely credible," writes the French theorist Jean-Francois Lyotard in "The Postmodern Explained." Francis Fukuyama claimed, in his grandly titled book, that we are living at "The End of History." The events of the 20th century -- world wars, totalitarianism, the Holocaust -- have consigned us to an existence on the margins of history; but they've also given us a special place in its narrative. George Steiner, in "Language and Silence," put the matter with stark simplicity: "We come after."
 But isn't it possible to imagine ourselves coming before? In his memoir, "Present at the Creation," Dean Acheson, Truman's Secretary of State, described the period between 1941 and 1952 as one of "great obscurity." "Not only was the future clouded, a common enough situation, but the present was equally clouded." In other words, a situation very much like ours. Yet for Mr. Acheson, the "disorderly and uncontrollable world" also offered challenges. The Marshall Plan would usher in "the dawn of a revivification unparalleled in modern history." Mr. Acheson compared "the mood of the beginning, of the early postwar period of action," to an earlier period of human energy: the Elizabethan Age, a time of "ignorance of the true situation, daring, and buoyant determination."
 What the vision of a posthumous world omits is the possibility of innovation. In this sense, Mikhail Gorbachev is a consummate transitional figure, a political artist who breaks down our way of seeing and invents new categories. The reports of his struggle to emerge from obscurity are a reminder of the transformations that have swept the world since he presided over the demise of the Soviet Union only four years ago. Are the recent peace initiatives in South Africa and Ireland and on the West Bank imaginable without him?
 Mr. Gorbachev's achievement is a perfect instance of the post-modern as defined by Lyotard: "The text he writes or the work he creates is not in principle governed by pre-established rules and cannot be judged according to a determinant judgment, by the application of given categories to this text or work."
 The legacy of perestroika -- the realignment of world powers, the unleashing of nationalism, the global outbreaks of freedom and anarchy -- has yet to be interpreted by historians; it lacks a title. But maybe it doesn't need one. As Mr. Beschloss says: "Only when you're past a period can you look back and do something so bold as to name it."

HEADLINE: The World;
Do Fickle Markets Now Make Policy?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE domino theory is alive and worried about in Washington.
 A generation ago, the fear was over Vietnam and whether its fall to Communism would inevitably take Thailand or Malaysia or Indonesia with it. The Vietnam of the economic age is Mexico, and the insurgents are brandishing not AK-47's and ideology but "hot money." That is what Wall Street calls the billions of dollars that investors move in and out of countries in minutes. And suddenly the task of trying to direct or at least contain that flow before it topples the next domino is remaking the conduct of American foreign policy. 
 To a degree rarely seen before, bond traders and the currency markets are driving policy, rather than reacting to it. For the evidence, just look at the faxes that that have been exchanged in recent weeks between officials at the Treasury Department and the leaders of Mexico, Argentina and Brazil. In Mexico's case, Treasury officials led President Ernesto Zedillo to the unhappy conclusion that he had to spark a deep recession -- sending interest rates on credit cards to upwards of 100 percent, bringing imports to a near halt -- if he had any hope of luring scared investors back into the country. Drastic measures have also been prescribed in Argentina, which just swallowed hard, accepted a $7 billion bailout package from the International Monetary Fund, and prayed that investors would stop fleeing the country in herds.
 In short, these days countries are often finding that they have to destroy prosperity in order to save it. In Mexico, that means laying off hundreds of thousands of people in the name of paying off the short-term bonds that the country sold with abandon last year. "It is a whole new set of priorities," said a Clinton Administration official. "Forget everything you learned about how to help developing nations. Now it's Fidelity first."

 
 
Can We Talk?
 Is this really the message America wants to send around the world? "It's a good question, and one we discuss a lot," said Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, the onetime co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, who has played this game from both sides of the table. "It is tempting to say that markets don't care about the social considerations, about schools or income disparities. But I think the truth is a little different. Don't get me wrong, we're not talking about investors with a conscience. But they want to get their money back, so they are interested in all the financial pieces, but also in what this will do to social and political stability. And in the end, I'm not sure the priorities are so different."
 Whether Mr. Rubin is right or not, ever since the Mexico debacle you cannot walk through Wall Street without tripping over Latin American leaders trying to convince investors to bring their billions back, or at least not suck away what little is left. Several made the trip last week; Peru's President, Alberto Fujimori, came just to make the case that his country is not like Mexico.
 But the fact that they come at all reveals how much has changed. When the Latin debt crisis struck a decade ago, all the lenders, representing the world's biggest banks, got into a room, negotiated austerity measures and reluctantly granted the countries time to work things out.
 In the '90's, bankers don't matter; markets do. "This isn't a situation where you can sit down and reason with someone, because there is no one to talk to," said Joan Spero, the Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs. "Have you ever tried to get a market into a hotel room?"
 But the harsh truth, as the Mexicans are learning, is that almost no amount of austerity will convince most investors to return. What fund manager will risk his job on the bet that Mexico is getting its act together -- especially when Indonesia is hot, India looks like a cheap Silicon Valley and Germany has become a safe haven of strong currency? As one fund manager said, "No one is going to get fired for staying out of Mexico."
 That is the price the country is paying for decisions made in the last days of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. He bet that he could keep the peso artificially high by hiding bad but complex news about the economy. He is now in self-imposed exile in the United States, sounding defensive.
 His biggest mistake was relying on hot money rather than following the example set by countries like China, Malaysia and Thailand -- who have urged foreign investors to invest in factories and other assets that cannot be swept out the country with a few strokes of the keyboard. A senior European finance official, however, blames not only the Mexicans but the industrialized nations that bailed the country out in the 1980's. "It is like being a doctor, and giving the patient a heart transplant, which is what we did a decade ago," he said. "You would expect that the doctor should be checking things out every year or so. But we were all so enthralled by the success of the operation that no one did a check-up."

 
 
Keeping Secrets
 Even when the doctors dropped by, Mexico set the rules: no X-rays, no blood tests. The Salinas Government carefully kept key statistics out of the public domain -- how much its foreign reserves had been depleted to prop up the peso, how dependent it had become on short-term money from abroad. The shell game deceived even the I.M.F.
 "The whole surveillance process did not work the way it should have," Karin Lissakers, the chief United States representative to the I.M.F., said last week. "We were too tolerant" of Mexico's reluctance to turn over vital numbers.
 Someone did see and understand many of the warning signs -- the United States Treasury. It has turned over hundreds of pages of documents to Congress, detailing warning after warning to the Salinas Government. Yet no one dared utter a word in public. In fact, President Clinton lauded Mexico's economic reforms at the Latin summit meeting in November.
 The case for silence is simple: Public warnings may trigger the rush for the exits that everyone is trying to prevent. But by keeping Mexico's secrets, the United States likely contributed to the ferocity of the ensuing panic.
 Mr. Rubin hopes that Mexico's extraordinary pain is sending a message. "I think there is no question that people who govern other countries, when they see what Mexico is having to do, are going to feel an enormous incentive to maintain sound policies," he said. Otherwise, he will be left to pick up the dominoes.

HEADLINE: African Democracies Worry Western Aid Will Evaporate

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: BAMAKO, Mali

 BODY:
For the three decades that constituted the infancy of African independence, Washington and its allies preached the virtues of democracy while supporting many of Africa's most corrupt one-party regimes, invoking the strategic considerations of the cold war.
Now, with the Soviet Union no longer the opponent that justified this policy, democratic systems have taken root for the first time in a score of countries. But as these sub-Saharan nations face grave crises of debt, population growth, poverty and religious militancy, leaders in Washington and in the capitals of Western Europe are increasingly telling African governments that they will have to rely on their own meager resources to solve the continent's problems. 
 According to a recent report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which monitors Western aid, the net flow of assistance to developing countries fell to $55.96 billion in 1993, down from $60.85 billion the year before. Aid to all of Africa accounts for about $20 billion a year.
American assistance to sub-Saharan Africa has followed a similar trend, falling to $1.2 billion in 1992, the latest year for which complete figures are available, from a high of $1.72 billion in 1985. Last year, in a round of budget cuts that hit Africa more than any other continent, the United States Agency for International Development closed 8 of its African missions, leaving 27.
President Clinton's national security adviser, Anthony Lake, widely seen as sympathetic to Africa's development needs, summed up the Administration's concerns in a speech in December at the headquarters of the Organization of African Unity in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
"Those of us who recognize the importance of continued active engagement and support for Africa," he said, "are confronting the reality of shrinking resources and an honest skepticism about the return on our investments in peacekeeping and development. The world around Africa is fast coming together, and this continent risks becoming the odd man out."
Mr. Lake's comments followed the November elections, in which Republicans won control of Congress and began urging cuts in foreign aid, often singling out Africa.
As they struggle to carry out Western-prescribed economic reforms that focus on privatizing industry, trimming government payrolls and paying off the huge debts that benefited dictators' personal accounts, Africa's new generation of democratic leaders is warning that the growing indifference of the West imperils the continent's democratic spring.
A result, many say, will be the resurgence of military-led governments and a spread of misery and chaos throughout the continent.
"We are confronted with a series of grave inherited problems today, and if we do not receive the kind of help that we need, we will not make it," said Mali's President, Alpha Oumar Konare, an archeologist by training who was elected in 1992.
"This does not mean that we are stuck in a logic of eternal recipients, but the next two or three years will be critical for the future of democracy in Africa," he said. "So far there has been a lot of sympathy from the West, but there has been no real premium for democracies here."
Mali, a predominantly Muslim country of 9 million people who eke out an average per capita income of $280 a year and have a literacy rate of about 40 percent, is in many ways typical of the new democracies.
For decades development experts have spoken of Mali, with its long stretch of the Niger River winding through a fertile, flooded delta, as a potential breadbasket for a region that has long imported large quantities of grain. But if it is ever to fulfill this potential, development experts say, Mali will require new injections of foreign capital and much technical aid.
Diplomats also speak of this large landlocked country as a bulwark against the spread of Islamic militancy from its northern neighbor, Algeria. Already Mali faces a destabilizing conflict involving Tuareg tribesmen in the north, but any settlement has been thwarted by a lack of resources.
At the same time, Mali's debt burden, contracted under years of dictatorship, consumes so much of the country's revenues that there is little left for development needs.
Even though they have already sharply pared back their civil service, Malian officials say that giving priority to debt servicing, a requirement of staying in the good graces of Western financial institutions like the World Bank, has turned each month into a frantic juggling exercise to meet Government payrolls.
"Today our foreign debt is higher than our gross domestic product," said the Minister of Finance, Soumaila Cisse, who said 60 percent of fiscal receipts were used to service debt obligations.
"If we didn't have aid, we could not pay salaries. If we can't pay salaries, that means social disturbances, that means no scholarships for students, that means we give up on preparing for the future."
In the current climate in the West, few expect large new infusions of aid to countries like Mali. Many development experts say debt forgiveness, particularly for payments owed to the World Bank, the biggest lender to Africa, will go a long way toward helping some of Africa's poorest countries get back on their feet economically.
Officials with the World Bank say that they have long been in discussions with its leading contributors over debt relief, but that Western capitals have been unable to agree on a plan.
Already, many experts in the United States say inaction in the early part of this decade by the West may have squandered a crucial opportunity to help consolidate democracy in Africa.
"When you looked at Benin and Mali and Zambia and the experiences of several other places, it appeared at the beginning of the decade that what was happening in Africa would just overwhelm despotism," said Makau wa Mutua, director of the human rights project at Harvard Law School.
"The values so long preached by the West were being realized in fact, and many of us naively thought that the West would have shown patience in nurturing democratic movement, not just in Eastern Europe but in Africa too."
Instead, he and other critics say, after a burst of enthusiasm for the changes sweeping the continent, Washington and other Western capitals turned their interest elsewhere.
Experts like Mr. Mutua said the West's short-lived attention to Africa has had a doubly negative impact. On the one hand, dictators who might have been persuaded to make way for democratic systems interpreted the relative silence as acquiescence in their continued rule. The result, many say, has been a strengthening of autocratic leaders in Nigeria, Kenya, Zaire, Togo and Cameroon who have been able to hold out against the democratic trend.
On the other hand, the failure by the West to relieve economic misery in many newly democratic countries has discouraged Africans on democracy, and may ultimately fuel takeover attempts by new military or civilian dictators.
"In most of the countries where they have had elected democratic governments, the fundamental problem is that they are left with precisely the same economic and social problems they had before," said L. Gray Cowan, an expert in African affairs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
"When people see that the new democratic systems are not capable of resolving their problems, the risk is that they will quickly grow disillusioned."

HEADLINE: U.S. Pressing Iraq to Release Two Americans

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
Relying mainly on foreign intermediaries to negotiate with Baghdad, American officials continued their efforts today to win the release of two Americans being held in Iraq.
Secretary of Defense William J. Perry, who is in the Middle East on a weeklong diplomatic mission, said the two men were working for the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which has a contract to maintain Kuwaiti aircraft. 
 The Administration has asked the United Nations and Poland, which handles American interests in Iraq, to press President Saddam Hussein to release the Americans, who were seized Monday night just north of the Kuwait border. Washington has not had direct diplomatic relations since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
Some American officials say they fear that gaining the men's release could prove difficult because relations are so strained, especially after Washington persuaded the United Nations this week to maintain economic sanctions against Iraq.
"We're still hoping for an expeditious resolution of this," said Sondra F. McCarty, a spokeswoman for the State Department.
Mr. Perry, who was on his way to Saudi Arabia, said the Americans had been taken to Baghdad. "The report we get is that they are in good condition," he said. "I mean, they are not in any danger."
[In Baghdad, in the first official Iraqi comment on the two Americans, Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan acknowledged their capture and said, "Nothing much will happen to them," The Associated Press reported.]
Kathy Daliberti, of Jacksonville, Fla., told The Florida Times-Union on Friday that her husband, David Daliberti, 41, is one of the captives. In an interview today, she identified the other as Bill Barloon, of Iowa.
Talking about her husband, Mrs. Daliberti said, "It's just a terrible, terrible thing, and I am just about at my wit's end not knowing if he's all right and how they're treating him."
Mrs. Daliberti said her husband was employed by Kay Industries of Chicago, an airline maintenance company. American officials said Kay apparently is a subcontractor of McDonnell Douglas. The Administration has emphasized that the men are not Government employees and were not working on a Government contract.
Administration officials raised the question again today of how the men could have mistakenly entered Iraq, especially after Kuwait built a 16-foot-wide, 10-foot-deep trench last year along the 130-mile border.
American officials said the Americans had been driving a white Jeep similar to United Nations vehicles in the area, which apparently made it easier for them to pass through an Iraqi border checkpoint.
"As near as we can tell, it was a mistake, a blunder on their part," Secretary Perry said. "And the reason they got past the checkpoints was apparently they were mistaken for a U.N. vehicle. By the time they had realized their mistake they were in Iraq, and by that time the Iraqis realized they were not U.N. and arrested them."

HEADLINE: CATHOLIC BISHOPS CHALLENGE PIECES OF WELFARE BILL

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
As the House prepares for debate on welfare legislation next week, the leaders of the nation's Roman Catholic bishops today denounced parts of the Republican bill that could end cash assistance for many children born out of wedlock, unmarried teen-agers who have children and legal immigrants.
The bishops said they were speaking not as partisan political lobbyists but in an effort to illuminate "the moral dimensions and human consequences of this debate." 
 In the statement today, titled "Moral Principles and Policy Priorities for Welfare Reform," the bishops agreed that "the status quo is unacceptable" but said the Federal Government must not abandon its role in fighting poverty. They said the coming debate would be "a test of our nation's values and our commitment to the 'least among us.' "
The statement by the Administrative Board of the United States Catholic Conference, the top leadership of the nation's bishops, echoes the concerns of many Democrats who have criticized the bill on the ground that it would punish children for parents' behavior. That view is shared by diverse groups, including supporters and opponents of abortion rights, child welfare advocates and civil libertarians.
Despite such opposition, the bill is likely to be passed by the House. Its fate in the Senate, however, is far less certain, and the bishops' statement, which raises the concern that ending subsidies for children born to women on welfare would encourage abortions, could kindle opposition from conservative Republicans opposed to abortion rights.
The bill to be considered by the House would bar the use of Federal money to provide cash welfare benefits for a child born to a woman already receiving public assistance. Most states now provide extra money to indigent families for each additional child, and some Republicans say that encourages women to have more babies -- a contention disputed by the Children's Defense Fund and by some economists. The House bill would also deny cash assistance to children born out of wedlock to women younger than 18, and to the women as well.
The Roman Catholic Church, Catholic Charities USA, the National Right to Life Committee and opponents of abortion like Representative Christopher H. Smith of New Jersey say the proposed restrictions on welfare benefits would increase pressures on poor women to have abortions. They say that pressure would be particularly strong in states that pay for Medicaid abortions but not for the costs of rearing an additional child.
The bishops' criticism of the House bill, while not a surprise, is important because it is likely to influence debate in Congress. The Republicans have a majority in the House and can probably count on party discipline to pass the bill next week after an impassioned debate, but they may have to modify some important provisions.
In a signal to Republicans, the House majority leader, Dick Armey, and the majority whip, Tom DeLay, both from Texas, have indicated that they may support amendments to allow somewhat more generous treatment of children born to young unwed mothers and of children born to women already on welfare. The bishops' views could also sway the Senate, where members of both parties are still searching for the best way to deal with the problems of unwed teen-age mothers.
The Catholic hierarchy has been speaking out on issues of poverty and social equity for more than a century. It speaks with authority on both welfare and immigration policy. It resettles thousands of refugees and immigrants every year. Its churches and charitable agencies run hundreds of soup kitchens, food banks, orphanages and shelters for homeless people.
The bishops said they felt a special obligation to speak out now, as Congress begins debate on the bill known as the Personal Responsibility Act, which would reverse a 60-year trend toward increased Federal control of social welfare policy. The measure is projected to squeeze more than $50 billion from Federal welfare spending in the next five years.
"There's no question that some of what we're saying is running against the tide," said Bishop Howard J. Hubbard of Albany. "Unfortunately, those who will be most affected are not well organized and can't speak for themselves. If we don't make the point, I don't know who else will."
In his weekly radio address today, President Clinton focused on the importance of child support. "If deadbeat parents paid all the child support they should in this country, we could immediately move over 800,000 mothers and children off welfare," he said.
Mr. Clinton said Congress ought to require states to suspend the driver's licenses and professional licenses of parents who refuse to pay child support, and he criticized Republicans for not including such penalties in their bill.
Curiously, the more stringent aspects of the House bill have brought disparate political factions together in opposition. For instance, Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, said the measure was unacceptably harsh on children. And in a recent interview, Mr. Smith, a Republican who was director of the Right to Life Committee in New Jersey from 1976 to 1978, said: "I don't think you should use the child as a pawn in trying to influence the mother's behavior. These proposals are inhumane, and unless they are fixed, I will vote no on the overall bill."
Assessing likely effects of the bill, the Department of Health and Human Services said today that cash benefits would be denied to 2.2 million children born to women already receiving welfare. About 70,000 children born out of wedlock would lose benefits, it said. A separate provision, which sets a five-year limit on cash benefits for any family, would eventually deny aid to more than four million children, it said.
But Republicans said those estimates were flawed because they took no account of changes in behavior likely to occur as the Government encourages work and marriage and reduces its subsidy for out-of-wedlock births.
The measure would give states vast new authority to design their own food assistance and cash welfare programs using Federal money. The main cash assistance program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, created in 1935, and the national school lunch program, created in 1946, with all their Federal rules and guarantees, would be scrapped.
So far Republicans have deflected Democratic criticism with the argument that the current welfare system is a complete failure because it traps people in poverty.
But Sharon M. Daly, deputy director of Catholic Charities USA, said, "Members of Congress are stunned to see pro-life and pro-choice groups arguing against the same provisions of the House welfare bill for different reasons."
The abortion opponents have championed "the rights of unborn children." Abortion rights groups have emphasized reproductive freedom for women. Both have expressed concern for children.
In today's statement the bishops said, "Denying needed benefits for children born to mothers on welfare can hurt the children and pressure their mothers toward abortion and sterilization."
Commenting on the same proposal, Ann F. Lewis, vice president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said, "We oppose any attempts by government to coerce reproductive decisions."
The Catholic Church, the Council of Jewish Federations and Hispanic groups like the National Council of La Raza also oppose provisions of the House bill that would make many legal immigrants ineligible for welfare benefits, food stamps and Medicaid. The bishops said, "We cannot support punitive approaches that target immigrants, even legal residents, and take away the minimal benefits that they now receive."
The Catholic Church also expressed grave concern about an important feature of the House Republican bill that would end the guarantee of cash assistance for poor women and children who meet eligibility criteria set by law. The church said it could not support welfare legislation that ends such entitlements, especially if the Federal Government lets states reduce their commitment at the same time.
The church is supporting two amendments that would relax the bill's prohibition on aid to children born to unmarried teen-agers and to current welfare recipients.
One, proposed by Mr. Smith, would allow states to provide assistance in the form of vouchers for goods and services needed by a child born to a woman already on welfare. The vouchers could be used for items like diapers, clothing and school supplies.
The other amendment, by Representative Jim Bunn, Republican of Oregon, would allow states to provide vouchers for children born out of wedlock to women younger than 18.
John Cardinal O'Connor, the Archbishop of New York, recently sent a letter to Congress endorsing both amendments. The National Right to Life Committee said lawmakers should vote against the bill unless it includes those "corrective amendments."

HEADLINE: Javits Center's Chronic Problems Go Beyond the Mob, Experts Say

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
For unions, the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center has been an employment bonanza because of its notorious but legal work rules: nine workers for jobs that require three or fewer elsewhere. For campaign contributors, it has been a source of lucrative contracts for work that is frequently badly done. For friends of politicians with little experience in the convention industry, it has meant management posts.
The Mafia has recently been getting the most attention for troubles at the Javits Center, but experts who have studied it, as well as those who have worked or participated in shows there, say the mob does not deserve all the blame. Many law-abiding citizens have been making money there as well. The experts and workers say it will take much more than a crackdown on organized crime to eliminate New York's reputation as the least hospitable convention city in America. 
 To some extent, the Javits Center's problems are endemic to convention centers across the country. Subsidized by tax dollars and often financed by bonds of quasi-public agencies operating without voter approval, convention centers have become a favorite project for politicians promising to generate jobs and urban renewal, in many cases a dubious promise, economists and investment analysts say.
The jobs the centers unquestionably generate are for the architects, bond underwriters, board members, consultants, vendors, union laborers and others who work for it. Those groups are especially well entrenched in New York, because of the city's long tradition of large-scale public works.
"We have a phenomenally greedy nomenklatura feeding at the trough, everyone from white-shoe lawyers to Joe the Mobster," said William J. Stern, who oversaw the center's construction when he was chairman of the State Urban Development Corporation from 1983 to 1985. "At other cities' convention centers, the Zeitgeist is: Let's be reasonable so that everyone comes out ahead. In New York, the Zeitgeist is: My guy gets the contract for the paper towels in the men's room."
Mr. Stern said that he was frequently pressured by state officials and legislators to overlook the shoddy work and high bills of politically connected consultants and contractors during the construction of the Javits Center. Complicated by a bid-rigging scandal and structural problems at the center, the project fell two years behind schedule and was $111 million over budget.
The new center, opened in 1986, was supposed to reduce the labor problems that had plagued the exhibitors at the New York Coliseum, but from the start there were complaints about featherbedding and work rules. Although some excesses were eventually curbed -- exhibitors can now plug in a lamp without paying an electrician $80 -- the center is still renowned for its high costs.
"Everything is more difficult in New York," said Jay Atherton, the general manager of the Freeman Decorating Company, which hires labor for trade shows around the country. The firm's labor costs at the Javits Center, he said, are at least 40 percent higher than in any other city.
"In Boston or Washington," Mr. Atherton said, "you can hire one worker to put up the pipe structure and the drapes around a booth; at Javits, you have to hire three workers from different unions. In Chicago you can unload a truck with two Teamsters and one forklift operator; in New York it takes three Teamsters and six other workers using dollies.
"Because of the minimums for standby labor in the contract at Javits, we're required to have 40 guys standing around when we need only six or seven."
These legal work rules have been a much bigger problem than extortion by mobsters, say contractors, show managers and exhibitors. "There have been no checks and balances here on the unions," said one show manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity because, he said, any criticism might trigger a labor slowdown at his next show. "Chicago is no labor paradise, but at least the politicians and unions there realize they have to stay competitive. In New York the unions did what they wanted, and until this year we couldn't get anyone at City Hall or Albany to stand up for us."
Although the Javits Center has been losing business to cities with lower costs, the shows remaining in New York are still profitable for the organizers -- a point that union officials make in their defense. They blame New York's high costs on contractors and show managers who mark up the prices they charge exhibitors for services.
"Working men are again the scapegoat of rich contractors who blame everything on the lowest man on the totem pole," Frederick W. Devine, president of the local district council of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, said at a State Senate hearing on Thursday.
At the hearing, politicians and law enforcement officials vowed to crack down on Mafia infiltration of the labor force at the Javits Center. Gov. George E. Pataki repeated his demand that the 13 members of the center's board resign. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani suggested that work rules be renegotiated and that a private firm replace the political appointees currently managing the center.
From 1991 until January, the chief executive at the Javits Center was Fabian Palomino, a lawyer who was appointed by his close friend Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. His lack of experience in the convention industry has often been cited by critics of the Javits Center, although the former Governor has defended Mr. Palomino, calling him "one of the best minds and best people in state service."
"The management at Javits has lacked any fundamental understanding of what the building is supposed to do," said Steven Hacker, the president of the International Association for Exposition Management. "It needs a new management team that not only understands the basics of the industry but has the competence to make real reforms."
Privatization is a growing trend at civic convention centers, said John H. Nicholson, a consultant in Boston who surveys the industry. About 15 percent of such centers are now privately managed, he said, and the results have attracted the attention of the many cities struggling with mounting operating deficits at convention centers.
"Some public facilities are run very well," Mr. Nicholson said, "and some private management companies have had problems. But in general, the private companies have proven to be more efficient. If current trends continue, nearly half of the convention centers could be privately run by the end of the century."
The most experienced private company is Spectacor Management Group, which runs 21 convention centers, including ones in San Francisco, Miami Beach, Denver and Salt Lake City. But Sims Hinds, a senior vice president of the company, said it would take more than just privatization to solve the problems at the Javits Center.
"A private company needs support to negotiate new work rules," he said. "We've been able to improve the bottom line and the work environment at every facility we've gone into because we have the experience to tell unions: This is what your brethren are doing in other cities, and this is the business they get as a result. But we couldn't have done it without the backing of the local political entity."
Nicholas Langella, a veteran of the Javits Center who now works for Spectacor as the general manager of the Rhode Island Convention Center, said that he has found a markedly different attitude at the center in Providence.
"This is a strong labor town," said Mr. Langella, who was the building services manager at Javits until 1992, "but we've been able to have cooperation from the unions because we all know that we have to be competitive. Our costs are one-third to one-fifth of New York's. There's no automatic overtime and double-time like there is at Javits. You only have to deal with one union, not three different ones, and you can set up your exhibit by yourself if you want. It's a user-friendly environment."
Revenues at the Javits Center have barely covered operating expenses in recent years, although convention center promoters argue that the facilities actually pay for themselves through the extra taxes they generate from visitors.
But academic critics disagree. Edwin S. Mills, an economist at Northwestern University, did a study for the Heartland Institute in Chicago that concluded: "There is no economic reason for governments to own convention centers." Another such critic, Heywood Sanders, a professor of urban administration at Trinity University in San Antonio, argues that politics, not economics, is what drives Javits and all other civic convention centers. "They're the best examples of corporate socialism on the earth," said Dr. Sanders. These projects "may not make economic sense, but they don't have to. They're built to reward the people with political clout."

HEADLINE: Cuba's Financial Crisis Erodes Sports Programs

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

DATELINE: MAR DEL PLATA, Argentina, March 18

 BODY:
As the Cuban weight lifter Rafael Gomez stood on a podium to hear his country's national anthem, the three gold medals around his neck clinked like champagne glasses raised in a toast.
Halfway through the 16-day Pan American Games, a hemispheric version of the Olympics, Cuba is exerting its usual dominance in sports like baseball and weight lifting. It trails only the United States in the hunt for gold medals. But a far more dramatic story is unfolding: the unprecedented admission by Cuban officials and athletes of the severity of the problems caused in sports by the island nation's worsening economic crisis and its political isolation. 
 Since the 1991 Pan American Games in Havana, where Cuban athletes won 140 gold medals to 130 by the United States, at least 70 Cubans with international experience have defected, mainly to the United States and Puerto Rico. Athletes and coaches who did not defect speak loyally of remaining faithful to the Cuban revolution, but they also admit to growing difficulties in obtaining proper nutrition, equipment and medicine because of the American trade embargo.
"Sometimes the food is good, sometimes it is bad," said Mr. Gomez, the weight lifter who won three gold medals last Monday in the 154-pound weight class.
Said his coach, Manuel Gui-Sing: "We don't have the necessary money for big sports. We don't have the competitions we need."
The most urgent problem, Cuban officials have told others, is that Cuban athletes are no longer afforded cost-free training, lodging, food and transportation in the dismantled Eastern bloc. Financial strains have forced Cuban teams to reduce their participation in international competitions; teams also are traveling with fewer athletes than in the past.
Cuban wrestlers have declined an invitation to a meet in Chattanooga, Tenn., next month. Only athletes expected to win medals have traveled from Cuba for the Pan American Games, reducing the 1995 roster to 490 athletes, compared with 633 in Havana four years ago. While many elite athletes have remained at the top, developmental programs have begun to erode.
Just as President Fidel Castro of Cuba put on a suit this week and went to Paris seeking foreign investment, Cuban sports officials have come forward with a new frankness: They are having problems, they need money and sponsorships and they are ready to do business with the rest of the world by renting out coaches and players to other nations.
"We will not say no to help," said Esteban Brice Nichols, director of an athletic training center in Havana.
Cuban officials, coaches and athletes are nearly as accessible as the Americans. Alcides Sagarra, the renowned boxing coach, even admitted on Wednesday that two of his boxers had failed drug tests in Cuba before the Pan Am Games and had been replaced. Such candor from the Cubans is novel.
This new openness appears to have extended to relaxed security around the Cuban athletes. They have been spotted shopping by themselves, and they have spoken freely with American journalists without having their conversations monitored. Rumors of potential defections surfaced this week but have not been confirmed. The Argentine press reported that Cuban expatriates were attempting to contact athletes here in an attempt to induce them to defect. Still, Cuban officials seem to have adopted the attitude that since they cannot stop those who want to defect, it is largely futile to try.
"It's not really a concern," said Reinaldo Gonzalez Lopez, Minister of Sport in Cuba. "Athletes are free if they want to defect."
Ledys Balceiro Pajon, a gold medalist in canoeing at these Pan Am Games, said those Cuban athletes who have defected are "deserters." Good riddance, he said.
"I'm very happy about it," Mr. Balceiro said. "There will be fewer Cubans angry with the government inside Cuba."
Families, along with teams, have been torn apart by defections. Emilio Lara, an Olympic weight lifter, sought political asylum in Puerto Rico in 1993, leaving behind his brother Pablo Lara, a silver medalist in the 165-pound weight-lifting category at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. Pablo Lara, who won three gold medals and set two world records at these Pan Am Games, said he remained in contact with his brother.
"We have our differences, but he is still my brother," Mr. Lara said.
Approximately 30,000 athletes remain in Cuba, 2,000 at the elite level, said Mr. Gonzalez, the sports minister. The country, whose President also happens to be its No. 1 sports fan, spends about $100 million a year on sports, Mr. Gonzalez said. That figure is approximately equal to the annual budget of the United States Olympic Committee, but it is artificial, pegged as it is to a one-to-one exchange rate between the Cuban peso and the American dollar. The black market rate has been as high as 100 pesos to the dollar but has dropped sharply in recent months.
"Sports is part of the culture and the national dignity," Mr. Gonzalez said. "It is not only a political experience but also one of patriotism in difficult times."
In striving for economic self-sufficiency in sports, Cuba has employed some decidedly capitalistic measures, such as charging a small amount of money to fans who attend sporting events. And if other countries need coaches to upgrade their Olympic-style baseball or volleyball teams, the Cubans are willing to rent them out in exchange for hard currency.
Some 500 Cuban coaches are now offering their expertise in various sports in 38 countries, Cuban officials said. Osvaldo Garcia, the former Cuban national water polo coach who defected to Miami, said in a telephone interview that coaches who work abroad keep 30 percent of their salary, give 70 percent to the Cuban Government and must travel without their families to assure that they will return.
Athletes are also being exported to other countries, where they compete and send home a large percentage of their earnings. Javier Sotomayor, the Olympic high jump champion, and six other track and field athletes compete for a professional club in Madrid. Five Cuban baseball players, joined by Cuban coaches, competed on Japanese amateur teams last season; another 15 players will play amateur baseball in Japan this season, Cuban officials said.
There has been talk of having Cuban boxers compete as professionals, but Felix Savon, the 1992 Olympic heavyweight champion, said Wednesday, "I don't want to be a professional; I want to still be a Cuban, a revolutionary one."
In many ways, it is remarkable that a poor nation with only 11 million people has developed into a world sports power. Successful Cuban athletes, as was the case in the Eastern bloc, can expect to be taken care of by the state. William Vargas Trujillo, a gold medalist in weight lifting, said that he had been provided with a house and that he had used money from his winnings to buy a car.
"Certain people think life is better in the United States than Cuba," Mr. Vargas said. "I don't think so. I feel very good in Cuba."
Some sports have shown less vulnerability to defections and Cuba's economic crisis than others. The baseball team is 71-1 since 1987 and has weathered such defections as Rene Arocha, a pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals. "When Rene left, there were five others ready to take his place," said Miguel Valdez, the Cuban baseball coach.
Despite losing at least seven boxers in the past year -- the superheavyweight Roberto Balado died in an automobile accident, the lightweight Dios Belys Hurtado defected, four others were suspended because of drug use and another for an unnamed disciplinary problem -- Cuba remains a threat to win all 12 gold medals at the Pan Am Games.
Other sports have suffered staggering punches from the defections of its stop stars. In water polo, the entire coaching staff, a physician and a trainer and four of Cuba's seven starters have left in the past two years. Ricardo Matienzo, Cuba's top basketball player, defected during the 1993 world championships in Toronto. Because it was unlikely to win a medal, the Cuban men's team is not even taking part in basketball at the Pan Am Games. Odalys Hernandez, Cuba's top women's softball pitcher, defected in Puerto Rico in the fall of 1993. American coaches said they have noticed a lack of depth among the Cubans in such sports as weight lifting and women's gymnastics.
"It's pretty evident to me that Cuba is having some financial difficulties in training," said Steve Nunno, coach of the United States women gymnasts at the Pan Am Games. "The sport is moving ahead, and they are standing still."
That is precisely why the Cubans have come to the Pan American Games with open discussions and an open-for-business attitude. The Cuban sports machine is running low on fuel. It desperately needs gas, even if officials refuse to admit that a complete overhaul is necessary.
"We are a little country with many problems with the blockade of the United States," said Mr. Gui-Sing, the weight lifting coach. "But we have found that our system is best for the Cubans, for a little country, a poor country. Maybe for the United States, your system is best. The most important thing is for the United States Government to understand that we are Cubans."

HEADLINE: Novel Cafe: A Deadbeat Poets Society

BYLINE: By KIT R. ROANE 

DATELINE: SANTA MONICA, Calif.

 BODY:
In the four-and-a-half years that Diana Birchall and her kin have warmed seats at The Novel Cafe, she has produced five novels, none published. Her son, Paul, has written one play, to no avail. And her husband, Peter, has scribbled several volumes of poetry, without any intention of showing them to anyone.
Upstairs, David Carver is on his 23d year writing a memoir about being a homeless Vietnam veteran. And across from the fiction section, a place where books find their own uneasy order, Doug -- nicknamed "Dogfood" Doug because of an earlier failed script, not the cafe's food -- worries over his latest attempt at screenwriting, "Banana Rose." The title recently appeared in hardcover, written by someone else. 
 "You could skip a rock off the heads of at least 20 screenwriters any time of day in this place," said Bill F. Kelman, the author of several B-movie scripts, paraphrasing a line from "Barton Fink." "This place is kind of a microcosm of Los Angeles; anybody who buys a ream of paper calls himself a writer."
These are the heirs to Ernest Hemingway, Henry Miller and Anais Nin, a set of scribblers and laptop-toting typists who dream of big breaks rising from small ruminations and have so far failed. Some are unemployed, many are in debt, and a few live in their cars. There is not a Hollywood Player among them.
"We thought about plastering the first page of everybody's work on the front wall when it was published," said Richard Karno, the cafe's owner. "But there was the obvious problem -- it might be a pretty blank wall."
From 7 A.M. to 1 A.M., this cafe just off Santa Monica's Main Street is a hostel to Los Angeles's disenfranchised intelligentsia, a mix of aging Hollywood hopefuls, Generation X beatniks and local students, all crowded into an eclectic selection of odd seats on a worn parquet floor.
Outside, smokers line the sidewalk, puffing on hand-rolled cigarettes or stroking their Vandykes, or both. Others rush upstairs to the balcony overlooking the espresso machine where tattooed youths dispense bitter coffee and wry wit to the wails of Patsy Cline.
The Novel crowd still prefers caffeine to decaf, and in a town not known for its literature, likes to read -- a distraction well-provided for at The Novel, where books on everything from canoeing to crystal healing line hundreds of wooden shelves.
All are for sale, as are the works of interminably undiscovered artists. The paintings, stillborn like many of the manuscripts written below them, hang in every open space, collecting little more than dust and cobwebs.
"There are a lot of dysfunctional characters engaged in a lot of fantasy here," said Jerry Prager, a friend of many, as he nursed a cup of coffee at his window seat near the front of the cafe. "This is Santa Monica hip, bohemian cool," added Mr. Prager, an actor and telemarketer. "It's a lot of people in their 40's who like to hit on young women and have been working on the same script for years."
Diana and Paul Birchall may have achieved the closest thing to fame among the cafe regulars; they not only have agents, but real jobs. Both are employed as script readers in the entertainment industry, an occupation with only one hazard -- they are frequently harassed by fellow Novel customers.
"We get approached at least once a week by some screenwriter asking us to look at his stuff," Mrs. Birchall confided from her usual perch in an overstuffed armchair at the center of the cafe. "As a rule they are the weirder ones, about space aliens or lonely writers who hang out in coffee shops.
"And," she whispered, grabbing a chunk of brownie, then washing it down with a 16-ounce iced cappuccino, "they are all awful."
Mr. Karno opened The Novel in the summer of 1990. The characters began to show up shortly thereafter, and few have ever strayed to trendier establishments like Starbucks Coffee a mere six blocks away, where, they complain, the stools are uncomfortable, the cappuccino expensive.
At The Novel the first refill is free, and regulars like Mr. Carver are allowed behind the counter to fetch as much as they want. On Sunday, when the meter maids stay home, the few writers who live in their cars sometimes pull up and use The Novel's restroom to bathe.
Few customers have been banished from the cafe, and some have nowhere else to go anyway. When they are tossed out, it is usually because they have been caught stuffing costly volumes into their backpacks without paying for them, or because they have skipped out on weighty tabs that Mr. Karno was kind enough to let them run up during lean times.
Sometimes Mr. Karno longs for the well-heeled clients that frequent Il Fornaio, a cafe just a block away, where -- like the few stars who visit The Novel -- people buy coffee, tip well, then leave. But Mr. Karno's lot appears to have been decided soon after his cafe opened, when the first customer discovered his lax loitering policy and the abundance of electrical outlets scattered throughout the building. Since then, laptops have sprouted like mushrooms on his many tables, and customers have rooted like trees.
"I got more Powerbooks in here than in a school cafeteria," he complained while calculating their drain on his electric bill. "But the last thing I want to do is run around collecting a buck-fifty for electricity every hour from a bunch of starving writers. Besides, they would just switch to pens and pads and still sit there all day anyway."

HEADLINE: 2-Year-Old Slovakia Toddling Toward Democracy

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: BRATISLAVA, Slovakia

 BODY:
Slovakia, which recently celebrated its second anniversary of independence, is stumbling toward democracy and an open economy as Europe's youngest nation.
It has had three Governments, two of which have been led by the current Prime Minister, Vladimir Meciar, who in his determination not to lose power again has shown an authoritarian bent that alarms the opposition, foreign governments and potential investors. 
 Yet basic political freedoms are still respected, and as people come to terms with the double shock of abandoning first Communism and then the 74-year union with the Czech Republic, Slovakia's political culture is slowly maturing in ways that many politicians and diplomats say will assure the country of a bright future, if Mr. Meciar can curb his anti-democratic impulses.
"It's only been two years since the country was founded, and people here are still trying to figure out who they are," said Rick Zednick, a Slovak-American who recently helped start Bratislava's first English-language newspaper. "They are looking into themselves and at their history and asking themselves what it really means to be Slovak."
With low labor costs, a skilled work force among 5.4 million people, a location at the heart of Europe and an emerging generation of young entrepreneurs, Slovakia should be poised for an economic takeoff. Continuing political uncertainty, however, has hurt the country's image and scared off some investors.
Early this month, 10 newspapers across the country published nearly blank front pages to protest threats from members of Mr. Meciar's party to impose sharply increased taxes that could force them out of business. The front pages carried a statement asserting that the proposed increases "threaten the work of the press in Slovakia and the right of Slovak citizens to choose their sources of information."
Faced with criticism at home and abroad, leaders of Mr. Meciar's party disavowed the proposal, and it was killed by a parliamentary committee. Yet many fear that he will strike again.
"Meciar's method is to hit us and see if he can get away with it," said Oliver Brunovsky, an editor of the business newspaper Trend. "This time it didn't work, but he'll keep trying."
Earlier this year, after reassuming power in December 1994 in a coalition Government, Mr. Meciar arranged to remove the directors of the state radio and television networks and the Government news agency, replacing them with political allies.
Coverage of opposition activities has been curbed, and three satirical programs were taken off the air. Several thousand people showed up this month for a rally in Bratislava to protest the changes.
But despite the heavy-handedness by Mr. Meciar, who was Slovakia's Prime Minister before independence, few citizens fear that their new democracy is under imminent threat. In an indication of the country's direction, for instance, Slovakia has signed agreements with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund that require it to observe basic levels of political and economic freedom.
"What's going on here is nothing like what's going on in some other parts of Central and Eastern Europe," a foreign diplomat said. "Meciar is a very skillful populist politician and a bit of an opportunist, but the 'former Communist' stuff is vastly overplayed. It fits in Poland, maybe in Hungary and certainly in the Balkans, but here there's a very different dynamic."
Some Slovak intellectuals are more worried about the country's future, however.
"Everything we did in the 1980's was aimed at destroying the system, chipping away at the cement that held it together," said Martin Simecka, a novelist and former dissident.
"Now Meciar is doing exactly what we did, chipping away at the established order," he said. "All he thinks about is how to bring down the democratic system. My instinct is that things will get worse here. I'm afraid that in a year, we will be closer to a real dictatorship."
Mr. Meciar's support comes principally from rural, less-educated and older voters, many of whom look back fondly on the security of life under Communism. Even his critics acknowledge that he is Slovakia's best politician and that the opposition has no one to challenge him.
Among Mr. Meciar's favorite targets is President Michal Kovac, who helped engineer the Prime Minister's fall from power a year ago. Mr. Meciar, 52, is waging a guerrilla war against Mr. Kovac, pushing through a series of parliamentary measures aimed at reducing his powers.
In an interview, the soft-spoken President said he disapproved of Mr. Meciar's attacks on the press, but asserted that the country's democracy was not in danger.
"I'm not happy about the situation," Mr. Kovac said. "It's hard when the President thinks certain steps could improve the country's credibility but does not have the legal power to take those steps."
As Slovakia's approached independence in late 1992, many people assumed that its most prominent citizen, Alexander Dubcek, would be elected the first president.
But Mr. Dubcek, who won international acclaim for trying to lead Czechoslovakia out of the Soviet orbit in 1968, died of injuries from a car crash in 1992. His death deprived Slovakia of the one figure who might have won it the respect that has been accorded to the Czech Republic.
"The problem is that from the beginning, people looked at the split in a very simplified way," said Eduard Kukan, a former Foreign Minister.
"The Czechs were good, the Slovaks were bad. We were looked at as spoilers who ruined the unity of the country. The fact is that both sides realized the split was inevitable, but the Czechs prepared for it quietly. Slovaks are more emotional. We shouted.
"We are seen as less sophisticated, less developed, and less educated, some of which may be true," he continued. "Then of course, the Czechs had Vaclav Havel, who is greatly admired in the West. We had Meciar, who is not a very lovable guy."
The last Slovak Government, which held power for nine months in 1994, won widespread praise not only for its commitment to democracy but also for its determination to privatize formerly state-owned enterprises. Mr. Meciar has slowed the pace of privatization, and critics suspect that he is seeking to shape the process so it will benefit his supporters. Already, they say, Government officials often ask for "commissions" in exchange for contracts.
"Nobody believes that Meciar himself is getting money," Mr. Kukan said, "but he is arranging things so that his supporters get the biggest slices of the pie."
Mr. Meciar rarely receives foreign journalists, but an official of the Economics Ministry, Jozef Sucha, said the Government remains committed to completing Slovakia's transition to a market economy.
"I myself am not pleased with the state of affairs, but I can assure you that the process of privatization will proceed," Mr. Sucha said. "All parties favor it. I realize that the delays look bad from the outside, but we are determined to wipe away the old system. The discussion is not about whether, but how."
Several large foreign companies, among them Volkswagen and Samsung, have opened plants in Slovakia and say they are pleased with the results. Others, however, are waiting for the political situation to stabilize.
"Persuading foreign investors to come to Slovakia is a difficult job," said Peter Mihok, president of the Slovak Chamber of Commerce. "There have been so many changes here in the last few years, and the political situation is still fluid."
Lubo Roman, a prominent theater director and member of Parliament, is one of many opposition figures who believe that Mr. Meciar's mercurial personality is hindering the consolidation of democracy here.
"He is a politician who thrives on keeping everything in tension, but he is not a man with a vision of how Slovakia should develop and what it should be about," he said. "We are waiting for a person with new ideas to give the country direction. Everyone here who is culturally minded is waiting for such a person."

HEADLINE: Republicans' Vow of Budget Cuts Carries Risks Down on the Farm

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: CLEARWATER, Kan., March 17

 BODY:
Clutching a briefcase stuffed with business papers, Dwayne Schmeissner, a bottom-line conservative who cheered the Republican takeover of Congress last fall, spoke insistently about the need to slash Government spending.
He pointed to some fat targets: welfare, foreign aid, academic research. But when asked about cuts in agricultural subsidies, the 35-year-old wheat farmer sighed apprehensively, pulling on his thick red beard, and said, "Well now, that's a scary proposition." 
 The business papers inside Mr. Schmeissner's briefcase were applications for crop grants from the Federal Government. Last year, he received about $20,000 in such subsidies. In all, the Government paid farmers about $10 billion in grants in 1994.
For Republicans vowing to cut Federal spending, farm subsidies mark a treacherous crossroads between conservative philosophy and political self-interest. Nearly half of the new Republicans in Congress represent farming districts.
As is true in much of the nation, the typical voter here is all for cuts in Government spending -- until they hit home. And in the farm belt, cuts in agricultural subsidies would slice right through the backyard.
"Oh, I'm sure they can cut something else," said Rachel Barnes, 33, moments after stopping at a Government office to deliver her crop payment application, a subsidy she cheerfully labeled, "farmer welfare checks."
Here in this wheat-rich farming country, voters ousted Dan Glickman, an eight-term Democrat and a strong supporter of farm subsidies, in favor of Todd Tiahrt, a conservative Republican who embraced the party's campaign manifesto, the Contract With America, which promises deep cuts in spending.
Ronnie Gaithen, a 27-year-old farmer, applauded the Republican Party's goals. The Government, he said, cannot play Santa Claus. But he said politicians should steer clear of touching farm subsidies for one very good reason: "We need it. If we could get an honest price without it, fine. But we can't. It's that simple."
Mr. Schmeissner said farmers had already suffered subsidy cuts. The Government's target prices, which farmers are paid even though market prices might be lower, have been frozen since the 1980's, even though costs had risen. In fact, Government grants to farmers have dropped from a peak of $25 billion in 1986. And farmers are now allowed to receive subsidies only on 85 percent of their cropland.
A lot of farms "would die" without subsidies, Mr. Schmeissner said, adding: "Is that what we want? I don't think so."
Even so, some farmers believe the subsidies should stop. Arlis Day, 63, in pin-striped overalls with a ball point pen in the bib, said he did not see how farmers could be fairly exempted from Government cuts in spending.
"It might be cutting our throats, but we farmers have got to do our part to get this budget under control," Mr. Day said as he sat on the tailgate of a pickup on his farm and watched a grain auger empty wheat into a truck. "These young kids coming up aren't going to have any Social Security by the time they retire. Everybody's going to have to take their hits. And I'm afraid that means farmers, too."
The most lucrative time on his farm, he joked, was the hailstorm of 1992. Between disaster payments and crop subsidies, he said, "It seemed like every time you went to the mailbox, there was a check from the Government inside."
But even in his own house, Mr. Day said, he encounters opposition to the idea of cutting subsidies.
"My wife says, 'Well, if they're going to give it, you might as well take it,' " he said.
Mr. Day said he told her, "If somebody's getting it, somebody's losing it."
Farmers in nearby Sumner County, the world's top producer of wheat, received about $6 million in farm subsidies last year. Together with Social Security and welfare payments, the Government is responsible for perhaps three-fourths of the county's income.
And it is not just the farmers who would hate to see the checks stop.
"This area depends on the farmers," said Elsie Wier, 55, who runs The Hardware Store in Wellington with her husband, Bob, 55. "They're our livelihood. If the payments stopped, we'd be devastated."
The farm subsidies were established in the 1930's as part of the New Deal, a way to protect farmers from volatile markets and protect consumers from the wild price swings and food shortages that could result from a purely market-oriented farm economy. The subsidies help keep the cost of food low. Americans spend an average of 12 percent of their budget on food, among the lowest in the world.
Even with price supports, farming remains a perilous venture. Elderly people here can remember the Dust Bowl days, when crops shriveled and blew away, many farmers went broke and some children, gasping for breath in the storm of dirt, died of suffocation.
Thousands of farmers still go broke every year around the nation. Nearly half of all Americans worked on farms at the turn of the century. Today, there are only about 600,000 full-time farmers. And a big share of them could not survive without working a second job, or the income of a spouse working in town.
In exchange for the subsidies, farmers must agree to limit production, which allows the Government to discourage glutted markets. Some farm payments are tied to soil conservation practices and other stewardship of the land.
Subsidies paid to American farmers pale in comparison with those paid in some European countries, like France. Without the subsidies, American farmers say they could not fairly compete on the global market.
"Look," said Mr. Schmeissner, who farms 2,800 acres, "if there was a level playing field, then fine, do away with it. But the field is not level."
But Mr. Schmeissner said he did not want to sound like a complainer. "After all," he said, "nobody is holding a gun to your head and forcing you to farm."

One with a different view, Arlis Day, 63, above, who farms near Wellington, Kan., said, "It might be cutting our throats, but we farmers have got to do our part to get this budget under control."

HEADLINE: Question Now: How Much War in Bosnia?

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
Having reduced the risk of war in Croatia by persuading it not to expel United Nations peacekeepers, President Clinton's foreign policy team is now seeking to prevent stepped-up fighting in Bosnia, but many officials predict a major outbreak of hostilities with the arrival of spring weather.
With a four-month cease-fire due to expire at the end of next month, Mr. Clinton's foreign policy advisers acknowledge that there is almost no chance of getting Bosnia's Muslim-dominated Government and the country's rebel Serbs to agree to a peace plan by then. 
 "The clouds of war are darkening," said Assistant Secretary of State Richard C. Holbrooke, who is the Administration's point man on Bosnia. "The four-month period, the cease-fire, is running out. The incidents are increasing."
After receiving some arms from abroad this winter despite an international embargo, the Government appears eager to attack Serbian lines to regain some of the 70 percent of Bosnia's territory held by the Serbs.
For their part, the Bosnian Serbs, helped by Croatian Serb soldiers, have mounted an offensive against the Muslim pocket of Bihac in northwestern Bosnia, an area where the cease-fire never took hold. Making matters worse, sniper fire in the country's capital, Sarajevo, has intensified in recent weeks.
"Things are bad and getting worse," said a longtime American negotiator on Balkan issues, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. "Right now, the Clinton Administration's Bosnia policy is twisting in the wind. They have a tough problem, and they don't know how to handle it."
All but abandoning hope that the warring factions would resolve their differences soon, Secretary of State Warren Christopher proposed a new stopgap policy this week that angered the Bosnian Government: extending the fraying cease-fire beyond its April 30 expiration.
Bosnian leaders immediately criticized the Christopher proposal, arguing that it would make it easier for the Serbs to solidify their control of the territory they had seized.
In an interview, Vice President Ejup Ganic of Bosnia said his country had originally insisted on a cease-fire of no more than four months for just this reason.
He also contended that his Government had never received the quid pro quo that was promised it for accepting the cease-fire. The United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia -- the so-called contact group countries -- were supposed to exert pressure on Bosnia's Serbs to accept a peace plan that would reduce their holdings to 49 percent of Bosnia's land.
This week, Mr. Ganic and other Bosnian leaders called for ending the cease-fire, lifting the international arms embargo against Bosnia and having the North Atlantic Treaty Organization make good on its threats to bomb Bosnian Serb positions when the Serbs flouted the organization's warnings.
"What we have now is diplomacy without force, and that's weak diplomacy," Mr. Ganic said. "What we need is diplomacy backed by force."
Administration officials acknowledge that they see no settlement soon. The Administration has failed after months of threats, pressure and cajoling to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to accept a peace plan put forward by the United States, Russia and Europe.
Similarly, it has failed to persuade President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, the dominant figure in the former Yugoslavia, to grant formal recognition to Bosnia and its borders, a move that would undermine the claims and spirit of the Bosnian Serbs.
Adding to the Administration's problems, Senator Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader, has promised to introduce legislation to lift the arms embargo against Bosnia if there is no peace settlement by May 1. While Senator Dole says lifting the embargo is needed to narrow the Bosnian Serbs' decisive arms advantage, the Administration contends that ending the embargo unilaterally will intensify the war, cause Britain and France to withdraw their peacekeepers and spread the war throughout the former Yugoslavia.
In a speech last week in Kansas, Defense Secretary William J. Perry described Mr. Dole's policy as "lift and pray." But some Republicans in Congress have countered by calling President Clinton's policy "don't lift and pray."
Many supporters of lifting the embargo acknowledge that it may heighten the fighting in Bosnia, but they argue that such a move can serve as vital leverage to get Bosnia's Serbs to accept the contact group's peace plan. Clinton Administration officials say it is wrong to lift the embargo unilaterally and thus violate a Security Council resolution. The Administration supports lifting it multilaterally, but Britain, France and Russia are opposed.
American officials assert that their Bosnia policy has had one unqualified success: it has prevented the war from spilling into other parts of the former Yugoslavia, including Macedonia and Kosovo.
In an interview, Mr. Holbrooke said: "We're not at a dead end. It's more peaceful on the ground in the region that it has been in the last few years, except for Bihac. The Bosnian Muslims are stronger than before. We've had to focus on Croatia for the past few months, and now we're refocusing on Bosnia."
Mr. Holbrooke sees some rays of hope. The political and economic isolation of Bosnia's Serbs could force them to accept the contact group's plan. And the stumbling year-old federation and military alliance between Bosnia's Muslims and Croats will add more pressure on Bosnia's Serbs, he said.
American officials continue to hope that President Milosevic will agree to recognize Bosnia and Croatia in exchange for getting the United Nations to lift economic sanctions against Serbia afterward. But in a bargaining position backed by Russia, Mr. Milosevic says he will recognize his neighbors only after the sanctions are lifted.
The Clinton Administration now sees little hope in persuading Mr. Milosevic. "That hole will probably turn out to be dry," Mr. Holbrooke said.

1,361 Executed Here, and Fear Restarts Count

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

 BODY:
EVEN with New York coming back on line more slowly than anticipated, Watt Espy, the nation's foremost historian of the gallows, remains confident that the United States will soon be breaking the single-year record of 199 executions set in 1935. That was a desperate time economically and criminally, but a good one for tabloid stories of cameras sequestered into the Sing Sing death house in carnival pursuit of the justly living's peeking at the condemned.
New York's actual return to capital punishment will take some time, and the impatience is palpable in some quarters. Still, Mr. Espy anticipates the nation's getting beyond that 1935 record by the year 2000. Splurging millennially, we will be dispatching close to 300 criminals a year, versus the 75 expected to go this year by electrocution, gunfire, hanging and the increasingly popular lethal injection, with its antiseptic gurney and trappings of social triage. 
 "Let's face it: When New York last had a death penalty it didn't just waste there on the books," Mr. Espy said, booting up the computer where he's stored 25 years of research labor on the death penalty. "A lot of New Yorkers were sentenced and a lot died."
THE numbers clicked forth on the screen in his ramshackle house in Headland, Ala., and Mr. Espy was fascinated anew at licit killing. "In fact, even after your layoff, New York is still second in the nation in total executions," he announced over the phone. "Second only to Virginia's 2,049. I document 1,361 New York executions, including 37 females."
As in the other states he's been studying, Mr. Espy says we can expect some leering overcoverage in the news of the first executions in New York. But then, except for that occasional "mad-dog" celebrity fiend, the news stories will shrink. They will slip away toward the mundane high-volume routine he finds capital punishment is already becoming in a nation that will soon stand alone among the major industrial countries in not abolishing execution but rather elevating it to record proportions.
"You'll be back in it strong in New York, yessir," said the historian, speaking as an authority respected for his researches in both lost data and human detail. He tracks executions back through 17th century records as well as through sympathetic correspondence with the modern flood of victims' survivors and perpetrators' families.
"I know some innocent people are going to be executed," Mr. Espy said, echoing the fearful prediction of the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau. "But if they're criminals with previous records, I think most people will say, 'So what?' People are not just cynical these days, they're scared."
The Headland computer is at 18,800 executions and counting since 1608, when Virginia got that lead and shot George Kendall as a Spanish spy. Mr. Espy is as opinionated against execution as much of the rest of the nation seems avid for it. He has reams to document its racist undertow, like an old newspaper headline: "Black Fiend Hanged/Jerked to Jesus."
But rather than proselytizing, Mr. Espy prefers just to amass the facts like some monk in the Dark Ages and await a change on the issue that, he concedes at age 62, won't occur in his lifetime. Change is more a matter of individuals than historic tide, according to his studies. "The only reason you have been out of the execution business in New York is because Governors Carey and Cuomo vetoed the legislation," he said. "Because of two men, not because of the Legislature or the people."
WATT ESPY understands the average citizen's fear of crime and the average politician's exploiting the fear. "Call it what you please, they want it: punishment, vengeance, whatever," he said. "In some states, they're allowing families of the victims to witness execution, like they used to do in the past. That just gives it purely and simply the aspect of revenge."
Anyone who has visited Mr. Espy and enjoyed his hospitality and biscuit sandwiches is struck by his singular dismay at the revival of execution. And by his dark humor, too, over grave statehouse debates when politicians proclaim the humaneness of lethal injection.
"Hell, we all know they don't really give a damn about the humanity of it," he said, chuckling. "They're doing that to make it easier to get the death sentence. They think somehow it can be presented that you're killing this man in the same way that you put beloved old Fido to sleep."
The laughter of the gallows historian echoed all the way to New York.

HEADLINE: Asked, Told, Pursued

BYLINE: By Lawrence Korb and C. Dixon Osburn; Lawrence Korb was Assistant Secretary of Defense from 1981 to 1985. C. Dixon Osburn is co-executive director of the Service Members Legal Defense Network.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In the year since the Pentagon initiated its "don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue" policy, the lives of most lesbians and gay men in the military have not improved. So it is no surprise that lawyers for six gay service members told a Federal court in Brooklyn last week that the rules continue discrimination and accommodate the fears and prejudices of heterosexual troops.
 The new policy was intended to stop officials from prying into sexual orientation, to end the Salem-like witch hunts of the late 1980's and early 1990's and to stop physical and verbal harassment of homosexuals. But commanders continue to ask, pursue and harass those who are or are perceived to be gay, lesbian or bisexual, defying the spirit of the policy and violating constitutional rights. 
 A Navy psychiatrist in Charleston, S.C., turned in Cpl. Kevin Blaesing after he asked her questions about sexuality, which led Corporal Blaesing's commander to try to kick him out of the military.
 In Okinawa, Cpl. Craig Haack was subject to a full-scale witch hunt; a Navy investigator seized and read his diaries and letters in front of him, confiscated his computer and software and even took a pair of his platform shoes, arguing that they were evidence of homosexual conduct. Corporal Haack was discharged when his term expired.
 There have been at least 37 violations of the "don't ask" policy, and the Pentagon is pressing for the discharge of at least one gay service member although it concedes that his supervisor asked him about his sexual orientation.
 Overall, the services are discharging homosexuals at the same rate as under the old policy. In 1994, the cost of training replacements for the 597 men and women discharged was more than $17.5 million. This figure does not include the costs of conducting investigations or holding discharge hearings.
 Many of those investigated are 18 to 25 years old and still coming to terms with their sexual orientation. Some have been wrongly accused out of vengeance, including heterosexual women who have been denounced as lesbians after they claimed that they were raped or sexually harassed.
 Many service members have no clear idea of their rights and do not know how to respond to an investigation. They need legal help, but the military will not provide a lawyer until after a full investigation into a possible defendant's life has been completed. One hour with a private lawyer can cost a full week's military pay.
 Investigators often interrogate parents about their child's sexual orientation and then use their statements against the service member at the discharge hearing. The military often threatens a court-martial and jail unless the service member confesses, and also encourages the accused's friends to speculate about his or her sexual activities.
 The military guarantees few of the constitutional rights that civilians take for granted. The accused aren't allowed to object to the admission of illegally seized evidence, hearsay or circumstantial evidence. And their lawyers often find that witnesses are unavailable for cross-examination.
 If the service member loses, he or she will be discharged and can be imprisoned for up to 15 years, forfeits many military benefits, can be denied unemployment compensation and faces discrimination when a potential civilian employer reads the reason for discharge stamped on the papers.
 "Don't ask" means don't ask. "Don't pursue" means don't pursue. "Don't harass" means don't harass. It shouldn't be that difficult. Yet, some commanders blatantly defy the policy and hide behind a military judicial system that is tantamount to a kangaroo court. This is difficult not only on lesbian and gay men who simply want to serve their country free from harassment and Government intrusion but on the Pentagon, which must argue in Federal court why the military needs to treat heterosexuals differently from homosexuals. It is clear that "don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue" is a ruse for business as usual.

HEADLINE: Cuba: Time to Change Direction

 BODY:
The sight of Fidel Castro in a business suit being escorted about Paris this week as an honored guest deserves some consideration in Washington. With the Soviet Union gone and the cold war over, the only threat that the Cuban Communist poses to the United States lies in the imagination of ideological warriors like Senator Jesse Helms. While the time has not yet come to welcome Mr. Castro to Washington, a re-examination of Cuba policy is long overdue. The embargo of Cuba, begun when John Kennedy occupied the White House and Nikita Khrushchev was Soviet leader, has outlived its usefulness.
 Conservatives still cling to the notion that isolating Cuba and creating misery for its people will eventually cause an uprising and sweep Mr. Castro from power. Now that he is without Soviet support and his economy is in tatters, they reason, sanctions should be tightened. 
 This scenario is unwise and inhumane. Cuba will survive because other nations are investing there and are not participating in the embargo. Last year when a resolution against the embargo came up at the U.N., it passed by 101 votes to 2. The kind of outright rebellion envisioned by Senator Helms and some Cuban-Americans, if it did occur, would bring bloodshed and more misery for many Cubans. At a time when Washington is trying hard to encourage peaceful transitions elsewhere in the region and world, it makes little sense to encourage bloodshed in Cuba.
 An increasing number of younger, more moderate Cuban-Americans are fed up with the revenge fantasies of their elders, and would like to see more dialogue and commerce with Mr. Castro's regime. They feel that his repressive policies could not continue for long if the barriers were lifted and ordinary Cubans could have a taste of material success and a whiff of personal freedom from the north. Washington's anachronistic policy may even help Mr. Castro, by giving him a convenient scapegoat for all his failures at home.
 Without the embargo, the excuses would be gone. Open communication with the United States, freedom for Cuban-Americans to invest in businesses back home, and access to North American goods could be first steps. More favorable trade conditions could be held out as incentives to further reforms. Mr. Castro's Paris visit illustrated the power of the friendly gesture. After his warm reception by President Mitterrand, Mr. Castro agreed to allow a French human rights group to visit.
 There should be gradations in American policy toward repressive governments. When American national security is potentially threatened, as with Iran and its efforts to develop nuclear weapons, Washington is justified in banning commerce. In cases like China and Cuba, where internal policies are anathema to Americans but American security is not at risk, commerce can be encouraged but trade privileges should be withheld.
 Scuttling the embargo would take some political courage. All the White House had to do last week to inspire Mr. Helms's wrath was to hint that it might consider lifting some additional sanctions imposed last year during the immigration crisis. But the political clout of the Cuban exile community has diminished in recent years as more Cuban-Americans have abandoned the traditional confrontational stance.
 Long gone are the days when Soviet troops and bases in Cuba represented a real threat to the United States and Mr. Castro was exporting arms and revolution in the hemisphere. Cuba, absent the ghosts of the cold war, is an impoverished neighbor of the United States led by a dictator overtaken by history. American policy should reflect that reality rather than a world that no longer exists.

Yesterday's Man

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Warren Christopher did yeoman's service last week in cajoling and enticing Syria's president Hafez el-Assad to resume peace talks with Israel. But frankly I'm really tired of watching secretaries of state trudge off to Damascus to beg Mr. Assad to resume negotiations that are in his self-interest. It's time for a new approach. I propose that the next time Mr. Christopher sits down with Mr. Assad, he opens like this:
 "Hafez -- you don't mind if I call you Hafez? Hafez, you are yesterday's man. You're still living in the cold war. I know you've only traveled outside the Middle East a few times, so let me tell you a little bit about the new world.
"Hafez, Syria today can barely make a light bulb. That's sad. That's also why your per capita income is only $1,200 a year. Have you ever been to Japan, Hafez? At the Lexus factory in Toyota City, the Japanese produce 300 Lexus sedans each day with 66 human beings and 310 robots. And you can barely make a light bulb. The world is passing you by.
 "Now, Hafez, the reason I'm telling you this is because during the cold war, it didn't matter whether Syria made computer chips or potato chips, a Lexus or a light bulb, because you could make a good living just by milking the superpowers for aid and blackmailing your neighbors.
"Yes, I see you smiling, Hafez. You know it's true. You milked the Saudis for billions by letting them know that there could be, as the Mafia would say, 'an unfortunate accident' in the oil fields if they didn't pay. But those days are over. The price of oil is down and the Saudis can't pay their bills anymore. Now Hafez, during the cold war you milked us a little, too. You milked the Europeans even more and the Soviets a lot. They bought your third-rate products and gave you arms and aid in return for your friendship. It was a good living, Hafez -- and you played us off against each other brilliantly. Chapeau.
 "But, Hafez, the cold war is over. There is a new global architecture. There are no longer two superpowers to play against each other. There is only one and we're broke.
 "Instead of superpowers, Hafez, there are super markets. There's the Tokyo bond market and the Frankfurt bond market and the Singapore bond market and the Wall Street bond market. These bond markets are actually more powerful than many governments today. And let me tell you, Hafez, you don't play the Tokyo bond market off against the Frankfurt bond market. No, no, no. They play you off. That's right, they play Syria off against Mexico off against Brazil off against Thailand.
 "Whichever country has the most stable government, the most efficient economy, the most Westernized legal system, the most convertible currency and the most educated labor force, gets rewarded with investment capital from the super markets. Those countries that don't get their house in order are left as roadkill on the global investment highway. And, Hafez, you are destined to be roadkill.
 "Now, Hafez, every time I come to Syria the phones don't work in the press room. When we go to Jordan and Egypt, we have touch-tone phones, but here, in your Sheraton Hotel, they have these old rotary dials with these very nice Syrian women who spend all day dialing for our reporters, because it can take hours to get through. It's generous of you, but don't you think those women would be more productive making goods for export?
 "Tell you what, I'm going to leave you my cellular, satellite phone. It's the latest model from Motorola. You'll reach me in Washington in seconds. Because, Hafez, I don't intend to make any more trips out here. You bore me, and these nine-hour history lessons on the Crusades that you put me through each visit are not an efficient use of my time. Why don't you put them on a compact disk and just hand them out to every visiting secretary of state?
 "You see, Hafez, I've got too many other important places to be: Mexico, Russia, China. Who should rule the Golan Heights is a fascinating question, but it's utterly irrelevant to U.S. interests today. But, hey, we'd still love to hear from you. When you're ready to do business, just dial 001-202-647-4910. Ask for Chris. Otherwise, Hafez, stay out of my life."
 (Wednesday: Assad's answer.)

Prospect of an April Lockout by Owners Leaves Many Questions

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla., March 18

 BODY:
With the scheduled start of the 1995 season two weeks from Sunday, about the only thing certain is that neither a negotiated agreement nor National Labor Relations Board action will get the striking players back in uniform by opening day.
The most intriguing development that could occur would have the players offering to return to work, with or without an injunction obtained by the labor board from a Federal court judge, and the owners refusing to let them do so and instead locking them out while continuing to use replacement players. 
 It is not certain that the owners, under the circumstances that would exist at the time, would have the right to lock out the returning strikers and use their strikebreakers; it is not certain that the owners would want to and run the risk of potentially incurring hundreds of millions of dollars in back pay and possible damages.
But it is lawful for an employer to lock out employees and use replacements. In 1987, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, upheld an N.L.R.B. ruling that permitted the use of temporary replacement workers during a lockout.
In denying the petition from a local of the operating engineers union, the court held that Harter Equipment did not commit an unfair labor practice by hiring temporary workers when it intended to return regular employees to their jobs at the conclusion of the contract dispute.
Although there would seem to be little relationship between the baseball dispute and one involving mechanics, a truck driver and a painter, the court's opinion created a link. It noted that "employer was in financial straits and union was aware of its financial problems." From the outset, the court noted, "the company made it clear that it needed substantial cost concessions because it was operating at a loss."
The baseball owners, of course, have not convinced their employees that their claims of economic distress are valid; that's the primary reason the players have resisted making "substantial cost concessions" by accepting a salary cap or a severe luxury tax on payrolls.
Like the operating engineers, the players may challenge their employers' bargaining strategy if they are locked out and find their jobs taken by replacement players. The court, in denying the operating engineers' challenge, found that Harter's action was "for the sole purpose of applying economic pressure in support of a legitimate bargaining position."
The players could argue that the court's opinion would not apply in the baseball case for a few reasons. In the Harter dispute, the company didn't hire the replacements until six weeks into the lockout; the baseball strikebreakers are already in place. The players also probably would argue that the lockout was retaliatory rather than the application of economic pressure. As for a "legitimate bargaining position," the players could contend that the owners, as indicated by multiple N.L.R.B. complaints, have not bargained in good faith.
Then there's the possibility that the labor board could reverse its position. "Just as precedent got undone," one lawyer said, "it can get undone twice."
Within the context of a lockout, Peter Angelos could create the most intriguing development. The owner of the Baltimore Orioles, Angelos has defied baseball officials and fellow owners by refusing to field a replacement team. If three-fourths of his fellow owners vote to lock out the returning strikers, Angelos could defy their strategy again by trying to let his real players play.
The American League would probably take action to bar those Orioles from playing, but if they somehow did -- through a court decision, perhaps -- they would wipe up the rest of the league and wind up in the World Series.
 
Delaying by the Owners
 'Tis a funny game the owners are playing in these negotiations.
"This union keeps doing everything possible to stay away from the bargaining table," Stan Kasten of Atlanta said last week in what appears to be his role as the negotiating committee's union basher.
"We're just so upset with Don Fehr and his continued delay in negotiating," Bill Giles of Philadelphia said.
But it was the owners' negotiators who created a wasted week in bargaining as the season rapidly approached. Talks had been scheduled to resume last Tuesday or Wednesday. When the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board last Monday summoned Chuck O'Connor, management's chief labor lawyer, to a meeting in Washington on Tuesday, the owners, already in Florida for the talks, called them off.
O'Connor was finished with his Washington meeting by noon Tuesday. The owners could have directed him to return to Florida that day, assessed the board's pending action, which they said they had to do before meeting with the players' negotiators, then begun bargaining Wednesday or, if they needed that day for assessment purposes, Thursday.
But they obviously did not want to meet, moving instead into a figurative four corners formation in recognition of the start of the National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament. While continuing to accuse the union of stalling, they put off even scheduling new talks.
"We still do not have baseball back because we are caught up in every conceivable diversion," Kasten said, adding about the N.L.R.B. complaint, "I guess this is going to stretch out the clock a little more, keep us farther away from getting a negotiated settlement."
But the owners were squandering valuable time in trying to negotiate a settlement before the labor board proceeded with its course. Fred Feinstein, the general counsel, didn't even go to the five-member board for permission to seek an injunction until Friday, three days after his meeting with O'Connor. The board isn't expected to act on his request until late this week.
The two sides had probably 10 days to negotiate before they would know if the board would seek an injunction. They have squandered more than half of that time, and it has been the owners who put off scheduling talks.
Asked yesterday about the delay, Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, said: "The union people had something Tuesday night and had something else scheduled Wednesday. At that point, given the N.L.R.B. and everything that happened, what looked like a definite pattern of negotiating had been totally disrupted."
However, even a prominent member of management questioned the owners' decision not to meet last week.
The owners have also accused the union of creating distractions by constantly going to the N.L.R.B. Yet the board repeatedly has found reason to cite the owners for bargaining in bad faith and allegedly violating labor law. Presumably, if the owners had bargained in good faith throughout the talks, the union would have had no reason to create the so-called distraction.
The owners, on the other hand, apparently have no grounds on which to accuse the union of bad-faith bargaining. When Feinstein was asked at a news conference last week if the players have bargained in good faith throughout the negotiations, he said, "We have not made any determination to the contrary, certainly."
 
Another Sticky Issue
 Not that the two sides are anywhere near debating settlement issues -- no settlement is in sight -- but a large issue looms. The union says it will have none of this replacement business once the real players return to work, but the clubs are faced with a dilemma.
If they were to acquiesce to the players' position and agree not to count the games, they would face a torrent of lawsuits from fans accusing them of fraud for having advertised the games as ones that counted in the championship season. Forget that some regular-season ticket prices have been reduced; the clubs will still call the games legitimate and the fans would have a legitimate argument if the clubs ultimately deem them otherwise.
Roger Clemens, the Boston pitcher, offered his view of replacement baseball.
"I don't know who they're trying to fool saying they're going to put a team on the field people are going to want to come see," Clemens said. "I disagree with that. In football, you can disguise somebody under some helmets and shoulder pads. Other than your topnotch superstar type caliber players, you just become a number and a name on the back of a uniform. You start three-hopping the ball from shortstop, you can't hide. If you ever watched paint dry, that's what it's going to be like."

THE END OF REFORM: New Deal Liberalism in Recession and War, by Alan Brinkley. (Knopf, $27.50.) In the late 1930's, a distinguished historian argues, liberal interventionism lost its nerve and settled for underwriting consumer demand, with the results we now see around us.

MOVING HOUSE: Stories, by Pawel Huelle. (Helen and Kurt Wolff/Harcourt Brace, $18.95.) These tales by a Polish writer, which turn on the longings and workings of memory, are rooted in the highly idiosyncratic history of Gdansk.

THE TUNNEL, by William H. Gass. (Knopf, $30.) This sprawling novel (652 pages) by an American master is all spun out of the head of its monstrous protagonist, a language-driven professor of fascist views who is as dreadful as he is plausible.
 
A VOID, by Georges Perec. (Harvill/HarperCollins, $24.) The letter E never occurs in this 1969 French novel or in its translation by Gilbert Adair; what does occur is a wildly amusing feast of puzzles, mind games and rules broken just to exhibit their latent existence.

HEADLINE: WHAT, US WORRY?

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

 BODY:
Their names -- Cuomo, Richards and Weicker -- were among the best-known in government. Now they're private citizens again. On a recent Saturday morning, they arrived at The New York Times without their customary entourages. Weicker came with his wife, Richards with an aide and Cuomo alone. They remain closely informed and fiercely opinionated.
In a two-hour conversation, Democrats Mario M. Cuomo and Ann W. Richards and Republican-turned-Independent Lowell P. Weicker Jr. looked back at the November election and looked forward to what the results are likely to mean for the country. They offered some guesses about the 1996 election; they appraised the obligations of ex-officeholders; and most of all, they talked about the angry middle class. 
 After 12 years as Governor of New York, Mario Cuomo has become a partner in the Manhattan law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher and is writing a book of his political observations to be published by Simon & Schuster in October. Ann Richards, who spent four years as Governor and eight years as Treasurer of Texas, is now a senior adviser in the Austin office of the Washington-based law firm of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson & Hand. Lowell Weicker, a three-term Senator from Connecticut and then independent Governor, is chairman of Dresing-Lierman-Weicker, a health care company in Bethesda, Md.
The following are edited excerpts of the discussion. It was moderated by Todd S. Purdum, a White House correspondent for The New York Times who covered the Cuomo campaign last fall.
 
THE ELECTION, RECONSIDERED
 
Todd Purdum: Was it a good thing the Republicans won?
 
Ann Richards: I think so.
 
Purdum: Why?
Richards: I think that any system, whether it is a social system, a government system, sociological, economic system that stays entrenched has a tendency to be defensive about itself. Government itself must change to be able to deal with the changing problems. I feel very strongly that change is good because it stirs up the system.
 
Mario Cuomo: I think it's very good. The people who won in 1994 now have to come forward with purported solutions. I've always believed that on the economy -- the first of the two problems which are the economy and cultural corrosion -- you have to do a lot more with infrastructure, a lot more with high tech, a lot more investing. We couldn't convince people to do that.
The Republicans now have a different proposal: "We'll give you a gains tax cut, a middle-class tax cut that will take care of the economy." I think that's a lot of baloney and that will very, very quickly become clear. So they have their shot. They give you a middle-class tax cut. They run into trouble with the deficit. It does nothing to improve your economy substantially and people come to understand that the Democrats were right. Clinton was right. You have to invest.
On cultural corrosion, I have said and a lot of other people have said, "Well, you can't just punish the kid for having a baby." Even if she doesn't have the second baby, you haven't solved the problem. They need other avenues to dignity. You need more than punishment. Of course they must develop a sense of responsibility, but you also have to give them a chance to have a job, the chance to get educated, the chance to fulfill themselves. That means you have to do a lot of positive things.
So far the Contract With America is purely negative. Let's forget that it's punitive. To the extent that it insists on responsibility, I'd agree with it, but then it stops there. It doesn't create any opportunity. I think that will become clear, too. They don't go far enough.
So I think the change is good, because in the end I think it vindicates what a lot of us have been saying. Look, you should be tougher, you should make stricter rules. We're trying to do that in our state, but that is not enough.
In the end to get rid of the violence, there is no point in sending people away to jail for longer terms. I built more prison cells than any governor in history; all the governors together didn't build as many as I did. Of course, you have to do that. It's true. . . .

Richards: I built more than you did.

Cuomo: [Grinning] You didn't need them; you kept killing them. No, in my state, I built more than all the governors before me, but that's not enough. Being tough is not enough to stop crime. You have to do something about the drug problem and being tough is not going to stop the drug problem. This has been our thesis; we haven't been able to prove it.
Now you give them their day. They give you money for more prisons. They do their thing, which falls short of what you said was needed and it will become apparent that they will not solve the problem, not by multiplying the death penalty, not by increasing the number of jail cells. So giving them their day allows you to make your case by their failure.

Lowell Weicker: I'm glad [the Republicans won] because to my way of thinking this plays out the great free-lunch theory that was started by Ronald Reagan.
Now talk about change. When I was a young man, joining the Republican Party, Democrats were spendthrifts, horrible as to how they viewed the government, the spending of monies. If anybody made the Democrats look like minor leaguers when it came to fiscal responsibility it was Ronald Reagan. The free lunch theory of government was put into action by President Reagan, continued by President Bush, but the reason why nobody had to pay a price was moderate Republicans, when the Republicans had a majority in the Senate -- and I was a part of that group -- managed to forestall the worst effects of the Reagan economics program. And the governors of the states stepped into the breach to again forestall the worst of the consequences.
Now the public having been given a small taste of the free lunch, from two Republican executives, all of a sudden felt, let's have more of this, not knowing that this time there was no political safety net to forestall the consequences of the free lunch. No moderates control the Republican Party within the United States Senate. And the governors themselves are under enormous pressure to accede.
The fact is that we're not doing very well because the Federal Government doesn't have any money. It's out of money. Therefore, it can't choose the most sensible options toward the resolution of any problem. And how is that going to get improved by what is being presented in terms of free-lunch economics? Now, not only will there be the thrill of the free lunch, but there will be the disappointment of what happens when you've eaten this free lunch and you have nothing to show for it.
The American people have never been made to suffer the consequences of Reagan economics, of Bush economics. So now it's going to happen.
 
Cuomo: Lowell made a very, very good point that you have to stay with. When Reagan did this, the people didn't notice, why? Because the states raised their real property taxes, if they had them; they raised their sales taxes. While he was cutting the income tax, the progressive tax, in Washington, all the states, most of them, were raising their local taxes to pick up the tab.
Now you can't do it anymore at the local level, because the pressure has mounted against you. They won't do it; they want to cut their taxes. You can't raise yours. There is going to be the inevitable lack of services, lack of roads and bridges work, lack of criminal-justice services and lack in social services. And that will manifest itself.
 
Richards: I do not wish ill will to the Republicans at the expense of hard times for the American public. I think it's a hard price to pay, but the truth is that the chickens are coming home to roost. And those chickens roosting are going to be felt in a lot of ways across this society, not just by the poor but by all of us.
 
WHAT THE VOTE MEANT
 
Purdum: By one analysis, the cumulative aggregate margin of victory that changed the control of Congress was about 18,000 votes. If you take the 14 closest races in which Republicans won, I am told that the total would add up to roughly a few thousand votes. So if you look at it that way, what was the election about?
 
Richards: I think that the election itself was only the tip of what is a much larger sociological and economic change. I think this election was a manifestation of the serious anxiety in the population. Mario and I have talked about this before, but I think if the Republicans had been in power, you would have seen a similar occurrence, which was that the mood was get rid of what you've got and get something else just in case it might make me, the voter, feel better.
And the fact that the Democrats were in power, that they had control of Congress for a long time, that they had the Speaker, the President, many of the governors. That it was a real expression on their part of a desire for change.
I think that the social programs of this country got set 60 years ago in the 1930's. My criticism of the Democrats is that we have tinkered and shaved and moved things around to the margins of the basic programs that were established a very long time ago. We've not seen any really dramatic alteration of those programs.
And so what's happening in the United States is that no one is addressing the fact that you can no longer maintain a middle-class existence by simply being willing to work hard. The old truisms that were established -- that all of us accepted, Number 1, if you're willing to work, there will be a job for you, is no longer true. And Number 2, that a public school education is sufficient to maintain a middle-class existence.
Now that neither of those is true, it's causing enormous unease among people. They see massive layoffs in a readjusting society. Even the people equipped to work within the com puter society are all afraid that their skills are going to be insufficient.
So what happens to the Americans out there who are told that they must provide for their family? They look around them and there is no security. There's no security. I think that's what you saw evidenced in a big way in the last election.

Weicker: First of all, to me the election was a continuation of an unwillingness of the American people to run their government.
Now the essence of our whole system is that the people are the engine. They've given up that power and they've done it increasingly election after election after election. I think we all recognize whether -- it wouldn't make a difference whether it was Republicans or Democrats, you've got government by minority right now in this nation, overwhelmingly, at not only the Federal level but state and local, even more so.

Purdum: You mean by that the loudest, angriest, whiniest part?

Weicker: I'm saying to you, when 38 percent of the people vote, put at its broadest terms, I suspect that means that probably 20 percent is the majority and that sure is not a majority when compared to the entire voting universe out there. Everybody loves to blame the Republicans and the Democrats, Washington, the capital of Texas, Albany, Hartford, whatever. Everybody likes to point the finger as if the business of government had nothing to do with them. And that in itself is an attitude that ought to be kicked in the butt.
The reason why we have what we have, good and bad, is because the American people make things happen or they don't happen. We have moved from a politics of accountability to a politics of re-electibility. So that is all encompassing as to how the candidates and officials present themselves.
Both parties, and the candidates of both parties on any difficult issue try to achieve the softest possible landing. And the harshness of reality doesn't permit you a soft landing on any of these tough issues. So deficits do not get resolved. Cities don't get resolved. Racial isolation doesn't get resolved. These are tough issues. You can't soft land them, but everybody knows that if you try to take a hard position on it, you don't get elected. That's everything. Unfortunately for the greatness of the United States, we're going to come to the realization it isn't everything.

Cuomo: You asked what happened in the election. Nobody knows. And what difference does it make? Is it an instruction to the American people, this tiny difference of 6 percent in a total vote of 38 percent? Is it an instruction to the politicians?
The Republicans try to make you believe that they voted for the Contract With America. Nobody knew what the Contract With America was, until a couple of weeks before when they started describing it.
If you asked anybody on Election Day in New York State, "Where's Cuomo on the Contract With America?" [they'd have said] "Mario's a good guy; he doesn't make contracts. Whatever you said about Cuomo, he's honest. He never made a real contract. No, not that kind of contract, a Gingrich. Who's Gingrich? What's Gingrich? Is that a thing or is it a person?"
So this notion that the people went to the polls in Texas and in New York and in other places and said here's how we feel on the economy -- it wasn't like that, I don't believe, and I don't think it makes any difference.
I showed my mother Fortune magazine once. She saw Lee Iacocca's face on the cover and she asked me, in Italian, who he was and I said who he was. She said, "Ah, Italiano" and I said, "Yes, he is." And I said, "He's complaining because he makes $16 million, and he thinks he should make 25." She said, "What does he do?" I said, "He makes cars." She said in Italian, "What's the matter, you can't make a car?"
The notion that you can get rich and powerful -- that's why they came here. Now that group is growing. The group on the bottom is also growing, unfortunately. And they've dropped out. They're not even voting against anybody. They've given up on it. They've created their own culture in a lot of places.
It's that group in the middle that shifts and you shift just a small percentage of them -- 7 points is a landslide -- right, the country goes right. And we all react to it as though everybody did it.
I think the important thing is, what is it -- quite apart from the vote -- that is creating this heavy sense of negativism, disconcertment, if you will, anger, willingness to scapegoat? Anybody who goes to people's houses and talks in living rooms and listens at the dining room table, knows that there's a lot of anger, a lot of confusion and therefore people want change, something better.
 
WHY AMERICA IS SO ANGRY
 
Cuomo: What is the basic mood? Here's what I believe it is. The biggest event in my lifetime was the Second World War and we have never been able to recreate it. Some people say thank God, but there's something we lose by not recreating what happened in the Second World War.
The Second World War was the last time that this country believed in anything profoundly, any great single cause. What was it? They were evil; we were good. That was Tojo, that was that S.O.B. Hitler, that was Mussolini, that bum. They struck at us in the middle of the night, those sneaks. We are good, they are bad. Let's all get together, we said, and we creamed them. We started from way behind. We found strength in this common commitment, this commonality, community, family, the idea of coming together was best served in my lifetime in the Second World War.
You never had a war quite like it. In the beginning of Iraq, you thought you did and a lot of people got excited. Hot dog, we've got another Hitler -- Saddam Hussein. But then after a while, everybody got confused. Was it the oil? What the hell am I fighting for the Emir for? Who is the Emir? What is an Emir? What's Kuwait? What did they do for me? Why is my son going? So that lost its luster as a cause. We haven't had another great cause.
We've not had a great hero or heroine since Martin Luther King, Jr. and John Kennedy. And they were taken down by fate. "Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?" It was perfect -- Paul Simon from Queens summed it all up. Where are our heroes, great causes? No cause. No hero. No heroine. Nothing big to believe in. Nothing to wrap your arms around.
Now, specifically two other things happened. Your economy after the Second World War was incredible to the economists, because they predicted depressions, no markets, nine million coming out of the service. How are you going to put them to work? Japan, Europe down. Whom are you going to sell to? They figured out the G.I. Bill of Rights. Eisenhower started building roads. He started manufacturing, the growth of technology that you got from the war. You brought Japan to life. You brought Europe back to life. They started buying from you. You became the maker, the seller, the broker, the creditor. You ran the joint until the 70's.
In the 70's something changed very dramatically. When I was growing up, when you said "Made in Japan," it meant you drop it on the floor it breaks. In the 1970's when you said, "Made in Japan," it meant when you close the car door, it sounded like a bank vault door. Japan was back, making things better than you were. They started taking your markets away.
You used to be a creditor; now you're a debtor. Five and half trillion bucks Federal debt. You used to snap your fingers and say interest rates. Now they tell you to go to hell. You've lost your dominance as some of us were trying to say in 1984. We've got debt mounting. We're falling behind. It's going to catch us.
It did finally in '88, '89. People out of work now, they're beginning to understand. That factory worker said, "Jesus, I thought I could work for the rest of my life." I married Matilda while I was in school in the 50's. My father thought I was crazy. I said: "Pa, don't worry about it. If I get out of school, I'll be able to work three jobs." And I did. There was all the work in the world. That was the 50's. You knew that if you kept your health and you wanted to work and you worked like hell, you could outwork the other guy and do very well.
That's all changed. We finally understand that our futures are uncertain in this global economy and people are nervous about it and they don't see you doing anything about it. The guys at the top don't care because the investors are doing very well. The guys at the bottom have given up. They're on drugs. They're in trouble. But the guy and the gal in the middle -- the $30,000-a-year factory worker -- are very nervous.
That's what this is all about: "If I can make a living, I don't give a damn about your social problems. I'll move away from them. I'll move into a house; I'll build a big wall. I'll have security guards, my own swimming pool. The heck with all the trouble. My kids are safe. I'll send them to a very special school. I'll insulate them from all the pain." And you can do it.
But the economy is weak and so people don't have that option and now they confront all the following which happened when I was Governor: crack, AIDS, homelessness, babies making babies, the manifest instability of families, children killing children with semiautomatic weapons. That affected everybody. You can't move away from that. You see it every night. It gets to your son. He can be a drug addict. You put this all altogether and the people are confused, angry.
Of course they tear down whatever power is in place. If it were Republicans, Ann's right, they would have knocked off the Republicans. This is Clinton, this is Mitchell, this is Foley. We don't know if they did it or didn't do it. "All we know is you're in charge. Hey, Mario, you've been there 12 years. Don't give us your long answers. You can talk about anything, but we don't hear it. We like you; we think you're honest and all that, but please go get yourself a job, will you, because maybe we need somebody who will chop off their heads."
 
THE STATE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS
 
Weicker: Dear friends, I've got news for you. The middle class has done very well in this country, extraordinarily well, and this Balkanization of us as a people into whatever our economics are or race or opportunities or our problems, I think very ill-suits the vision that is the United States of America. Why, for example when we refer to poor people in this country do we say "welfare"?
How about all the welfare, if you want to call it that -- I don't chose to call it that, I prefer assistance -- to all Americans? What about everything that the middle class gets? What was the biggest part of our budget in the state of Connecticut? It was Medicaid driven by nursing homes for middle-income Connecticut, putting mom and dad at the poverty level just to get them in a nursing home -- 10 percent of the budget in the state of Connecticut. You call that welfare? I think so. I had no problems with it, but I think if we all look at what assistance we've received from our Government, whether it's me and the G.I. Bill or whether it's nursing homes or whether it's Head Start.
I think the sooner we understand that whatever our opportunity or our problem, we have all been there at one time or another asking for assistance and the more we feel that somebody's entitled to something special or that the only way you're going to get that is to walk over the back of the other individual, the more we debase America. I'm sorry but I think that the America we know is gone. The fact is that for all the criticisms of public education and welfare and all the rest of these programs, we're still the best in the world.
What we're doing now is dismantling the essence of our greatness whether it's education or the creating of economic opportunity or the fact that we have compassion for segments of the society that no other nation of the world has ever had.
Why the hell are we tearing ourselves apart? That's different from saying we can't do better. We can, but right now the American people, as I've said before, just better understand that the problem doesn't reside with a few politicians. It resides with them -- the fact that they've got to go ahead and participate. They've got to demand accountability, which could very well be a painful process. And they're going to have to put money up front in order to make sure that the problems don't compound downstream.

Cuomo: When Lowell starts talking about what we've done with the middle class, I get a stomachache, because I tried a couple of times going to Long Island, saying what you're talking about, the middle class. You guys have one of the best university systems in the world. It doesn't cost you diddly -- no tuition increase for my first seven years. You have one of the best highway systems in the world. Who uses it? You have the largest park system in the whole world, right here in New York State. That's all middle class. Who the hell do you think goes there? Not the black guys from my old neighborhood.
We have created a middle-class paradise and you're beating up on the poor people, because they're taking food off your table.
I got killed; Dave Garth had a heart attack. "Our chances are slim enough," he said. [laughter]
You've got to focus again on what it is that the current policies are going to do and what they're not going to do and what the result of that is going to be. This approach to me really says this: "Look, we're not really going to try to solve the problems of the poor people. They're not us. They don't vote for us. We win without them. As a matter of fact we win by running against them." Reagan holds up the jobs and says if they wanted to work, they could. He says, the homeless, if they wanted shelter, they could have it. A baby having babies. It's only because nobody ever told her how to do the right thing. And they're pretending that the problem will solve itself.
So you have an attitude really that says, and Reagan did it, look, I can pile up the debt, I can con you with my smile. He made the denial of compassion respectable. That was his greatest thing. He was so genial, so non-threatening, so popular, and so lovable that he made America forget that you have an obligation, Number 1, in compassion, and also in common sense. Because unless you solve those problems, they'll come back to haunt you. That's what's going to happen.
 
THE ESSENCE OF LEADERSHIP
 
Purdum: What should people be willing to give up? Can you persuade them? Is there a way to persuade them?

Weicker: My problem with the two parties, my own, having belonged to it for 30 years, the Democrats also, is that leaders aren't being produced. I suspect that both of these individuals [indicating Richards and Cuomo] will remain powerful forces within the Democratic Party because I think we are going to come back to the issue of leadership.
The answer now is that the American public doesn't want leadership. It doesn't want to make sacrifices, but like we always do, Americans have an uncanny knack of all of a sudden coming around to what needs doing and they'll do it.

Richards: Mario said a little bit ago that he had not seen anything that equaled, nor have I, the commitment of the nation that we felt in World War II. There was a brief moment when we decided that we were going to put a man on the moon; that we were going to commit ourselves to something that was larger than this nation with the space program.
If the atmosphere that exists today existed then, we would never have gone into space. You wouldn't see the satellite system that exists, the modern communication ever having taken place. You would not have seen the enormous technological advances that have taken place as the consequence of the space program. And that was not our intention. Our intention was to put a man in space. The consequences of that were that we became technologically in the forefront of the world at having done enormously important scientific things.
So you say, what should Clinton do? What should some other leader do? Call us to a larger national purpose. What that is, well, if I'd known that, I would still be in office.

Cuomo: I think that's sad. I think Ann has put her finger on it: what is the national purpose? I've tried once describing the character of the American people. And I came up with four marks of the American character. One was what are we as Americans. Well, we came here for opportunity; that's a big one, everybody, papa, mama, the immigrants. Liberty, absolutely, well, there's never been a freer place that stayed well ordered as wonderfully well as we have, except for the Civil War. Responsibility, yeah, opportunity, liberty, but responsibility. You have to work here, if you break the law, you go to jail. It's the fourth one, after opportunity, liberty, responsibility that is the tricky one. Is it individuality or is it family? Is it community or is it individuality? Do you really believe in the notion of community? As Jeremiah shows, you will find your own welfare in the welfare of the whole community. Do you really believe there is a connection between you and the kid in the ghetto, even if you moved out, even if she's black, even if she's not yours?
I say in the end our national purpose must be to think as a family. There are two political motivations. One is compassion; doesn't work. The other is self interest; does work. When self-interest and compassion come together in the same objective, then you have a perfect political position.
 
ON ISOLATION IN OFFICE
 
Purdum: Is this mood of antipolitics a real thing? Does it have any roots? [to Richards] In 8 years as Treasurer and 4 years as Governor did you get too isolated from people? Too much time in the helicopter, too little time in the neighborhoods? Is that a bum rap?

Richards: I spent more time on the road probably than any governor in the history of the state. It wasn't just a matter of speaking to Rotary clubs and Chambers of Commerce either. It was a matter of holding town forums to be able to bring people in to talk about problems. We did a series of summits for young people because it seems to me that when you talk about juvenile crime, you need to talk to juveniles to find out really what's going on in their lives.
And I had one young man say: "Governor, you're talking about what we can do in the schools. Don't you understand it really doesn't make any difference what you do in the school, as long as I go home? Once I leave school and hit the war zone" -- which is what he called his neighborhood -- "what you do in school all day doesn't make any difference." That kid very clearly saw that school was a component part of his life, but unless we made some difference in the circumstances under which he and his family lived we couldn't correct in school what was taking place in a larger world. So the relevance that this young man saw to what government action did to actually make anything better in his life simply did not exist and he ain't going to vote.

Cuomo: I didn't lose touch with the people of my state. It's just that I couldn't give the people what I knew they wanted all the time. I couldn't see my way to giving them the tax cut over the last four years, because I didn't think it was the right judgment. Of course they wanted the tax cut. Of course they want the death penalty. Now maybe I'm wrong, but I just couldn't see it that way. So my problem politically was not being out of touch with them; it was not being able to give them what they asked for in enough of the cases to win popularity and as things got worse in their perception, they were less and less willing to forgive me the differences.
 
THE ROLE OF A FORMER GOVERNOR
 
Purdum: So what's the job of a lapsed politician in all this?

Richards: What responsibility do I feel as a citizen of this country now that I am no longer an elected official? I feel the same responsibility that I felt before I was in office and that is that I must do my part as best I see to help make my state and my country better. And I'll continue to do that in whatever way the opportunity offers itself.
But I've got probably a different point of view and different feelings about it. Mario's going to do one thing. Lowell, I guess is going to do another and I'm probably going to do another because we are going to act now as individual citizens, but I don't feel that I have some soapbox attached to my belt to drag around from one place to the other. I don't feel that it's up to us somehow to carry some banner into the fray. Mario and I talked about this when we did our Dorito commercial [for the Super Bowl]. People call in. . . .

Cuomo: I was hoping you would get through this without mentioning. . . . [Laughter].

Richards: You get a jillion telephone calls from people who love you and people who might have some other interest in you to save the world with television talk shows and radio talk shows. I just don't see myself in that role and not to be snide or mean. I mean this honestly. I don't have time to talk to anyone who has time to call a radio program.

Weicker: I'd better respond to this. Peter Brown, who writes for Scripps- Howard, read that I was going to do a radio talk show, so he called me and said, "Lowell, why are you doing this?" And I said, "Well, Peter, to respond to all the unanswered bull that's out there."

Richards: Well, that's the best answer I've heard yet.

Cuomo: You have three ex-governors here. You accumulate their lifetimes of experience in politics and living, it's about 100 years. It would be kind of foolish to throw it away. And what we're saying is, look, we learned an awful lot. Let's see if we can't share some of it. We made a lot of mistakes, maybe you can avoid some of them.
 
THE OUTLOOK IN 1996
 
Purdum: What do you make of the political woods for '96? Who's the Republican ticket going to be?

Richards: Phil Gramm.

Purdum: Really? And for Vice President?

Richards: Oh, I have no idea. Whoever he likes and whoever will buy it.

Cuomo: President Clinton will be the Democratic nominee. I don't know who will be on the Republican side. The one thing that I'm surest of between now and '96 is that three things will happen that nobody figured on and they could change everything. So my guess is that Bill Clinton is the Democratic candidate.

Purdum: Are you saying three events that can't be predicted now?
 
Cuomo: Three events. There are always at least three.

Weicker: Clinton for the Democrats, Dole for the Republicans and a major third-party, centrist candidate. And it won't be Ross Perot.

Purdum: It won't be Colin Powell, either?

Weicker: I'm not saying that. I'm just saying to you I think there will be a major third-party candidate, a centrist, who will have great appeal and that it will be a very tight three-way race.

Richards: In that scenario, if Lowell is right, it will be a tight three-way and I think ultimately Clinton will win it.

Beyond the Shroud

BYLINE: By MAX FRANKEL 

 BODY:
LAST AUTUMN, IN A FLIGHT OF ANGRY rhetoric, I accused the three main television networks of drawing a great shroud across the mind of America and leading the public back toward isolationism. I observed that the dwindling TV staffs abroad still report an occasional massacre or famine but that most evenings the newscasts and magazine shows treat the five billion folks beyond our borders as inconsequential and irrelevant. That conclusion now requires well, not correction but, as the old, incorrigible New Yorker magazine would say, amplification.
Many readers reported similar resentment of television's withdrawal from the world and also of the meager diet of international news in most newspapers. An energetic demurral, however, came from NBC's Tom Brokaw, a frequent foreign flier and student of both the world and its treatment on the tube. He cited some recent television reports that defied the trend I was bemoaning. More insistently, he argued that television and journalism are not so much the causes of a new American isolationism as its victims. 
 Brokaw observed, for example, that when Bryant Gumbel at long last persuaded his network to send the "Today" show to Africa for one week of fascinating reportage, that program's normally large audience faded rapidly from day to day. Brokaw pointed out that if one network scheduled a foreign-affairs documentary for prime time, the predators at Fox would swiftly counter in the same hour with sex and song; indeed, even the American Movie Channel would leap in to bash the perpetrators of journalism with some popular golden oldie.
And there's more than Nielsen ratings to prove that Brokaw is right: speak of world affairs and most eyes glaze over. Americans are again withdrawing into their shell, trying to hide from the strange and the distant. In the bitter words of one reader, Joan Sapon, who reported her family's failure at publishing a weekly compendium of European news, "Americans just don't give a damn about what is happening outside their borders unless Di and Charles are involved."
The news from Washington demonstrates that the politicians have caught the drift. I had thought that after many journalists decided to ignore the world, politicians would, too. But no, the politicians have found opportunity in isolationism. They perceive profit not in ignoring the world but in trashing it.
The Republican contractors, led by Newt Gingrich, for example, dig for votes by proclaiming that "the nation has gone too far in the direction of globalism." With Communism in ruins, they are desperate to find a new foreign enemy that might justify their nativism. And so to replace the Kremlin, they've chosen the United Nations. No more support for international peacekeeping in fevered places like Mozambique or Macedonia; no more cooperation with foreigners in ugly places like Rwanda or Somalia. Billions for defensive shields in outer space, but not even pennies for pursuing peace on earth.
Whereas Americans once found inspiration in grand admonitions like "No More Munichs" and "No More Vietnams," they are now asked to march to the petty slogan of "No More Somalias" -- no more policing in the desperate alleys of Mogadishu if foreigners are involved.
Yet another Washington posse, led by Senator Jesse Helms, rides against foreign aid, as if the $13 billion America spends annually for friendly armies and the world's poorest economies contributes nothing to averting war, or famine or disease. Of all the advanced nations, America invests the least, per capita, in foreign aid. But the demagogues in Congress, who rarely neglect to denounce aid in their newsletters home, have misled Americans into believing that they give away 15 times as much as they actually do.
And at the fringes, left and right, stand the guardians of an illusory American "sovereignty," railing against the new World Trade Organization because it will not give any nation a veto in the resolution of disputes. Ralph Nader guards this barricade, afraid that some of America's laws on safety or the environment might be challenged as impediments to trade. And beside him stands Pat Buchanan, demanding higher trade barriers to protect Americans against the competition of lower-paid foreign workers.
There are good reasons to worry about our competitiveness in the world. But there's no way to lock the world out. Just consider the major American corporations, the ones that make our cars and refine our oil, transmit our telephone calls, bank our deposits and design our computers. They are truly citizens of the world, not of any single country. They take their capital, resources and talent where they find them and make a single product with parts from many lands. If not subjected to international rules and supervision, they would heed no one's. There's no way to nail a modern corporation to any piece of soil or make it salute a single flag. Nor is there any way to immunize the dollar against the daily speculations of foreign traders or, as Russia and China learned to their dismay, to seal a nation's borders against alien ideas.
There is nothing "sovereign" about an economy that must adjust to the tides of foreign inflations and recessions. There is nothing "sovereign" about a society that is routinely dependent on transnational information. There is no safety in isolation when a dozen crazies can smuggle a nuclear warhead into any airport.
If anything, Brother Brokaw, these realities require all of us in the media to resist the Babbitts that would have us pander to America's small-town nostalgia. The country needs more correspondents in Moscow and Mogadishu, not fewer -- not just to cover government coups and warlord rivalries but to explain the mechanics of modern life. Americans need instruction in trade and in terrorism, in international banking and global drug-running. They may not be ready for lessons every night, but the media had better be ready for the night that hijackers strike, banks collapse or CBS is bought by Radio Riyadh.
It's true that even the savagery of Bosnia or Rwanda does not directly damage America's security or standard of living. But surely the threat of tens of thousands of nuclear weapons is greater now that they lie scattered in unfamiliar hands than when their masters could be addressed by phone or hot line. The foreign threat to American jobs and incomes would be greater, not less, if there were no international civil servants to settle arguments about trade. And the American environment cannot be protected only by American laws; polluted clouds and acid rains know no frontier.
All this should be good news for the media, because so long as the world remains a mysterious and dangerous place, there will be exciting stories to report. The parochial competitions of other networks and newspapers must not be allowed to gut this essential work.
But yes, Brokaw, there is another side to the problem. Those competitive pressures spring from a deep yearning in American hearts, a yearning for relief from alien concerns. As a former publisher of The Times, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, once remarked, "Along with responsible newspapers we must have responsible readers" because "the fountain serves no useful purpose if the horse refuses to drink." Just don't turn off the water.

The Yen Bubble Keeps Growing

BYLINE: BY FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
It is the bubble of the decade, and there is no telling when it will stop expanding. But someday it will, and then it will burst.
The bubble is in the Japanese yen, a currency that, on the basis of comparative purchasing power, has gone from unreasonably high to ridiculously overvalued. 
 The latest leap of the yen has come as Japanese have dumped dollars, and it is not hard to understand why. William Sterling, a Merrill Lynch economist, estimates that since 1977 the Japanese have lost the equivalent of $400 million from depreciation of the dollars they took in exchange for Toyotas and other exports. Nor did their attempts to buy long-term assets -- among them Pebble Beach, Rockefeller Center and Columbia Pictures -- work out very well.
The panic could continue, but not forever. Bob Barbera, the economist at Capital Investments International, sees signs of a vicious circle. As the yen strengthens, Japanese companies get less competitive and their profit outlook weakens. That puts pressure on Japanese stock prices, and thus on the capital adequacy of Japanese banks, which are stuffed full of stocks. So the banks need to shore up their capital by selling foreign assets. And that drives the yen up. The dollar now trades for 89.1 yen, down from 100 yen in early January.
In classical economic theory, things could never have gotten this far. By now, the rapid rise of the yen -- it is up 77 percent against the dollar in five years -- would have brought a flood of imports. And exports would have been severely damaged. Mr. Barbera argues that was delayed by Japanese barriers to imports and by the willingness of Japanese society to pay much more for goods -- whether made in Japan or elsewhere -- than was charged overseas. But that, he says, is finally changing. First in alcohol, then in apparel and now in consumer electronics, cheap foreign goods have begun to grab significant market share.
It has not been widely noticed, but Japanese imports are surging. Over the past three months, the rate is running 72 percent above the previous year's pace, even while retail sales are weak. The walls of Fortress Japan are crumbling.
That means Japanese companies are going to have to raise prices abroad to make up for the need to be more competitive at home. Japan's trade surplus will slip, and eventually it will be clear that Japanese industry, for all its virtues, cannot be competitive with the yen even close to current levels.
For now, the weakness of the dollar against other major industrialized currencies seems likely to keep the industrial part of the American economy strong, even as the consumer side weakens in part because of higher prices for some imports. It may be some time before market psychology, now completely against the dollar, begins to turn. There is talk that central banks, having finally noticed how much their dollar reserves have depreciated, will diversify by buying yen and German marks. And those sales, it is said, will drive the dollar even lower. The fact that Japan has problems that demand a lower yen is largely ignored.
Mr. Barbera calls the yen a "boomerang currency," arguing that when it starts to fall it will do so rapidly, devastating those who bet on the yen. But he won't forecast a date. "The most powerful thing about speculative markets at the end is that they are going up because they are going up," he says. "Once they start going down, you remember a whole host of reasons why they should never have gone up that much to begin with."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 26, 1995, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
The Market Watch column last Sunday about the rising value of the yen misstated the sum that was lost by Japanese businesses as a result of the decline of the dollar since 1977. It is $400 billion, not $400 million.

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
Hot Dogs, Volleyball Courts and Waterfront Access

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
VOLLEYBALL players of Queens, take comfort. Thanks to the efforts of Vincent Luccisano, you will have three new sand-surfaced courts to play on this summer. To find them, take a spin down to Howard Beach on Cross Bay Boulevard, that speedway to the Rockaways.
While there, stop in for clams or a frankfurter at his 50-seat restaurant, now in construction. Nonplayers will be welcome too. 
 It is the triumph of Mr. Luccisano, a 36-year-old property owner, that he has reached the construction stage on a commercial project on land that borders on a tidal channel called Shellbank Basin. The project is the second to win approval under the city's waterfront zoning ordinance, adopted by the City Council in October 1993. The first was a nursing home on Surf Avenue in Coney Island.
"My family had an archery range here 35 years ago," said Mr. Luccisano, who also runs the Surfside Motel south of the volleyball site. "People would like to see this area get back to entertainment uses."
Small-sized infill properties on commercial strips in Queens are not perhaps what the Department of City Planning had principally in mind when it drafted the waterfront zoning ordinance. But the Shellbank Basin development provides a striking example of the impact of the law on a small property.
On a land area of 21,900 square feet, 24 percent is to be devoted to public areas required by the new law. The cost to build them is about 20 percent of the total development cost, excluding the cost of the land.
The law requires waterfront property developers to provide public access to the water and "view corridors" from the street as well. Since the law offers no direct compensation to owners for providing these public benefits, property owners are likely to doubt the constitutionality of the law.
"There is no question that the waterfront law is vulnerable to a challenge," said Sheldon Lobel, a Manhattan land-use lawyer whose firm represents Mr. Luccisano. He also said that planners had shown flexibility in administering it.
Marilyn Mammano, director of zoning and urban design in the Department of City Planning, underscored the need for flexibility. "The Planning Commission insisted on it, because one rule cannot fit all in New York City," she said. "Sometimes we'll modify the rules or even waive them. We go out of our way to help the small developer, and we expedite action."
Recent United States Supreme Court decisions have given planning and zoning officials across the country new cause to heed the economic effect of zoning actions. In an Oregon case last year -- Dolan v. City of Tigard -- the High Court held that there has to be a "rough proportionality" between a zoning law that restricts development and the harm that the development might do.
THE 5-to-4 decision for the first time gave the government the burden of justifying its zoning action. Previously, it was left to the landowner claiming an uncompensated land-taking to prove that a regulation would remove all or substantially all economic value from a property.
The Shellbank Basin site is something of a test of the ability of a small commercial development to bear the uncompensated cost of providing a public benefit. If the project succeeds in generating the annual revenue that the owner is projecting -- $1 million a year -- it can digest them, commercial brokers said. But some also suggest that with no drive-through, and parking for only 10 cars, that may not be possible.
The property has 330 feet of street frontage and is 85 feet deep -- 28,000 square feet in all, including the portion under water. It is near the north end of a commercial strip that runs nine-tenths of a mile from 157th Street, where Shellbank Basin ends, to the Cross Bay Bridge.
The Luccisano family has held the land for 12 years. Its original hope was to build stores or a fast-food operation on the entire site by building a bulkhead with a permit from the state's Department of Environmental Conservation. But years of negotiation with the department never succeeded. In the end, the owner decided on a plan that would require construction only past mean high water, and therefore no bulkheading or state permit.
The city's new waterfront zoning regulations had gone into effect by then. "Getting through City Planning was a breeze as long as we abided by the regulations," Mr. Luccisano said. "There were no time delays."
The restaurant will have 1,900 square feet of space and surface parking for 10 cars. There will also be customer seating to the side and rear of the three volleyball courts. One of the courts is regulation size; the other two are smaller, for use by children. Arrangements are to be made to form leagues for competitive play.
Mr. Luccisano said he got the idea of building volleyball courts from watching the sport on television. The courts are an acceptable use of the land from a zoning standpoint, and the developer expects them to be a commercial success.
The estimated development cost of the site is $600,000, excluding any consideration of the cost for the land. Site improvements will cost about $300,000, said Thomas F. Cusanelli of Maspeth, the architect. At least half of that, or 20 to 25 percent of the total cost, is attributable to improvements required by the waterfront zoning text. These include lighting, walkways, curbing and plantings, a retaining wall, and additional plumbing for drainage. Joseph Giannetti of Mr. Cusanelli's office designed the project.
A paved walkway from Cross Bay Boulevard will enter the property between the restaurant and the volleyball courts, and end at the canal. At the canal, a 7-foot-wide walkway will run 330 feet along the embankment to the canal, with a three-foot wrought-iron guardrail as protection for pedestrians. Nine lampposts 13 feet high will illuminate the walkway in the evening, when the gate will be locked. "The waterfront access will benefit us in the end," Mr. Luccisano said. "We're hoping to do a big take-out and car-hop business. There's heavy beach traffic in the summer."
One of the beneficiaries of the flexibility planners have shown is another Shellbank Basin owner, Russo's on the Bay, a catering establishment at 162-45 Cross Bay Boulevard. Frank Russo Jr., the owner of Russo's, was far into planning of an 18,500-square-foot addition to his building when the waterfront zoning ordinance was enacted. He had bought the land, and had built a small clubhouse for use by a yacht club that Russo's had moved from a waterfront location to make way for the addition.
UNDER the new zoning, Russo's would have lost 40 percent of the development capacity of the newly purchased land, said William F.J. Fegan, a partner in Levien Deliso Songer Fegan of Forest Hills, Russo's architect. Staying within the floor-area limits of the property and yet providing two levels of off-street parking, as called for in the plan, left no way to provide an open "waterfront yard" as well. The waterfront yard is an area running 30 feet back from the high water mark that must be preserved as open space under the zoning law.
In addition, the loss of building area would have forced an impractical alteration of room configurations, Mr. Fegan said. In the end, the yard requirement was waived. But Russo's agreed to acquire from the city the land for a mapped but unbuilt street at the south end of the property. It is to be maintained as a visual corridor to the channel.
The waterfront zoning law affects only parcels of 10,000 square feet or more with a water frontage of at least 100 feet. Parkland and manufacturing zones, which account for 73 percent of the shoreline, are exempt. And in residential zones, the low-rise housing zones are also exempt, but medium- to high-rise zones (R6 and above) are covered.
Small owners in New York City are of course unlikely to bring constitutional tests of zoning actions. Even well-financed owners are not likely to find this a practical approach. The more likely outcome is that the law will suppress new commercial development on small sites.
"It's a tough pill to swallow when you have to give up private land for public access, but what could I do?" said Mr. Luccisano, adding that it was expensive to carry the Cross Bay Boulevard land without getting income from it. "I had no choice but to take a chance," he said.

HEADLINE: Rise in Hudson Valley Tourism

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
OVERSEAS, the dollar may be down. But at home the tourist dollar buys more than ever, especially in the Hudson River Valley region. That's the message 200 vendors hope to impart to more than 1,000 tour operators and travel planners at Travel Expo '95, a tourism trade show on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday at the Mid-Hudson Civic Center in Poughkeepsie.
To emphasize how important travel is in Westchester County, the Westchester Convention and Visitors Bureau released figures for 1994 that show that tourism -- which includes conventions, meetings and vacation travel -- generated more than $385 million, up 24.5 percent from 1993. Convention bookings alone were up 347 percent from the previous year. And the jump in employment in the tourist industry generated an all-time-high industry payroll of $507.6 million. 
 "The revenues from tourism are becoming even more important when the jobs and income are disappearing from other sectors of the economy in Westchester," said Georgia G. Kalayjian, president of the Convention and Visitors Bureau. "The numbers are impressive, but I think they are only the tip of the iceberg. We are now aggressively marketing the region as a prime destination to a national and international audience, and when our efforts pay off the sky will be the limit."
As for Travel Expo, Ms. Kalayjian said it is New York's top tourism industry show.
"This is a great opportunity for all of us in the Hudson Valley region to sell the area as a prime tourist destination to the rest of the country," she said. "Tourism has always increased in regions where the expo has been held. And we're all looking forward to new business."
The convention bureau and many Westchester hotels and tourist sites will be showing their wares to the travel industry at the expo. "We're co-oping our booth with Stouffer, Marriott and the Ramada Inn in New Rochelle," Ms. Kalayjian said. "The hospitality industry in Westchester has made a strong comeback." The latest figures for hotel sales in Westchester show an increase of 40 percent compared with the same period a year ago, she said.
Attractions like Kykuit and Caramoor have already brought thousands of new visitors to Westchester. "What's more," Ms. Kalayjian added, "the Caramoor International Music Festival, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, was named as one of the 1995 top 100 events in North America by the American Bus Association and Destinations magazine."
When it comes to increasing tourism, the American Bus Association is considered a major player. "They represent more than 700 motor coach owners, tour company members plus another 2,200 members who belong to related travel organizations," Ms. Kalayjian said.
Being named a top event by the association, Ms. Kalayjian added, is good for business. "We expect a ripple effect, which means that the significant increase in tourists -- and revenues -- who will come to Caramoor will fan out to other sites in the county," she said. "Motor coach business is very important in bringing tourists to the region. And the old-fashioned idea that bus travel is confined to the low end of the touring industry is no longer accurate. Motor coach tours now attract the upscale market. The buses themselves are very luxurious and have all types of amenities aboard."
And they are often filled with tourists from overseas, Ms. Kalayjian said. "We're delighted that increasing numbers of travel agencies abroad are arranging two-day tours of our region for their clients who come to New York and want to see something outside of the city," she said. "As for the reaction of foreign tourists, it is one of amazement that we have so many historical sites."
Closer to home, she said, tourists from the Middle West have much the same reaction. "They are simply astounded when they see places like Lyndhurst and Sunnyside, and they invariably say that what we have in this country rivals the best attraction Europe has to offer."
Marilyn Birnbaum of Bedford agrees. "What can be better anywhere than a picnic on a summer night at Caramoor? Guests find it enchanting." Mrs. Birnbaum, who enjoys taking out-of-town visitors to places of interest in Westchester, says another one of her favorites is the Katonah Museum of Art. "Not only is the building a gem architecturally," she said, "but the exhibitions the museum presents throughout the year are really very fine."
Karen Woods, director of Dutchess County Tourism, said: "The economic benefit of motor coach business translates into big dollars. One 48-passenger motor coach staying overnight one day generates $5,500 a day in a community, and one motor coach coming just for a day trip generates more than $2,400 per day."
About 35 bus companies will bring representatives of 1,200 travel groups to the Expo. They will be looking for new packages to sell.
The visitor program at Kykuit, the Rockefeller house and gardens in Pocantico Hills, is operated by Historic Hudson Valley. Burns Patterson, a spokesman for that nonprofit educational organization, said that Historic Hudson Valley will also have a booth at the Expo.
"Kykuit has received such coverage in the national and international press that it acts as a magnet for the entire region," Mr. Patterson said, adding that in 1994, the first year Kykuit was open to the public, 45,000 visitors toured the site.
Last year, Mr. Patterson said, "a total of 220,000 people visited Sunnyside, Philipsburg Manor, Van Cortlandt Manor and the Union Church of Pocantico Hills in Westchester and Montgomery Place in Dutchess, which are our properties."
Historic Hudson Valley, Mr. Patterson added, is dedicated to preserving the cultural, historical and natural heritage of the Hudson River Valley.
"We operate with a budget of $6 million, and we spend most of it locally for goods and services," he said. "For example, we pay $150,000 a year to the White Plains Bus Company to take visitors up to Kykuit. And we spend many dollars for local landscaping companies, food services, and the like."
Tourism, he said, benefits everyone: "It exerts a strong economic force. Typically, for every dollar spent directly on tourism, four more will be spent on shops, restaurants and for goods and services."
Historic Hudson Valley was the beneficiary last Thursday of one of two gala parties at The Westchester, the megamall in White Plains. The event's proceeds, about $100,000, Mr. Patterson said, will be used to support the preservation of Hudson Valley's historic properties.
"The generous contribution made by the developer of The Westchester, the O'Connor Group, clearly shows that alliances between culture groups and the business community will benefit both," Mr. Patterson said. "The destination travel industry has become more sophisticated. Now in addition to the other attractions we can offer them, we have The Westchester, which is unrivaled in shopping facilities anywhere."
Caramoor was one of the beneficiaries of the other gala celebration, held Wednesday by Nordstrom to mark its opening in The Westchester. A Nordstrom spokesman said that the advance sale of tickets totaled more than $225,000 with half of that going to Caramoor. The other half will benefit St. Vincent's Hospital in Harrison.

NEW YORK 1960
Architecture and Urbanism Between the Second World War and the Bicentennial.
By Robert A. M. Stern, Thomas Mellins and David Fishman.
Illustrated. 1,374 pp. New York: The Monacelli Press/Penguin. $125. 
 IN 1971 the poet and art critic John Ashbery, visiting the new SoHo art scene in Manhattan, wrote that, even though one had to trudge through trash-strewn streets to get to the artists' "glittering white lofts," a regular visit to SoHo was now mandatory, "another in the expanding list of inconvenient pleasures New Yorkers are heir to." "Inconvenient pleasures" might well apply to "New York 1960: Architecture and Urbanism Between the Second World War and the Bicentennial," a gigantic book, just under eight pounds, with 1,213 pages of text and pictures, 134 pages of scholarly notes and a 26-page index. It is the work of Robert A. M. Stern, an architect, historian and professor of architecture at Columbia University, and Thomas Mellins and David Fishman, historians who have worked with Mr. Stern on various projects, including "Pride of Place," the public-television series on the development of American architecture. The book joins "New York 1900" and "New York 1930" in a projected five-volume history of the city's architecture and urban design. Still to come are "New York 1876" and "New York 2000." The dates in the titles refer to key years in the periods covered by each book.
The first two volumes celebrated what the authors define as "metropolitanism" in the half-century before World War II, when the city sought to establish the prototypes and standards by which governments, local and Federal, would meet their responsibilities in such areas as museums, parks, transportation and public housing. Though somewhat myopic in their failure to recall attendant social and economic inequities, the authors see New York, in those years, as "constituting a paradigm of efficiently organized diversity." It was, they write, "de facto a world capital, the highest representative of cultured life in America. Urban density . . . was celebrated in a so-called cult of congestion inextricably linked to the advantages and aspirations of a progressive civilization." But that relatively self-contained character changed after the war, when New York became the major focus, but not the only one, in an urban-suburban sprawl from New England to Virginia that came to be known as Megalopolis.
During the years between the end of the war and the late 1970's, there were changes that affected the whole world's view of cities. New York became the acknowledged capital of world finance, as well as the home of the United Nations. The sudden concentration of national and international business brought, especially to Manhattan, both the demands for new building and the wealth to realize it. The competition among architects to be represented in the city was intense. Interior design became an exalted profession, and both architecture and design were subjected to severe critical and popular attention. Laws governing building, landmarks preservation and zoning all changed in ways that affected the fabric of New York, sometimes benignly, sometimes not.
The city itself seemed to become a gigantic media star. It was the world capital of art, and in many ways much of the art commented on, and affected, the esthetic values of architecture and design. It was the background, the subject, the very spirit of countless plays and films that also affected the world's perception of the city and the city's view of itself. The sheer excitement and energy of the physical changes transforming New York in this era fascinated the world -- and they give this vast and important study an irresistible force.
The most valuable and satisfying parts of the book are two synthesizing introductory chapters that trace in a roughly chronological way the development of New York architecture and planning over three decades. This includes not only a treatment of buildings but an analysis of the design and maintenance of parks, streets, bridges, traffic patterns, lighting and street furniture, as well as the public transportation nexus of buses, subways, trains and airports. These long chapters, in fact, could be published separately as an instructive monograph in American urban history.
They are followed by a phalanx of chapters arranged by geography that take one through the city as though on a long, intense walking tour that wanders inside and outside an astonishing number of places. The advantage of the book's geographical organization is that it gives one a greater sense of urban design and context. A liability is that it encourages redundancy and skews chronology. For example, the explication of such historically path-breaking buildings of the 1950's as Gordon Bunshaft's Lever House and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Seagram Building, both in midtown, follow by some 150 pages the related discussion of younger downtown buildings they influenced. The historically trend-setting midtown chapter might well have been placed first.
Yet several of the best chapters are those that ignore geography and cover interior design, New York in the theater, the city and the arts, and the city in the movies. Not only are these sections filled with wonderful stories and personalities, but they give one a larger and deeper understanding of what urbanism is, and of the intellectual and emotional rewards, and costs, of city life.
They show us in words and images how urban people define themselves and recognize themselves in plays like "On the Town" and "West Side Story" or films like "Babes on Broadway" (1941), "Breakfast at Tiffany's" (1961) and "The Pawnbroker" (1965), in the art of an Abstract Expressionist like Franz Kline or in the work of the Pop Art masters of the 1960's. There is a generosity, a democratic spirit, in this kind of presentation that makes this volume important and enjoyable. Sometimes, of course, the authors get carried away in their boosterism and present methodologically flawed statistical equations. The city's museum's, they assert, "were so popular with artists and the general public that annual attendance reached 3.5 million, exceeding the combined attendance of the city's two baseball stadiums." How would attendance at museums have compared with the annual attendance at professional sporting events in all seasons of the year, beyond the baseball summer?
THE tone of this book is not wholly celebratory. The authors can be forcefully critical and sometimes melancholy, as in a strong chapter on historic preservation, something the previous volumes discussed only in passing. The demolition of the great Pennsylvania Station in 1963 is still seen as an acute tragedy today. And the authors point to other kinds of losses; there are fascinating pages on great proposals never built, like Louis Kahn's design for a Holocaust memorial in Battery Park. One of the early losses was the old Produce Exchange Building designed by George B. Post in the late 19th century that once sat splendidly across Bowling Green from the Beaux Arts exuberance of the United States Custom House. It was replaced by a monolith of unrelieved tedium, and the authors gather eloquent testimony from architects and others about it. Such losses led in 1965 to the establishment of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, a significant weapon against unbridled development.
Not all changes in zoning law were that beneficent. In 1960 and 1961, the city largely overturned the pioneering zoning ordinance of 1916 that had maximized ground density and opened the city skyward with its "setback" rules, allowing tall buildings to rise flush from the sidewalks, but then requiring floors to be reduced in area as the buildings rose above specified heights. The new regulations of 1960 practically reversed that formula, encouraging "unmodulated, independently spaced skyscraper slabs rising from generously scaled plazas . . . a city that was space positive rather than mass positive, a city which if rebuilt completely along the lines of the new code would become one with the continuous open space of the essential ruralism of Megalopolis." It also stimulated a disruption of the traditional pattern of towers rising principally along the north-south avenues, with much smaller structures filling the side streets. As the plazas spread, towers began populating the side streets too. The authors call the result a "collapse of traditional street architecture" and say with some exaggeration that the new code resulted in the loss of "the camaraderie of street and neighborhood life, so long the glue that kept the city's social fabric together."
All this change did not pass unremarked, and the public disputes that accompanied it shaped the nation's discussion of what cities ought to be. In a crucial section titled "Two Power Brokers: Robert Moses and Jane Jacobs," these two key figures are shown in battle over different visions of what constituted the commonweal. They personified, the authors say, "the struggle between New York as the grandest metropolis in the world on the one hand and as the world's biggest village on the other, between the power of the purse, whether public or private, and the power of the public will." For Moses, who for many years championed massive redevelopment, "city life was the daily grind, a fundamental fact of modern existence but basically unsympathetic to the good life." For him, "city life meant sacrifice, with the individual bending his will to the collective." His attitude was exemplified by his fondness for quoting the old proverb "You can't make an omelet without breaking eggs." Toward the end of his imperious career, the authors contend, Moses seemed "actively hostile to the city he had so long served."
For Jane Jacobs, the sensitive but tough-as-nails editor, theorist and activist, "the city was a great liberation, the ultimate freedom, an intricate web of individuals, buildings and streets, a mosaic or tapestry that somehow amounted to more than any singular vision and was absolute anathema to the idea of a grand plan. In Jacobs's view, New York, or at least the parts of it she admired, had the ingredients of a post-industrial-age utopia; it was definitely not an ordeal to be endured." In her 1961 book "The Death and Life of Great American Cities," she bluntly attacked not only Moses' notions of urban order, but those espoused by Le Corbusier. She celebrated the "ballet of the street" and "order in variety" of much of New York, as epitomized by her own neighborhood in Greenwich Village. "The pseudoscience of planning," she asserted, "seems almost neurotic in its determination to imitate empiric failure and to ignore empiric success." Her manifesto turned the planning establishment on its head. Even the influential critic Lewis Mumford, who found occasional virtues in the book, referred to it patronizingly as "Mother Jacobs' Home Remedies."
The urgent voices of other power brokers are heard throughout the book, reminding us of the passions, and the principles, brought into play. John V. Lindsay, for example, more than any other mayor before him, put architecture, planning and urban design among his top priorities, recognizing, the authors say, "that physical planning was a key issue that could unite a wide section of an electorate that was seriously divided over issues of race, ethnicity and class." During his first six months in office, he killed Robert Moses' plan for a 30th Street expressway that would have slashed across the center of Manhattan, stopped various planned intrusions into the natural preserve of Central Park and closed the park to automobiles on Sunday mornings.
He also brought expert consultants into his administration and gave them responsibility, people like the architects Jonathan Barnett, Richard Weinstein, Jaquelin Robertson and Myles Weintraub whom he appointed as founding members of the Urban Design Group, an expanding cadre of professional urbanists who helped the Mayor turn theory into action. Later he moved members of the group into key city positions -- Richard Weinstein, for example, as director of the Office of Lower Manhattan Development and Jaquelin Robertson as director of the Office of Midtown Development.
AMONG the critics discussed at length, the authors believe that no one was more important than Ada Louise Huxtable. As an independent writer about architecture and design for some years, she had argued persuasively that the treatment of architecture in newspapers and magazines was scandalously inadequate and that, as a result, citizens were deprived of both information about and a voice in the development of their cities. In 1963 she became the first full-time architecture critic for any American newspaper, and she used her wit and her knowledge in The New York Times to tremendous effect. In 1965 she received the first Pulitzer Prize ever given for criticism of any kind. Her years at The Times established the view that no major newspaper in any great city of the world could afford to be without a full-time architecture critic. This became important not only for constantly informing the citizenry, but for informing later historians whose task it is to reconstruct the past.
Beginning with lower Manhattan -- the Lower East Side, Chinatown, the Civic Center, the financial district, the World Trade Center, the Battery Park area, New York University, Greenwich Village and SoHo -- the authors give excellent introductions to each section, evoking the social and cultural history of the area as prelude to the discussion of its changing architectural character. They strike an admirable balance between attention to the grand structures of the powerful and the environments of middle- and working-class New Yorkers, including public housing.
In lower Manhattan they first introduce readers not to the financial district but to the large public housing projects. They may lament the blandness of such "elevator tenements" as the Jacob Riis Houses along the East River from 6th to 14th Streets, but they point out that in 1965 a landscape architect, M. Paul Friedberg, with private funding from the Vincent Astor Foundation, transformed the central open area amid the Riis Houses into "one of the few attractive and engaging outdoor gathering spaces in a public housing project." It contained a children's playground with sand piles and recreational equipment, a series of trellised and brick-paved sitting areas for older residents, and "a thousand-person, pergola-enclosed, sunken amphitheater." The Village Voice opined that "for once, the poor of the city have the best of it." The authors also have high praise for some of the structures surrounding Riis, like Percival Goodman's Public School 126 and, behind it, his Alfred E. Smith Recreation Center.
Among the financial center skyscrapers they cite the handsome Chase Manhattan Bank headquarters (1960) by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, across Liberty Street from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as the building most responsible for revitalizing downtown as a commercial center. Yet they have even higher praise for the same firm's 140 Broadway, directly to the west of the Chase, designed by Gordon Bunshaft and containing in its plaza Isamu Noguchi's memorable "Red Cube." Mrs. Huxtable believed it represented "one of the miracles of modern building: the skyscraper wall reduced to gossamer minimums of shining, thin material hung on a frame of extraordinary strength through superb contemporary technology."
IN a packed chapter of more than 200 pages, "New York 1960" explores midtown, with whole sections devoted to selected areas like Stuyvesant Town, Murray Hill and Chelsea, as well as to certain singular buildings, to the north-south avenues and to some of the side streets. While the authors carefully assess what they believe to be the good and the not-so-good, they seem overly cool to one of the prevailing masterworks of the area and the era: Roche & Dinkeloo's steel and concrete Ford Foundation on 42d Street (1967), connected so integrally to its glass-enclosed garden court. Other architects have criticized it, but Mrs. Huxtable thought it was one of the foundation's most charitable contributions to the arts, "a grant of some importance in a world where spirit and soul are deadened by the spectacular cheapness of the environment."
In their chapters on the Upper West Side and the Upper East Side, the authors include detailed and suggestive discussions of such institutions as Lincoln Center, Columbia University and the Guggenheim and Whitney museums, but, as throughout this book, they also examine housing projects and urban renewal sites. The breadth of their understanding and empathy is also notably apparent in their chapters on Harlem and Upper Manhattan. They give excellent whole chapters to the United Nations complex and to Central Park, including an assessment of the expansion of the Metropolitan Museum. One long chapter is devoted to the Outer Boroughs -- Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island -- where architectural development was obviously less intense than in Manhattan, but this section includes provocative assessments of La Guardia and Kennedy airports.
Mr. Stern, Mr. Mellins and Mr. Fishman say they have "sought to let the city tell its own complex story rather than to impose a contemporary perspective on it." That is somewhat disingenuous since they obviously have their biases, which ought to be noted. The most obvious is a distaste for mid-century modernism, particularly its expression in the variants on the mature International style. While they dutifully cite pros and cons from contemporary critics on buildings of this genre, they subtly stack the deck throughout the book against the late Modern movement. About Richard Meier's acclaimed Bronx Developmental Center (1977), for example, a total-care facility for 750 mentally and physically disabled children, they offer the loaded observation that it stood as "a symbol of Modernism" as well as "the butt of jokes." In Marshall Brickman's comic film "Simon" (1980), they tell us gleefully, the building is used as the fictitious Institute for Advanced Concepts, "within whose technologically perfect confines a group of brilliant scientists go mad."
The bias in the use of pictures is more subtle and pervasive: an endless repetition of calculatedly similar shots of mediocre International Style structures captured in relative isolation from people, other buildings and urban activity. As in a police lineup they stalk across the pages with a blandness more menacing even than that of Sixth Avenue north of 42d Street. Is the objective here to saturate readers with a Modernist overdose that is sufficiently toxic to make them cry for the purgative antidote of a Post-Modernist Nirvana, the world of Robert Stern's own architectural generation that will presumably decorate the pages of "New York 2000"?
This penchant is intensified with the excessively large coverage given to the work of Emery Roth & Sons, which the authors and their quoted sources usually describe as "banal" and "bland," without ever properly explaining their use of those terms. They would have performed a great service for students and lay readers by formally "deconstructing" a "banal" Roth skyscraper and comparing it specifically with a similarly explicated work of Gordon Bunshaft, like 140 Broadway, which usually earns the more flattering adjectives "extraordinary" and "superb."
There is also the old-fashioned matter of "function" and responsiveness to clients' needs. The Roths' great success was apparently based on this. Between 1950 and 1970, the firm "completed 70 New York office buildings, collectively containing in excess of 30 million square feet of space, or half of the total amount of office space created during that period." So apparently gifted was this office in making the "belly" of a building work that it was frequently engaged as the associate of fancier firms that designed the formal elements and gave the building its ultimate character. The problem, as always, lies in the mistaken perception that the two worlds cannot be integrated -- as they ultimately must be in the greatest and most successful architecture.
But those are not crippling faults. "New York 1960" should be read and pondered by all who value architecture and who understand, or wonder about, its importance in their lives. It should also be absorbed by all literate New Yorkers, actual and spiritual. Reading it will make them smarter and more loyal citizens and pilgrims. Despite its interesting flaws and its daunting length, there is very little here that should have been excluded. The authors are, by turns, optimistic and pessimistic. The writing is lucid and sprightly. Although the conclusion seems inappropriately downbeat, the book fairly crackles with energy and purpose, much like the city it examines so well.

HEADLINE: Japan Moves to Halt A Slide in the Dollar

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, March 20

 BODY:
The dollar recovered from a new postwar low set this morning, as the Bank of Japan aggressively bought dollars and sold yen, traders said.
Foreign investors were also buying dollars through banks in Singapore, pushing up offers for the currency, traders said. 
 "There's no doubt that the Bank of Japan is buying a fairly good amount of dollars," said Masahiro Yamaguchi, assistant manager for foreign exchange at Tokai Bank. The Japanese central bank does not comment on whether it is intervening in the market.
The dollar fell as low as 88.65 yen, a record. The previous record low in Tokyo was 88.75 yen, which was set on March 8. It was quoted later today at 89.20 yen, up from 89.05 yen in late New York trading on Friday, and 1.3850 German marks, down from 1.3865 marks in New York.
Traders said the dollar was likely to fall again. Hironobu Tsurugai, a trader for Citibank, said he expected the dollar to trade from 85 yen to 92 yen and from 1.36 marks to 1.41 marks this week.
That is because traders do not expect central banks around the world to take concerted action to prop up the dollar, which also fell to record lows of 1.3455 German marks and 1.1195 Swiss francs on March 8.
Traders and analyst say the dollar could rebound if the United States raises its interest rates while Germany and Japan cut theirs. No such action has been taken, however, and recent statements from central bank officials suggest that they may not act in concert.

HEADLINE: On Hustings, Paris vs. Anglo-Saxons

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, March 19

 BODY:
No matter which candidate wins this spring's French presidential elections, French foreign policy is likely to remain what it has been for three decades: proudly European and prepared to keep Anglo-Saxon influences at arm's length.
All of the three leading contenders, two conservatives claiming direct political lineage from the famously difficult de Gaulle and a Socialist hoping to inherit the mantle of President Francois Mitterrand, have been saying more or less the same things. 
 The campaign has been dominated by domestic concerns like unemployment, so foreign policy has not been an issue.
It was only Thursday that the front-runner, Mayor Jacques Chirac of Paris, a conservative, finally outlined his foreign policy platform in a speech to guests and the press. On relations with the United States, Mr. Chirac's position is not much different from that of his fellow conservative, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, or the Socialist contender, Lionel Jospin.
The first round of voting will take place on April 23, and a runoff between the two most successful contenders will decide the winner on May 7.
"It is of course in France's interest to consolidate Franco-American friendship despite the periodic, and in general superficial, frictions that we experience in our relations with our oldest ally," Mr. Chirac said.
But he warned of new frictions ahead over expanded ties with Asia and Latin America, saying, "The United States has reacted by seeking to establish renewed ties with these regions, and wishes to remain their privileged and even dominant partner."
Mr. Chirac was at his most Gaullist in his vigorous defense of French cultural and linguistic identity against the inroads of American and British English, right up there with maintaining the French nuclear deterrent force on his list of foreign policy priorities.
"In a way, our language has never been spoken by so many," Mr. Chirac said. "But at the same time, it has never been as threatened by what seems to be the irresistible rise of English, or rather of the impoverished form of it that is tending to become the language of international communication."
France under a Chirac presidency would not declare war on the English language, he promised, but it would resist the international trend to uniformity just as, under Mr. Mitterrand, it fought and won the battle to keep European -- mainly French -- movies and television programming from being overrun by Hollywood.
There is a consistency in all this, a prickly insistence on a separate European political, cultural and military identity that goes back to de Gaulle's presidency, which lasted from 1959 to 1969. And Mr. Chirac's two leading rivals share it.
Mr. Balladur told the daily Le Figaro last week, "The Americans have to accept once and for all the existence of Europe -- that is, if Europe accepts being more independent and responsible itself."
And in his election platform, Mr. Jospin said, "To preserve their identity and also their economic competitiveness, it is crucial for France and Europe not to be simply receptacles for technologies and ideas from across the Atlantic."
All three candidates say they would, like Mr. Mitterrand, insist on maintaining European television programming quotas and filmmaking subsidies to keep Hollywood from swamping movie screens and living rooms on the continent.
And all three usually get cheers from audiences when they say they will maintain the European Union's protectionist policies on agricultural production and exports, another subject long dear to French hearts and a thorn to Americans.
Given the backgrounds of the three leading candidates, continuity in foreign policy is really no surprise. Mr. Jospin served as Education Minister under Mr. Mitterrand, Mr. Balladur has been Prime Minister for the last two years and Mr. Chirac has been Prime Minister twice, from 1974 to 1976 and again from 1986 to 1988.
If Mr. Chirac becomes President, and the latest polls predict that he will win more votes than any other candidate in both rounds, he is expected to ask the current Foreign Minister, Alain Juppe, to form the next Government.
All three of them now promise to bolster European trade defenses, to be able to retaliate against trade sanctions against them by the United States, and move to a common European currency as soon as possible. Mr. Balladur has set a target of 1997; Mr. Chirac offered no date but said he wanted a genuine national debate about it in France before it happened.
Mr. Chirac, who has sounded skeptical at times in the past about closer European integration, fell in line with the consensus on Thursday. "Hardly any different from the proposals made by Edouard Balladur," the left-leaning daily Liberation commented afterward.
All three candidates say the European Union needs to streamline its decision-making as it grows to take in the new democracies in Central Europe. And all three want to make Europe a more effective actor on the world stage by strengthening its common foreign and security policies, though not at the expense of national sovereignty.
"New mechanisms allow Europeans to use NATO resources under their own command," Mr. Chirac said, alluding to the concept of combined joint task forces that the allies approved last year. The European Union's military arm, the Western European Union, could use these in peacekeeping missions.
"This development makes a new type of relationship between France and NATO possible, and even necessary," Mr. Chirac said.
He said he would not have France return to NATO's integrated military structure, which is under the command of an American general based in Stuttgart, Germany.
But, he added, "Without returning to an integrated structure, our country must take part in all the organizations of the alliance based on the respect and sovereignty of states."

HEADLINE: Call for Moves On Currencies

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: CARCASSONNE, France, March 19

 BODY:
The President of the European Commission, Jacques Santer, called today for the Group of Seven industrial powers to take joint action to stabilize world currencies.
Mr. Santer said recent monetary turbulence was largely attributable to the effects of "benign neglect" of the dollar, and urged the group to coordinate policy as it had done in the 1980's with the so-called Plaza and Louvre accords to counter currency swings. 
 "We must act on the causes of monetary turbulence, which are not so much fundamentals as the effects of benign neglect vis-a-vis the dollar," Mr. Santer said after a European Union foreign ministers' meeting in this southwestern French town.
The recent turbulence, which has upset the European monetary system, has been largely caused by the dollar's drop to postwar lows, as investors seek safety in the mark and yen.
But the United States, while saying it did not encourage the dollar's slide, has so far resisted calls for concerted action, which have come mainly from the French.

HEADLINE: Encouraging Home Businesses;
Suburbs Revise Zoning Rules for Residential Entrepreneurs

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y., March 19

 BODY:
Evelyn Simon was stunned the day a city inspector came to her door to investigate a violation of a law she had never heard of: her neighbors had filed a complaint against her for working out of her home.
"I couldn't believe it," said Ms. Simon, who was running a consulting business from home using a fax machine, a copier, personal computers and two secretaries. "It was totally absurd. I always assumed I had a right to work at home." 
 But things have only got worse in the four years since the inspection. The city fined Ms. Simon for operating a business in a residential zone. Her legal bills climbed to more than $5,000 as she fought the city in court over the case. Eventually, she moved her office elsewhere in frustration and dismay.
The peculiar experience of Ms. Simon -- who lost her case in December after an appeals court upheld the local restrictions on home occupations -- has added fuel to a debate here over whether the city's 40-year-old zoning regulations meet the demands of a modern working world driven by faxes and desktop computers. And New Rochelle City Council members are reviewing a proposal that would loosen the city's laws on working at home while still protecting the residential character of neighborhoods.
New Rochelle is not the only community looking to accommodate the legions of people who have embarked on a wide range of ventures from their dens, basements, garages and spare rooms. Planning officials in the suburbs have increasingly sought to draft new zoning rules that allow -- and sometimes even encourage -- home businesses. "Our zoning laws need to reflect the realities of the 90's," said Christina Selin, a New Rochelle City Councilwoman. "The fact is that many people no longer need to go to a centralized workplace with the advent of computers, faxes and other forms of telecommunications."
In the Hudson Valley community of Plattekill, N.Y., officials have made it easier for people to start businesses at home as a way to cope with layoffs at the nearby I.B.M. plants. Officials in the white-collar Westchester village of Scarsdale are considering a proposal that expands the number of professions permitted to operate within homes beyond the traditional list of doctors, lawyers and dentists. And in New Hanover, Pa., a suburb of Philadelphia, homeowners are now simply required to pay a registration fee to run businesses under their own roofs.
"The reality is that more people are working at home," said Marya Morris, a senior research associate with the American Planning Association in Chicago. "So communities around the country are broadening the range of businesses that they consider appropriate home occupations."
Most residential zoning rules were drafted decades ago to protect neighborhoods from heavy traffic, annoying smells and noises, billboards and other problems associated with businesses. Today, about 65 percent of communities across the country have laws that regulate home occupations, typically limiting them to doctors, dentists and other licensed professionals who are believed to provide needed services to neighborhoods.
But as more people work at home because of corporate layoffs, the high cost of commercial real estate and changes in family responsibilities, planners have come under increasing pressure to change their residential zoning codes. Many have concluded that their regulations are outdated, especially since sophisticated telecommunications equipment makes it possible for people to run all kinds of businesses from home without neighbors realizing it.
Many of Boine Johnson's neighbors probably have no idea that the ground floor of his Scarsdale home serves as the headquarters of a multimillion-dollar import business he started several years ago. What he mostly needs to run the company is a fax machine, three computers and some help from his family. He sees no clients at home and generally minds his own business.
There is only one problem: he is violating the local zoning ordinance.
He regards the law as absurd, and wonders whether the village is doing itself a disservice since many other people in Scarsdale run unobtrusive but prohibited businesses like his. "If you had a law that said you can't sleep past 6 A.M.," he said, "it would not only be ignored, but it would minimize respect for the law."
"I look at my own particular street here in Scarsdale," he added, "and 18 of the 22 houses have something going on."
Village officials are starting to see his point. In fact, they are considering changes in the zoning law that would expand the number of occupations allowed to operate from home.
"There are many professions and businesses that can operate in a home without affecting a community," said John Crary, the deputy village manager. "And they shouldn't be limited."
But in some other communities, residents have actively opposed loosening zoning restrictions, fearing this would spur a proliferation of home businesses and hurt the values of their homes. In the Westchester village of Irvington, a group of homeowners urged village officials to enact stricter zoning codes after a psychiatrist converted her garage into an office and built a circular driveway to provide parking for patients.
The new laws, adopted last year, prohibit establishing a new home office without registering with the village clerk and abiding by restrictions on the amount of floor space the business uses.
Linda Leary, a member of the group that lobbied for the new laws, said the case involving the psychiatrist caused concern that more home businesses would start turning up in the village without any regulations in place to protect neighborhoods from annoyances like heavy traffic.
"It was an issue that had been festering," said Ms. Leary, who has no quarrel with home offices that do not disturb neighborhood life. "The value of our real estate is very directly related to the quality of life in the area. And a small business could be a nuisance."
But the new restrictions have outraged many others, who say they have shaped their lives around the ability to do business from home.
Judith Lederman said she bought her home in Irvington several years ago largely because it had a front room that could be converted into an office for her public relations firm.
To Ms. Lederman, it was important to be able to work from home because she wanted to have time to raise her three children. "In the beginning, I even had a crib in the office," she said. "I learned how to nurse in front of my computer while typing with one hand."
So it is not surprising that Ms. Lederman did all she could to fight new zoning restrictions, including joining an ad hoc group of professionals opposed to such changes.
In the end, though, she relocated her office as the opposing side gained momentum. "The things they were asking for were absolutely ludicrous and would have made it impossible for me to stay in my home office," Ms. Lederman said.
But officials elsewhere in the region consider these new home businesses a valuable asset and have begun loosening restrictions. In Plattekill, planners realized many people were looking to start businesses at home after layoffs at nearby I.B.M. plants and other downturns in the economy. So last year they expanded the number of professions permitted to operate within homes.
"We're looking to encourage economic development in our community," said Judith Mayle, the Town Supervisor. "The new thinking is that these small home occupations will be a major force in the economic vitality of the area."
Raymond M. Uhrlass, a respiratory therapist at a hospital just outside the town, is one of the new entrepreneurs who took advantage of the zoning revisions. He went down to town hall one day in January and immediately obtained a permit to open a private practice in his mobile home. "I was suprised at how simple it was to get the permit," he said, adding that his business would not disturb neighbors because he plans to make house calls and use his home office only for work like billing.
He would not have been able to start a business, he said, if he had had to rent an office. "I wouldn't have been able to afford it," said Mr. Uhrlass. "I have a wife and two children to support."

HEADLINE: Republican Says Senators Put Deficit Over Tax Cut

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
The head of the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees tax legislation, said again today that his panel would have little appetite for reducing taxes until Congress had brought the Federal deficit under control.
The remarks by Senator Bob Packwood underscore the widespread presumption that any tax cut even approaching the five-year $189 billion package now in the House is a dead letter in the Senate. 
 "This feeling on the Finance Committee -- Republican and Democrat -- is that the best thing we can do for the taxpayers of this country is just try to move toward deficit reduction," Mr. Packwood, Republican of Oregon, said on the ABC News program "This Week." "And if that gets their mortgage interest rates down a point or two, that is more important than anything else we can do."
Mr. Packwood and many economists say that Federal borrowing to finance daily Government business drains so much money from the economy that it has raised everyone else's cost of borrowing the money that is left. But he and other legislators also say that they believe that average citizens prefer erasing the deficit to widening it with a tax cut.
Mr. Packwood has been saying this for a month, and other senators from both parties have echoed him. On the Finance Committee, senior Republicans like John H. Chafee of Rhode Island question the need for a tax cut. So do the ranking Democrat, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, and a host of others.
Some also criticize the smaller $63 billion tax cut over five years that President Clinton proposed in February. One Democrat on the Finance Committee, Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, attacked both plans, calling the White House proposal unfortunate and the House plan "a political document."
"I find it very difficult to believe that the Senate will support it, either Republicans or Democrats," Mr. Bradley said of the House plan on the NBC News program "Meet the Press."
Mr. Packwood and others argue that a nation with a total debt approaching $5 trillion and growing by $200 billion a year cannot afford a tax cut. To balance the budget in seven years as promised, Republicans in Congress must already reduce projected spending by at least $1.1 trillion, and any tax cut would increase that figure.
The House Republican proposal would give a $500-per-child tax credit to families earning under $200,000 a year and reduce the capital gains and alternative minimum taxes. Mr. Clinton's proposal offers a similar break to families that are generally less well off and gives cuts to those who pay college tuition or invest for retirement.
Mr. Clinton proposes some spending cuts to offset those breaks. But his budget makes no overall attempt to reach a balance and instead will average $200 billion-a-year deficits through 2000, effectively diminishing the deficit as a percentage of the growing national economy.

Colombia Becoming an Oil Power in Spite of Itself

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TAURAMENA, Colombia

 BODY:
Once defined by creeks and cow paths, the arid landscape of the Andean foothills here is now marked by helicopters, drilling rigs and the cowboy boots of American oilmen.
Foreign oil companies are drilling three miles down, tapping into a sea of low-sulfur crude oil capable of making Colombia a major oil supplier to the United States. 
 "The U.S. could import 10 percent of its oil from Colombia by the end of this decade," said Thomas G. Finck, president of the Triton Energy Corporation of Dallas, who flew here last month for the inauguration of a $300 million oil-processing operation. The tanker trip from Colombia's Caribbean oil port to refineries in Texas and Louisiana takes four days.
With production in the United States at its lowest level in four decades, the emergence of a nearby source of clean-burning oil is increasingly important for Americans. Last year, imports accounted for more than half of American oil consumption. And United States oil companies now account for 11 of the 18 largest foreign oil concerns operating in this country.
Only a decade ago, Colombia was an importer of oil. Today, it is Latin America's third-largest exporter to the United States, after Venezuela and Mexico. With most of Colombia's known oil reserves having been discovered by private companies, private investment will be essential both to maintain future exports and to explore the two-thirds of the country not yet explored for oil.
But in recent years, foreign oil companies have shied away from Colombia because of heavy taxes. The Government has therefore begun to bear more of the cost of oil exploration and development. At the same time, it is planning a series of tax breaks.
And it has attracted the largest oil investment in the country's history. The British Petroleum Exploration Company, with financial assistance from three partners -- Triton of Texas, Total of France and Ecopetrol, Colombia's state oil company -- is undertaking a $7 billion development in Cusiana and Cupiagua, two huge fields near here, about 90 miles northeast of Bogota, the capital.
The oilfields, which cover a thinly populated area the size of Connecticut, hold 2.1 billion barrels in proven oil and gas reserves. Ecopetrol announced late last month that probable and possible oil and gas reserves in the area totaled a further 3.9 billion barrels.
Helped by the oil investments, Colombia's economy is expected to grow 5 percent this year, the same rate as in the last two years. At the fields here, the largest confirmed in Colombia, oil production is expected to increase to 185,000 barrels a day by the end of this year from 90,000 barrels a day at present, and to 500,000 barrels a day by the end of 1997.
Colombia also offers other energy opportunities to Western companies. After British Petroleum announced the discovery of five trillion cubic feet of gas near the oilfields here last August, the Government began a $3 billion program to pipe gas to all urban households by 1997. The new find, equivalent to a billion barrels of oil, doubled Colombia's proven gas reserves.
Centragas, an affiliate of the Enron Corporation of Houston, is building a $217 million, 357-mile natural gas pipeline. Fluor Daniel, another United States company, is part of an international consortium that has won a $310 million contract to build a second 215-mile-long branch of a national gas-pipeline network.
Still, the high cost of doing business in Colombia dampens interest in oil exploration. According to Byron E. Grote, Latin America director for British Petroleum, the Colombian Government takes up to 90 percent of the value of each barrel pumped here by his company. The Government's revenue comes from Ecopetrol's production-sharing agreements and from corporate-income and other taxes.
The Colombian Oil Association, which represents 18 major Western companies, in a recent study of foreign investments, concluded that Colombia "is not internationally competitive to attract risk investments."
Since 1988, seismic studies conducted by private oil companies in Colombia have dropped by about two-thirds. The number of wildcat exploratory wells drilled has also dropped, to about a dozen last year from 52 in 1988.
The disillusion of many foreigners with Colombia's oil conditions became clear last July when Colombia held its first auction of exploration lots. The Mines and Energy Ministry invited 150 companies to take part. Only three companies, all of them already operating in Colombia, submitted bids. Nowadays, the republics of the former Soviet Union as well as China, Vietnam and Cuba are all open to foreign oil exploration.
Colombia's President, Ernesto Samper Pizano, seems to be listening to the oil companies' complaints. He plans to submit to the nation's Congress a bill that would exempt new oil operations from a so-called war tax of $1 a barrel on production. The tax, enacted in 1992, helps pay for the army's defense of oil operations -- favorite targets of Colombia's leftist rural guerrillas, who demand nationalization of the oil industry and more spending for social programs in areas where oil is produced.
Last month, the Government announced that Ecopetrol would also pay more of the exploration costs incurred by its private partners. Ismael Enrique Arenas, an Ecopetrol vice president, said foreign companies are now negotiating for about 10 exploration and production lots.
The test of the new operating environment will come this summer, when Ecopetrol is to hold Colombia's second international auction of exploration lots.
Oil executives who visited the remote processing facility here were divided about the effects of the new measures.
"It is definitely a move in the right direction," said Steven Sparks, general manager of the Colombian subsidiary of Helmerich & Payne, an Oklahoma drilling company.
But the president of a major Western oil company operating here was cautious, saying: "The Government wants the oil money for social development. The war tax is being eliminated, but a new finance minister could come along with something new."

HEADLINE: Phone Bill Brings Out Big-Name Lobbyists

SERIES: Special Pleaders: A period look at lobbying.

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
Howard H. Baker Jr. has been many things over the years, from Senate Republican leader and Presidential candidate to a trusted adviser to President Ronald Reagan. But now the former Tennessee lawmaker is a hired gun -- and this is the week he must prove his worth.
His client: a coalition of long-distance telephone carriers, dominated by AT&T, MCI and Sprint. His mandate: to persuade his former Republican colleagues in Congress to keep the so-called Baby Bell companies out of the long-distance market for at least a few more years. 
 "My role is to craft a strategy and to move the markers of the debate," Mr. Baker said last week, clearly irked by the idea of pleading with politicians who once jumped to do his bidding.
Call him what you want -- statesman, strategist or influence peddler -- Mr. Baker has lots of company. Marlin Fitzwater, chief White House spokesman for President Bush, joins the long-distance team today. Roy M. Neel, a top aide to Vice President Al Gore for 17 years and President Clinton's deputy chief of staff in 1993, is now the top lobbyist for an association of local telephone companies.
And that doesn't even begin to exhaust the "A" list of political movers and shakers hired to influence the debate over rewriting the nation's telecommunications laws. Cable companies, broadcasters, newspapers -- every segment of industry with a stake in a sweeping bill now before Congress -- are fielding an army of high-powered lobbyists.
But is anybody listening? Having wrestled with telecommunications policy for years, key lawmakers are beginning to tune out the noise as never before. Increasingly, they are simply telling the lobbyists to let them get about their business.
"Members of Congress don't think there are any good guys or bad guys in this," said Mr. Neel, who left the White House last year to become president of the United States Telephone Association. "This is not about right or wrong -- it's ultimately about money."
Nonetheless, the big lobbying guns are still being brandished because no side feels it can afford to disarm. With so much at stake, and so little to pin on labels of "right" and "wrong," the various factions are seeking a personal edge by throwing into the fray as many people with friends in high places as possible. All of which has made telecommunications as much of a bonanza for lobbyists this year as health care was last year.
"Everybody in this town who has a pulse has been hired by either the long-distance coalition or the Bell operating companies," said Representative Michael G. Oxley, an Ohio Republican on the Commerce Committee. "It's just amazing."
The battle will be joined this time around on Thursday, when the Senate Finance Committee plans to vote on whether to send the bill to the floor. Broadly, the bill is intended to let local telephone companies, long-distance carriers and cable television providers enter each other's markets. If it passes, it could reshape virtually every corner of the industry by setting off a free-for-all for control of the so-called information superhighway.
After years of stalled debate, Congress came close to passing a similar bill last year. The measure passed the House but died in the Senate, partly because of last-minute opposition from the Bell companies. This year, there is broad support for legislation and many of the disputes have narrowed. Even so, the bill's chances are uncertain.
Senate Republicans and Democrats came close to working out an agreement late Friday on some of the most contentious issues. The chairman of the Commerce Committee, Larry Pressler, Republican of South Dakota, proposed a compromise in which he dropped a provision that would have automatically allowed the Bell companies to enter the long-distance business after three years.
Long-distance carriers immediately rejoiced at the retreat, but the move infuriated the Bell companies and did not immediately win over key Democrats. Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, for example, refused to endorse the plan.
As in years past, all sides proclaim support for the principle of open competition, while each jealously guards its turf. Many lawmakers say they are exasperated by the bickering among the factions they have heard for so long, and their eyes glaze over at the full-page advertisements and breathlessly promoted market studies by industry-financed research groups like Citizens for a Sound Economy and the American Enterprise Institute.
"We've heard these arguments for years now," Senator Pressler said.
The Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, put the matter even more bluntly earlier this month in a speech to executives from every industry faction. "You better work this out quickly," he said, "because if you don't, then we're going to do it ourselves and you're not going to like what we do."
But this is Washington, where conflict is the coin of the realm. The communications industry contributed more than $13 million to Congressional campaigns in 1993 and 1994, according to the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington. Local telephone companies contributed $3.1 million, while the long-distance carriers tossed in $1.7 million.
Within weeks after the election last November, Senator Pressler held several fund-raisers here in which communications industry lobbyists contributed $24,500 for the privilege of saying hello.
Some in the industry see themselves locked in an arms race, forced to match rival business groups dollar for dollar.
"It's a hoot, an absolute hoot," Mr. Neel said. "I've heard of consultants who were hired just so they wouldn't be hired by the other side." Of course, Mr. Neel did not get his job by answering an ad in the newspaper, either.
Indeed, it is hard keeping track of all the rival agendas. The Bell companies, hemmed in by the antitrust decree that broke up the Bell system in 1984, want permission to offer long-distance and cable television service and to manufacture equipment. The long-distance carriers want to keep them out of long-distance, at least until the Bells give up their monopolies on local service. Cable television companies want to compete in local telephone service, if possible before the Bell companies are allowed into cable television. The cable companies are also pushing to end rate regulation, and have support from Senate Republicans.
Even traditional television broadcasters have an agenda. They want to relax restrictions on the number of stations a company can own. They also want the freedom to use new channels reserved for high-definition television to offer everything from wireless messaging services to pay-per-view movies.
The Republican sweep over Congress has forced many combatants to rethink their strategy. Long-distance carriers like AT&T knew they were on thinner ice, because Republicans have been much more hostile toward regulation and more supportive about freeing the Bell companies to enter long-distance services and manufacturing.
Mr. Baker, a senior partner in the law firm of Baker & Donaldson, may or may not prove to be the answer. But his credibility among senior Republicans, particularly in the Senate, is unmatched.
On New Year's Eve, Mr. Baker, Senator Dole and otherswere the hosts of a party at the Seaview beachside resort near Miami where they both own condominiums. One of Mr. Baker's personal guests was none other than Senator Pressler.
Some political operatives say Mr. Baker leaves most of the work to his subordinates. He says he wants nothing to do with corralling legislators in hallways. "I told them before they hired me that they already had plenty of lobbyists," said Mr. Baker, positioning himself as more of a senior adviser.
Others in the fray include William Diefenderfer, President Bush's deputy budget director, and the WEFA Group, a leading economic consulting firm in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., for the Bell companies; Ray Marshall, Secretary of Labor under President Jimmy Carter, for AT[T] Richard E. Wiley, former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, for CBS and the Newspaper Association of America; and Thomas H. Boggs, a legendary all-purpose lobbyist, also for the newspaper group.
What happens if Congress actually passes a bill this year? The most famous and well connected of the hired guns will probably always find new clients and causes. But more than a few mid-level soldiers are quietly nervous.
"Let's face it," an operative for one of the Bell companies said. "This is the big crusade. After this, there's not going to be much opportunity for a lot of us."

HEADLINE: Mr. Kasich's Numbers

 BODY:
The House Budget Committee has released a five-year plan to cut discretionary spending by $100 billion. Or, depending on who does the counting, $177 billion or perhaps $315 billion. The blizzard of numbers confuses debate. But no matter how the G.O.P. decides to count, its budget looks punishing and arbitrary.
The only reasonable sign to emerge from Congress last week was a mild outbreak of party disunity. Faced with the prospect of stiff, sometimes cruel, budget cuts, some moderate Republicans in the House and Senate are beginning to inch away from their commitment to large tax cuts. Senators Pete Domenici, John Chafee and Judd Gregg may not have seemed like paragons of moderation in the past. But they are positioning themselves between the House and fiscal folly. 
 John Kasich, chairman of the House Budget Committee, proposes to cut discretionary spending -- everything from the F.B.I. to defense, but not Social Security or other entitlements -- over five years by $100 billion below actual 1995 levels. But the shortfall would be larger, $180 billion, if Mr. Kasich's budget is measured against amounts that Congress currently intends to spend over the next five years. By the one measure that matters -- spending under Mr. Kasich's budget compared with spending that would be required, after taking account of inflation, to keep Government services whole -- the shortfall would be a whopping $315 billion. In focusing upon the smallest number, Mr. Kasich may have become the only politician in Washington who is prepared to cut more than he is willing to admit.
In the year 2000, Mr. Kasich would have the Government spend $530 billion on discretionary programs, rather than the $630 billion it would take to keep current programs in place -- a huge 20 percent cut. How hard will it be for Congress to find those cuts? Apparently, very hard.
Separately, the House passed last week a $17 billion package of mid-year spending cuts, known as rescissions. Most of the reductions picked on familiar G.O.P. targets such as summer jobs for disadvantage youths and nutrition programs for pregnant women. In one of the few places where Republicans were asked to show courage by taking on a powerful constituency, they backed away from taking a small amount of money from the overbuilt and largely wasteful system of veterans' hospitals.
The battle over rescissions gave moderate Republicans second thoughts about the $200 billion in tax cuts approved by the House tax committee. If passed, these tax cuts will absorb almost all of Mr. Kasich's spending cuts plus $60 billion that the G.O.P. hopes to knock out of welfare programs. The Congressional Republicans would then have to come up with a trillion dollars worth of cuts to fulfill another provision of the Contract With America: balancing the budget within seven years. That would force them to go after Social Security, Medicare and other targets that make the veterans look like pushovers.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Magazines Find Green Pastures Abroad

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY 

 BODY:
Forget about the weak dollar, said George J. Green, who shrugs it off as a minor irritant: These are great times for starting magazines overseas.
Mr. Green, who has been president of Hearst Magazines International since the group was founded in 1989, is looking 5 to 10 years down the road with the goal of developing a large international media operation within Hearst. This year alone he plans to add 8 to 10 new foreign-language magazines, a high number of start-ups for any company. 
 "Europe is coming out of a recession and Asia is strong," he said. "Eastern Europe has potential. We have been successful in Brazil, and Argentina looks good. And now we know how to do business in Russia."
Hearst, with 64 foreign-language editions of eight magazines, is the most aggressive player internationally, but companies like the Reader's Digest Association, Conde Nast Publications and Playboy Enterprises are also active. They, too, view the falling dollar as a temporary fluctuation that has far less importance to their foreign operations than the national economies of the countries in which they publish.
"A weak dollar does not have any great effect either positive or negative on our foreign operations," said Jonathan Newhouse, chairman of Conde Nast International, which publishes 31 magazines through wholly owned companies in five European countries and Australia.
Among the magazines Hearst publishes abroad are Cosmopolitan, Esquire, Good Housekeeping and Popular Mechanics. The magazines, published in 14 languages, are distributed in more than 80 countries. A separate company, the National Magazine Company, publishes nine Hearst magazines in Britain.
Most of the articles are generated by local editorial staffs. The magazines also include translations of articles that have appeared in their original American editions. Some of the magazines operate under licensing agreements in which Hearst allows other publishing companies to use its titles in exchange for royalties, while others are a result of 40 joint venture agreements that allow Hearst to share revenues with foreign publishers.
The runaway success story for Hearst thus far is the start-up a year ago of Cosmopolitan in Russia, where the magazine has been consistently selling out and has been profitable since the first issue.
In 1995 Mr. Green plans to introduce Esquire and Cosmopolitan in Thailand and India, Cosmopolitan in Argentina, and Good Housekeeping and Harper's Bazaar in Russia. He said there might also be two start-ups in Korea, which he declined to identify, and a possible Turkish edition of Popular Mechanics.
American publishers estimate that it costs $5 million to $20 million to start a magazine in the United States. Since Hearst is a privately owned company that does not reveal its finances, Mr. Green declined to disclose the cost of a typical foreign start-up, but he made it clear that it was far below the amount needed to start a magazine in the United States. Since most of its magazines overseas are sold on newsstands, Hearst does not have to spend a lot of money acquiring subscriptions.
In addition, advertising is generally easy to attract from global advertisers like Chanel and Estee Lauder that already have established relationships with other Hearst magazines around the world.
One of the largest American publishers overseas is the Reader's Digest Association. With the start-up of the Polish edition of Reader's Digest in May, the company will have 47 international editions in 18 languages, with a total circulation of 13 million. Nearly all of Reader's Digest's magazines are operated through wholly owned foreign subsidiaries.
"Our plan is to continue launching new editions at the rate of one a year for the next several years," said Craig Lauder, a spokesman for Reader's Digest. "The focus is now going to be toward the Pacific Rim and Latin America."
Mr. Newhouse of Conde Nast said his company had no immediate plans to enter new markets in Europe but was looking to expand in Asia. "I think we are looking very closely at China, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan," he said.
Mr. Newhouse said that 1994 was a good year for the company and that 1995 would be stronger than the last several years. "Advertising is up in every country, business is strong and magazines are up in advertising and circulation," he said.
Playboy, with 16 foreign-language editions, is in the midst of pruning some overseas editions that it says have not lived up to the company's standards. Playboy recently dropped its Hong Kong and Hungarian editions, but there are plans to begin publishing Playboy in Russia as part of a joint venture with Independent Media, a Dutch company that also publishes Cosmopolitan in Russia.
Henry W. Marks, director of international publishing for Playboy Enterprises, predicted that leading publishers of magazines and catalogues would increase their licensing operations around the world.
"There is more and more activity for more and more people," he said. "Everybody has discovered that the markets abroad are worthwhile going after."

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
When Fluidity Replaces Maturity

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI 

 BODY:
In Washington, in academia, in the writing of biographies and fiction, several R-words have gained a new ascendancy. The words are "reinvent," "revise," "redefine," "reposition." "rehabilitate" and "redeem."
Shortly after his election, President Clinton put Vice President Al Gore in charge of "reinventing government"; then, after the Republican victory last year he refocused on reinventing himself. He summoned three self-help gurus (Stephen R. Covey, Marianne Williamson and Anthony Robbins) to Camp David last December, while his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, embarked on yet another image make-over with the help of Ann Landers and Cindy Adams. 
 The Clintons are hardly alone in their efforts to shuck off the past and redefine (or rehabilitate) their public images. Marion S. Barry Jr. and Oliver L. North have done their best to disprove F. Scott Fitzgerald's lament that "there are no second acts in American lives," while Gov. Pete Wilson of California was recently tagged by the columnist Anthony Lewis in The New York Times as a "political Zelig" for his repeated repositioning of himself on social issues.
In fact, for many people -- from Jerry Rubin, former Yippie turned entrepreneur, to Jane Fonda, former radical turned mogul's wife -- shape-shifting and metamorphosis seem to have replaced the conventional process of maturation. This same taste for chameleonlike transformation can be found in a host of recent novels, short stories and plays: works of fiction that have subverted the traditional idea of a Bildungsroman, turning it from a naturalistic coming-of-age story into something more hallucinatory and mythic.
The heroes of Stephen Wright's "Going Native" and Russell Banks's forthcoming novel "Rule of the Bone" hit the road, change their names and slip on new identities with the ease of actors changing costumes. Cut off from the past and any sort of familial definition, the characters in Sam Shepard's plays similarly spend their lives trying to manufacture new identities; in some cases, they actually undergo bizarre metamorphoses onstage, in effect becoming fantasy versions of themselves. The hero and heroine in Will Self's novellas "Cock & Bull" hopscotch back and forth across sex lines with Ovidian ease, while the very notion of a discrete personality has become obsolete in Douglas Cooper's novel "Amnesia."
Post-modernist notions of personality have also begun to affect the writing of biographies. More and more studies of artists contend that our views of their lives and works are merely functions of our own prejudices and preoccupations. In "The Mozart Myths," William Stafford examines the wildly disparate portraits of the composer that have come down to us over the years, some depicting him as a perpetual child inept at daily life, others depicting him as a manipulative Don Juan. He contends that successive generations of scholars have reinvented Mozart in their own image, filtering his life through shifting theories of genius and creativity. Gary Taylor makes a similar argument about Shakespeare in "Reinventing Shakespeare," and A. Richard Turner does the same for Leonardo da Vinci in "Inventing Leonardo."
So pervasive has this mutable sense of identity become that the psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton has coined a name for it: "the protean self." In his recent book of the same name, he writes: "We are becoming fluid and many-sided. Without quite realizing it, we have been evolving a sense of self appropriate to the restlessness and flux of our time. This mode of being differs radically from that of the past and enables us to engage in continuous exploration and personal experiment."
Just why has this notion of a protean self taken hold in society today? In Mr. Lifton's view, it is a response to three historical forces: dislocation brought about by "the breakdown of social and institutional arrangements that ordinarily anchor human lives"; "the mass media revolution," which has given people "omni-access" to events around the world, and the prospect of human extinction (through nuclear war or environmental disaster), which he says "casts doubt in each mind about the self's larger connectedness."
Certainly signs of the flux and restlessness Mr. Lifton describes can be found everywhere one looks. On a superficial cultural level, we are surrounded by images of shape-shifting and reinvention, from sci-fi creatures who "morph" from form to form, to children's toys that metamorphose from people into robots; from Madonna's ever expanding gallery of ready-to-wear personas to New Age mystics who claim they can "channel" other people or remember "previous" lives.
On the global scale, the rapid spread of communications has erased ancient cultural boundaries and eaten away at traditional values, while wars, social upheavals and economic shifts have created waves of refugees and expatriates cut off from their roots. It's a situation vividly delineated by novels like Bharati Mukherjee's "Jasmine" and Salman Rushdie's "Satanic Verses," novels that not only feature characters addicted to change but also depict a world in extremis, a world of shortening attention spans and radical discontinuity, a world in which memory -- the ability to connect the past to the present -- has little if any hold.
There are other reasons, too, for the current predilection for protean change. Post-modernism and deconstruction have given us a fragmented view of the world, teaching us to doubt the very existence of a stable, objective truth; and this emphasis on appearances and perception has been reinforced by all the spin-doctors and marketing consultants who have helped politicians embrace image over idealism, strategy over ideology.
Equally important is the so-called recovery movement, which, as Wendy Kaminer points out in her wittily acute book, "I'm Dysfunctional, You're Dysfunctional," has perpetuated the notion that people can make the requisite journey from trauma to transcendence by confronting their inner demons through confession and public absolution. This movement, fostered by continual talk shows featuring survivors of dysfunction sharing and caring on camera, has not only encouraged people to think of all problems as responsive to easy 12-step solutions but has also galvanized a faith in limitless self-growth, a belief that sins and mistakes are but pit stops on the road to redemption.
As David Maraniss's new biography "First in His Class" attests, President Clinton has long evinced a faith in just this sort of thinking. Mr. Maraniss reports that the young Mr. Clinton, having just lost the Arkansas Governor's seat after one term in office, decided to announce for re-election by running a 30-second commercial in which he spoke of his earlier failings, arguing he would never make the same mistakes again if voters would only give him another chance. He later used a similar strategy of asking for public empathy when confronted with allegations of marital infidelity.
For Mr. Clinton, character "is a journey, not a destination," as he once told the reporter Joe Klein, and this dimly existential view of character as a "lifelong process" oddly echoes Fitzgerald's description, in "The Great Gatsby," of the hero's personality as "an unbroken series of successful gestures."
Like the Comeback Kid and Horatio Alger, Gatsby (a poor boy with romantic dreams who succeeded in inventing "just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a 17-year-old boy would be likely to invent") is a quintessentially American type. This country, after all, was supposed to be a place of new beginnings, a place where class and ancestry and history weren't supposed to matter. Here, people were supposed to be able to spring, like Gatsby, from their "Platonic conception" of themselves; here on the frontier, they were supposed to be able to move on, move up, move ahead.
In "The Protean Self," Mr. Lifton celebrates this sense "that we need never stand still, and that transformation may be just around the corner." As he sees it, proteanism is, all and all, a positive thing, enabling troubled individuals to transcend their pasts, and pressing everyone toward a "human commonality, as opposed to the fixed and absolute moral and psychological divisions favored by fundamentalism."
Mr. Lifton, however, seriously plays down the perils of proteanism -- namely, rootlessness, fragmentation and spinelessness -- and he completely ignores its encouragement of irresponsibility, hypocrisy and perpetual adolescence.
In a recent column, Meg Greenfield argues that Bill and Hillary Clinton "make a real mistake" in thinking "that personal reinvention is an option for those in office." "For one thing," she writes, "it has the opposite of a reassuring effect. It troubles people because it conveys an impression of unsureness and personal wobble and self-concern that is the last thing they want in a leader."
The notion of multiple lives (as in Carol Anshaw's novel "Aquamarine," which gives its heroine three very different sorts of lives) or multiple chances (as in the movie "Groundhog Day," which gives Bill Murray repeated chances to clean up his act) is amusing enough in fiction, but it represents a false option in real life. To believe that one need never really commit to a set of values or beliefs is ultimately to deny accountability, just as to believe that one can continually assume new identities is to end up having no identity at all.

HEADLINE: Eugenio Perente-Ramos Is Dead; Farm Labor Organizer Was 59

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
Eugenio Perente-Ramos, an organizer of migrant and seasonal laborers who founded the Eastern Farm Workers Association on Long Island and was a close associate of Cesar Chavez in the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee, died at his home in Brooklyn on Saturday. He was 59.
The cause was congestive heart failure, said Dan Fiske, a friend and fellow organizer. 
 In 37 years as an organizer, Mr. Perente-Ramos signed up machinists, miners and aerospace workers from New York to Texas and California. But his principal efforts were on behalf of those lowest on the economic ladder and hardest to organize: migrant and seasonal farm workers, domestic help and temporary and part-time workers unprotected by minimum-wage and other Federal labor laws.
Born in 1935 on a rented farm near Butte, Mont., the son of a domestic worker and a man active in the Industrial Workers of the World, Mr. Perente-Ramos trained as a machinist but went to work for the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee in the 1950's. Later, he helped organize 50,000 machinists and other workers at Boeing, Lockheed and other aerospace companies.
In the 1960's, when his group merged with Mr. Chavez's National Farm Workers Association, he became a member of the general executive board of the United Farm Workers under Mr. Chavez and helped organize farm workers in California and Texas. He also was chairman of the Chavez-for-Governor Committee in California.
In the early 1970's, Mr. Perente-Ramos founded the Eastern Farm Workers Association and led 800 migrant and seasonal workers in a strike against potato processers in Suffolk County. It was the first successful drive -- after many failures -- to organize farm workers east of the Mississippi, Mr. Fiske said. The group now represents 10,000 workers on Long Island, he said.
Mr. Perente-Ramos, who left no survivors, lectured often on labor organizing and was the author of "The Essential Organizer," a 1973 book detailing his theory of systemic organization, in which permanent cadres of volunteers, and not leaders with short-lived charisma, are relied upon to conduct boycotts and other long-term activities on behalf of labor.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 21, 1995, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An obituary of Eugenio Perente-Ramos yesterday gave an incomplete and partly inaccurate account of his activities and life. The article noted that he was an organizer of migrant and seasonal labor, but information from his associates omitted the fact that he was also the leader of a group that has been characterized as a cult. A corrected version, with fuller accounts by cult experts, parents of followers and a former wife of Mr. Perente-Ramos, appears today on page D20.

HEADLINE: Buying Excellence: How N.Y.U. Rebuilt Itself -- A special report.;
A Decade and $1 Billion Put N.Y.U. With the Elite

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
Ten years ago, New York University was what college-bound students from New York regarded as a safety school, fourth or fifth on their application lists. If you didn't get into Cornell or Brandeis or Brown University, you could always commute to N.Y.U.
But the administration, doing some long-range planning, decided that being the safety school was not good enough. So in 1984, it began a brash campaign aimed at moving the school into the nation's top tier of universities. And according to academics around the country who have looked on with envy, the strategy worked. 
 In what was a remarkable fund drive at the time, the university set out to raise $1 billion. But unlike most institutions, which plow such sums into their endowments and then live off the interest, N.Y.U. spent nearly all of it to rebuild the university.
It lured scholars from Princeton and Harvard and Stanford and Chicago. It created a top neural science center. It opened a new performing arts school, an institute of mathematics, an Italian studies center.
It raised the average Scholastic Assessment Test score of entering students from about 1100 five years ago to over 1200, making it one of the more selective schools in the country. It built new dormitories to attract students nationwide: 10 years ago, 18 percent were from outside New York City; today, 73 percent are. And it has increasingly become the first choice of students who apply.
"They have simply made enormous progress in the last decade," said Harold T. Shapiro, the president of Princeton University, who served as chairman of the evaluating team for N.Y.U.'s reaccreditation last year. "In several areas, they're every bit as good as the best."
Joel Conarroe, president of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, which evaluates faculty at colleges nationwide for its prestigious fellowships, said, "N.Y.U. has recently become a great university, and if it continues to develop at this pace, it may well gain admittance early in the next century to that small, charmed circle of exceptionally distinguished institutions."
The story of how the university came to inspire wealthy benefactors to help upgrade it into what is now very nearly the Greenwich Village equivalent of Columbia uptown, commanding tuition, fees and room and board of $26,800 and attracting students of nearly equal caliber, involves alumni like Laurence A. Tisch, the head of CBS, who fanned out across the city in the last decade to woo rich friends and acquaintances for investment in the transformation.
It involves administrators like John Brademas, the former N.Y.U. president who used the money to convert a collection of blighted and crumbling buildings into a modern urban campus and who tried every wile imaginable to attract faculty and students of the first rank. And it involves the resurgence of the city itself, and of the Village in particular.
N.Y.U.'s professional schools of law, medicine and business have long been highly regarded, but today the university's unquestioned strengths include the Tisch School of the Arts, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, the Center for French Civilization and Culture, the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, the Africana Studies Program, the Center for Neural Science and the Institute of Fine Arts, located off campus on East 78th Street.
"We have changed from a commuter school whose entrance requirements were in the medium range into a national university whose students come from all over the country and the world," said L. Jay Oliva, a professor of Russian history who became president of N.Y.U. in 1991.
 
Setting the Goals
A Billion Dollars In One Decade
 N.Y.U.'s $1 billion drive was supposed to take 15 years. It took 10.
When undertaken back in 1984, it was a daring move. Not until 1992 did Stanford became the first university to complete a billion-dollar fund-raising drive. Harvard is now seeking $2 billion, and both Yale and Cornell are soon to complete five-year billion-dollar drives.
"A few years before, a major campaign at Yale had come close to failing," said Robert Ashton, vice president for development at the New School for Social Research in Greenwich Village. "And N.Y.U. didn't have a long history of alumni participation."
The university, like the city itself, had survived perilous financial trouble in the mid-70's. It was losing students to the expanding City University system, which still did not charge tuition. Things had become so bad, N.Y.U. had to sell off a decrepit Bronx satellite campus to the state just to meet payroll in the spring of 1973. Four years later, the university again staved off financial trouble by selling, for $115 million, a macaroni company, Mueller, which it had acquired in the late 1940's.
Still, N.Y.U.'s future was precarious. Founded in 1831 as a private university for immigrants and the children of immigrants living in the New York metropolitan area, it was known as reliable but uninspired. The crumbling campus and paucity of dormitories doomed any effort to recruit students nationally.
By 1984, it became clear that the university had to do something big.
"We were mediocre," said President Oliva. "You can do well in this world if you're absolutely the best or if you're the best bargain, but not if you're somewhere in the middle. We were in a position where we had to grow or die."
Then chancellor, he and John Brademas, N.Y.U.'s president from 1980 to 1991, and Mr. Tisch, since 1978 chairman of N.Y.U.'s board of trustees, chose to go all out.
Mr. Tisch and his fellow trustees, many of whom had attended N.Y.U. as night-school students and could not afford an Ivy League education, were proud of their humble beginnings and pleased to show off their accomplishments. "By elevating N.Y.U.," Mr. Tisch, a 1942 graduate, said with a chuckle, "we made our degrees worth more."
But they also had a larger vision. Many of the trustees -- men like William R. Salomon, founder of Salomon Brothers Inc.; Walter V. Shipley, chairman of Chemical Bank, and Lewis T. Preston, former chairman of the J. P. Morgan Company -- were financiers with large stakes in the city. They understood the financial plight of New York well and were eager to do something about it.
"Although our main purpose was to help N.Y.U.," said Mr. Tisch, "We are citizens of New York. N.Y.U. is a real anchor for this city. If you include the medical center, it's one of the largest employers in town. We wanted to help both the university and the city."
 
Raising the Money
Major Gifts Up the Ante
 The university's chief fund-raiser, Naomi B. Levine, took a pragmatic look at the membership of the board and saw dollars.
"I knew, for example, that Mr. Tisch and Leonard Stern, the owner of the Hartz Group, would soon make major gifts," Mrs. Levine said. "We also had on the board George Heyman of Lehman Brothers, who is one of the best fund-raisers in the city, and philanthropists like Lew Rudin of Rudin Management; Alan Greenberg, the chairman of Bear, Stearns, and Morris Bergreen of the Skirball Foundation."
"You look at a group of trustees of that quality," Mrs. Levine said, "and you say to yourself no university has a better group and none has a more effective chairman than Larry Tisch."
The fund-raisers capitalized on the facts that Mr. Tisch almost never turned down a proposed meeting with a potential contributor and that as New Yorkers, they were never more than a cab ride away from the headquarters of most major foundations.
"The best way to raise money is not by having the best brochures, charts, fund-raising thermometers and so forth," said Mr. Oliva, "but to keep constantly on the road. Shoe leather!"
Despite such enthusiasm, the billion-dollar goal often seemed daunting. "We had to raise $2 million a week for 500 weeks," said President Oliva.
In 1988, the Tisch family made a $30 million donation. The same year, Leonard Stern contributed $30 million, and fund raising topped $90 million that year, for a total of $366 million. In 1989, contributions soared to $123 million, a record. The annual total slid down with the general economy over the next few years, but never fell below $100 million.
In 1991 came an odd bequest, the $25 million legacy of the actress Paulette Goddard. After all, she was a high school dropout from Great Neck, L.I., not an alumna, and lived most of her life in Hollywood and Switzerland. But behind the scenes were her dentist, Dr. Maurice Saklad, another N.Y.U. board member, and N.Y.U.'s president, Mr. Brademas, who speaks warmly of the "good chemistry" he had with Ms. Goddard.
Last year, N.Y.U. raised $116.5 million, and with that, the $1 billion mark was reached without even counting what may be the largest single gift ever given to an American university -- the late Sir Harold Acton's estate in Florence, La Pietra, valued at between $300 million and $500 million. N.Y.U. officials are not counting it yet because Sir Harold's will is still in probate.
Last week, the university celebrated reaching its goal with a black-tie affair at the Bobst Library on Washington Square. But of course, there were a few disappointments along the way.
"Our corporate contributions were not as strong as they should be," Mrs. Levine said. "The only overseas country that's been helpful has been Japan. We should have done much better in Germany and Italy," she said, given the Italian Studies Department and the Deutches Haus on Washington Mews, a center for the study of German culture.
As Mr. Oliva sees it, there can be no letup. "When you raise this kind of money, you also raise the level of your expectations," he said. "That means continuing to raise $100 million a year. It's like what John Wooden said when he was coach of the U.C.L.A. basketball team. He said, 'A team doesn't stay the same. It either gets better or it gets worse.' I intend to get better."
 
Spending It All
Fat Wallet Buys Dorms and Deans
 If fund raising was often a struggle, spending was a cinch. The largest share of the billion raised -- about $600 million -- was used to complete the expansion and renovation of the Washington Square campus.
Among the 22 buildings erected, bought or renovated were the $35 million Tisch School of the Arts, which opened in 1985, and the Department of Chemistry, which underwent a $15 million renovation between 1987 and 1989.
Equally important for an urban university like N.Y.U. were the 11 dormitories built or renovated. These included the $14 million Goddard Hall at 86 Washington Square East and the $49 million Carlyle Court complex on Union Square that was bought and renovated between 1987 and 1989.
Some students who came to live in these quarters were attracted by generous offers of financial aid, totaling $109 million. Others were lured by the new sense of urgency and growth that emanated from the university.
The infusion of money also made possible the energetic, decade-long recruitment of a stellar faculty to fill 88 new chairs. The hunt and capture was supervised by Duncan Rice, a Scotsman who was himself recruited in 1985 from Hamilton College, in upstate Clinton, by President Oliva. He is now vice chancellor.
N.Y.U. had the advantage of flexibility. Unlike many public colleges and universities where salaries are tied to rank, there was nothing to stop Mr. Rice and his colleagues from luring an associate professor, for instance, with a higher salary than that received by a full professor in the same department. Not all the new hires have been welcomed with open arms. Andrew Ross, who was drawn from Princeton in 1993 to head N.Y.U.'s American Studies Program, has faced criticism for his focus on such matters as gay and lesbian studies.
Mr. Rice, as dean of the faculty of arts and science, began to think systematically about recruitment, he said, soon after his arrival in 1985. That year, he learned that Anthony Movshon, a leading N.Y.U. specialist in neuroscience, was about to accept an offer from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
"It made me wonder about what we could do to persuade him to stay, and, if we succeeded, how we might use Movshon to attract other outstanding people in his field," Mr. Rice said. "I knew that neuroscience was one of the most rapidly expanding fields in the biomedical sciences -- people were talking about this being the Decade of the Brain -- and it seemed like an opportunity to create a center of strength."
Eventually, Mr. Rice persuaded Professor Movshon to stay by creating the Center for Neural Science, which gave him the unusual opportunity to hire 10 professors and develop what is now an internationally known center for the experimental and theoretical study of the human brain.
Other professors were lured by the promise of rejuvenating a troubled department. By the early 1990's, N.Y.U.'s department of political science had become a victim of internal strife, its staff pared as 6 of 27 faculty members quit. But the resignations meant that a new chairman would have the opportunity to reshape a department.
Russell Hardin, a leading expert on the role of morality in politics, was lured from the University of Chicago for the job. In the last year and a half, he has hired two faculty members from Stanford, one from Harvard, one from Princeton and one from the University of Chicago.
In another instance, a university asset proved to be the lure. John Freccero, a leading Dante scholar, gave up a post at Stanford three years ago to move to N.Y.U. because of its Casa Italia. The landmark brownstone on West 12th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues is where the seven faculty members have their offices and conduct classes.
"Everybody acknowledges the importance of Italian culture in the Renaissance and so forth," said Professor Freccero, "but very few universities have a commitment to it to match N.Y.U.'s."
It also helped that Professor Freccero was baptized at Our Lady of Pompeii Roman Catholic Church on Carmine Street, and had warm memories of growing up in Greenwich Village. "New York City," he said, "was a big attraction for me."
As it is for so many others, says George E. Rupp, president of Columbia University. He says the city deserves some of the credit. "I am delighted with N.Y.U.'s progress," he said. "It reflects the resurgence of interest in New York City that we are all seeing, as more and more of the best students and faculty come here."
Said David Levitsky, 18, a film major at N.Y.U. from East Northport, L.I., "Many of my friends went to colleges with lawns and trees, but for me this is where it's happening."
 A picture caption with the article misidentified the couple who were being greeted by L. Jay Oliva, the university's president, and Laurence A. Tisch, the chairman of CBS. They were Nan and Abraham Ellis, not Klara and Larry Silverstein.

HEADLINE: With a Woman Sought, the U.S. Offers Choices as Unicef Chief

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 20

 BODY:
Under pressure from Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to nominate women for the job of executive director of Unicef, the United States submitted new candidates today for the position in order to meet a European challenge to American leadership of the organization.
Until today, the Clinton Administration had stood by its original nominee, Dr. William H. Foege, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Clinton Administration officials have described him as uniquely qualified to head Unicef, the United Nations children's fund, an organization heavily involved in issues of child health. 
 The American mission here would not identify the new candidates submitted today, but it is widely believed that Carol Bellamy, now Peace Corps director and a former New York City Council President, is on the list. The Peace Corps said it could not confirm the report, but was aware of it.
Diplomats say they have also heard that Catherine Bertini, director of the World Food Program in Rome, may be on the American list.
The Secretary General may make his decision on the nominee as early as this week, diplomats say.
European nations, arguing that they collectively contribute half of the budget of Unicef, contend that they should be given the directorship, which the United States has held since the organization was founded in 1946. James P. Grant, the last American director, died in January. The United States pays for about a quarter of the Unicef budget.
In an interview in Copenhagen last week, the Secretary General said that he was determined to find a woman to head the agency, which assists children worldwide in education and other areas of childhood development. Mr. Boutros-Ghali is being urged to raise the percentage of women in executive and managerial roles in the United Nations system.
The Europeans nominated two women -- Elisabeth Rehn, a former Finnish Defense Minister, and Anne-Marie Lizin, a Belgian politician. Another European nominee is Richard Jolly, the British deputy director of Unicef, who is now acting as executive director.
Although Britain continues to support the candidacy of Mr. Jolly, other European diplomats say that the European Union is likely to coalesce soon around the candidacy of Ms. Rehn, who was defeated in a race for President of Finland last year.
Unicef, which is afflicted with a corruption scandal in its Nairobi headquarters and unfavorable audits and management reviews, will need a strong administrator willing to tackle a needed reorganization, diplomats say.
Today, as Unicef's board began a scheduled meeting, the organization announced that it was dismissing three of its Kenya headquarters staff members in Nairobi. They were among 10 people suspended without pay last month for misuse of agency funds.

HEADLINE: A New Quest By Buchanan For President

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., March 20

 BODY:
Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator who wounded President George Bush badly in this state's Republican primary in 1992, returned here today to declare that he is again running for his party's Presidential nomination. This time, he said, he is not merely a protest candidate.
Known for his provocative language and combative style, Mr. Buchanan repeated the hard-line conservative themes he invoked in his first campaign, and which even some of his fellow Republicans blamed in part for the party's difficulties then. He again called for abolishing racial quotas, cracking down on immigration and striving for economic nationalism, including virtually eliminating foreign aid. And he vowed to lead a "cultural war," saying that the nation's movies, television and music are "polluted with lewdness and violence." 
 Mr. Buchanan lost the New Hampshire primary in 1992, but his impressive 37 percent showing hurt Mr. Bush in the nation's opening primary. Polls showed that Mr. Buchanan's support was largely a result of Mr. Bush's lack of popularity in a state whose stricken economy made voters receptive to a different message. That was the high point of Mr. Buchanan's campaign that year; he never won a primary.
The difference in this campaign, he said, is that the Republican Party -- and Mr. Buchanan's competitors for the nomination -- have moved closer to his way of thinking.
"Four years ago, we came here to say 'no' to tax hikes and 'no' to quota bills, and now every Republican says 'no' to tax hikes and 'no' to quota bills and 'no' to affirmative action," Mr. Buchanan, 56, told nearly 200 supporters at the Manchester Institute of the Arts and Sciences. "So we want first to welcome the prodigal sons home to their father's house. But we shall remind them: the Buchanan Brigades are not leap-year conservatives."
Flanked by his wife, Shelley, and his sister, Angela (Bay) Buchanan, who has been instrumental in her brother's political campaigns, Mr. Buchanan asserted, "We stand here today to resume command of the revolution that we began here three years ago -- because we intend to lead that revolution to triumph and into the White House in 1996."
In an indication of where he intends to look for votes, supporters who stood behind Mr. Buchanan on the stage here today included the heads of groups proclaiming themselves "New Hampshire Right to Life" and "New Hampshire Gun Owners for Buchanan."
In introducing Mr. Buchanan, the co-chairman of his state campaign, Ward Scott, drew the loudest applause when he depicted the candidate as "a patriot who will not yield on the sanctity of human life."
But Mr. Buchanan did not mention abortion even though, as other contenders try to play down the issue, he has emphasized that he is unalterably opposed to diluting the Republican platform's demand for a prohibition on abortions. Bay Buchanan said afterward that her brother simply wanted to stress "general topics" in his speech.
Though he insists otherwise, Mr. Buchanan is viewed by many political professionals as a protest candidate. He ranks near the bottom in early polls, and other better-organized and better-financed candidates, particularly Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, have already acquired central elements of his message.
Even so, Mr. Buchanan could have significant influence on the Republican contest, particularly in an early primary state like New Hampshire, because he is not reluctant to raise hot issues, including his opposition to abortion and to homosexual rights.
Mr. Buchanan, who is best known as a co-host of the CNN program "Crossfire," from which he recently resigned, delivered one of the more vitriolic speeches -- on cultural differences -- at the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston.
Today, repeating some of those same notions, he declared: "I will use the bully pulpit of the Presidency of the United States, to the full extent of my powers and ability, to defend American traditions and the values of faith, family and country from any and all directions. And together, we will chase the purveyors of sex and violence back beneath the rocks whence they came."
Mr. Buchanan ridiculed the North American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. He said there would be "no more $50 billion bailouts of third-world socialists -- whether in Moscow or Mexico City," and added: "In a Buchanan White House, foreign lobbyists and corporate contributors will not sit at the head of the table. I will."
Mr. Buchanan, who worked in the White House for Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford and Ronald Reagan, is the third Republican to declare his candidacy this year, after Senator Gramm and former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. Others who are preparing to announce their candidacies or who are considering it are Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana and Gov. Pete Wilson of California.
In a sobering reminder of the hostility among some people toward Mr. Buchanan, today's event was marred when four young protesters jumped onto the podium as Mr. Buchanan was beginning his speech. They waved placards that read "Buchanan Is a Racist!" and other taunts. The protesters, who identified themselves as representing a Riverdale, the Bronx, group called the Coalition for Jewish Concerns-Amcha, said they were disturbed by past comments in which Mr. Buchanan has been critical of American Jews, Israel and the Holocaust.
The protesters, whose national president, Rabbi Avi Weiss of New York, led protests in 1989 against the presence of a convent on the site of the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland, were hustled out of the hall by Buchanan supporters. No one was injured, and the police said they were investigating the incident but had made no arrests.
After asking the audience to "calm down," Mr. Buchanan started back on his speech with a reference to the protesters. "My friends," he said, "now you know what we're fighting against in this country."
Mr. Buchanan mentioned the protesters again when he raised the issue of a moratorium on legal immigration to the United States. "So, like our little visitors this morning," he said, "the custodians of political correctness do not frighten me. And I will do what is needed to defend the borders of the United States, even if it means putting the National Guard all along our southern frontier."
Determined to show that he was waging a national campaign, Mr. Buchanan flew from here to Chicago, where he held a rally and then boarded a motor home headed for Iowa, where the first Presidential caucuses will be held next year.

HEADLINE: Governors' Frustration Fuels Effort on Welfare Financing

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
Gov. Marc Racicot of Montana has shopped at the Safeway with families using food stamps. One Saturday last month, he helped look for adequate subsidized housing for a once-homeless family in the state capital, Helena. After two years as Governor, Mr. Racicot thinks he has a good feel for the needs of Montanans on welfare.
So it frustrates him no end when the bureaucracy in Washington prevents him from meeting those needs the way he thinks best. And he is by no means alone. 
 Among the nation's governors, Republicans and Democrats alike, there is a growing frustration with the restraints imposed by Federal rules governing welfare and other social programs, and it is adding impetus to the drive by Congressional Republicans to turn over to the states most of the Federal programs for the poor.
The Republican solution is to replace entitlement programs, which provide benefits to everyone who meets the criteria, with lump sums of Federal money, or block grants, each earmarked for a specific purpose. Committees of the House of Representatives have already approved block grants to finance welfare, food stamps, child nutrition, foster care and Medicaid, but without the myriad bureaucratic strings attached to current entitlement programs for those purposes. The welfare legislation will be debated on the House floor in the next few days.
But critics of block grants, including some governors exasperated by entitlement programs, worry that the lump sums would leave many poor people without an adequate safety net, either because they would be out of luck if demand for a program's services outruns the state's grant or because some states do not have governments competent to deal with such complicated matters.
Many critics also worry that the Federal money would not be distributed fairly among the states.
The block grant concept is hardly new; it has been a feature of Republican doctrine for the last quarter century. Under President Richard M. Nixon, dozens of separate programs in job training, housing and social services were folded into three block grants. Nine new block grants were created in the first year of Ronald Reagan's Presidency, replacing more than 50 health, social services, education and community development programs.
All told, 23 block grants have been enacted since 1966, and 15 are still on the books. This represents only a small fraction of Federal aid to the states -- about $35 billion a year as against the $200 billion Washington sends to the states each year in grants for narrow purposes.
What is different about the block grant proposals now before Congress is that they would make a much more fundamental change in the relationship between the Federal Government and the states than anything seriously contemplated before.
All the block grants that have been enacted until now involved operating or capital expenses. Many programs for which Congress already provided specific sums of money were folded into a few bigger grants, for which Congress appropriated fixed sums.
In contrast, the programs the Republicans want to turn into block grants this year are entitlements, the amount of which are determined by need. Currently, for example, when the economy in California is rocky, more money goes to Californians for welfare, food stamps and other poverty programs. When the economy gets better and people go back to work, less money goes into the state for these purposes.
Republicans maintain that entitlements have discouraged fiscal responsibility and have thus resulted in the programs' growing out of control. Last year, for example, the cost of Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor, rose 11.3 percent. Inflation in the overall economy was only 2.7 percent, and health costs generally rose only 4.9 percent.
Gov. Jim Edgar of Illinois, a Republican and an outspoken advocate of block grants for social programs, said he expected the Federal Government to cut spending to lower its budget deficit. "What we're saying is that if you're going to make those cuts, we can run the programs at less of a cost than it costs us now," he said in an interview.
Other governors are not so sure. Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, a Democrat who is chairman of the National Governors' Association, said that he, too, was frustrated by what often seemed to be senseless restrictions imposed by Washington. But he said he could not accept block grants unless the Federal Government set minimum standards for helping poor children and created "some kind of safety valve for state budgets when you have a recession."
What worries many politicians and academic experts is what would happen under block grants if circumstances changed unexpectedly.
Richard P. Nathan, director of the Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany, is a Republican who worked on urban problems in the Nixon White House and who generally advocates block grants. But he has broken ranks this year.
"If you have a recession, if you have rapid inflation, if you have the courts suddenly requiring more money be spent for foster care and group homes, then you're going to run out of money," Mr. Nathan said. "And come April or May, someone's going to apply for welfare or child assistance, and what are you going to say, 'Sorry, we're all out'?"
Governor Edgar took issue with that assessment. Illinois already pays half the bill for Medicaid and Aid to Families With Dependent Children, the principal welfare program, he said, so the state is just as likely under the current system to run out of money when a recession hits as it would be with a block grant.
Two other concerns expressed by those skeptical of block grants for social programs are whether the states are competent to administer such complicated programs and whether the money would be distributed fairly among the states.
One state that consistently gets high marks for the quality of its government is Wisconsin. Its Governor, Tommy G. Thompson, a Republican, is one of the leading supporters of block grants.
Governor Thompson's showcase exhibit is the welfare program he put into place after receiving free rein from Washington to experiment. The Wisconsin system limits the amount of time people can remain on welfare and aggressively pushes welfare beneficiaries into jobs and education.
While state welfare rolls across the country rose an average of 35 percent from 1989 to 1993, Wisconsin's caseload fell by 3 percent, and its costs fell by $9 million a month. At the same time, Wisconsin has some of the most generous benefits in the country -- $517 a month for a family of three under Aid to Families With Dependent Children.
"In welfare, Wisconsin is a beacon to the nation," wrote Lawrence M. Mead, a professor at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, who published a study of Wisconsin's welfare system in January.
But Mr. Mead's principal finding may not sit well with some Republican politicians. He said the main reason for Wisconsin's success was that the number of caseworkers was increased so people on welfare could be supervised more closely. "Reforming welfare may save money on balance," he wrote, "but it requires more bureaucracy rather than less."
Many states might not be able to match Wisconsin's success. Donald F. Kettl, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin who helped edit a Brookings Institution study last year on health programs in various states, said: "In terms of administrative capacity, the states are all over the lot. Some are on the level with the Federal Government. Some are innovative and exciting. But some are a long way from that kind of competence."
The Brookings study, which tried to assess whether the states would be able to manage the Clinton health care plan, concluded that there was "positively no way that Texas, Mississippi and other states with limited experience" could meet the administrative responsibilities.
The question of how to distribute the money is the single most difficult issue faced by lawmakers writing the block grant legislation, said Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
The easiest approach, and the one usually taken in the past when block grants were formed from smaller programs, is to apportion the money on the basis of how much each state had been receiving for the individual programs. But the General Accounting Office, the Government's chief auditing agency, said last month that this approach has often proved to be inequitable.
This could be a serious problem when the legislators take up Medicaid. For example, about one-third of all Medicaid money is spent on the elderly, mainly for nursing home care. Thus, states like Florida and Arizona, which have rapidly growing populations of the elderly, would be disadvantaged.
But if some other formula is developed for distributing the money, then winners and losers will be created, and that could stir up considerable political opposition.
It is far too soon to tell how the notion of block grants for poverty programs will fare. The House Agriculture Committee has already rejected the idea of a food stamps block grant for all states, although under its legislation some states might get one.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who is the chief authority in Congress on the history and workings of social programs, said that he expected the states to be given more flexibility to administer the system, but doubted that the principle of a Federal entitlement would be removed from basic welfare programs.
Governor Racicot (pronounced ROS-coe) of Montana said in an interview that he, too, worried about the risks of block grants. But he added, "Doing more of the wrong thing doesn't seem to be the right solution either."
To support his point, he recounted a litany of frustrations as Governor:
*He was turned down by the Agriculture Department when he asked permission to give poor families cash and training in money management in place of food stamps, steps he thought would reduce administrative expenses and eliminate a black market in food stamps.
*He was blocked by the Department of Health and Human Services when he wanted to pay day care expenses with some of the Medicaid money earmarked for devices like eyeglasses and hearing aids.
*His welfare bill now before the Legislature cannot go into effect without 72 separate waivers from Washington, some of which have been obtained but others of which are stuck in the pipeline.
"I'd like to make certain that we live up to our responsibility to provide a helping hand," Governor Racicot said. "But there are just legions of requirements from Washington that evince a lack of trust in us to do the right things."

HEADLINE: After Years in Exile in South Florida, Nicaraguans Feel the Tug of 2 Homes

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI, March 19

 BODY:
In her nine years in the United States, Maria Luisa Campos has learned a construction trade and become used to the nickname Marylu. Most of her family is here, including her parents, four sisters and a brother, and her 11-year-old daughter speaks Spanish with the accent of an English speaker.
Ms. Campos is among more than 100,000 Nicaraguans who came here fleeing war, economic hardship and a leftist government. Like the Cuban exiles before them, the Nicaraguans have spent their years in exile in Miami building new lives, setting up businesses and staking out neighborhoods with streets and schools named after their most famous poet. 
 But a recent change in Federal rules has reminded many Nicaraguans of the legal limbo they face as immigrants, caught between a recovering country that says it cannot yet absorb them and an adopted one that has never given them a blanket welcome.
What still eludes many of them, they say, is a certainty about where their futures lie. "I have one foot here and the other over there," said Ms. Campos, 41.
About 1,000 Nicaraguans gathered last month in front of the offices of the Immigration and Naturalization Service here to protest new rules that deny applicants for political asylum work permits while their cases are pending. Without such permits, immigrants cannot work legally, and employers who hire them face possible criminal sanctions. Federal officials say the change, which included a promise that new asylum cases would be heard more quickly, is meant to cut down on fraudulent claims and help clear a backlog of asylum cases -- not only Nicaraguans, but also Guatemalans, Chinese and others.
Immigration officials say the new rules on work permits will affect about 24,000 Nicaraguans whose applications for asylum have yet to be resolved, as well as thousands more who are appealing their cases.
Nicaraguans here say the change threatens the livelihood of thousands of exiles, forcing them either to take illegal jobs for substandard wages or to leave. All of this only underscores the precarious security of immigrant populations who say they have been caught in the shifting tides of politics and history; they have stayed so long in their country of refuge that they have put down roots, and now they find it difficult to think of starting over in their own country.
Ms. Campos's father and her oldest daughter, a married nursing student with whom she lives, came to Miami before her and have obtained political asylum. Ms. Campos said she was denied asylum years ago but continued working with work permits that she was allowed to renew annually.
"If my daughters left with me I'd go back, but what do I have there?" said Ms. Campos, who has been out of construction work after suffering a knee injury and is now studying flower arrangement.
Almost invisible before the 1980's, Nicaraguans are believed to be the second-largest Hispanic group in the Miami area, after Cubans. Although the 1990 census counted fewer than 75,000 Nicaraguans in Dade County, their population, both legal and illegal, is estimated at closer to 150,000, the largest concentration of Nicaraguans in the United States.
Nicaraguans, much like the Cubans, moved here in waves. The Cubans regarded them as fellow refugees from Communism and welcomed them with open arms after the Sandinista revolutionary victory over the military dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle in 1979. The bulk of them, and the poorest, came in the years of United States-financed armed resistance to the Sandinista Government.
Elections in 1990 ousted the Sandinistas. But then Americans moved on to other crises, and much of an exile community that expected to be transient has stayed put.
Many in that community do not want to go back because, they say, their country's democracy is too young and the economic and political problems are too big. Some say they fear political reprisal. Others await the settlement of property claims after losing homes and farms to confiscations. Still others say they do not want to return because they no longer believe they belong there.
"Now the situation is different because the children who are protesting are American," said Cristobal J. Mendoza, head of the Committee of Poor Nicaraguans in Exile, which sponsored the protest at the immigration service and plans another outside the White House in May.
Roberto Arguello, 39, a banker who came from one of the wealthiest Nicaraguan families and helped form the Nicaraguan American Bankers and Businessmen Association, a lobbying group here, said many decided long ago to stay for good.
"I adore this country," said Mr. Arguello, who became a United States citizen in 1986. "My father died in the United States. My family business is here. Even though I'll do everything possible to help Nicaragua with money, I can never go back."
The Nicaraguan exodus strained education and health services here. But a multitude of small businesses, newspapers and professional organizations, and areas of the county with a distinct Nicaraguan imprint, attest to the success of a large part of the exile community.
In Sweetwater, a city west of Miami, an L-shaped shopping center is Centro Comercial Managua, and West 97th Avenue is Ruben Dario Avenue, named after Nicaragua's best-known poet. This is also where former members of President Somoza's National Guard don their uniforms for a parade every year and where the Somoza family co-owns a successful Nicaraguan restaurant.
John Hamilton, director for Central American Affairs at the State Department, said that in 1994 Nicaragua registered its first year of economic growth in a decade, with total private investment of $40 million to $50 million, part of it from exiles here. President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro of Nicaragua said in a recent interview that Nicaraguans received $150 million a year from relatives in the United States, but exiles estimate the figure at twice that.
In December, President Chamorro urged in a letter to President Clinton that Nicaraguans be allowed to stay longer in the United States because "the economy of my country is still fragile and couldn't take a massive return of our citizens."
But many here fault her Government, saying it has engaged in corruption and nepotism and in political alliances with the Sandinistas. Many here say they are skeptical that they would be treated fairly, and some, like former members of President Somoza's National Guard, say they are outright fearful of what they call Sandinista terrorists.
Noel Castillo, 43, and Antonio A., 32, are merely disillusioned. While Mr. Castillo fought as Comandante Trampa (Commander Trickster) during the war against the Sandinistas, Antonio A. was a Sandinista worker who roved the same mountains making sure peasants remained loyal.
Today, Antonio A., who is here illegally and did not want his full name used, makes trusses for prefabricated houses in Homestead, and Mr. Castillo works as a warehouse manager and studies radiology part time in Miami. They meet with their families for dinner and sometimes talk about politics back home, but they never discuss the past and its failures.
Enemies in their country, they are friends in exile.
"To me the war is over," Mr. Castillo said. "All I want is to move ahead."
Despite the apprehensions, more than 200,000 Nicaraguans have returned from the United States and neighboring Central American countries since the 1990 elections, Nicaraguan Government officials say.
"Who cannot adjust to what is his?" asked Orlando Barreto, a 67-year-old corporate lawyer, in a telephone interview from Nicaragua. He returned after living in Miami for seven years, believing his native country is now "on the right track."

Princeton Economist Is Named John Bates Clark Medal Winner

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
The highest prize in economics short of the Nobel -- the John Bates Clark medal -- will be awarded to a Princeton University labor economist, David Card, who has helped make empirical research on hot topics fashionable again among younger economists.
The prize, granted by the American Economics Association every two years, is for the best economist under 40 and is seen by many as an indicator of Nobel material. 
 Professor Card's research papers have had a way of jumping from ivory-tower academic journals to front pages and television news programs. That is partly because of their focus on the real world, along with novel methods, counterintuitive results and accessible style.
At a time when data have become more abundant, statistical techniques more advanced and computers more powerful, Professor Card is one of the leading young economists -- along with his frequent collaborator, Alan Kreuger, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich's chief economist -- who have been able to show the rest of the profession how to exploit these new riches.
"David has made empirical research more influential by making it more credible," said Orley Ashenfelter, an economist at Princeton who spread the news of the award yesterday. "Many people who are considered for this prize write papers you could never read."
Indeed, while early Clark prize winners like Milton Friedman and Robert Solow had a strong track record in empirical research using real world data, prize winners in the 1970's and 1980's tended to be inventors of mathematical techniques or novel theoretical insights.
Professor Card's best-known works are studies suggesting that raising the minimum wage may not prompt employers to cut back on their hiring of minimum-wage workers, contradicting what most economists have long believed. These results have figured heavily in the current debate on whether to increase the minimum wage.
Professor Card's research has also helped fuel the debate over the payoff from school spending. With Mr. Kreuger, he employed masses of data to find out whether attending school in a state that spent a lot of money on schools, say California, versus a state that did not, like Mississippi, resulted in higher earnings. Again, their results were the first in decades to seriously challenge the conventional wisdom that school quality, student-teacher ratio, teacher salaries and the length of the school term have no discernible effect on future pay.
Professor Card, a plain-talking, wise-cracking Canadian who grew up on an Ontario dairy farm, found out about the prize -- which will not be formally announced until the association meets in January -- on Sunday.
Twenty-four hours later, he still sounded surprised. "I never in a million years thought I would have a chance to win," he said, laughing. "Normally the committee would have selected a leader in economic theory or very sophisticated econometric techniques."

Yielding, U.S. Bows to Europe On Trade Chief

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 20

 BODY:
In an embarrassing setback, the Clinton Administration has abandoned a lengthy effort to install its candidate as head of the new World Trade Organization and will announce on Tuesday that it is endorsing Europe's choice, Renato Ruggiero of Italy.
The move ends a divisive deadlock involving countries on three continents and assures that Mr. Ruggiero, a longtime diplomat who was once Italy's trade minister, will take up the post this spring. 
 But under conditions negotiated by the Clinton Administration in recent days, Mr. Ruggiero will be limited to one four-year term, and the major trading partners have agreed that his successor will not be a European, senior Administration officials said.
Until just a few weeks ago, American officials argued that Mr. Ruggiero was a glorified bureaucrat who embodied the protectionist leanings of European governments on agriculture and a range of other issues. They asserted that he lacked the influence to shape the first years of an organization that is to become, in essence, a United Nations of international trade, with broad authority to set rules and arbitrate disputes between nations.
The candidate favored by Washington, former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico, dropped out three weeks ago, after it became clear that he bore some responsibility for Mexico's economic crisis and when the arrest of his brother in connection with a political killing made his candidacy untenable.
The White House, after unsuccessfully searching for an alternative and dismissing the idea of supporting the third candidate, Kim Chul Su, a South Korean economist, concluded that it had no choice but to back Mr. Ruggiero.
"The race for director general became a hemispheric conflict that was not in the interest of the United States or the W.T.O.," a senior official said today. "We have worked diligently for the past 10 days to get the assurances that we need about the direction of the organization, and in the end we got those assurances, which were critical."
The move will undoubtedly anger South Korea and other Asian allies, who have promoted Mr. Kim's candidacy. But the key to his candidacy was the support of Japan, and in recent days Japanese diplomats, sensing the way the argument was going, have begun to sing the praise of Mr. Ruggiero as a man who had opened some of Italy's most protected markets.
Mr. Ruggiero, a big man with a deep laugh and skills in half a dozen languages, has campaigned for the job since last June. He quickly secured the support of all the European nations and most former European colonies. But under the ill-defined electoral rules of the new organization, which is the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's secretariat, the director general had to be elected by a consensus that was led by the world's largest trading nations.
At a lunch with American reporters several months ago, Mr. Ruggiero cast himself as an "honest broker" among the competing interests of the trade organization's more than 120 nations. He talked extensively of the need to bring developing countries and emerging markets into central roles in the new, Geneva-based group, which will possess, at least on paper, far more power to administer world trade rules than any international group since the end of World War II.
But Mr. Ruggiero spoke of the need to build an efficient bureaucracy rather than to bring about revolutionary change. That was exactly what had the Clinton Administration worried. "He's a glorified bureaucrat," an Administration official said several weeks ago.
Today, though, the Administration tone had changed, and Mr. Ruggiero was hailed by a senior official as a man "who certainly has the experience." Another official involved acknowledged, however, that the United States had to give ground because "we were the ones who came up with the candidate who didn't make it."
Several diplomats here who have monitored the uneasy talks among the United States, Europeans and Asians said today that they expected Mr. Ruggiero to bend over backward in the next year or so to accommodate American interests.
"In some ways I think the Administration is better off this way," an Ambassador from a Pacific region nation said today. "He knows that everyone is going to be looking for any evidence that he's protecting European farmers or helping to keep American movies out of France. He's going to be careful."
The World Trade Organization's first responsibility, and Mr. Ruggiero's, will be to apply the complex provisions of the new GATT accord, which embraces more than 20,000 pages and a score of subagreements.
The accord was approved by Congress last fall, but only after a last-minute compromise with Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, to establish a commission of American judges to review decisions by the trade group that go against American interests. If the panel finds a pattern of such judgments, Congress must review American participation in the organization.
The race for director general came, over time, to reflect three very different visions of the future of the world economy. The United States pressed for deregulation and change toward the principles of a market economy. The Europeans seemed to seek an organization that gave greater attention to protecting farmers and to individual national sensitivities. Asian nations pursued an Asian model of development -- strong central government leadership of industry, often with a detailed industrial policy.
In the end, the race turned into a power struggle, in which none of the three regions wanted to give ground. "Clearly, we were headed for an indefinite deadlock unless someone took the initiative," a senior Administration official said.
Mr. Ruggiero's first test will probably come Tuesday in Washington, where he is expected to appear with Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, for the formal blessing of his candidacy. He will also attend meetings with other American officials, who are expected to describe their expectations for the trade organization's early days -- and the informal agreements worked out among trade ministers lately -- in some detail.
Mr. Ruggiero will be required to walk a fine line between accommodating those in Washington who view the organization as anti-American, and those elsewhere who say that the United States has dominated international economic organizations.
He will also have to try to persuade the United States to give up the tactic of trade retaliation against individual rivals in favor of multilateral rules, something the Administration has sometimes been loath to do, especially given the visible success of its threats against Japan and China in the last year.

HEADLINE: Stocks Continue to Rise; Dow Climbs 10.03, to a Record 4,083.68

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market rose again to record levels yesterday after posting records on Friday. But the rally was not very broad, and analysts warned that traders might pull back as the Dow Jones industrial average approached 4,100 points.
Tobacco, pharmaceutical and retailing stocks rose sharply, but those of steel, bank and automobile companies fell. 
 Traders might also be tempted to pull back in advance of next Tuesday's policy-setting meeting of the Federal Reserve Board. The Fed is expected to refrain from raising interest rates. There are also few market-moving economic reports this week, except for February durable-goods orders on Friday.
Bond prices fell and the dollar continued to be weak, though it gained some ground. But the stock market seems to be acting independent of bonds and the dollar.
In lackluster trading, the Dow rose 10.03 points, to a record 4,083.68, while the broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 0.62 point, to 496.14, another record. After falling on Friday, the smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 2.16 points, to a record 810.49.
But more stocks fell on the New York Stock Exchange than rose, with declining stocks outnumbering advancers by 1,105 to 1,073.
"The market these days is a trader's paradise," because of the volatility of recent sessions, said Alan R. Ackerman, market strategist for Fahnestock & Company. But, he added, "a few nosebleeds are possible above 4,000 and some traders may want to pull the rip cord before they get to 4,100."
The stock and bond markets have reached a tentative consensus, based on last week's economic data, that there is no rationale for raising rates at the March 28 meeting of the Fed's policy setting committee.
With the economy apparently slowing, the Fed should not need to fight inflation with higher rates. But traders often warn that the market is most vulnerable to a downturn when such conclusions form.
Meanwhile, the dollar remains fragile. In Tokyo trading, the dollar fell to a record low 88.65 Japanese yen before recovering to 89.40 yen later. It settled at 89.33 yen in New York, up from 89.05 yen on Friday. The dollar also rose against the German mark, but remains near its post-World-War-II low.
The value of the dollar is important to the stock market because a weaker dollar penalizes foreign investors, who have become an important source of capital for American markets. The Dow, for example, has risen 6.5 percent so far this year in terms of dollars but fallen 3.54 percent in terms of marks.
Shares of the Philip Morris Companies, a Dow component stock, rose 2 7/8, to 66 5/8. Traders are betting that Philip Morris, the cigarette maker, will benefit from a Federal appellate court ruling on an class-action suit against the drug industry.
An appeals court in Chicago stripped that suit of class-action status, thus limiting potential damages, and traders believe this could aid the tobacco industry defend itself against another class-action suit. Shares of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation, another cigarette maker, rose 1/8 to 513/16 .
Shares of Autofinance Group Inc. rose 53/16 , to 153/16 , after Keycorp agreed to acquire the finance company for $316 million in stock. And Circus Circus Enterprises Inc. rose 3 5/8 a share, to 28 7/8, after it agreed to buy Gold Strike Resorts, a casino owner, for $576 million.
Shares in steelmakers dropped sharply after the Nucor Corporation announced a price cut in a major steel product. Nucor shares fell 2 1/8, to 51 3/4.
Shares of the Colonial Data Technologies Corporation, a maker of caller-identification displays for telephones, fell after Texas Instruments Inc. said it would make competing equipment. Colonial shares slid 4 3/4, to 14 1/8.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.21 point, to 268.05, and the American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.16 point, to 456.18.

Canadian Rail Strike Denting the Economy

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH 

DATELINE: TORONTO, March 20

 BODY:
A national rail strike that began in Canada Saturday, idling nearly 35,000 workers, has already started to affect auto makers and other industries dependent on rail shipments and forced commuters to find alternative ways to get to work.
Because of a shortage of parts, 6,200 Ford auto workers in Ontario were laid off or working half time. Delays also hit shipments of forestry products and such diverse minerals as sulfur, potash and coal. 
 The potential for crippling Canada's fragile economy led Prime Minister Jean Chretien's Cabinet late Sunday to authorize Labor Minister Lucienne Robillard to seek legislation immediately to end the walkout.
The earliest a law could take effect, a ministry official said in Ottawa, would be Thursday. It is expected to decree some form of arbitrated settlement, as was done last week when Parliament stepped into another potentially disruptive labor conflict, a Vancouver, British Columbia, dock strike that could have drastically cut Canada's grain exports.
Mr. Chretien's Liberals have more than enough votes to assure passage of back-to-work rail legislation. But the Bloc Quebecois, a Quebec separatist party that is also the official opposition in the House of Commons, refused consent to speed the legislative process, arguing that the law was antilabor. "Does the right to strike still exist in Canada?" Lucien Bouchard, the bloc's leader, asked during House debate.
The Government had asked the bloc to waive the required 48-hour notice for the introduction of bills, which would have permitted enactment by Tuesday.
The United States has similar procedures for dealing with crippling strikes. The President has recourse either to administrative or legislative remedies. One major difference is that in seeking a legislative solution, the President does not always command a majority in Congress.
The biggest impact so far of the shutdown of Canadian National Rail, CP Rail and VIA Rail has been on the auto industry, which depends on parts deliveries that are almost hourly. Some 85 to 90 percent of the Big Three cars made in Canada are exported to the United States.
A shortage of body panels for the Ford Crown Victoria and the Mercury Grand Marquis forced Ford to close a plant in St. Thomas, Ontario, halfway between Windsor and Toronto, and furlough 2,500 workers. An additional 3,500 workers at Ford's mini-van plant in Oakville near Toronto were working half shifts, and 400 at an engine-casting plant in Windsor went home early.
"We're faced with an entire week of disruption," lamented Jim Hartford, a spokesman for Ford of Canada.
General Motors of Canada was also running short of parts but had not yet interrupted production, Stew Low, a spokesman, said. Chrysler, which uses trucks more than rail service, was in the best shape. "If it drags on a week or two, that could cause some problems," acknowledged Walt McCall, manager of corporate public relations.
Pay and job security are the key issues. Wages currently range between $10.25 and $12.75 an hour.
The unions complain that it has been two years since most employees have had a raise. Management, struggling with large networks of obsolete branch lines and $1.1 billion in combined losses since 1993, contends that it cannot afford higher labor costs and that rail workers are already the highest-paid transport workers.

HEADLINE: Eviction of Abortion Clinic Is Postponed Until a Hearing

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., March 20

 BODY:
A Long Island abortion clinic that faces eviction because of its landlord's fears of anti-abortion violence can remain in place, at least until a trial next month, a judge ruled today.
Justice John DiNoto of State Supreme Court here ruled that the clinic -- Long Island Gynecological Services, at 1103 Stewart Avenue, Garden City -- could continue to operate while the court determined whether new rules that prohibit abortions in the building were "reasonably prescribed." 
 "While this court is not unmindful of the sensitivity of the subject matter of abortion," Justice DiNoto wrote, "the issues before this court are issues of landlord and tenant rights pursuant to the terms of a written lease."
In a four-page ruling, Justice Di Noto extended a temporary restraining order against the eviction. The justice also told lawyers for both sides to be back in court on April 3 to argue whether the landlord had acted reasonably in issuing the new rules.
The landlord announced the rules in January after a wave of anti-abortion episodes at clinics across the country, including the killing of two abortion-clinic employees in Massachusetts and the posting of a threatening sign at the Garden City clinic.
The landlord, Ronald J. Morey, said that while he supported a woman's right to an abortion and was sympathetic to the clinic, he had to consider the safety of his other tenants.
He said that bullets had been fired at his building and that tenants, including a 72-year-old nurse in a doctor's office not affiliated with the abortion clinic, had been pushed and shoved in a hallway of the building. The nurse also received a telephone death threat, he said.
Justice DiNoto's ruling today was welcomed by lawyers for the clinic and by national abortion rights advocates who fear that threats of eviction and other economic pressure from anti-abortion groups are threatening women's right to abortion.
"This is a good first step, but we've got a long way to go, both for this clinic and others across the country that might be endangered by similar threats," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, a sponsor of a 1994 law guaranteeing access to abortion clinics.
Mr. Schumer, a Democrat of Brooklyn, said that his office was planning a conference of abortion providers from around New York State next month to talk about the law, how it is being enforced and what kind of new threats and problems abortion providers are facing in light of the Long Island case.
David I. Rosenberg, the lawyer for the clinic in Garden City, said that his client was satisfied that the court had continued the restraining order pending a full hearing on the landlord's rules. "I don't think it's reasonable," he said, "when a rule, in effect, cancels the entire use my client put the premises to, a use that was insured in the lease."
According to the 11-year lease, signed by the clinic and the landlord on Aug. 3, 1992, the clinic was to use the premises as "medical offices" for an "ambulatory, surgical or diagnostic and treatment center."
The Nassau County police said that threats and other incidents reported by security officers at the building were being investigated and had been reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is monitoring illegal acts against the clinic.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains Some Ground Against Mark and the Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar strengthened yesterday, rebounding from a record low against the yen in intraday trading in Tokyo, following intervention by Japan's central bank. The dollar also gained against the German mark, bolstered by supportive comments from European officials.
But the increase came largely on overseas markets before the start of trading in New York. 
 "New York did the prudent thing," said Steven Flanagan, a vice president in New York for Credit Agricole. "The market just was in a profit-taking, consolidating mode after last week's hectic activity."
In early Tokyo trading, the dollar fell to a post-World-War-II low of 88.65 yen before the Bank of Japan began buying dollars and selling yen in an effort to halt the dollar's slide. The central bank did not confirm the action, but traders reported a sudden burst of buying that normally indicates official intervention.
The intervention helped push the dollar back up to 89.32 yen in late Tokyo trading. Later in New York, the dollar settled at 89.33 yen, up from 89.05 yen on Friday.
While the Japanese intervention may have prevented a plunge in the dollar, dealers appeared to be little impressed with its overall impact.
"You didn't get a real big rebound," said Jack Griffin, vice president for Fuji Bank Ltd. in New York. "The long-term direction of the dollar hasn't changed."
The dollar's long slide against the yen has picked up speed in recent weeks as Japanese companies and investment funds sell dollars for yen ahead of the close of their fiscal year on March 31. But the dollar may get a breather today, because Japanese markets will closed for a holiday.
The dollar saw some relief against the mark yesterday. The mark, which has surged in recent months on political uncertainty in parts of Europe, retreated yesterday in profit taking. The mark hit record highs against the British pound, Italian lira and Spanish peseta last week.
The dollar was also helped after Hans Tietmeyer, the president of Germany's central bank, called the dollar's decline "exaggerated." He said Europe wanted to see a stronger and stable dollar, which he noted remained the world's major reserve currency.
In New York, the dollar rose to 1.4030 marks, from 1.3865 marks on Friday.
"The market has a great deal of respect for the German central bank," Mr. Flanagan of Credit Agricole said. " A lot of profit taking came in on those comments."
On Sunday, the chief executive of the European Union, Jacques Santer, called on the world's large industrialized nations to devise a plan to stop the dollar's decline.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Mark Time Again on Light Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed for a third consecutive session yesterday in thin trading.
Without any new economic data or comments from Federal Reserve officials, market participants shifted their attention to the dollar, which moved from stronger in early trading to weaker and back to stronger as the day progressed. 
 The price of the 30-year bond fell 11/32 , to 10225/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its prices, rose to 7.39 percent, from 7.36 percent on Friday. Shorter-maturity bill rates in the secondary market were unchanged.
At yesterday's regular weekly auction of Treasury bills, interest rates on short-term bills were nearly stalled, with the new rate for a three- month issue unchanged from last week's 5.76 percent, while the six-month issue was down a basis point to 5.91 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Yesterday's market "was pretty much a yawn," said Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist at CS First Boston.
Mr. Alexy said there was not much new information to serve as a catalyst for either buying or selling securities, with few events on the economic calendar for the next couple of days. "The real action will come during the first week in April, when at that point the market will begin summarizing the first quarter of the year," he said. "It is at that point it will be much clearer as to were we are in respect to the national gross domestic product."
The generally positive performance of the dollar helped support the bond market. But traders note that the United States' huge trade deficit and the effects of Mexico's financial crisis continue to weigh on the dollar. The dollar has also been hurt by expectations that the Federal Reserve will not soon raise short-term interest rates.
"After last week's rally in the bond markets, the fixed-income sector opened today on solid ground, which is generally seen as a pause in the movement of the market," said Chris Moore, senior fixed-income analyst for Technical Data in Boston.
But there may not be much upside for the market because money managers are buying to dress up their portfolios as the the end of the quarter nears, he added. Moving forward, with little data due this week, activity could be choppy, but if prices can hold to the upper end of this established range, most market participants will continue to maintain a positive outlook, Mr. Moore said.
In other trading, municipal bond yields were little changed as investors focused on this week's $2.26 billion of new debt.
Today's sale by Minnesota of $115 million of general obligation bonds is expected to see strong demand. And because of a shrinking supply of new issues the state should see some decent prices. Last week's new-issue sales, for instance, were priced higher than than similar bonds sold in the secondary market.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:
 
 (000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.544	97.012	Discounted Rate	5.76%	5.91%	Coupon Yield	5.94%	6.19%	High Price	98.552	97.017	Discounted Rate	5.73%	5.90%	Coupon Yield	5.91%	6.18%	Low Price	98.544	97.012	Discounted Rate	5.76%	5.91%	Coupon Yield	5.94%	6.29%	Accepted at low price	68%	32%	Total applied for	$43,385,385	$45,302,350	Accepted	$12,493,555	$12,576,233	Noncompetitive	$1,361,979	$1,332,660	
 
Both issues are dated March 23, 1995. The three-month bills mature on June 22, 1995, and the six-month bills mature on Sept. 21, 1995.

HEADLINE: German Economy Took This Path in the 20's

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As an economic historian who has analyzed American policy since 1932, I commend "Hit the Poor. Reward the Rich" (editorial, March 12), a cogent indictment of the Republican plan for reducing poverty programs while cutting taxes for upper-income families and turning over block grants to the states. 
 The proposals are unwise from a long-term Republican as well as Democratic point of view. American capitalists are as blind to their long-term interests as were German capitalists in the early 1920's.
The German banking and big-business interests unleashed a great inflation, hoping that this would lead the Allies (Britain, the United States and France) to reduce World War I reparations. This objective was achieved, but the middle class was destroyed and the working class so embittered that the Nazis could come into power and destroy the Weimar Republic and the established German capitalist system.
The policies of the business groups that support the dominant Republican Party will hinder long-term economic growth. They will weaken the lower middle and working classes, destroy the welfare safeguards for the poor and intensify class conflict. The Republican Contract With America is suicidal for the socially responsible American capitalism that has prevailed for 60 years under Democratic and Republican administrations.

HEADLINE: Don't Blame All White Men

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Authorities ought not make a racists' mistake when reviewing affirmative action. Early reports of a Federal panel, the Glass Ceiling Commission, are not promising (news articles, March 16). 
 Evil intent is attributed to an entire group based only upon sex and skin color. White males are the perpetrators of racism, sexism and discrimination.
Never mind that the discriminators are a very small group of white males. All must be penalized for the offenses of this small clique, and because they have already made it, the perpetrators go free. Group membership takes priority over actions.
To say that the son of an unemployed West Virginia coal miner keeps blacks and women out of boardrooms, or that he should be penalized for the actions of an elite, is ludicrous. Lacking access to the old boy systems that even wealthy blacks and women have when a hiring or promotion decision is constrained by sex and race preferences, the coal miner's son is the likely loser.
Favoring a black publisher's son or a white financier's daughter over the coal miner's son cannot be justified under any standard of fairness. That is exactly what preferential hiring and promotion do.
Until the burden of affirmative action falls upon the actual offenders -- the illegal discriminators -- rather than candidates who just happen to be the wrong race or sex, these programs will be under fire. And rightly so.

Scandals Pit Some Younger Judges Against France's Establishment Elite

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: PARIS, March 17

 BODY:
For decades in France, it has been an open secret that the nation's business and political elite had intimate and mutually beneficial ties -- far more blatant ones than in other countries.
French industrial giants channeled campaign contributions through offshore bank accounts, and in return, their exports were promoted by Government officials. Within France they were given captive markets, and any bribes were considered a necessary cost of doing business. And politicians and chief executives alike were kept mostly beyond the reach of the criminal courts. 
 But that cozy relationship has been shaken by a series of corruption cases brought against some barons of industry. Corporate chiefs as well known here as Lee Iacocca or Bill Gates is in the United States have been hauled into court and interrogated, on charges including defrauding shareholders, illegal political financing, fraudulent invoicing and using company funds to remodel home bathrooms.
What is happening, political analysts say, is a kind of 20th-century version of the French Revolution -- a generational struggle between young, idealistic, rambunctious judges on the lower end of the pay scale and the 60-something members of the establishment who wonder why their power, perks and big salaries are suddenly being questioned. And all this comes as Government-controlled companies are privatized and thrown into a competitive global economy.
Not surprisingly, members of the old guard are indignant, complaining that the scandals will hurt their export markets -- and, broadly, that Anglo-Saxon values are being imposed on Gallic corporate governance. Politicians are also presumably indignant, but are mute about the scandals with a presidential election looming in late April.
While some historians and legal experts say the investigators may be going too far, they quickly add that the corporate and political establishment has long exercised political clout with a fierce impunity, and this is the backlash.
"We are going through in France what Italy went through five years ago -- the courts beginning to take on the corrupt aspects of the large industrial groups," said Thierry Jean-Pierre, a former judge and now a member of the European Parliament.
The latest and most prominent case involves Alcatel Alsthom S.A., the world's largest maker of telecommunications equipment.
On March 10, its chairman, Pierre Suard, was barred from the executive suite by a French judge investigating him for using corporate funds to remodel his homes and for his reported involvement in a scheme to overcharge France Telecom, Alcatel's largest corporate customer, by more than $100 million.
On Wednesday, on national television, Mr. Suard denied all charges, saying he was the subject of persecution by disgruntled former employees and of a misguided judiciary.
The next day, an association of judges expressed outrage, saying its members were "dumbstruck" by Mr. Suard's "surreal appearance."
And today, a second judge said he had uncovered an Alcatel account in Brussels that had reportedly channeled up to $20 million to accounts operated by French political parties.
Analysts say the Alcatel case has captured the public imagination because it embodies so much of the pent-up frustration with the power elite.
"It is a French tradition that a lot of high managers come from the top ranks of the civil servants," said Herve Joly, a political analyst in Lyon. "Alcatel is one of the best examples of this system."
For the company and Mr. Suard, the trouble began in 1993, when two employees of Alcatel-CIT, a subsidiary, were arrested for setting up a system of false invoicing in which they contracted work to companies they controlled and had Alcatel pay exorbitant fees. To defend themselves, Mr. Suard contends, the two men began implicating top company executives.
On July 4, the police came to Mr. Suard's home and questioned him on renovations done in the apartment he owned in a Paris suburb and in a three-apartment building he had built for himself, his son and his daughter. That same evening, he came face to face with his future nemesis, Judge Jean-Marie d'Huy, who informed him that he had been placed under formal investigation for misuse of corporate funds.
By the end of the year the judge had jailed Pierre Guichet, the head of Alcatel-CIT, for 12 days on charges that he was part of the scheme to overcharge France Telecom.
Mr. Suard has yet to spend any time in jail; he has not been brought before a grand jury or indicted. Under French law, judges have wide latitude to place anyone they consider involved in a crime under investigation and to detain them, almost indefinitely.
For his part, Mr. Suard, an intense man with neatly combed silver hair, a square face and gentle eyes, protests his innocence.
Over a recent lunch, he said he had personally paid for the renovations to his home and had shown the checks to the judge. And he saw no problem with the company's paying for a security system, especially after the Government recommended that companies protect top executives after the 1986 killing of the chairman of Renault.
"I never imagined I could have been a victim of this type of injustice," he said. He said he had paid the $60,000 bill to install the telephone system in his new apartment building. "No one in France could believe that I, head of Alcatel, actually paid for my own telephone installation," he said.
Most of all, he said, he felt helpless against repeated leaks from the courts. "All damages to my honor and to Alcatel have been made by one man, one judge, under the control of nobody," he said. "And I have not been permitted to defend myself."
Judge d'Huy declined requests for interviews.
Some French judges pursuing the corruption cases have become almost folk heroes, although to a lesser extent than in Italy. Mr. Jean-Pierre, for example, who brought some early cases, was elected to the European Parliament on an anticorruption platform.
In the past, judges have often been kept in check by politicians who remove them if they step out of line. But Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, a presidential candidate, has given the court more freedom and interfered less, political analysts say.
This greater liberalism has come back to sting Mr. Balladur, who has seen his once big lead in the polls erode, in part, because of his close ties to Mr. Suard and others caught up in the corporate scandals.
When Mr. Balladur was Finance Minister, from 1986 to 1988, he named Mr. Suard to head Compagnie Generale d'Electricite, which became Alcatel after its privatization a year later.
Before joining the Cabinet, Mr. Balladur had been head of GSI, a software subsidiary of the company, and rejoined the concern as a part-time adviser after leaving office in 1988. Over the next five years, he made almost $2 million in capital gains and fees from GSI. He has not been accused of any illegal activities, and he had repeatedly refused to disclose his compensation until last week.
Mr. Suard insisted he would not resign. Yet he is likely to face some pressure from Alcatel shareholders, for reasons quite apart from Judge d'Huy's investigations.
Last year, because of troubles in Germany, Turkey and Brazil, the company's profits plunged 40 percent, sending its stock price reeling. The company's biggest shareholder, the ITT Corporation, which holds 7 percent of Alcatel's shares, appears to be upset. Though it has made no official statement, press reports this week in Paris were filled with thinly veiled warnings from ITT that Alcatel could ill afford a management crisis. Until Mr. Suard's judicial fate is clear, the reports said, Mr. Suard might want to step aside.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
American Class Struggle

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
When the Republicans took over Congress in the November election, I didn't take it hard. I voted for candidates from both parties, so I told my Democratic friends not to go into mourning. After all, shifting control of Congress once every few decades was not exactly destroying democracy.
But I began to get nervous when I heard Representative Newton Gingrich boast that he was a revolutionary, the only one around. 
 Myself, I think the first American Revolution was carried out well enough to be the last. Any major-party leader who prattles about being a revolutionary strikes me as stunningly insensitive to the havoc that revolutions cause, especially when they are rooted not in oppression but in the brain of a politician afloat in self-esteem.
I still give him the benefit of the doubt; put the revolutionary talk down to a boyish pose. But sometimes a pose creates a result a young fellow might not foresee.
The fact is that the ambitions of the Newtonians, their lust for the quick, dramatic change and their deep fascination with themselves do have in them the makings of one important ingredient of revolution. That is class struggle.
Done carefully, with each Federal program to be sliced examined with the caring attention that we usually save for our own self-interest, much of the Contract With America could be of benefit.
But absent that tenderness, the program is turning into more than Americans who voted for it might want. They expected to save some government money spent on other Americans, give bureaucrats the scare of their lives, and have a good housecleaning.
But I doubt they expected the slash-and-burn campaign the Republicans have mounted against so much of the economic and social safety net created by Republican as well as Democratic administrations since World War II.
What's more, all this is going on when a particular kind of economic expansion is also taking place. Felix G. Rohatyn, senior partner of Lazard Freres, described it in a speech at Wake Forest University last week:
"The big beneficiaries of our economic expansion have been the owners of financial assets and a new class of highly compensated technicians working for companies where profit-sharing and stock ownership was widely spread.
"What is occurring is a huge transfer of wealth from lower-skilled middle-class American workers to the owners of capital assets and to the new technological aristocracy.
"As a result, the institutional relationship created by the mutual loyalty of employees and employers in most American businesses has been badly frayed. . . . These relationships have been replaced by a combination of fear for the future and a cynicism for the present as a broad proportion of working people see themselves as simply temporary assets to be hired or fired to protect the bottom line and create 'shareholder value.' "
All right, put this attitude toward workers as disposable together with "slash that net." Target people on welfare wholesale, take important aid programs from immigrants, legal or not, put Medicare on the cutting board and hint that Social Security will be next. Reduce money for narcotics therapy, summertime jobs for youngsters, health care and other parts of the net created over the last five decades. Cut very deep, very fast.
Inevitably Americans who find themselves poorer or more frightened, with nothing between them and the ground, will look to business, a big beneficiary and supporter of the cuts, to erect a new net.
Too bad for them. Mr. Rohatyn warns that it won't work, that being the social safety net of last resort is government's business, which makes two of us.
So: If they destroy too much of the government safety net, Republicans will be loading business down with a job it cannot do, with working-class expectations it does not want to meet and cannot.
As a bleeding-heart conservative, I believe that will be not only the prescription for class struggle but the beginning of its reality.
Class struggle does not automatically bring revolution -- real, not sound-bite. But in 1932, President Roosevelt understood the danger of economic class struggle, and moved to overcome it and save capitalism. Left unrecognized or ignored, class struggle creates divisions that can undermine society -- any society.

Nucor Cuts Some Steel Prices, Hurting Stocks

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
The stocks of steel-producing companies were hammered yesterday after the Nucor Corporation, the nation's largest mini-mill operator, announced that it was cutting the price of some of its lower-grade products by $20 a ton, or about 5 percent.
The action came at a time other steel companies are trying to raise prices for a second time this year. Consequently, some analysts concluded that the industry was close to the price peak for some grades of steel in this economic cycle. Eased demand and new mills' entering the market will lead to lower prices in the future, they say. 
 Nucor's announcement sent the company's shares down $2.125 to close at $51.75. Other steel stocks also declined on the New York Stock Exchange, erasing the gains they recorded last week when the U.S. Steel subsidiary of the USX Corporation said it was planning to raise prices $15 to $30 a ton, effective July 2.
USX was down $1.375, closing at $30.75; Bethlehem Steel lost 37.5 cents to close at $14.625; the LTV Corporation declined 37.5 cents, closing at $14.50; Inland Steel Industries was down $1.25, closing at $24.75, and National Steel lost 50 cents, closing at $16.125 a share.
The Nucor announcement, which is effective immediately, involves hot-rolled steel, a lower-quality steel that is generally used in construction, pipelines and farm machinery. It is not clear what effect the Nucor price cut will have on higher grades of steel, like the cold-rolled and coated sheets that go into automobiles and appliances.
Nucor officials said they were cutting the price of hot-rolled sheets to $370 a ton from $390 a ton because of weakened demand and price discounting by competitors. In addition, many customers stocked up on hot-rolled steel in advance of a 5 percent increase on Jan 1, analysts said.
"I think that it is an indication that we have hit a peak in hot-rolled," said Michael F. Gambardella, a steel analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities. "But there may still be some upward room on cold-rolled and coated."
Mr. Gambardella said that when competitors disagreed over what the market would bear for their products, it was a signal that the upper limit on prices had been reached. Last week, U.S. Steel announced increases of $15 a ton for hot-rolled steel, $20 a ton on cold-rolled and $30 a ton on steel with an additional coating like zinc galvanizing. Its announcement was quickly followed by other companies' increases.
Nucor, as a mini-mill operator using steel scrap as a raw material, has more flexibility to adjust prices to keep its mills humming than the integrated producers that refine iron ore into steel before forming it into products.
Nucor was the first of the mini-mill operators to venture into the market for steel sheet, which is more difficult to make than the low-value reinforcing bars and light structural shapes that were the mini-mill industry's foundation. Inspired by Nucor's success, nearly a dozen new mills have been announced or begun, which will increase the supply of sheet steel toward the end of the decade.
This could hold down the prices steelmakers can command from customers, analysts say.

What They Aren't Saying About Jordan

BYLINE: By DAVE ANDERSON 

 BODY:
EVER since Michael Jordan moved onto the runway for takeoff, just about everybody in the National Basketball Association except the ballboys have been asked for their thoughts on the return of His Higher and Higherness. But none dared to finish the sentence with what they were really thinking.
Pat Riley said, "It obviously puts a big impact on, and changes the thinking of, who can and cannot win." But the Knicks' coach, aware of a possible opening-round playoff pairing with the Bulls, didn't dare say, "I know we can't win now." 
 Phil Jackson said: "With the strike and all, I think you have to say that Michael did not fail baseball. Baseball failed Michael." But the Bulls' coach didn't dare say, "I know he couldn't hit the curveball, but hey, I've got to coach him now."
David Stern said, "It's wonderful." But the N.B.A. commissioner, always conscious of pro basketball's image, didn't dare say, "It's more than wonderful because Michael's comeback upstaged the reaction to The Wall Street Journal story about cocaine possibly being a factor in Reggie Lewis's death."
Spike Lee said: "We've got something for Michael's butt. We'll put Anthony Mason on him." But the filmmaker in Madison Square Garden's front row didn't dare say, "I'll be on him, too."
Horace Grant said, "I think opposing teams hoped Michael would stay in retirement." But the Magic power forward, once Jordan's teammate on the Bulls' three-peat champions, didn't dare say, "The Bulls still don't have a power forward to do what I did."
Larry Brown said: "The Bulls will win the championship now. Michael is simply the best." But the Pacers' coach didn't dare say, "If the Bulls think that, it'll put more pressure on them and take some of the pressure off us to get to the Eastern final."
Scottie Pippen said, "I'll be happy to have any of my teammates back." But the Bulls' forward didn't dare say, "I don't have to take the big shot anymore because Michael will be taking it."
Gene Lamont said: "Michael had improved a lot as a baseball player. He had to keep improving, but I will say this: he improved more than I dreamed he would." But the White Sox manager didn't dare say: "I work for Jerry Reinsdorf, too. I'm not going to knock Michael as a baseball player."
Charles Barkley said, "Even with Michael, I don't think the Bulls can win three playoff series in the East." But the Suns' forward didn't dare say: "That's wishful thinking. If the Bulls win the East and we win the West, we'd have to beat them in the finals, which we couldn't do two years ago."
Patrick Ewing said, "It just makes one more challenge we'll have to face." But the Knicks' center didn't dare say, "One more challenge I wish we didn't have to face."
Johnny Bach said: "He has to try to return as the greatest player in the game. He was the top scorer. He was the top player. He won three championships. What else could he do? I would rather people remember him as who he was rather than who he is or who he will be." But the Hornets' assistant coach, once the Bulls' defensive coach during their three-peat reign, didn't dare say: "When we play the Bulls in Chicago on April 22 and maybe in the playoffs, I'll have to come up with defenses for him. He'll ruin my reputation."
Will Perdue said, "Just to be able to play with Michael is fun, just to be able to watch him." But the Bulls' center didn't dare say: "Just pass him the ball. That's all I have to do now."
Rudy Tomjanovich said, "If Michael can pull it off, it will be one of the great sports stories, but if it doesn't work, it takes away the clean ending of his career." But the Rockets' coach didn't dare say, "I'm just glad he wasn't around a year ago or we wouldn't be the defending champions."
Bill Clinton said, "The economy has produced 6.1 million jobs since I became President and if Michael Jordan comes back to the Bulls, it will be 6,100,001 jobs." But the President didn't dare say: "Ooops, I forgot to subtract the baseball job he had. I guess it's still 6.1 million jobs."
And after shooting 7 for 28 in his Sunday return, Michael Jordan said, "My timing was off." He didn't dare say that, as sport's "replacement player" for the entire industry of baseball, his timing was perfect.

HEADLINE: Use of Balloons to Unclog Arteries Soars Among the Very Old

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, March 20

 BODY:
The use of angioplasty, in which a balloon is inflated to open clogged arteries, is growing at an explosive rate among elderly Americans, some of them nearly 100 years old. Researchers say this is happening even though these patients face a much greater risk of death and complications than younger ones.
With little fanfare, the procedure has rapidly evolved from a technique reserved for the relatively young and fit to one increasingly being done on people in their 80's and 90's, according to a study made public today. 
 The change is attributed in part to better instruments that give doctors the confidence to try this approach on patients who are at greater risk. But it also raises questions about whether such costly and invasive techniques make sense, either for the elderly or as a way to use health care dollars.
Dr. James G. Jollis and his colleagues from Duke University analyzed Medicare records from 1987 to 1992 and found that the use of angioplasty in men and women over 80 had nearly quadrupled. These elderly patients are three times as likely as people in their late 60's to die in the hospital from the procedure.
In all, about 5 percent of the 420,000 angioplasties performed each year are done on people in their 80's and beyond. During the years studied, eight angioplasty patients were 98 or older.
"It is a major change," Dr. Jollis said. Until recent years, he said, "it was rarely done on somebody in their 80's."
About 20 percent of people over 80 have coronary artery disease. The disorder can cause chest pain called angina. Doctors routinely try to control the pain with medicine, but this can be especially difficult in old people, who are more likely to experience dizziness and other side effects.
When drugs fail, doctors may offer two choices: angioplasty or coronary bypass surgery. Bypass operations, which often have longer-lasting results than angioplasty, involve using pieces of blood vessel to detour blood around the blockages.
Earlier work by the Duke researchers showed that the number of bypass operations had also surged among the elderly. These are some of their findings:
*In 1987, doctors in this country performed 3,050 angioplasties and 4,534 bypasses on people over 80. By 1992, this had grown to 11,490 angioplasties and 9,979 bypasses.
*Seven percent of these angioplasty patients died in the hospital, compared with 2 percent of patients from 65 to 69. Death rates after bypass surgery were 11 percent for those over 80 and 4 percent for the younger patients.
*One year after angioplasty, 16 percent of the older group had died, as against 5 percent of those who got the procedure in their late 60's. By comparison, 18 percent of bypass patients over 80 had died, as against 8 percent of the younger group.
Dr. Bruce Brundage, chief of cardiology at Harbor-U.C.L.A. Medical Center in Torrance, Calif., defended the trend toward angioplasty in the very old. "Older people are a lot healthier than a generation ago or a decade ago," he said. "They expect us to push the envelope and not deny them treatment based on chronological age."
Routine angioplasty typically costs $15,000 to $20,000. Whether such large amounts should routinely be spent on those who at best have only a few years to live is one of the most difficult questions in medicine.
While economists weigh the cost to the health care system of such modest benefits, doctors seldom consider costs when making treatment decisions. Nor do the patients themselves. "From the patient's perspective, there is no amount of resources that is too much," Dr. Jollis said.
Dr. Daniel Ullyot of the University of California at San Francisco, said he worried whether doctors always considered elderly patients' best interests when offering such care.
"Are we imposing technology on people?" he asked. Then, referring to a blockage in the heart's arteries, he asked, "Do we care more about the patient or the lesion?"

HEADLINE: Parkland Route of Pan-American Highway Sets Off Storm

DATELINE: LOS KATIOS NATIONAL PARK, Colombia

 BODY:
A NEW effort by Colombia to complete the Pan-American Highway as part of an economic development program has reopened a longstanding conflict with local residents and environmentalists.
The 16,000-mile highway was conceived at the International Conference of American States in 1923 to provide an uninterrupted roadway from Argentina to Alaska. It is complete except for a 70-mile stretch that crosses two national parks, one on either side of the Colombia-Panama border. 
 As currently planned, the highway would cross the southwestern tip of the 172,800-acre Los Katios National Park and some private land in Colombia, and run through the middle of the 1.3-million-acre Darien National Park in Panama.
The Colombian Government, seeking to modernize the economy and develop free-trade pacts and foreign investment, has embarked on a $6 billion, four-year plan to improve the road system. But preservation groups object to completing the highway through Los Katios, and even the Government's Environment Ministry opposes the plan.
"I think it is outrageous that in this day and age there is still no road to connect the Americas," Juan Gomez, the Transportation Minister, said in a recent interview. "I am going to keep pressing the issue because it is a necessity. To say it can't be done is easy. We have to say, let's find a way for the road to be built without damaging the environment."
The Government is planning a two-year, $1 million study of the environmental impact of the road before it makes a final decision.
The residents of Puente America, one of the many poor fishing hamlets that border Los Katios, say the road will destroy their pastures but will bring no benefits to them.
"We need someone to explain to us what advantages and disadvantages the road will bring," said Juvenal Cuesta, a 50-year-old farmer. "Before polluting us, the Government should find a source of jobs for our children."
The Government predicts that the highway would cost $118 million to complete, $85 million for the difficult construction, some of it over swampland, through the 34 miles on the Colombian side of the border. Panama has agreed to complete its part but faces the same conflicts.
Mr. Gomez has proposed adding a research center and a corps of trained guards to protect both parks. Environmentalists dismiss this suggestion.
"Who is going to stop the deforestation once the highway is built?" asks Claudia Leal, a researcher at the Bio-Pacific Project, an internationally backed center overseen by the Environmental Ministry. "That is impossible."
The Bio-Pacific Project has studied a 23-mile stretch of the highway that ends 20 miles from the park and was the most recent segment completed, in 1983. It found that by 1992, 60 percent of the forest on both sides of the road had been lost.
Environmentalists worry about other threats to the park.
The area has had a heavy influx of settlers over the last 30 years, and there is illegal logging in areas outside of the park. The border has also become a route for drug traffickers, smugglers and Colombian guerrillas.
Irenio Doria, 61, a farmer who supported building the nearby stretch of highway, objects to completing the highway across Los Katios. Mr. Doria moved to the area 30 years ago and cleared 240 acres of land for farming.
"I moved here because of the promise of the new road," he said of the part completed earlier. "Transportation is easier now, but if the rest of the highway were built, big business would come and buy us out. It would bring more problems, more violence and more crime."

All Too Human Comedy On a Midwest Campus

MOO
By Jane Smiley
414 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $24.
Some writers -- the hedgehogs of the literary world, as it were -- spend their entire careers amplifying a single vision and working improvisations upon a single voice. Others are more foxlike in their approach, pushing their talents in as many directions as possible, continually reinventing their styles and continually looking for new subjects. Among contemporary novelists, Philip Roth has been a willful fox, while John Cheever was more of a hedgehog. As for John Updike and Norman Mailer, they have occasionally tried -- with varying success -- to shed their hedgehog natures and embrace a more foxlike demeanor. 
 As her last couple of books attest, Jane Smiley is most definitely a fox. Having tackled the mystery story ("Duplicate Keys") and the family melodrama ("Barn Blind") during her apprenticeship, she has moved on to write several masterly novellas about the perils and imperatives of love ("The Age of Grief" and "Ordinary Love and Good Will"), a vast folkloric epic about a distant civilization ("The Greenlanders") and a dense, mythic tale of familial loyalty and resentment set in the American heartland ("A Thousand Acres").
Whereas "A Thousand Acres" rigidly used "King Lear" as its model -- resulting in a rather pretentious, overblown tale that often lapsed into phony, archaic language -- Ms. Smiley's latest novel, "Moo," works some wonderfully loose variations upon the Shakespearean comedy to produce an uproariously funny and at the same time hauntingly melancholy portrait of a college community in the Midwest. Like traditional comedies, Ms. Smiley's story begins with an assortment of individuals in disarray, pushes them into a realm of even greater confusion and ends with at least a glimpse of a transformative new order.
In its opening pages, "Moo" looks as though it's going to become a David Lodge-like satire of academe. Ms. Smiley deftly paints the portrait of a sprawling Midwestern agricultural college (nicknamed "Moo U") that's reeling from a series of recent financial cutbacks, and she introduces us to a Dickensian cast of teachers, administrators, students and eccentric hangers-on. There's Timothy Monahan, an ambitious and wondrously self-absorbed novelist, who, unable to win an appointment at a more prestigious university, sheepishly teaches writing to the benighted students of Moo U. There's Dr. Lionel Gift, a professor of economics and self-congratulatory booster of capitalism, who spends his free time buying land in Costa Rica and making deals with unsavory politicians; and Dr. Gift's nemesis, Chairman X, an unrepentant Marxist and ardent pamphleteer who ostensibly presides over the school's horticulture department.
We also meet Mrs. Walker, a formidable secretary who uses her access to computer files to manipulate university affairs; Keri Donaldson, a pretty student who looks like a Barbie doll and worries that people will discover that she was a Warren County Pork Queen; and Loren Stroop, a local farmer and first-class paranoiac, who approaches the university about an invention he believes will revolutionize agriculture around the world.
But while Ms. Smiley uses these people to gently send up some of the current trends in higher education -- including political correctness, multicultural studies and deconstruction -- she turns out to be less interested in social satire, as such, than in the simple spectacle of ordinary human beings succumbing to greed, power, hope, envy and love.
Indeed, "Moo" revolves around a series of romances and obsessions that will have lasting repercussions for both the participants and the school at large. Diane, an energetically ambitious management student, we learn, is sleeping with Bob, who's preccupied with his student-aid assignment: a 700-pound hog named Earl, who is the centerpiece of a secret study of hog behavior and potential. Prof. Helen Levy is sleeping with the provost, Ivar Harstad, but reluctant to marry him, while Ivar's twin brother, Nils, has decided to marry a middle-aged kitchen worker named Marly and use artificial fertilization procedures to guarantee them the large family he wants.
We also learn that Tim Monahan has been dating Cecelia Sanchez, who has become infatuated with Chairman X, who has become obsessed with Lionel Gift's involvement in a plan to destroy a rain forest in Central America. That plan, it turns out, has been masterminded by one Arlen Martin, a billionaire chicken entrepreneur turned business mogul, who appears to hold the university's financial future in his hands, and who is depicted by Ms. Smiley as a nefarious combination of Ross Perot and Frank Perdue.
Juggling dozens of storylines and a multitudinous cast with consummate ease, Ms. Smiley does a deft job of conjuring up Moo U. and chronicling the plights and pleasures of its bumbling denizens. But while many of the goings-on that she depicts are hilarious -- from Tim's ham-handed efforts to ingratiate himself with the literary establishment to Bob's well-meaning attempts to empathize with Earl the hog -- there's a dark undertow of loss that links the novel with such earlier Smiley works as "The Age of Grief." Comical as the characters in "Moo" can be, they are also depicted as fallible, needy human beings, subject to all the perils of ordinary life. As a result, "Moo" is not only a delectably entertaining comedy, but also a comedy in the truest Chekhovian sense: sad, resonant and wise.

HEADLINE: Surviving and Disturbing in Moscow

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 20

 BODY:
Homeless people sleep in railway stations, Russian Air Force jets blitz the rebel republic of Chechnya, rich gangsters and corrupt politicians poison the free market, inflation has turned old people into paupers, and the country's most popular television personality was recently gunned down by unknown assassins in his apartment stairwell in what many Russians suspect was a government-led conspiracy.
But Russia's best known and most successful movie director, Nikita S. Mikhalkov, chose to illustrate a different kind of terror in his latest film, "Burnt by the Sun." His is a lush, lyrical and ultimately horrifying portrait of how one happy, upper-class family living in the country in the summer of 1936 is destroyed by Stalinism. 
 The film, which was nominated for an Oscar this year as best foreign film, is about Russia's terrifying past.
Mr. Mikhalkov says it is intended as a warning to Russians complacent about the present. "The Old Bolsheviks told us we should forget everything that happened before 1917," the director said. "The new Bolsheviks are telling us to forget everything that happened after the Revolution." He was alluding sardonically to former party bosses like President Boris N. Yeltsin and politicians and tycoons who converted to democracy just in time to catch the wave of history.
Mr. Mikhalkov said his film, which opens in New York City on April 28, reminds Russians that "we were all responsible, that nobody was blameless.
"We all played a role in what happened in Russia."
He should know. The creator of such internationally acclaimed films as "Slave of Love" (1976) and "Oblomov," (1979), Mr. Mikhalkov is one of the very few directors of the Communist era who survived its collapse with his oeuvre and dignity intact. Talent, determination and a famous, well-connected father (who wrote the words to the Soviet national anthem) helped shield Mr. Mikhalkov from the censorship and persecution that forced other film makers to curb their careers or compromise shamefully with the Government.
He is not unaware of his own good fortune, but he is unembarrassed by it. "I was not a dissident," he said, "but I never joined the party. People used to ask me how could I work. I worked, but I never made deals. I managed to make my films the way I wanted." As a film maker, he said, he avoided addressing political issues but alluded to them elliptically, focusing on the suffering of individuals helplessly caught up in the historical clashes of their time.
But Mr. Mikhalkov is decidedly political now. A nationalist, slavophile and advocate of a constitutional monarchy, he is the darling of the Russian conservative right and often appears on television to attack the Yeltsin administration.
The director has also rediscovered his aristocratic roots. A giant, framed genealogical chart tracing his lineage back to Tolstoy and Catherine the Great hangs over the couch in his office in Moscow. Gregorian chants played softly in his office as he spoke. "I am not a counterrevolutionary," he said. "I consider myself an enlightened conservative, an evolutionist."
It is not a view he could have expressed openly 10 years ago.
But even his early films never hid his romantic fascination with prerevolutionary Russia or his love affair with dreamy, sun-dappled afternoons in the Russian countryside. His characters have always been delicate, genteel and Chekhovian. He even loosely adapted a Chekhov play, "Platonov," for his acclaimed 1977 film, "An Unfinished Piece for Player Piano."
The main characters in "Burnt by the Sun" are similarly serene, gentle people living out their days in pastoral bliss. But in this film, the once unspoken horrors of the Soviet system are played out. The young wife is a member of the intelligentsia; her husband, played by Mr. Mikhalkov himself, is a civil war hero and Soviet commissar who wrongly believes that his personal friendship with Stalin will protect him from the purges that have decimated the rest of his world.
The film ends with an epilogue saying that the movie is based on the story of real people. It isn't. Mr. Mikhalkov said he added the epilogue for dramatic effect and invented the characters himself. They are not unlike members of his own family, with one difference. Unlike the main characters in "Burnt by the Sun," Mr. Mikhalkov's parents survived totalitarianism and witnessed its defeat.
Mr. Mikhalkov's family is one of the most prominent in Russia. It also mirrored the deep divisions in Soviet society. His mother, descended from the aristocracy, was an essayist and the great-granddaughter of one of Russia's most famous painters, Vasily Surikov. His father's brother was taken prisoner in Germany in World War II but escaped, only to be sent to the Gulag upon his return. But his father, Sergei Mikhalkov, a poet and author of children's books, sided with the Communists. In addition to writing the words to the national anthem, he was the head of the Soviet Writers Union.
Mr. Mikhalkov aligns himself with his mother's branch of the family. Insisting that today's leaders are no better than and no different from Communist rulers, he said: "The new people are still the old people, they merely sit in new seats. They don't say: 'Forgive us. We were wrong. We will go quietly.' " Flinging his arm in the direction of his ancestral chart, he exclaimed, "They don't call to those who were sent away: 'Come back! You are the true culture.' " He paused, then added, "No, they held on to their seats in power."
But the director was never an outcast; he lived a relatively pampered life as part of the approved intelligentsia, a star of Soviet cinema who never had to pledge his allegiance to the state.
Mr. Mikhalkov said he did not invent the gauzy, lyrical images that enrich his films: little girls in white dresses gamboling in leafy arbors as ladies in white gowns play Chopin inside the dacha and sip tea.
"I knew that life," he said. "I lived it. It was my childhood." He was 8 when Stalin died. "It was a time of terror, but it's not true that everything was repressed -- the core of the country survived."
Mr. Mikhalkov's older brother, Andrei Mikhalkov-Konchalovsky, is also a respected director, the creator of the epic "Siberiade," who chose to emigrate and work in the West. There is tension in their life choices, if not in their personal relationship.
Mr. Konchalovsky went to Hollywood and directed at least one unfortunate action-adventure film, "Tango and Cash," starring Sylvester Stallone. In 1992 Mr. Mikhalkov made a film set in Mongolia and called "Close to Eden," which darkly satirizes the invasion of Western materialism and junk culture, with Sylvester Stallone as the ultimate insult.
At the time, Mr. Konchalovsky told The New York Times: "We represent two different trends in Russian development of the last several centuries. I am a Westerner and more cosmopolitan, and Nikita is a nationalist, more a slavophile. I am more rational; he is very emotional, and that makes him impassioned and intolerant, as real Russians are."
Mr. Konchalovsky returned to Russia last year. But his career has not matched his brother's. His recent films have been poorly received.
Mr. Mikhalkov's talent and luck have held. Despite the chaos and corruption in the Russian movie business, he has little difficulty with financing and distribution. He has his own production company, and his films have been critical and commercial successes in Russia and abroad.
Though he says he would never make a Hollywood film ("What for? I would have to do what everyone else is doing"), Mr. Mikhalkov is at ease in the West. In 1987 he made "Dark Eyes," an international production that starred Marcello Mastroianni. When in the United States, he hobnobs with Jack Nicholson and Robert De Niro. His study is lined with photographs of Boris Pasternak and Arseny Tarkovsky, but also Charlton Heston and Gina Lollobrigida.
As a three-time Oscar nominee, he has mastered the delicate art of deprecating pre-Oscar jitters. "I'm quite calm," he said with a big smile. "If I lose, I will be the only Russian director ever to have been nominated three times and lose each time -- something for the record books."

HEADLINE: Despite Reductions in Exposure, Lead Remains Danger to Children

SERIES: Tomorrow in Personal Health: How to guard against lead exposure.

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY 

 BODY:
THANKS to bans on lead in gasoline, indoor house paint and cans that hold food, enormous progress has been made in recent decades in ridding the environment of lead and preventing symptomatic lead poisoning in children. Even in the worst of the nation's slums, it is rare to see children who are obviously suffering from the toxic effects of lead.
Even the incidence of so-called silent lead poisoning -- the low levels that have hidden effects on the developing brain -- has dropped precipitously. Since 1969, more refined studies of lead's effects on children's neurological development have prompted changes in the definition of lead poisoning, from 60 micrograms per deciliter of blood to 10 micrograms in 1991. The percentage of preschool children with that lower level has plummeted from 88 percent to 9 percent. 
 Yet new studies suggest that despite the promulgation in 1991 of a Federal plan to reduce to almost zero the amount of lead that can enter the bodies of unborn and young children, an estimated three million preschool-age American children currently harbor more than 10 micrograms of lead.
Dr. John Rosen, a specialist in the pediatric effects of lead at Albert Einstein School of Medicine in the Bronx, says the highest prevalence of silent lead poisoning occurs in African-American children aged 1 to 5 who live in large cities and whose families have marginal incomes. One-third of these children have hazardous amounts of lead in their blood, while 17 percent of Hispanic American children and only 6 percent of white children living under similar circumstances have the same levels. The reasons for these differences are not known, but they could reflect genetic or environmental differences in how lead is absorbed and stored in the body, Dr. Rosen said.
For example, studies in both humans and animals have shown that a diet low in iron and calcium and possibly protein increases the body's absorption and retention of lead, while a diet rich in these nutrients protects against lead buildup.
Despite the preponderance of evidence that low levels of lead can harm the brains of young children, silent lead poisoning remains a controversial issue. Some studies have found little or no effect of low lead levels on I.Q. or development. Methods of measuring lead and its effects differ in various studies and could account for the different results, some researchers believe.
"If there were no effect of lead on children's I.Q.'s, one would expect about 1 study in 20 to report an association on the basis of chance," wrote Dr. Herbert L. Needleman of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in an editorial in the journal Pediatrics. Dr. Needleman, who has been studying lead's effects on children for two decades, added, "In fact, more than half of the published studies show an effect" that is statistically significant.
And while I.Q. does not necessarily determine a child's success in school or in life, Dr. Rosen and others point out that the particular sections of the I.Q. test most affected by lead can result in difficulties with reading, writing, spelling, mathematics, concentration, memory and language development.
The United States Public Health Service has called lead the most serious environmental hazard to young children and, along with the American Academy of Pediatrics, has recommended that all children under 6 years old be tested for lead.
Most large studies that have been following the effects of lead on child development for years continue to show that children who are already at risk of academic failure are most likely to suffer costly consequences. For example, newly published findings suggest that lead damage to children's developing brains could make the difference between their being on the low end of normal intelligence and dropping below normal. The result, according to a report published in the current issue of the journal Epidemiology, could be a tripling of the number of youngsters who need special education.
The study, begun in 1979 and widely considered one of the best examinations of the effects of low lead levels, is following more than 700 infants born in or near the lead smelting town of Port Pirie in Australia. When the children reached 7 years old, the researchers reported, the functions most affected by low-level lead exposure were visual-motor abilities. Such deficits could hamper a child's ability to read, write and solve math problems by interfering with the brain mechanisms involved in recognizing and copying shapes, visualizing objects in space and forming nonverbal concepts. A similar finding was reported several years ago among 4-year-olds in an ongoing study in Cincinnati.
Even in families that are well educated and financially secure, where lead levels are generally lowest and children are best able to compensate for the small declines in cognitive abilities, the effects of lead are notable. In a continuing study of 170 children from middle- and upper-middle-class families in Boston, Dr. David Bellinger and his colleagues found significant signs of lasting brain damage in children from low-risk environments. For every 10 micrograms of blood lead above the 10-microgram danger level measured when the children were 2 years old, there was a 5.8-point decline in overall I.Q. and an 8.9-point decline in achievement test scores by age 10.
Dr. Bellinger, a psychologist and epidemiologist at Children's Hospital and an associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School, said the findings strongly suggest that the cognitive losses associated with lead are permanent and that the decline in academic achievement is more serious than can be explained simply by the loss of I.Q. points. He added that some studies have found that among children from lower socioeconomic groups, "there is an even steeper loss in I.Q. or academic performance" associated with low-level lead exposure.
"We infer from these findings that lead affects aspects of neuropsychological development that are not measured by I.Q. tests," Dr. Bellinger said in an interview. "If, for example, a child has trouble carrying out fine motor skills, he might have trouble taking tests in school because he has to concentrate so hard on the act of writing that he has difficulty focusing on what he wants to say."
In the Port Pirie study, general environmental contamination from lead smelting operations is the primary source of lead exposure. In the United States, however, children are most commonly exposed to lead that contaminates dust in homes built before 1978, when a ban on leaded indoor paint took effect. The paint on windows, doors, ceilings and walls painted before the ban could contain as much as 50 percent lead, which can enter the child's environment as a result of friction, for example, when windows and doors are opened and closed, and from flaking of loose paint.
"Leaded paint in residential housing continues to be the overwhelming source of lead poisoning in children, accounting for 99.9 percent of cases we see," Dr. Rosen said in an interview.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta estimated conservatively that above the costs of removing lead from children's homes, the nation would come out ahead by $28 billion through the reduced need for medical care and special education and the increase in wages that typically accompanies a high I.Q.
Not included in the estimate were potential savings from a reduction in juvenile delinquency and, in adults, the costs of treating high blood pressure and heart disease, which can result from long-term exposure to low levels of lead. For example, a study directed by William G. Sciarillo, executive director of the Association for the Care of Children's Health in Bethesda, Md., revealed that African-American children in Baltimore with blood lead levels of 15 micrograms or higher scored significantly higher on a measure of problem behaviors than comparable children with lead levels below 15 micrograms. The finding "lends support to a belief that undue lead exposure in early childhood may have a pervasive influence on the prevalence of juvenile delinquency in this country," Dr. Sciarillo and his colleagues wrote in The American Journal of Public Health in 1992.
Furthermore, there are emerging indications that no amount of lead is safe for a child. In an analysis published last July in Environmental Research, Dr. Joel Schwartz, an epidemiologist and statistician at the Harvard School of Public Health, found evidence that lead exposure could be harmful at levels as low as 2 micrograms per deciliter of blood.
Still, Dr. Claire B. Ernhart, who does research on child development at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine in Cleveland, questions whether lead is to blame for falling academic performance and rising behavioral problems among young children, particularly those from inner cities. Dr. Ernhart, who has conducted research sponsored by the lead industry and has testified on the industry's behalf, points out that most adults in this country grew up exposed to far higher lead levels than are a cause for concern today.
There are also researchers who maintain that lead is insignificant compared with other factors that can adversely affect intelligence. In a recently published review of 26 epidemiological studies conducted since 1979, Stuart J. Pocock, a medical statistician at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Marjorie Smith of the Institute of Education in London, and Dr. Peter Baghurst, the principal investigator in the Port Pirie study, concluded that "uncertainty remains as to the real impact that lead makes on children's neuropsychological development."
Writing in The British Medical Journal last November, the authors of the review said that other explanations for observed lead-related deficits in I.Q. should be explored, such as a tendency of children with low intelligence to do things that cause them to have relatively high lead levels, like eat paint chips, and that higher priority should be given to other social factors known to impair child development.
In an editorial in The American Journal of Diseases of Children, Dr. Ernhart and Dr. James W. Sayre of Family Health Associates of St. Mary's Hospital in Rochester, N.Y., maintained that rather than undertaking major investments in lead abatement, available resources would better improve the health of children if they were used to provide prenatal care for all pregnant women, vaccinate all children and enroll all eligible children in Head Start.
Dr. Rosen, however, views such skepticism about the value of controlling lead exposure as "politically and economically motivated" and not firmly grounded in scientific observation. "Some researchers have their own agenda, and it's not public health or the health of kids," he said.

HEADLINE: Where Sputnik Once Soared Into History, Hard Times Take Hold

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER 

DATELINE: BAIKONUR SPACE CENTER, Kazakhstan

 BODY:
THIS is the desolate, enormous cosmodrome where Russian space flight was born, where it produced many of its most stunning achievements, and where it has clearly begun to die.
When the astronaut Norman E. Thagard became the first American to soar into orbit on a Russian rocket last week, it was a historic moment for both Russia and the United States. But in many ways it has also served to publicize the deep flaws in the Russian space program, which just five years ago seemed an almost invincible symbol of Soviet power and pride. 
 A lot has happened here in five years, and almost none of it has been good for the space program. Baikonur, where Sputnik was launched and where in 1961 Yuri A. Gagarin became the first man to leave the earth, has become more a museum -- a mausoleum actually -- than a rocket center. Located in the land-locked middle of the former Soviet Union, the huge base, which is almost 10 times the size of the Kennedy Space Center, now has to be rented by Russia from another country.
The world's largest and most powerful rockets -- two 170-million-horsepower, 20-story Energiyas -- sit here in a cavernous building whose many platforms and staircases are covered with bird droppings and loose feathers. Fifty yards away, boosters powerful enough to launch space shuttles are covered with plastic, waiting to be used by a country that cannot possibly afford to launch them.
"If you could just help us find some rich guys to pay for them," said Grigory Sonis, the space center's chief engineer, "I know we could send them up."
But the Energiya is not the only rocket sitting idle on the vast, dusty plains. In another building nearby, two Burans, the Russian version of the space shuttle, built at a cost of $29 billion and used in only a single flight, sit like exhibits at the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum.
"People wonder whether these rockets will ever fly," said Nina Osimova, the 47-year-old chief engineer of the Energiya program. "I know they won't. I have spent 20 years on this program. There were years when I thought about nothing else. But it is all over now. I have cried away all my tears. Life has passed us by."
It is a painful assessment, but one that may be accurate. The day before last week's launching almost nobody was working in the seven-story building where technicians assemble and test rockets. Space officials say they are going to send 25,000 of the center's 40,000 employees back to Russia in the coming year. In the last three years, the population of Leninsk, the town where the employees live, has fallen to 50,000 from 100,000. It would drop more if people here had any place else to go.
Officially, Russia says the Energiya rockets would be the most obvious choice to send a large payload to the permanently orbiting space station that it and at least a dozen other partners, including the United States, plan to construct between 1997 and 2002. And officially, they are right.
But official pronouncements are made mostly to save face here, in a town where workers rioted a few years ago over their deteriorating living conditions and from which so many gifted engineers have already fled. Many apartment buildings are vacant, filled with broken glass and shattered dreams.
If three years from now Energiya rockets are used to send a payload into space, they will have remained idle in their mammoth storage halls for nearly a decade. Every one of hundreds of valves will need to be replaced or checked. The stakes -- a launching to the most important space mission since men landed on the moon -- will be enormous.
It would take only a few launchings of the Energiya to ferry enough material to assemble an entire space station, as compared to more than 30 shuttle flights that would be necessary if the United States relied solely on its own technology. Since each shuttle flight costs at least $1 billion, that would save any space station project about $25 billion dollars.
All space agencies have serious money problems these days, and resurrecting the Energiya is a seductive possibility, not only because the rockets are so powerful, but because of the enormous savings it could bring. Yet the Energiya's reliability is not entirely certain. "They certainly have the power to be used effectively," said a senior NASA official who traveled here for the launching of the Mir 18 mission last week. "But could we rely on rockets built a decade ago not to fail? Would it be politically possible in the United States? Well, I just don't think so."
It is that presumption that makes many of those who follow the increasingly public and commercial world of space exploration wonder whether Russia can possibly keep up its end of the bargain with the United States. The trip to Mir, Russia's aging, cramped space station, is only the first stage in the process that would end in a completely new station in less than a decade.
America needs to rely on the Russian knowledge gained from astronauts who have spent months at a time in space. Russia has more experience in sustained manned space flight than any other country. Russian engineers also have experience in designing a space station, although the United States Congress has seemed reluctant to permit the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to share that chore with the Russians. And Russian science -- in space and on the ground -- is clearly at a crossroads. Technology here can no longer compare with that in Europe, Japan or the United States. Money is so tight that the Russian space agency cannot even afford to purify the water in the isolation quarters routinely used by astronauts just before launchings.
There is a big sign on the wall of the building that warns all who enter not to drink the water. Some ask whether a country where the launching pads are rusted over at its premier space facility and where bottled water is a must for visitors can be trusted to put together the engine of mankind's most ambitious space quests, like the new station or a mission to Mars.
Others say the answer is probably yes, because technicians and engineers here still know what they are doing. Russian technicians, in most fields, make things work. They do not have the equipment, money or even training that they used to have. But they have the ability to solve problems. Launchings here, even now, are rarely delayed and they have a high success rate compared with any other country, including the United States. The Buran, on its one unmanned test flight, completed a perfect mission, landing less than three feet from where it was supposed to land.
But past success does not insure future financing, and space is a very costly place. Last month the head of the space subcommittee in Parliament said that the space program here would have to stop completely within two years if new sources of money were not found quickly. The United States is paying Russia $400 million for use of the Mir and for training connected with long trips there, and that money should help save the program. But it is not enough to make it prosper again.
"It would be sad, strange and confusing if the space program were folded in this country," said Yuri Koptev, the director of the Russian Space Agency. "Especially for those of us who have been concerned with these matters for dozens of years, but also for anyone in Russia, it would be demoralizing if our work suddenly ended and our accomplishments were denied."
This year the Russian space agency has been allocated less than $300 million dollars. By comparison the NASA budget is $14 billion this year. The trip to Baikonur last week was, for many NASA officials, a little like peeking at the Ghost of Christmas Future. They frequently point out that it does not take long to take the best space program in the world -- and its bountiful technological offspring -- and run it into the ground through bad financing, poor management or both.
At Baikonur, where no building has fresh paint, and hot water is sporadic even in the one special guest hotel, that message could not have been delivered more vividly. Last year financing for space projects in this country was less than 10 percent of the level of 1989. Because of the financial problems, the Russian Space Agency was forced to halt work completely on 34 of its 70 national projects. Most of those that continue are barely alive.
Increasingly, American officials worry that the necessary alliance with Russia may turn into a nightmare if political relations between the countries deteriorate, or the economy here worsens further.
"I worry that what has happened to their space program could conceivably happen to ours if people lose interest and people start lacking the will to fund it," said David Leestma, head of flight crew operations at NASA, and one of many who stared open-mouthed at the squalor here.
For Russia, which cannot stand to think of itself as anything less than a superpower, the relationship also has its problems. Already scientists here have begun to complain of providing little more than backup support for the United States on the planned space station. It will be in Houston, not in Kazakhstan or Moscow, that the controllers will sit for the station, named Alpha.
Russia does not really have a functioning legal system, so it will be hard to sort out who owns what if there are disputes. Space officials here realize that if not for American money there would be almost no money at all, so they have few choices open to them.
Yet it was not all that long ago that American scientists were calling the Mir space station a second Sputnik, arguing that its launching in 1987 -- and the 1986 explosion of the shuttle Challenger -- clearly put Russia out front in the space race.
"Things can change again," Mr. Sonis said. "We are not simply going to give up what we have done now. We are excellent space engineers and we certainly have lived through hard times before. We have come a long way as a nation and the hurdles we have to face may not even be as big as the ones we have already overcome."

HEADLINE: Forest Study Is First to Show Ozone Retards Growth of Trees

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
SCIENTISTS have determined for the first time that ground-level ozone retards the growth of at least one type of mature forest tree, a widespread timber species called the loblolly pine that contributes billions of dollars to the economy of the South.
Ozone in the stratosphere shields living organisms from harmful ultraviolet rays. But at ground level, where it is produced mainly by the combustion of gasoline in motor vehicles, ozone has long been known as a human health hazard. It has also been considered a significant threat to forests. Previous studies have found that when closed chambers containing tree seedlings are flooded with ozone, growth is hobbled. But there had been no definitive evidence that ozone in the real environment stunted mature trees. 
 Researchers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee have now provided this crucial evidence in a study published in the current issue of the journal Nature. The study was commissioned and financed by the Southern Global Change Program of the United States Forest Service.
Dr. Sandy McLaughlin, a physiological ecologist, and Dr. D. J. Downing, a statistician, studied changes in the stem circumference of 28 mature loblolly pines exposed to naturally varying levels of ozone under a wide range of temperature, rainfall and soil moisture conditions in eastern Tennessee from 1988 through 1992. The site, described by Dr. McLaughlin as typically rural, was within the forested buffer area around the Oak Ridge laboratory, about 25 miles west of Knoxville.
The researchers placed around each tree trunk a measuring device called a dendrometer, consisting of a metal band attached to a scale in such a way as to detect the expansion rate of the trunk. They also measured ozone levels. Readings were taken once or twice a week.
Using statistical techniques to separate the effects of ozone and other factors, they determined that ozone levels that frequently occur in the Eastern United States caused growth to slow. The effect was increased under drier soil conditions. When ozone levels were especially high, they found, some trees actually shrank.
"Ozone and drying conditions interact together to cause more slowing of growth than either one alone," said Dr. McLaughlin. This, he said, suggests that the ozone amplifies stress caused by lack of moisture. No mechanism through which this might happen has been identified by the research, but other studies have found that periodic episodes of high ozone increase the rate at which trees use water.
In the driest year of the study, 1988, the combined effect of high ozone levels and weather produced an average reduction in the growth rate of 13 percent compared with a low-ozone environment. In the wettest years, 1989 and 1992, there was virtually no reduction. The five-year average was a 5 percent reduction. The researchers calculated that in a five-year period of moderately dry soil conditions, the overall reduction would be three times as great as the average.
"We were very fortunate with the study," Dr. McLaughlin said. "We got a wide range of conditions." Weather conditions appeared to be the major factor determining whether a year was one of high or low ozone exposure: in years when storm systems moved through the area relatively infrequently, air stagnation made conditions drier and allowed ozone to build up. In 1988, the driest year and the one with the highest ozone concentrations, 27 of the 28 trees were adversely affected.
Trees varied in their sensitivity to the combination of ozone and drought stress. Generally speaking, said Dr. McLaughlin, they started showing adverse effects when the ozone concentration reached 40 parts per billion. This level is reached on most days in the Eastern United States, he said.
Loblolly pine is a major element in the ecology of much of the South, covering an estimated 60 million acres and contributing, through logging, an estimated $4.5 billion to the regional economy. Declines in loblolly growth were detected in the mid-1980's. Air pollution, especially ozone, was suggested but not proved as a possible cause.
Dr. McLaughlin said of the new study, "I don't think we should be taking this result and predicting forest growth losses across the region; we are saying the relationship of growth to ozone appears to be a real one and does involve some factors that could be important over the long run."
The findings might be particularly significant, the researchers wrote in Nature, if climatic changes as a result of rises in heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide materialize as predicted by global climate models. Some models predict warmer and drier conditions in the midlatitudes and this means "there is the potential for ozone problems to be increased by climate change in the future," said Dr. McLaughlin.
Climatologists generally agree that the models cannot predict the regional effects of climate change with much accuracy. Nevertheless, concentrations of both carbon dioxide and ozone as a result of the modern economy's dependence on fossil fuels like coal and oil are expected to increase globally, raising further questions and concerns about the interacting effect of climate change and pollution on many ecosystems, including forests.

PATAKI CUTS IMPERIL AID FOR MENTALLY ILL
Fifteen months ago, Senate Republicans, including George E. Pataki, spearheaded the passage of landmark legislation that was intended to revolutionize care for the mentally ill and reduce the number of sick, disoriented people living on the streets. Now, just as the first dollars have started to flow to local treatment programs, Governor Pataki has proposed repealing vital parts of the law and making large cuts in the very community programs that he and his fellow Republican senators had pressed Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to enact. A1.

The push to get New York City's firefighters ready to respond to medical emergencies has not gone smoothly.

HEADLINE: A Silver Lining To Base Loss?;
Bayonne Mayor Sees Boon

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

DATELINE: BAYONNE, N.J.

 BODY:
Soon after the Pentagon announced that it wanted to shut its marine terminal here, Mayor Leonard P. Kiczek was walking through the 437-acre site on the kind of tour that is customary for politicians who are trying to fend off military base closings. Such visits typically go like this: Attack the bigwigs in Washington. Bemoan the loss of jobs. Plead for the base's survival.
But Mr. Kiczek said none of that. He did not appear upset that the Army might pull out of the installation, which, with 2,445 workers, is the largest employer in Bayonne. As he roamed past docks that have sent tanks, trucks and other cargo to dozens of battle zones since World War II, he sounded more like a real estate agent than a bitter municipal official. 
 "Look at that!" he said as he neared New York Harbor, pointing to the Manhattan skyline. "It's gorgeous!"
In the days since the decision to close the terminal was made public on Feb. 28 as part of the latest round of military base cuts, Mr. Kiczek has taken on a most unusual role in the political theater that is often played out after these sentences are handed down: Let others crusade to save the base. The Mayor has his own ideas.
Mr. Kiczek (pronounced KIH-check) maintains that the base could provide more of an economic boost to this working-class city in Hudson County if it were closed and its land, potentially lucrative waterfront property that juts into New York Harbor, was turned over to commercial or residential interests.
He said that selling the base, which occupies 20 percent of Bayonne's land, could sharply increase the city's revenue from property taxes and supply just as many jobs, if not more. The Federal Government, the base's current owner, does not pay property taxes.
The Mayor also contended that efforts to save the base are probably futile anyway.
His position has infuriated some workers at the base, as well as other politicians in New Jersey, who say he is sabotaging their attempts to rescue it. Some of these officials have begun a whispering campaign against him, questioning whether he or his allies have anything to gain if the base, the Military Ocean Terminal, is sold. Mr. Kiczek said he was acting only in the interests of his city of 61,444 people.
Defense experts say that rarely has a local official voiced such maverick views since the Pentagon began shutting bases in the 1980's. That Mr. Kiczek feels comfortable in expressing them in the often-vitriolic debate over base closings may reflect not only the base's valuable location, but also an evolution in thinking about this issue in base communities around the country, they say.
Mr. Kiczek, 45, a first-term Democrat, emphasized that he was not happy that hundreds of Hudson County residents who work at the base may lose their jobs, and he said he would try to insure that both the Federal and local governments would help them find other jobs.
"Those who cried and tried to stop closings in the past by spending all their energies to fight instead of looking at the alternatives wound up with ghost towns," Mr. Kiczek said. "The whole base's operations have been whittling away for years. They could have easily just slipped away one day and we would have been far behind in trying to capture this asset."
He said he was not hindering a drive by officials like Representative Robert Menendez, a Democrat who represents Bayonne, to save the base, but he also noted that such efforts seldom succeed. Under the rules for base closings, which are intended to insulate the process from politics, the Defense Department makes a recommendation to a commission set up by Congress.
The panel then conducts hearings on those choices before settling on a final list of closings. The President and Congress must accept or reject the entire list. In the first two rounds of closings under this system, in 1991 and 1993, about 85 percent of the bases that the Defense Department asked to shut were endorsed by the commission, officials said.
In the current round, the commission has until July 1 to forward its final list to President Clinton, who then must decide whether to agree to it and bring it before Congress.
Though few local leaders elsewhere share Mr. Kiczek's views, it appears that in this round of cuts more are beginning to perceive that there is life after base closings, though they may be unwilling to say so because they fear paying a political price.
"There are more communities thinking long term, as well as fighting the short-term battles, than in the first two rounds," said Carol A. Lessure, an expert on base closings at the Defense Budget Project, a research organization in Washington. "Some of them are seeing that there might be some long-term benefits to having a base closure."
But officials like Mr. Menendez said it was foolish to give up on the Bayonne base, which pumps tens of millions of dollars into the economy of New Jersey every year. Mr. Menendez pointed out that if the base is shut, it might be years before it could be sold to private owners, and years after that before it could begin generating significant property taxes.
The hardship for those who are thrown out of work, he said, will be immediate. Of the 171 military and 2,274 civilian employees at the base, many would move south to Fort Monmouth in Monmouth County under the Pentagon's plans. The future is unclear for hundreds of others. The most threatened are 267 civilian workers in the Army Garrison, which handles support services at the base, officials said.
"We need the Mayor to send a clear, strong and unambiguous message that the base needs to be kept open," Mr. Menendez said. "Any other message damages our ability to win. If we don't succeed, we can then join efforts to economically revitalize the base."
Workers on the base also were critical. Chief John C. Erichsen, head of the 30-member fire department in the Army Garrison, said many of the firefighters believe that Mr. Kiczek does not understand how hard it would be to convert the base to civilian use. "If he thinks he can just sell the terminal to a private company, he doesn't know what goes on here," Chief Erichsen said.
Mr. Menendez said he was trying to convince the base commission that the Pentagon's proposal to move its operations in Bayonne to private terminals on New York Harbor was not feasible. For example, the private terminals may not have the capacity for extra cargo, particularly during wartime, he said.
But Brig. Gen. Boyd E. King, the base commander, said the Army used private terminals up and down the East Coast to transport its cargo, and rarely ran into difficulties. And he said the Army already shipped large amounts of cargo through private terminals on New York Harbor.
Mr. Kiczek said he had already received inquiries from companies that would like to operate the dormant drydock on the base, which is used to repair large ships. The United States Coast Guard has expressed interest in a small part of the base, and the Navy is considering whether to keep its 500 or so workers there even if the Army, which runs the base, leaves.
Mr. Kiczek, who in the 1960's delivered fast-food chicken to soldiers on the base, said he was sorry that so many lives might be disrupted by the Pentagon's move. But he said he was determined to learn from the lessons of other cities that had faced these closings.
"You have to just step back and look at what happened throughout the entire country," he said. "Those communities that have taken the bull by the horns, they wound up with more jobs than they began with."

HEADLINE: Bad Bargain for Children

 BODY:
As Congressional Republicans shred the social safety net, gaping holes are opening in programs designed to protect the nation's most vulnerable children -- the victims of abuse and neglect. As part of the assault on welfare, House Republicans want to overhaul federally funded foster care and adoption services. They would consolidate many existing programs into block grants and chop funding by nearly $3 billion. For a system that is already overburdened and underfunded, these proposals could spell disaster.
The child welfare system is a patchwork of programs, usually run by states and counties, that protect abused and neglected children and offer services to troubled families where children are at risk. It also helps families who take responsibility for neglected and abandoned children through foster care or adoption. The system has grown as families and neighborhoods, devastated by the economy, drugs and alcohol, have disintegrated. In 1993, almost three million children were reportedly abused or neglected, an increase of 130 percent from a decade earlier. Nearly 450,000 children were in foster care. 
 In many states, children are victimized as much by the child welfare system as by their families. They are often left too long with abusive relatives or languish in foster care for years without reasonable plans for permanent placements.
Since 1980, Washington has tried to impose minimal standards on states receiving Federal funds for child welfare programs. The standards require states to provide written plans for each child, with recommended services and timetables to move children into or out of foster care, help them return to their families or make them eligible for adoption or other permanent placement.
Now House Republicans seek to remove even these minimal protections, while imposing harmful budget cuts. In a plan approved by the House Ways and Means Committee, about two dozen Federal child welfare programs would be consolidated into one block grant per state, with overall funding reduced by $2.9 billion over five years.
Proponents insist that the loss of funds will be more than offset by increased program flexibility and reduced administrative burdens. Giving states more flexibility and less paperwork is desirable. But the new plan would scrap virtually all standards and prohibit Washington from exercising any meaningful oversight.
In addition, funds to individual states would be capped, leaving state and local governments to pick up the tab if caseloads soar. For New York, where both Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani have proposed severe cuts in child welfare, the results could be particularly damaging.
As the plan heads for a vote in the House this week, supporters may think this is a good bargain for the states. But it's a bad bargain for children.

HEADLINE: KEY SENATE PANEL AGREES TO PURSUE BIG SPENDING CUTS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 20

 BODY:
The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee said today that both Republicans and Democrats on the panel were prepared to make spending cuts "of an immense magnitude" -- up to $700 billion by 2002 -- to erase the Federal deficit if both parties will give their political blessing.
The chairman, Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, said the committee's members reached a consensus in support of huge budget cuts during a weekend retreat on the Chesapeake Bay. The retreat was attended by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who said they had also agreed that tax reductions should be postponed either until the deficit has been tamed or until responsible experts can prove that specific tax cuts will not raise the Federal debt. 
 "If there are any spending cuts of any magnitude that are real, we ought to consider -- before we consider tax cuts -- whether or not we would like to use that money to reduce the deficit," Mr. Packwood said in a speech today to the National Association of Manufacturers.
Other Finance Committee members said that big tax cuts were as good as dead in the committee and that procedural obstacles would make it difficult to steer such legislation to Senate passage by other routes.
That appears to put the panel at odds with more conservative Republicans in the Senate and especially the House, where Speaker Newt Gingrich has endorsed a five-year package of business and personal tax cuts totaling $189 billion.
The Finance Committee oversees all tax legislation and most of the mandatory programs, like Medicare and Social Security, that consume 70 percent of Federal spending. The annual Federal budget must pass through the committee on the way to a floor vote in the Senate. An accord on the deficit among committee members would be a major development, if it lasted.
But as Mr. Packwood himself said today, the forces working to unglue the agreement were many and strong. As if to prove it, the Senator barely finished his plea for shared sacrifice before his audience began peppering him for assurances that a swarm of corporate tax cuts and loopholes would either be enacted or preserved.
The political prospects for the agreement are also cloudy.
Mr. Packwood said today that any budget accord would fail unless the leaders of both parties showed "the courage and the will and a willingness to forgo partisan hammering" over the painful impact of spending reductions.
Mr. Rubin could not be reached for comment on the weekend's proceedings. But other Clinton Administration officials viewed a Republican helping hand with trepidation, noting that President Clinton's last package of spending cuts and tax increases, in 1993, passed without a single Republican vote.
Nor is it clear how much support the Finance Committee's majority of fiscal moderates will get from the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, who is also a committee member. Mr. Dole's candidacy for the Republican Presidential nomination rests in part on his ability to attract conservative support, and conservatives are the principal supporters of the tax cuts that the committee opposes.
One participant in the retreat said today that the 15 or so legislators who attended had nevertheless agreed, almost unanimously, that deficit reduction was "the first, second and third order of priority" in this year's budget.
Another, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, summarized the senators' view on deficit reduction with a single word: "Now. And with great emphasis at this meeting. Now."
Mr. Packwood stressed, as have many Republicans before him, that balancing the budget was not literally a matter of cutting spending, but merely slowing the rate at which spending is growing. Federal spending is expected to rise by a total of about $3 trillion between now and 2002, he said, and restraining that growth to $2 trillion would probably reduce the deficit to zero.
That is much more difficult than it sounds, because both parties have refused to restrain the most expensive program, Social Security. And the programs growing at a breakneck pace, like Medicare and Federal pensions, are fiercely protected by beneficiaries or private companies, like health care providers, that profit from them.
House Republicans have also pledged to balance the budget by 2002, but have yet to propose more than a handful of specific spending cuts or reductions in growth. Mr. Packwood proposed very few today himself, but he differed from his House counterparts in that he said he had Democratic support for whatever cuts might be forthcoming.
Mr. Moynihan said committee members had generally agreed that the deficit should be attacked now, with the economy running at full steam and unemployment as low as it is likely to get, rather than later, when an economic slowdown will increase spending on the jobless and the poor.
And he said now was precisely the wrong time to cut taxes and give an already-hot economy a spending jolt that could ignite inflation.
Mr. Moynihan and a second leading Democrat on the panel, John B. Breaux of Louisiana, said they came away from the weekend session optimistic that the committee would find a long and specific list of spending reductions, even with the political wrangling that always accompanies the budget.
"I think the problem is big enough for both of our parties to work on at the same time," Mr. Breaux said.
He said he expected the Finance Committee to prepare its own deficit proposal "later rather than sooner," probably as budget legislation nears its final votes in Congress in July.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 22, 1995, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page article yesterday about plans for cuts in Federal spending misattributed a statement that senators on the Finance Committee had agreed to postpone tax reductions that might increase the Federal debt. The speaker was the committee chairman, Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, not Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin.

AT&T Cutbacks in Japan Rattle Old Sensibilities

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 21

 BODY:
In a drab industrial district of Tokyo, where the AT&T Corporation runs some Japanese operations, workers are handing out pamphlets attacking the American company's "bullying" of employees.
A half-day walkout has already been carried out, and the union is threatening a full-fledged strike if AT&T does not stop conduct it regards as outrageous. The problem is that AT&T is being assailed for doing what American companies think they should be doing: cutting costs to improve the bottom line. 
 "We cannot accept that this is a company that is making a profit, but to make more of a profit it is trying to cut jobs," said Akira Hashimoto, a union official. "It's trying to cut people with 20 to 30 years in the company, with a heavy responsibility at home, who cannot easily find new jobs."
The labor dispute is small potatoes by international standards, involving fewer than 4,000 employees. But it offers a window into contrasting perceptions in the United States and Japan about corporate responsibility -- and into the personal pain that is emerging as Japanese companies get tougher with employees.
In times of recession, shareholders ordinarily do better in the United States and workers fare better in Japan. But differences in employer behavior in the two countries are lessening, and labor unions say that more Japanese companies are acting like AT&T -- moving to cut costs even when longtime employees bear the burden. This more aggressive approach is straining Japan's lifetime employment system and perhaps helping to reshape the country's labor market.
AT&T has not actually laid off anyone in Japan, and says it has no plans to. Likewise, very few Japanese companies have dismissed employees. But the outcry over austerity measures, which to Americans might seem tame, demonstrates the extraordinary sensitivity of Japanese workers to any threat to interests that have long been held sacred.
The union leaders subscribe to a traditional Japanese view of a large company as a big family. To them, layoffs are as shocking as if a parent dumped children with a taste for steak and replaced them with potato-eaters who were cheaper to feed.
Most American companies, including AT&T, tend to see themselves more as shoppers trying to get the best deal. And it would be an unusual shopper who continued to patronize one store if another slashed its prices.
The current confrontation has its roots in AT&T's 1991 purchase of the NCR Corporation. The unit, renamed AT&T Global Information Solutions, has been a drag on the parent company, losing money in 1993 before struggling into the black last year. So AT&T has been closing its plants and cutting thousands of jobs.
In Japan, no one has been laid off, but the changes have been tumultuous by Japanese standards: A factory that makes cash registers and computers will no longer export them; a printing plant will move from a Tokyo suburb to a more remote area where costs are lower; repair workers are being spun off into a new subsidiary with a pay system that is more dependent on their performance. The workers are being abruptly reassigned at what they believe will be less pay.
The American telecommunications giant contends that it is playing by Japanese rules. "It's AT&T's view that each unit has to be viable and stand on its own two feet," said Mark R. Newburg, senior managing director of AT&T Global Information Solutions Japan Inc. "There are some efficiencies that we're trying to get, but we're working very hard to comply with Japanese labor laws as well as labor practices." He stressed that the new pay arrangement for service workers could lead to higher as well as lower incomes.
Some AT&T employees do not see the company in so charitable a light.
"This would be unthinkable in a Japanese company," Mr. Hashimoto, the union official, said. While a Japanese employer might take some of these measures, it would phase them in over several years and consult workers more, he said.
Many big Japanese companies, reluctant to engage in large-scale layoffs, instead eliminate overtime, move people around and even cut pay. That is why Japan's unemployment rate is 2.9 percent, compared with 5.4 percent in the United States, despite a four-year recession here.
"The first priority of a Japanese company is its employees; the second priority is its customers, and the third priority is its stockholders," said Mitsuya Goto, a former Nissan Motor Company executive who now runs a consulting company.
Yet to the dismay of union members, Japanese companies are clearly moving in American corporate direction. Nissan, for example, has reportedly worked out a plan to cut labor costs by shedding 6,000 to 7,000 jobs, though without layoffs.
A few companies have gone so far as to dismiss workers, but that is rare. Still, a job is so much a part of a person's identity in Japan that the prospect of being sloughed off on a subcontractor and taking a pay cut terrifies many Japanese.
"These things used to happen just in foreign-invested companies," said Teizo Hotta, an executive of AT&T Japan Ltd. "Now they're happening in Japanese companies, too."
To an American ear, the Japanese union's arguments may sound quaint, a bit like the charming old restaurants in Tokyo with armies of hostesses and bills that make you feel as if you've just bought the restaurant.
Indeed, the unions do not just resist cutbacks; they sometimes urge corporations to hire more people and pay them higher salaries. "Leading multinational companies like AT&T have a responsibility to maintain employment and even expand employment," Mr. Hashimoto said.
Clashes with foreign companies over what Japanese unions view as their rude behavior and unseemly haste to make money have been common. To the unions, the corporations act like overbearing foreign tourists who barge into Japanese homes without removing their shoes or plunge into communal baths without first scrubbing themselves clean.
These days, the tensions are becoming more acute, according to Eichi Yamane, secretary general of the Japan Association of Companies with Foreign Capital. "With the yen soaring, the salaries in Japan are looking out of whack to the people in headquarters," Mr. Yamane said.
Masaru Takagi, chief economist at the Fuji Research Institute in Tokyo, said change was long overdue. "Japanese companies can't keep the levels of labor they did 10 years ago," Mr. Takagi said. "The basic trend is moving toward the U.S. system. Maybe even layoffs will become more common in the future."

HEADLINE: Pakistan Asks for U.S. Help in Crackdown on Militants

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, March 21

 BODY:
Under growing pressure to crack down on Muslim militants suspected of plotting terrorist attacks abroad, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said today that her Government favored closing clandestine training centers in Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province but would need help from the United States.
"We in Pakistan simply don't have the resources on our own to carry out the entire cleansing operation," said Ms. Bhutto, who met with American reporters ahead of a two-day visit by Hillary Rodham Clinton that begins this weekend. Prime Minister Bhutto is scheduled to meet with President Clinton in Washington next month. 
 The Pakistani leader said she would appeal to the United States and to other countries to help her close down suspected bases of Arab and Asian militants, including Muslim religious schools and other organizations that have been used as fronts for terrorist activities.
Questioning of terrorist suspects seized recently in Peshawar, the capital of North-West Frontier Province, has revealed that the suspected mastermind of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York made a botched attempt to kill Ms. Bhutto during the 1993 election campaign that returned her to power, Pakistani newspapers reported last weekend.
The suspect, Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, was captured in a boarding house in Islamabad six weeks ago and was immediately deported to New York.
The newspaper reports quoted unidentified police officials as saying that Mr. Yousef had accidentally detonated a bomb he originally intended to place under a manhole cover near Ms. Bhutto's family home in Karachi in September 1993. The reports said Mr. Yousef was treated for injuries to his hands at the Aga Khan hospital in Karachi and released.
Confirming the reports, Ms. Bhutto said Pakistan had not known the extent of the terrorist underground here or its international links until Mr. Yousef's arrest by American and Pakistani agents in Islamabad on Feb. 7 set off a wider inquiry.
"It was deeply disturbing to Pakistan that somebody who is an international terrorist should have such deep roots within Pakistan, and that he should seek to influence the course of an election," she said.
Ms. Bhutto, who met with the reporters at the Prime Minister's sumptuous residence on a 35-acre estate overlooking Islamabad, said that the police are also looking for an uncle of Mr. Yousef. She did not identify him but said that he had recently disappeared from his position as the director of an Arab assistance organization in Peshawar, one of a cluster of Arab social, educational and relief organizations being investigated for possible terrorist links.
The Prime Minister added that the police had "plenty of photographs" of the man with what Ms. Bhutto described as "higher-ups in Pakistan."
The Pakistani leader said the photographs "could be innocent, or not," and that the police would investigate to determine whether Mr. Yousef's terrorist connections extended to influential people in Pakistan.
There is a growing sense among Pakistanis that those responsible for the widespread lawlessness that has swept the country in recent years -- the drug barons who control the country's pervasive heroin-trafficking, the armed gangs that have run amok in Karachi, and the terrorist underworld in Peshawar -- are protected by a network of influential politicians and businessmen.
Ms. Bhutto hinted that powerful forces are arrayed against the Government when she said that Pakistan could not move on its own against terrorists.
While her Government is prepared to move against "drug barons, militants and terrorists" in a way that previous governments have not, she said, "Pakistan on its own cannot just go and shut down" terrorist training camps, religious schools and other places used as terrorist fronts because doing so would prompt the militants to fan out across Pakistan and step up their campaign of violence.
Ms. Bhutto said her message to the United States would be: "You are a fair nation. You have been our allies. Help us to overcome militancy and terrorism."
In these and other remarks, she appeared to be suggesting that the Clinton Administration should bolster Pakistan's stability by moving to restore aid programs that were worth more than $600 million annually before Washington cut off all economic and military assistance to the country in 1990. The aid was suspended in a dispute over Pakistan's nuclear weapons program.
But aides to the Pakistani leader said her call for American help was also a reference to the use of United States influence in persuading other governments, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, to take back their own nationals who have joined terrorist groups here.
Police officials and diplomats have said that the Peshawar underground may have as many as 1,000 members drawn from a wide range of Arab countries, including Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the Sudan, as well as from nations in Central Asia and the Far East, including the Philippines.
A series of events has drawn international attention to Pakistan's role as a base for terrorists. On March 8, gunmen in a stolen taxicab shot and killed two Americans who were traveling to work at the American consulate in Karachi. Some suspect that they were killed in revenge for the arrest of Mr. Yousef, who faces a jail term of as much as 240 years if he is convicted in a bombing conspiracy trial in New York. The World Trade Center blast killed 6 people and injured more than 1,000.
Last week Pakistani investigators said that telephone calls Mr. Yousef made from Islamabad to Peshawar in the hours before his arrest had led them to six, and later several more, associates of Mr. Yousef who are being held on suspicion of involvement in an Arab-led terrorist underground in Peshawar and in Quetta, a city in west-central Pakistan that the police say has also been a sanctuary for terrorists.
It was in questioning those suspects, who include at least three Arabs and an Iranian, that Pakistani officials say they learned about the bombing attempt against Ms. Bhutto and of the involvement in the Peshawar underground of several relatives of Mr. Yousef, including two of his brothers who are now on a police watch list.

HEADLINE: Year's Effort by 5-Nation Group Accomplishes Little in Bosnia

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: PARIS, March 21

 BODY:
With great fanfare last spring, the United States, Russia, France, Britain and Germany formed the so-called contact group, confident that their collective diplomatic might would enable them to press Bosnia's warring factions to make peace.
A year has passed, and not only does peace in Bosnia seem as elusive as ever, but many diplomats also say the contact group is on the brink of falling apart. Nowadays, the five major powers seem to spend more energy quarreling among themselves about Bosnia than exerting pressure on the Muslims, Serbs and Croats. 
 In the type of understatement diplomats are known for, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Robert Frasure, the chief American representative to the group, said, "I would be misleading you if I tried to convince you that the contact group as an organization is working with perfection and smoothness right now."
There are as many differences within the group as there are members. The Clinton Administration says it wants the United Nations to lift the arms embargo against Bosnia's Muslim-led Government to step up pressure on Bosnian Serbs, but Britain, France and Russia oppose ending the embargo.
France has proposed a summit meeting of the leaders of the contact group and the former Yugoslav republics, but American officials say the idea is premature and bound to fail.
American diplomats complain that Britain and France are all too eager to make concessions to President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to cajole him into pushing the Bosnian Serbs to make peace.
"The situation right now within the contact group is total disarray," said one of the Administration's top policy makers on the Balkans. "At this point, people will have to decide whether the contact group has any usefulness left or not."
In the group's biggest controversy, the United States and the Europeans insist that economic sanctions on Serbia should not be lifted until it formally recognizes Bosnia and Croatia. But Andrei V. Kozyrev, the Russian Foreign Minister, told President Milosevic last month to grant recognition only after sanctions were removed.
"The idea for the contact group was we were going to come up with a position, stick to it and use our leverage to make it happen," one American diplomat said. "The contact group has stumbled badly, primarily because Russia has often gone off on its own. The Russians have used the group as a means to advance the Serbs' agenda, rather than to impose the contact group's position."
Secretary of State Warren Christopher flew to Europe today to meet with the French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppe, and to meet with Mr. Kozyrev on Wednesday and Thursday in Geneva.
Aides accompanying Mr. Christopher said one purpose of the trip is to revive the contact group and push the stalled peace negotiations forward. At his meeting with Mr. Kozyrev, Mr. Christopher plans to discuss differences over not just Bosnia, but also Chechnya, NATO expansion and Russia's plans to build nuclear reactors in Iran.
The contact group can boast of a few, limited achievements. It helped persuade Mr. Milosevic to close Serbia's border with Bosnian Serbs, a closing that American officials say is full of holes. In perhaps its most important accomplishment, it put together a peace plan that would give Bosnia's Government 51 percent of Bosnia's territory and the Bosnian Serbs 49 percent.
Bosnia's Government has accepted the plan, while Mr. Milosevic has given it his grudging, partial blessing. But the Bosnian Serbs, who control 70 percent of Bosnia's land, have rejected it.
Bosnian officials have repeatedly criticized the contact group for creeping appeasement of the Serbs. They note that the contact group at first said Bosnian Serbs must accept the group's peace plan, but then it said they need only accept it in principle as a point of departure for negotiations in which the Muslims and Serbs might swap some land.
The best way to reinvigorate the contact group, some diplomats say, would be to have the foreign ministers of the five countries meet regularly, a move that could increase the group's visibility and press members to thrash out their differences.

HEADLINE: Fleeing America's Relentless Pace, Some Adopt an Amish Life

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER 

DATELINE: CHESTERHILL, Ohio, March 15

 BODY:
This town of fewer than 400 people in southeastern Ohio, founded by Quakers and now home to a sizable community of old-order Amish, has always been a place apart, a quiet celebration of simplicity. Its newest business, the nonprofit Center for Plain Living, will do nothing to disturb that tradition.
The center, a clearinghouse of criticism of technology-driven American culture, is little more than a desk, a table, an old printing press and several lamps housed in a 19th-century photography studio. Yet it is a distinctly visible symbol of a small migration of families from East Coast and Midwest cities and suburbs, many with no previous rural ties, to a new and quiet life in which they adopt the customs and even the religious beliefs of the Amish, other Mennonites or the most conservative of the Quaker sects, the plain Quakers. 
 Prompting this movement is the sense that people are losing control of their lives, largely as a result of the increase in stress and alienation bestowed by technology. "We've moved to a whole new speed in how we live," said Scott Savage, a 35-year-old former librarian who helped found the center four years ago and is now its director. "We started with the horse and buggy, and then to the automobile, and now we're moving at electronic speed. We're finding that people can't live at that speed. We're being crushed by the way we live, and it's on everybody's mind. It's right there on the surface."
Nobody knows exactly how many "homecomers," as these refugees are called, have migrated to plain living. But Mr. Savage puts the total at several hundred during the last year alone in Ohio and five surrounding states.
The center's philosophy -- rejection of technology coupled with a quest for healthier rural economies, a cleaner environment and a less frantic, more meditative life style -- is an amalgam of the 1960's back-to-the-land movement and the 1990's emphasis on family values.
Mr. Savage grew up in a Cleveland suburb as a liberal Quaker, accepting of modern culture, and holds a master's degree in library science from Kent State University. Now he, his wife and their two children are plain Quakers. With his long beard, black suit, white cotton shirt and straw hat, he is often mistaken for one of the Amish farmers who raise their cows and corn among the steep ridges outside Chesterhill.
Sometimes his appearance attracts rude behavior. Last year, he said, he was "semi-mobbed by camera-crazed tourists" when he stopped on a Saturday afternoon at Lehman's Hardware, an Amish supply store in the town of Kidron, to the north. Across the street, other tourists surrounded the bench where his 30-year-old wife, Mary Ann, also distinctively attired, was waiting with their children.
Such moments remind the Savages how far they have wandered from their old lives in the mainstream. But they are not alone on this quiet tributary: at the 159-year-old Quaker meeting house next door to their home, they worship with several other young former suburbanites who have adopted the life of plain Quakers.
"We are doing something offbeat," said Mr. Savage, "and somebody who's never considered it would think this is totally ridiculous. But we keep talking about it and writing about it. And when you do that in a personal way, one on one, you get past all the self-defensiveness, and the snickering just disappears."
Although the Center for Plain Living has sponsored programs on rural development, its focus is Plain, a bimonthly magazine that is both a thoughtful exploration of Amish and other Mennonite cultures and a provocative critique of modern American life.
In Plain, emotional turmoil and environmental deterioration are attributed to technology, the automobile, blind pursuit of career at the expense of family, rampant consumerism and children's lives so tightly structured that they have no time for free play.
The path to a less frantic life, the magazine teaches, begins with throwing out the family television and computer, then substituting sweat for electronics, generalists for specialists, and, where possible, bicycles and horses for cars.
More than 5,000 families have subscribed to Plain since the first issue was published 18 months ago. Part of the magazine's appeal is the Savages' serialization of their experiences in gradually abandoning technology.
Not that they have been able to do without every possible convenience. Mr. Savage -- who, faithful to the tenets of his plain Quaker faith, declined to be photographed -- works at Ohio University in Athens writing grants for the medical college and so must commute 25 minutes each way by car. The family's rented house has electric lights and a telephone. And Mrs. Savage, a professed radio addict, is still getting over her decision last year to give away the family's radio, her last connection to the electronic media.
What is more, Plain is edited and set on a computer and printed with modern offset presses. Mr. Savage is working with Seth Hinshaw, a young plain Quaker printer from North Carolina, to acquire and use hand-powered movable-type presses, but the transition is expensive and likely to take at least another year.
Such inconsistencies, which Mr. Savage details in each issue of Plain, attract occasional criticism among the 40 to 80 letters that the magazine receives each week. More frequently, though, readers respond to the magazine with high praise. After seeing the first issue, which dealt with agriculture, Craig Zolodger, an agricultural extension agent in Santa Clara, Calif., wrote, "You are giving voice to very deep feelings about what is wrong with society and, more importantly, offering hope and vision about what can be done to correct the dis-ease we are all experiencing."
And in response to an issue on threats posed by the information superhighway, Michael S. New, who identified himself as a computer specialist from Fort Worth, wrote: "The computer in the business world has replaced the requirement for face-to-face contact and trust building with an ever-accelerating and paranoid passion for precision. Those unable to see both edges of this sword, or to relish your noble though occasionally disagreeable alternative view, are already servants of the machine."
 
From Plain Magazine, Plain Voices

 
"My husband and I have lived without television for a long time -- the four years of our marriage plus at least five prior years, separately, for each of us. It has been more recently that we've given up radio as well. For over a year now we've lived without voices in our home save those of the real, live people who live here or those of visiting friends." MARY ANN LIESER
 
"My antipathy toward the automobile goes way back. For a period as a young child I refused to ride in the car unless coerced into it, because its noise frightened me. I had similar reactions to vacuum cleaners and flush toilets." CHRIS ROTH

HEADLINE: Whitewater Salesman Pleads Guilty to Fraud

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21

 BODY:
The Arkansas real estate salesman who handled the Clintons' land dealings pleaded guilty today in Little Rock, Ark., to two charges of bankruptcy fraud, giving the Whitewater special counsel a witness with detailed knowledge of the venture.
The man, Chris V. Wade, handled the finances of the failed Whitewater enterprise from its earliest days and worked closely with James B. McDougal, the owner of a failed Arkansas savings and loan and Bill and Hillary Clinton's partner in the Whitewater Development Company. 
 "Mr. Wade has pledged to actively cooperate with our ongoing investigation and to provide complete, truthful and accurate information to the U.S. through the office of the independent counsel," the Whitewater special counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, told reporters shortly after Mr. Wade entered his plea in Federal District Court. "That cooperation has already begun."
Under the plea agreement, Mr. Wade faces a sentence of 12 to 18 months in prison. The sentence can be reduced to 10 to 16 months if Mr. Starr deems that Mr. Wade has provided "substantial assistance."
Mr. Starr is investigating, among other things, whether Mr. McDougal illegally diverted federally insured money from the Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association, which he owned. Madison later collapsed at a cost to the taxpayers of more than $60 million. The Clintons and Mr. McDougal bought the Whitewater land in 1978, before Mr. McDougal owned the savings and loan.
When interest rates rose in the early 1980's, Mr. Wade was unable to sell many of the Whitewater lots. The White House has acknowledged that Mr. McDougal ended up investing about twice as much as the Clintons to pay the mortgage and other obligations.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has already asked Mr. Wade about a transaction in April 1985 in which Mr. McDougal raised about $35,000 to pay off bank loans that the Clintons had taken out to finance Mr. Clinton's 1984 re-election campaign for governor.
According to Whitewater's check register, on March 22, 1985, Mr. McDougal wrote a $25,000 check on Whitewater's account at Madison Guaranty to Ozark Realty, Mr. Wade's company in Flippin, Ark. At the time, the Whitewater account's balance stood at $258.
The check was paid, but the account remained overdrawn until April 9, when Mr. McDougal shifted money from another of his real estate ventures. A few weeks later Mr. McDougal held a fund-raising event at Madison, and gave the campaign checks totaling about $35,000, including $12,000 in cashiers checks that investigators suspect may have been diverted from the savings and loan.
Mr. Wade said in an interview last year that he and his wife contributed no more than $3,000 at the fund-raising event. He said that the $25,000 check, which was identified in the Clinton campaign's 1992 report on Whitewater as a real estate commission, was actually a down payment from Mr. McDougal for a venture that was never consummated. Mr. Wade said that soon after, he wrote a check back to Mr. McDougal for the same amount, though it is not clear what happened to the money.
Federal agents found substantial evidence about Mr. Wade's business dealings, according to the charges filed today in Little Rock. Although he was not charged with tax fraud, Mr. Wade agreed to file amended returns for 1989 through 1993 "in which defendant received income he previously did not report."
The two charges filed against Mr. Wade stem from his November 1990 bankruptcy filing. He owed four unsecured creditors $489,120, including $83,883 to the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency that deals with failed savings and loans.
Prosecutors charge that Mr. Wade fraudulently concealed his ownership of one Whitewater lot from the Federal bankruptcy court.
According to charges filed today, Mr. Wade had an intermediary pose as the landowner and fill out a false application for a $45,000 loan from an Arkansas bank. Mr. Wade then appraised the land himself and falsely asserted on the documents that he had no interest in it. The bank eventually made the loan, and Mr. Wade used it to build a house, the court papers said.

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall on Inflation Fears Raised by March Retail Sales Data

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Breaking a three-session rally, traders bid stock prices sharply downward, after an unexpectedly strong retail sales report fanned fears of inflation. The same report drove down bond prices, despite a surprise strengthening in the dollar overseas.
In the absence of similar market-moving economic reports, the dollar may be the main driver of the stock and bond markets in advance of the policy-setting meeting of the Federal Reserve on Tuesday. 
 But the dollar may have only short-lived speculative reasons for rising, analysts said. "When markets start trending, a lot of people who are not normally in the market start swooning and say, 'Oh, this will be easy money,' " said Graham Broyd, managing director for foreign exchange at Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale. "We call these people amateurs."
The value of the dollar is important to the stock market because a weaker dollar penalizes foreign investors, who have become an increasingly important source of capital for the financial markets in the United States. The Dow Jones industrial average, for example, has risen 6.21 percent so far this year in terms of dollars, but has fallen 3.08 percent in terms of German marks.
The plight of the dollar is "worrisome" for stocks, said Dirk van Dijk, equity strategist for C. H. Dean & Associates, which manages $4 billion in stocks and bonds. "You've got the world reserve currency, the dollar, for the most part, going down the tubes."
At any rate, the Dow rose as much as 26 points, before falling and then plummeting at 2:55 P.M., when Johnson Redbook, a research firm, announced that the estimated March retail sales were six-tenths of 1 percent higher than the February sales. The projection was higher than the gain of one-tenth of 1 percent that traders had expected.
By the end of the day, the Dow had fallen 11.07 points, to 4,072.61. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.07 points, to 495.07, and the smaller-company Nasdaq composite index fell 0.71 point, to 809.78.
Bond prices also fell sharply, reacting to the possibility that the overheating economy could produce higher inflation. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 7.44 percent from 7.39 percent. Yields and prices move in opposite directions.
The dollar, meanwhile, rose against most leading currencies yesterday. The dollar rose against the mark, helped by comments by central bankers in Germany and France. The president of the Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, said yesterday about German interest rates that "I will take everything into account to see whether there is room for a small rate cut." A cut would make the mark less valuable and the dollar more valuable to international currency traders.
But the dollar, which ended slightly lower against the Japanese yen, remains fragile.
Among the stocks moving the market yesterday, Kmart rose 1, to 13, adding $457 million to its market capitalization. The longtime chief executive of Kmart, Joseph E. Antonini, resigned yesterday. FSI International, which makes equipment for building silicon wafers, rose 3 5/8, to 42 3/4, after the company reported a rise in its second-quarter earnings to 57 cents a share, from 23 cents a share in the corresponding period a year ago.
Ascend Communications, a maker of telecommunications equipment, rose 3 1/4, to 63 1/2, after several analysts raised their earnings estimates for 1995.
The Norand Corporation, a maker of computer equipment, fell 63/16 , to 359/16 , after analysts questioned whether new products were hurting profit margins. Casino Data Systems, a maker of gambling equipment, fell 3, to 12, after its management said first-quarter earnings would fall 5 cents to 10 cents a share below Wall Street's estimates of 27 cents a share.
The volume on the New York Stock Exchange was above normal, with 367.1 million shares changing hands, about 12 percent higher than the daily average of 329 million shares this year.
Of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 15 fell, led by I.B.M., which fell 1 1/4, to 82 1/4. Of the 500 component stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, 226 stocks fell, led by SBC Communications, formerly Southwestern Bell, which fell 1 1/2, to 41 3/4.
The most active stock, with 26.4 million shares traded, was RJR Nabisco, which rose 5/16 , to 6 1/8.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Decline Sharply on Report of Robust Retail Sales

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities tumbled yesterday after a retailing industry report rattled investors' belief that the economy was slowing.
The market began with early gains in quiet trading, only to be jolted from its lull in the afternoon by the strength shown in a survey of the nation's leading department stores by the Johnson Redbook Service, a New York-based retailing consultant. The survey indicated that retail sales growth through the third week of March was a strong six-tenths of 1 percent; most economists had expected no change. The surprising gain challenged investor expectations of slower economic growth and subdued inflation. 
 In another report yesterday, the Treasury said that the Federal budget deficit ran $38 billion in February, slightly lower than expected and better than the $41.6 billion deficit seen in February 1994.
"The details of the latest budget report confirmed that the slowdown in tax refunds is not a myth and may go a long way in explaining the current consumption pause," Anthony Chan, chief economist for Banc One Investment Advisors, said. But, he added, "when these refunds begin to hit the mailboxes, we're likely to see an additional bounce back in consumer consumption, and retailers may start to see that stories of the demise of consumer spending were greatly exaggerated."
Mr. Chan also suggested that a bounce in retail sales could lead to a rebound in housing as well, indicating that the economy might be about to reheat. That might cause the Fed to raise interest rates again. "This data has caused market expectations to do a 180-degree turnaround," he said.
The 30-year bond fell 20/32 , to 1026/32 to yield 7.44 percent, up from 7.39 percent on Monday, in reaction to the stronger-than-expected retail number. Rates on short bills were slightly higher.
Elsewhere, in the municipal-bond market, yields were little changed.
Yields have fallen some two-thirds of a percentage point in the last four months amid widespread belief that munis will be harder to find later this year; new issues are currently down about 60 percent from last year.
The surge in prices, which move in the opposite direction of yields, has pushed the yields on bonds to about 78 percent of comparable Treasury securities. Investors generally consider muni bonds inexpensive when they yield more than 82 percent of Treasury securities.
In competitive bidding yesterday, Minnesota sold $115 million in general obligation bonds at yields lower than comparably rated securities. The debt offering was awarded to Bear, Stearns & Company, which repriced the issue to yield as much as 5.60 percent for a bond due in 2009.
Rated Aa-1 by Moody's Investors Service and AA+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation, the bond was considered expensive by some traders.
Connecticut's negotiated sale of $438 million of its general obligation bonds through Morgan Stanley & Company, initially priced last week, was offered to institutional investors this week. The maximum yield was 5.90 percent for bonds due in 2014 and 2015, with the remainder of the serial bonds priced to yield from 4.50 percent in 1997 to 5.85 percent in 2013. However, with prices falling since the end of last week, some bonds like the ones for 2015 were priced to yield 5 basis points more. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
In the day's largest new negotiated offering, Dade County, Fla., priced $240 million in aviation revenue bonds through Goldman, Sachs & Company. The bonds, which will be used to finance improvements at Miami International Airport, were tentatively priced to yield as much as 6.24 percent for an issue due in 2024. For some buyers the bonds are subject to the Federal alternative minimum tax.
The bonds are insured by the Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corporation and will be rated triple-A by both Moody's and S. & P.

HEADLINE: Let a Free Market Take Its Course on Sex Shops

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The change in zoning for sex shops in Times Square and elsewhere in New York espoused by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican, and endorsed by your March 15 editorial, flies in the face of economic arguments presented by the United States Government to the world. 
 Our governments, both Republican and Democrat, have always endorsed the idea of a market economy. That is, the prices, quantities and types of goods and services that are produced should be governed by the market. We have always advocated that this policy would result in the most efficient economic system.
The policy on sex shops is contrary to this policy. If people patronize these shops and the shops are making money, they should be allowed to flourish. If people find them repugnant, they shouldn't buy from them. Lack of demand and related losses will cause the shops to close in order to stop losing money. This is a more efficient policy and furthers the idea of reducing government involvement.

Dollar Rebounds as Japan Denies It Accepts Big Drop

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar ended little changed yesterday after rebounding from a low against the yen as the Bank of Japan denied speculation that it would accept a large drop in the dollar.
The dollar tumbled in early New York trading amid rumors that the Bank of Japan had said in an internal document that Japan could tolerate a temporary fall by the dollar to 78 to 82 yen. 
 The dollar pared its losses after a Bank of Japan official in New York denied the document existed, saying, "At this moment, the Bank of Japan wouldn't tolerate a move to 78 to 82 yen."
After falling to an intraday trading low of 88.40 yen, the dollar recovered to 89.27 yen, down from 89.33 yen on Monday.
The dollar gained against the mark after French and German monetary officials meeting in Paris said the French franc was undervalued against the mark, traders said.
"We estimate that the current exchange rate between the two countries' currencies isn't reflecting economic fundamentals," the French and Germans said in a joint statement.
The communique helped push the mark, which reached a record high of 3.6168 francs March 8, down to 3.5376 French francs in New York trading, from 3.5507 francs on Monday.
The retreat by the mark helped support the dollar. In New York trading late yesterday, The dollar rose to 1.4132 marks from 1.4030 marks on Monday. The dollar also rose to 1.1740 Swiss francs from 1.1665 francs. The British pound rose to $1.5860 from $1.5763.
Many market participants, however, said yesterday that the dollar's rebound would be temporary.
"The dollar is going lower," said Ezra Zask, president of Ezra Zask Associates, a Norfolk, Conn., currency-trading fund with $100 million under management.
Tom Hoge, a corporate currency trader at the Bank of New York, said he expected the dollar to slide to 1.30 marks and 88 yen within the next one to two months.

HEADLINE: Thinkers and Doers on the Federal Bench

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Mediocrity on the Bench" (Op-Ed, March 17): Jeffrey Rosen's argument that more high-powered liberal scholars should be appointed to the Federal bench to counteract the conservative scholar-jurists typifies the arrogance of those who view intellectual credentials as the sole measure of potential judicial distinction. 
 Mr. Rosen laments the fact that President Clinton's appointees are "largely a group of soldierly and obscure judges and prosecutors." He neglects to mention that most Federal judicial appointments are for the Federal trial court, where experience as a Federal prosecutor or as a state court judge would prove significantly more valuable than a command of law and economics principles or other scholarly theories.
Second, it is questionable that judges' ability to "transform the law by the force of their arguments" matters more than ability to apply the correct law to a given case with a sense of context, which is gained by practical experience. Even if Mr. Rosen's argument were limited to the appellate courts, one could make a case that our most distinguished appellate judges were former District Court judges who practiced law before their appointments.
Instead of decrying the lack of name-brand Federal appointees as the by-product of a misguided effort to diversify the judiciary, Mr. Rosen might do better to withhold judgment until the careers of the "practitioners" and the "scholars" speak for themselves.

HEADLINE: World Trade Choice Draws Modest Praise Of U.S. Aides

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21

 BODY:
Accepting the Clinton Administration's reluctant endorsement of his candidacy to be the first head of the World Trade Organization, Renato Ruggiero declared today that "the past is the past" and said he and the American officials who once opposed him had now had a "meeting of the minds."
Mr. Ruggiero, who was once Italy's trade minister, spoke in Washington as the Administration formally declared that it would support his appointment at a meeting of the major trading nations scheduled later this week in Geneva. The endorsement guarantees Mr. Ruggiero the post, and places him at the head of the new worldwide grouping of 124 trading nations. 
 In a statement of support for Mr. Ruggiero, Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, was hardly effusive in his praise. After meeting with him this morning and confirming a series of conditions that the United States had placed on its support, Mr. Kantor declared that "we are satisfied that his stewardship will advance our mutually shared goals."
The decision ended a three-way struggle that has gone on for nearly nine months, and became a divisive issue among countries in Asia, Europe and the Americas. Washington and the Latin American nations had supported Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the former President of Mexico. But Mr. Salinas was forced to withdraw after it became clear that he bore some responsibility for Mexico's deep financial crisis and after his brother was arrested in connection with a political killing.
The other candidate, Kim Chul Su, a South Korean economist, withdrew his candidacy today. He has been assured that he will receive the No. 2 post in the organization, American officials said today. European nations and their former colonies backed Mr. Ruggiero.
In return for its support for Mr. Ruggiero, the United States insisted on a number of conditions, including an understanding that he would serve only one four-year term and that the next head of the organization would be a non-European. The World Trade Organization is the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's secretariat, which had been headed by Peter Sutherland of Ireland.
Mr. Kantor also said that he had reached an agreement that Asia, the Americas and Europe would not get into the same kind of intercontinental struggle over the group's leadership.
Today Mr. Ruggiero, a large man known as "Rocky" with a jolly demeanor, went out of his way to talk about how much he and Mr. Kantor agreed upon. He said everyone had benefited from the American concessions that led to an end to the competition.
"This became a hemispheric contest, and that can lead to some nationalism," Mr. Ruggiero said. "But believe me, all this is behind us."
When American officials were deriding Mr. Ruggiero's candidacy several weeks ago, they described him as an earnest bureaucrat who had little vision for the future of the new trade organization, which has been given far broader powers under the new world trade agreement.
He did nothing today to shake that view. Mr. Ruggiero talked at length but offered few specifics, describing his role as one of achieving accommodation among the trading partners, and declaring that he held little power himself "other than the power of moral suasion."
Mr. Ruggiero insisted that he had not agreed to any conditions on his appointment, and said his only priorities would be promoting free trade and strengthening the international trading system.
But several diplomats say that the United States exacted an agreement from the European Union that agricultural issues -- the most politically charged matters in reaching the last GATT accord -- would be the focus of the next round of global trade negotiations if another accord was sought. European countries had been hoping to avoid such negotiations, which would inevitably lead to a further reduction of protection for farmers.
Mr. Kantor declined today to describe the agreements he had struck with the Europeans in return for supporting Mr. Ruggiero.

HEADLINE: Massachusetts Seeks to Help Fish Industry

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: BOSTON, March 21

 BODY:
With stocks of cod, haddock and yellowtail flounder at historic lows in New England waters, Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts said today that he would ask President Clinton to declare the state's fishing industry a natural disaster and to authorize Federal relief.
Governor Weld, a Republican, is taking a new tack on the decline of the industry, and it might be one that is hard to support. To qualify for Federal disaster relief, he must show that the shrinking fish populations are the result of uncontrollable forces of nature. 
 The scarcity of fish in the Atlantic has been extensively studied in recent years, and almost all of the efforts to address the problem have been directed at curbing overfishing.
Scientists and Government experts generally agree that overfishing is the main reason for for the reduction of the fish populations.
In December, the Federal Government took one of the most drastic steps to try to bring back the fish. The Commerce Department ordered the emergency closing of more than 6,000 square miles of fishing area off the Massachusetts coast.
But the numbers have continued to decline. In his request for aid, to be submitted to the the Federal Emergency Management Agency later this week, Mr. Weld predicted "the likely complete collapse of the traditional Massachusetts fishing industry within the next six months."
Over the years, the New England Fishery Management Council, which regulates fishing in the region, met yesterday at the National Fishery Service in Woods Hole, Mass. to discuss stepping up efforts combat overfishing.
"We are working on a management plan to address overfishing," said Patricia Fiorelli a spokeswoman for the council. "We haven't been able to put a finger on environmental factors."
Governor Weld compared the situation in New England to that in the Pacific Northwest, where a natural disaster was declared last year after El Nino further diminished the salmon population. California, Oregon and Washington received $20 million in Federal aid. But whether the New England situation is a result of a natural disaster is debatable.
Bernie Bohn, harvest manager for the Oregon Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, said environmental problems were legitimate concerns.
"But it sounds to me like the principal problem is still the one that was there in the first place, which is too-high harvest rates that weren't controlled in time," Mr. Bohn said.
The most important benefit from Federal relief would be unemployment disaster assistance for fishermen. Most fishermen do not get unemployment benefits because they are self-employed. Other Federal aid might help pay for worker retraining and provide low-interest loans for the restructuring of fishing businesses.
To back up his request to the President, Governor Weld argues that fluctuations in water temperatures and rising predator populations have been killing off the cod, haddock and yellowtail flounder, the fish that are the industry mainstay.
"We have been concentrating on poorly understood natural factors," said John C. Phillips, the state Commissioner of Fisheries, Wildlife and Environmental Law, whose office prepared the request for Federal relief. "There has been a tremendous population boom of certain fish that prey on young ground fish including sea herring, mackerel and dogfish."
John Bullard an expert on New England fishing and a former Mayor of New Bedford, Mass., who now works at the Commerce Department, said that the struggling fishing communities along the coast had already been seriously hurt but that they still faced even harder blows. An estimated 20,000 depend on fishing or related business for their livelihoods in New England. He said recent scientific data indicated that fishing would have to be stopped completely for several years in the Georges Bank, off Cape Cod, to replenish the stocks of fish.
"Georges Bank is arguably the most productive fishing grounds in the world," he said. "You take the world's most productive fishing grounds and essentially shut them down. It's hard to overstate the severity of this problem."
Even harder to quantify is the emotional impact on the communities, Mr. Bullard said. In New Bedford, he said, "We were a seaport. If you no longer have a reason to go to sea, you are losing more than your economy, you are losing your character. You are losing you soul."
Mr. Weld made his announcement at a meeting of the state's Seaport Advisory Council, in the port city of Fall River, one year after the Commerce Department approved $30 million in Federal help for the fishing industry that was shared by all the New England states.

HEADLINE: Loral Plans to Pay $800 Million In Deal for Unisys Military Units

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
While most military contractors are looking for ways to scale back in the face of spending cuts at the Pentagon, the Loral Corporation is avidly pursuing growth. Yesterday, in the latest in a string of acquisitions during the last decade, Loral agreed to buy the military and aerospace operations of the Unisys Corporation for $800 million in cash, beating bids by the Hughes Aircraft Corporation and the Raytheon Company.
Loral, based in New York, said the deal would immediately lift its earnings by 20 cents a share and improve its capabilities in areas like radar, satellite communications and military information systems. The sale will allow Unisys to leave the military industry with a large amount of cash to spend on its core computer businesses. 
 The chairman and chief executive of Loral, Benjamin L. Schwartz, said he did not expect layoffs from the acquisition. Unisys Defense Systems, which is made up of four units in Great Neck, L.I.; Eagan, Minn.; Salt Lake City and Montreal, employs about 8,500 people and had revenue of about $1.4 billion last year.
"We like their businesses and we like their management and their people," Mr. Schwartz said. "We will be looking to expand rather than contract."
Such comments reflect the enthusiastic commitment of Mr. Schwartz to military contracting at a time when other companies like Unisys see few opportunities. Since taking over Loral in the early 1970's, Mr. Schwartz has turned the company around and expanded it rapidly, making more than a dozen acquisitions.
In 1990 Loral bought Ford Aerospace for $715 million, more than doubling the size of the company. Three years later it paid $1.57 billion for the Federal Systems Company unit of I.B.M., which provides computer hardware and software to Government agencies.
In the decade since 1985 Loral's annual sales have grown to $5.4 billion from $502 million, while the number of employees has jumped to 33,000 from 6,500.
"The company is very astute at purchasing properties and assimilating them into its business base," said Elliott Rogers, an analyst at Cowens & Company.
Mr. Schwartz said Loral had achieved efficiencies through economies of scale. His goal is for Loral to become one of the largest Government contractors when the current round of industry consolidation is completed.
Loral is a leading producer of training and simulation machines for pilots, command and control communications, satellite communications and tactical weapons and missile systems. The company also provides system integration and other specialized computer services to Government agencies like the Postal Service and the Internal Revenue Service, and it has invested nearly $70 million in Globastar, an ambitious worldwide wireless telephone system based on 48 satellites that will circumnavigate the earth.
Mr. Schwartz said Loral would finance the deal with Unisys from its cash flow and through borrowing from banks.
On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, shares of Loral rose $1, to $43.875, while share of Unisys fell 50 cents, to $9.25.
Mr. Rogers praised the deal, even though revenues at the military-related units of Unisys have been shrinking in recent years. "From a stream-of-earnings standpoint, it's a plus," he said. "And the businesses throw off $100 million in cash annually."
But he added that Unisys was one of five suppliers of ground and surface ship radar in a market that he believed could support only three. "That means that Loral is either going to have to buy a competitor or sell," he said.
But Mr. Schwartz would not hear of it. "There is nothing in Unisys that we're going to sell," he said. "Every one of its operations fits very, very well with Loral."
For Unisys, the sale will net substantially more than the $600 million the company expected to receive when it attempted to spin off its military businesses to the public in an unsuccessful initial public offering in 1991.
The chairman and chief executive of Unisys, James A. Unruh, said the sale would help the company continue to transform itself from depending mainly on hardware sales into a service-led information management company. "That is the future of our business," he said.
Like other mainframe computer makers, Unisys suffered a big setback by failing to recognize the shift toward personal computers. From 1989 to 1991 the company lost nearly $2.5 billion. It had revenue of $7.4 billion last year, far lower than its peak in 1990 of slightly more than $10 billion.
But under the leadership of Mr. Unruh, who took over the company in 1990, Unisys has been given credit for recasting itself as a supplier of complete information systems and smaller, networked computers known as client-servers.
"It's been kind of an up-and-down ride for Unisys in recent years," said Bob Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research, a consulting firm based in Phoenix. "The more focused the company gets on what it considers to be its core business, the better the chances are that it will succeed."
Mr. Unruh said Unisys began seriously considering the sale about three months ago. After narrowing the field of interested parties, the company entertained bids from Hughes, Loral and Raytheon.
The cash offer from Loral was superior financially and from the perspective of the 8,500 Unisys employees affected by the sale, he said. Officials at both Hughes Aircraft and Raytheon declined to comment on the sale.
The actual purchase price is $862 million, but will be about $800 million after various adjustments, Mr. Schwartz said. The deal will close in June, he added.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
New Curbs Proposed on Foreign TV Programs in Europe

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: PARIS, March 22

 BODY:
In a protectionist move that was promptly criticized by the United States, the executive commission of the European Union proposed new rules today that would tighten restrictions on foreign programming on European television stations for the next 10 years.
The main effect of the proposal would be to strengthen a requirement that European television stations must dedicate at least 51 percent of broadcast time to European programming. Many stations have avoided meeting the quota by relying on a modifying phrase -- "where practicable" -- in the requirement. 
 It seems unlikely that the new rules will be approved, however, when they are debated by culture ministers from the union's 15 member countries in Luxembourg on April 3, because Britain is leading a group of European governments that strongly oppose the idea of programming quotas.
Coincidentally, Germany's high court ruled today that the Government had no constitutional right to commit regional German states to the existing broadcast rules. While unrelated to the current European debate, this decision may stiffen Bonn's resistance to the programming quotas.
The drive for stricter controls on foreign programming has been led by France, the region's largest film producer, which has argued that the struggling European television and film industries need the quotas to survive competition from Hollywood.
Several European governments, however, say that while the quota system may protect movie and television production inside the union, it will hinder development of a vast range of new global media services.
Though the United States reluctantly agreed to exclude audio-visual services from the Uruguay Round of global trade talks that went into effect on Jan. 1, it has long campaigned against European television restrictions that seem aimed at American entertainment companies.
After today's announcement, Stuart E. Eizenstat, the United States Ambassador to the European Union, said the commission had missed "an historic opportunity to take a bold step towards a more open system."
"In the high-risk, fast-moving world of telecommunications, 10 years is an eternity," he added.
But Mr. Eizenstat said the Clinton Administration was not planning immediate retaliation. He characterized the issue as an "internal European Union debate."
"It's our hope that the directive will improve as it goes through the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament," he added.
Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Pictures Association of America, responded cautiously. "We Americans are not part of this debate -- a debate between those who believe governments can force people to watch what they don't want to watch and those who say you have to be open to be competitive," he said.
But Mr. Valenti noted that today's proposal "keeps in place some very stern protectionist barriers and makes them mandatory throughout the European Union." Private investors who will be needed to finance "the audio-visual future" will be "very wary" if governments are making decisions for them, he contended.
The issue dates to 1989, when the union adopted a policy with the unlikely name Television Without Frontiers; in fact, the policy established a number of barriers to non-European programming. France has been pressing for elimination of the phrase, "where practicable," which has weakened the policy.
At a meeting of European ministers in Bordeaux last month, France was largely isolated. Britain, the Netherlands, Germany and Austria called for looser controls, and many other countries favored the status quo. At the meeting of the union's executive commission in Brussels today, however, 11 commissioners voted for the proposal, four voted against it and two were absent.
The proposal is a compromise: it eliminates the "where practicable" escape clause but gives television stations the option of dedicating 25 percent of their program budgets to creating new programs and assures protection for only 10 years. In practice, the new rules seem likely to please no one.
Predictably, Britain said it was disappointed. "It would seem that the European Commission has not taken account of the broad view expressed by a majority of states in Bordeaux that they don't want to see a tightening of the existing regime," a spokesman for the Department of National Heritage in Britain said.
Nor was France happy. A spokesman for the Communications Ministry said France welcomed removal of the loophole and reaffirmation of the quota principle, but opposed setting a date for ending the quota system and regretted that new multimedia services like video on demand had been excluded.
At present, 60 percent of programming on French television must be European, including at least 40 percent made in France, though many stations fail to meet the targets. The French film industry, which has demanded that Paris oppose the 10-year provision, has a particular interest because much of its financing comes from French television stations that are required not only to show French films but also to invest heavily in movie production.

HEADLINE: Ruling on Definition of 'Family,' Justices Back a Welfare Curb

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
The Supreme Court today unanimously upheld a California welfare regulation intended to save the state money by counting all needy children living in the same household under the care of a relative as a single family.
The regulation replaced an approach under which only members of the same nuclear family were counted as a family unit when calculating monthly welfare grants. 
 Two pairs of siblings living with a grandmother, for example, would get two separate welfare grants under the old rules, but under the regulations upheld today it would be a single grant calculated for a family with four welfare recipients. Because state welfare programs give lower per-capita grants for each additional family member, the larger family would get a smaller total grant than two separate families with the same number of people.
About half of the states have regulations similar to California's. But the lower Federal courts were divided over whether the regulations complied with various provisions of Federal welfare law.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, declared the California regulation invalid in 1993, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, upheld a similar New York welfare regulation last May. Connecticut and New Jersey are among the states with similar rules.
The Clinton Administration supported California in its appeal to the Supreme Court, telling the Court that states were supposed to have considerable latitude in administering their welfare systems under the Aid to Families With Dependent Children program, the main Federal-state welfare program at issue in the case. The Administration said that the Government had endorsed state approaches similar to California's since the 1960's.
Writing for the Court today, Justice Clarence Thomas said that while the California regulation resulted in lower per-capita grants to members of extended families, "California is simply recognizing the economies of scale that inhere in such living arrangements."
One plaintiff in the case, whose situation the Court highlighted today, was caring for a granddaughter and was receiving welfare on the child's behalf of $341 a month. She then began caring for two grandnieces, who were sisters and who received a separate benefit of $560 a month. When the new California rule took effect in 1991, the total monthly grant of $901 was cut to $694.
According to the California Attorney General's office, the state expects to save about $20 million a year by using this approach to calculating payments.
But the lawyer for the plaintiffs, Katherine E. Meiss of the Western Center on Law and Poverty in Los Angeles, said in an interview today that the decision might cost the state money. "I'm sure that thousands of kids will end up in foster care" rather than being cared for by relatives as monthly grants are cut, she said.
A brief filed in the case by the American Association of Retired Persons said the welfare rolls showed a "staggering growth" in the number of grandparents caring for their children's children.
The legal arguments in the case, Anderson v. Edwards, No. 93-1883, were quite technical. They concerned the interplay between the challenged state regulation and several Federal welfare regulations intended to make sure that a child's welfare benefits would not be reduced because of the presence in the home of an adult who was not legally responsible for the child's expenses.
Reflecting the Administration's explanation of those regulations, the Court said today that they were intended to address a different issue, that of a boyfriend or other adult male in the home who had no legal obligation to the children and whose income should not be assumed to be available to them.

HEADLINE: U.S. TRADE DEFICIT SOARS TO RECORD

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
In an ominous sign for the economy and the Clinton Administration, the nation's trade deficit soared by two-thirds in January to a record $12.23 billion.
There was strong evidence that the United States' usual imbalance, caused largely by Asian nations that export far more to this country than they buy in return, was being worsened as Mexico, recently a major importer of American goods, plunged deeper into economic crisis. 
 The severity of the trade gap reported today by the Commerce Department took the Clinton Administration by surprise. Although the dollar fell to a record low of 89 Japanese yen in New York trading, the decline was relatively modest, given the big jump in the deficit.
Still, the White House is particularly concerned, several Administration officials acknowledged, because a further deterioration in trade could keep the dollar weak. And if the economy slows as expected later this year, it could open the door to Republicans to attack what has been the Administration's stronghold: a healthy economy.
The exceptionally big trade deficit in January was the largest number ever reported, but it is hard to be absolutely sure that it exceeded all previous months because the Commerce Department recently changed its method of calculation.
Paradoxically, the big jump in the trade deficit can also be seen as a measure of the economy's continued strength. Imports continued to climb, reflecting strong consumer demand. But exports declined even faster.
What's worse is that the latest figures make clear that predictions about the fallout from the collapse of the Mexican peso are already coming to pass. Mexico, which has helped compensate for a chronic trade deficit with Asia, is now beginning to help widen the gap. Today's numbers are expected to be the first in a long series of Mexican trade surpluses with the United States as the steep devaluation of the peso hurts America's third-largest export market.
The trade gap with Mexico was $863 million in January after a $19 million surplus in December. Such figures seem certain to worsen: Some economists are expecting a deficit with Mexico of $15 billion or more this year as a recession caused by Mexico's economic austerity plan begins to bite into that country's imports. But the White House can hardly complain about the Mexican austerity plan, because its Treasury Department wrote much of it.
"Mexico has to run a big trade surplus with us if this plan has a chance of working," a senior Administration official said recently. "But it is not going to be easy to explain that to workers in Texas or California."
Until recently, the Administration was boasting that 700,000 new jobs had been created in the last year because of increased trade with Mexico. Now, no one in the Administration wants to speculate, at least publicly, about what could happen to many of those jobs in the next year.
"We're seeing a lot of bad things happen simultaneously," said Lawrence Chimerine, the chief economist of the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington research organization that advocates a more aggressive trade stance. "In a few months this is going to be a political issue again, and an issue of economic growth."
Yet trade has hardly been mentioned in the months since the Republicans took control of both houses of Congress. That is little surprise at a time of continued economic expansion and low unemployment. But it usually flares up as a political issue as soon as there is any evidence of economic slowdown in which critics can argue that imports are costing American jobs.
The quandary for the Clinton Administration is that the classic economic solution for a big trade gap -- a weaker dollar that makes American exports less expensive abroad and imports more expensive -- could not only prove to be a political liability but is also unlikely to provide any relief this time around.
Already, the dollar's low levels against the German mark and the yen are hurting American prestige. So the Administration is hardly in a position to push the dollar lower. And even if it wanted to, the weak dollar is unlikely to help American exporters in the markets that count the most: Japan, Mexico, Canada and China.
For reasons that are as complex and confused as the trading relationship between Tokyo and Washington, the deficit with Japan has been virtually immune to currency shifts. The two countries have been trying for a decade to narrow the trade gap, only to find the effort frustrated by Japanese trade barriers, an inability by Detroit to overcome Japan's advantage in the automobile industry that accounts for much of the gap, and a low American savings rate, which requires constant injections of capital from abroad to finance both private investment and Government borrowing.
In fact, Japan was one of the few bright spots in today's trade report, with the deficit in the trade in goods -- a figure that excludes increasingly important American services like insurance and telecommunications -- declining to $4.86 billion, from $5.55 billion in December. But that decline was almost certainly a temporary result of the Kobe earthquake, which paralyzed one of Japan's busiest ports. Most Japanese companies have since worked out alternative routes for their exports.
Nor is the growing deficit with China, which jumped by a third in January to $2.72 billion, likely to be affected by the weakness of the dollar. China's currency loosely follows the dollar, as do the currencies of many of the Southeast Asian nations that also run large trade surpluses with the United States. And while the dollar is weak in comparison with the yen and the mark, it has strengthened by 50 percent in comparison with the peso, and is also stronger compared with the Canadian dollar.
The figures announced today indicated that exports in January totaled $60.70 billion in goods and services, while imports were $72.93 billion. The $12.23 billion deficit was $5 billion more than the December figure, and $4.8 billion more than the figure in January 1994.
The gap widened with most of American trade partners, with the deficit with Western Europe growing to $1.3 billion from $200 million and Asian nations contributing to about 80 percent of the total gap. The surplus with South and Central America fell sharply. But the deficit narrowed slightly with Canada.
Today's figures came out days before President Clinton is scheduled to begin a series of regional economic conferences around the country to listen to workers and business executives, and presumably to laud his Administration's economic successes.
In the past, he has always listed the nation's export boom as one of his proudest accomplishments, arguing that it creates jobs that are higher-paying than average. The statistics support his case. In political terms, however, the growing trade deficit may undercut his arguments that free trade is an undiluted advantage for American workers and companies.

HEADLINE: Christopher Says Russia May Pay High Price for Chechen War

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: GENEVA, March 22

 BODY:
Secretary of State Warren Christopher warned Russia today that its military intervention in Chechnya could delay its efforts to win quick integration into the West.
Describing Russia's invasion of Chechnya as "foolhardy" and "tragically wrong," Mr. Christopher said its actions there had badly hurt Russia's image overseas and could frustrate Moscow's desire to gain full participation in several international groups, including the Group of Seven industrial nations. 
 At a working dinner here tonight, the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei Koyzrev, told Mr. Christopher that his nation wanted to expand its role in the Group of Seven so that it was involved in not just political issues, but economic issues as well.
But, according to a senior aide, Mr. Christopher told the Russian diplomat, "Given the situation in Chechnya, it would probably be too much for the market to bear to have an enhanced Russian role."
Shortly before meeting Mr. Kozyrev, Mr. Christopher told reporters: "They're paying a high price of their reputation in the international community. They were on an incline in their acceptance by various international organizations. You can see that slowing."
One senior official indicated that Russia's invasion of Chechnya could also delay its membership in the World Trade Organization.
At their meeting, Mr. Kozyrev said he was confident that by early May, Russia would agree on ways to end a dispute in which the United States has criticized Moscow for selling submarines and other conventional arms to Iran. Administration said Mr. Kozyrev had indicated that Russia would scale back the amount of arms it is supposed to supply Iran under existing contracts.
Mr. Christopher also had some welcome words for Russia, saying it would be wrong to cut off aid to Moscow because of Washington's unhappiness over Chechnya and Russia's plans to build nuclear reactors in Iran.
Asserting that ending aid might hurt the United States more than Russia, Mr. Christopher said cutting off aid would undermine American interests by slowing Russia's conversion to a free-market economy and its dismantlement of nuclear weapons.
"Some people would say that we should punish Russia when it does something we don't like," said Mr. Christopher. "I've gone over our aid programs one by one, and I've concluded that restricting them would injure United States interests. It would hurt us at least as much or more than the Russians."
Noting that he studied the idea of using economic leverage to punish the Russians, Mr. Christopher said it would work against America's security interests to cut off the $500 million authorized to help Russia dismantle nuclear warheads. Similarly, any move to cancel the $379 million in economic aid promised Russia this year would backfire, he said, because this money is to be used to advance privatization and other program he said were vital for moving Russia closer to the West.
Defending Mr. Clinton's decision to visit Russia from May 9 to 11 to mark the 50th anniversary of the Allies' victory in World War II, Mr. Christopher said America's relationship with Russia was too important and broad to allow it to break down over one or two issues.
"It's important not to let it be held hostage by any particular issue," he said.

HEADLINE: Survivors of Collapse Lose All to Demolition

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Ethel Johnson and her boyfriend, Robert Jacob, watched in terror Tuesday morning from the living room of their Harlem apartment as half their life's possessions vanished from their bedroom in a thunderous rush.
Yesterday morning, as they stood sullenly in front of the building, they were told that a wrecking ball would claim the other half -- demolishing the eastern corner of their building at 142 West 140th Street, which officials condemned after determining that it was too unstable for anyone to enter again. 
 A couch, a television, a futon and a closet full of clothes, photos and personal papers -- everything that Ms. Johnson had slowly accumulated in nine years in her second-floor apartment -- was to be buried under a mountain of bricks and timber.
"It's not fair, it's not fair," said Ms. Johnson, 31, weeping quietly and wearing the only possessions she managed to salvage. "Maybe they think poor people's belongings don't mean anything to them. But they meant something to me."
For Ms. Johnson, Mr. Jacob and the dozens of people who occupied the 12 apartments that were most heavily damaged in the collapse of the building's east wall, the last 36 hours seemed like a dream in which the very fabric of their lives was ripped.
Yesterday, the couple lined up expectantly in front of the building with dozens of other residents, hoping to be allowed back in briefly to gather the things that mattered to them most -- a small amount of cash, legal documents and, most important, pictures, videos and mementos of Ms. Johnson's son.
While residents who lived in the intact parts of the building were let in with black trash bags to grab a week's change of clothes, medicine, money and credit cards, those who lived in the 12 collapsed apartments were not allowed to enter.
Mr. Jacob and Ms. Johnson were escorted as far as the threshold of their apartment, 2E, its front door torn from the hinges, before they were turned back by other officers. "I could see all of our stuff right there," said Ms. Johnson, weeping. "We could have just reached out and grabbed it."
Capt. Edward Cannon, one of the police officials who were escorting residents back into the building, broke the bad news when the couple asked when they would be able to get their things.
"It's going to be a loss, basically," he said. "I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do. It's a situation of life over property."
The couple's ordeal began soon after they rose early on Tuesday. Though he was usually difficult to get out of bed, Ms. Johnson' 4-year-old son, Krystian, got up on his own about 7:15 A.M.
As the couple lounged in their underwear and Krystian ate a bowl of bran flakes on his favorite Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles tray, they heard a noise that sounded like a clap of thunder from the bedroom where Krystian had just been sleeping.
"Ethel was yelling at me, 'Get up! Get up!" said Mr. Jacob, 25. "I ran back to the bedroom and I said, 'I can see daylight!' and she said, 'Daylight?' and I said, 'Daylight! Run! Run!"
The couple said the minutes that followed were the most terrifying of their lives. "We thought maybe the whole building was falling into a hole," Mr. Jacob said. "It felt like the rest of the building was going to come right down on us."
Ms. Johnson scooped up her son, clad only in long johns, and carried him into the hallway outside her apartment, where neighbors held him while she ran back in to try to call her family.
Mr. Jacob pulled on his pants, grabbed a coat and stumbled into the hallway, where he saw a woman in the adjacent apartment hoisting herself up from the precarious slope of her bedroom floor with a pair of blue jeans. "The jeans were on a hanger and she was pulling herself up on them like a rope," he said.
Before Ms. Johnson could get through to her family on the phone, neighbors grabbed her and rushed her from the building. "I guess the phone's still off the hook," she said yesterday, and then laughed when she realized how little that mattered now.
The couple spent the night of the collapse in a dingy room in the Belleclaire Hotel on the Upper West Side, where the Red Cross had placed at least five of the displaced families.
Krystian had been left for the night with his father and grandparents in West Harlem "because I wanted him to wake up in place he knew, not in some dirty hotel," Ms. Johnson said.
On Tuesday night, as Ms. Johnson, an unemployed home health aide, sat on a bed in the hotel, staring at three plastic bags full of items donated from friends -- a radio, an extra pair of pants, some shampoo -- she recounted that the building's collapse, as terrifying as it had been, was simply the finale in a series of smaller collapses.
Last year, the ceiling in the kitchen and the bathroom had caved in, she said. She said the leaks were so bad that sometimes she was forced to sit on the toilet with an umbrella over her head to keep dry.
Just last week, there was a leak in a hallway so big "that you could have gotten a washcloth and taken a shower in it," said Mr. Jacob, who is unemployed and had lived in the apartment for nearly a year.
"A week before that, all the lights had gone out one night -- no emergency lights, nothing," he said, relating how he had used a cigarette lighter to find his way upstairs.
While the building had been in fairly good condition when Ms. Johnson moved in in 1986, paying a rent of $215 a month, for the last three years it had been falling apart, even as her rent increased to $350, she said. She and several other residents said there was no heat or hot water during most of the winter.
More and more, they said, squatters were breaking into the building at night using a knife or a plastic card to jimmy the antiquated lock.
"And there were times when you'd come in and the hallway would be filled with smoke, like burning rubber, I guess from the boiler," Ms. Johnson said. "You'd just go into your apartment and shut your door and just hope nothing blew up."
Yesterday, as the couple stood in the rain with empty black plastic bags, waiting for the Red Cross to ferry them back to the Belleclaire Hotel, Ms. Johnson said that as bad as it got, at least it was a roof over their heads.
"What were we going to do?" she asked. "We didn't have enough money to move anywhere else. Now we've got nothing."

Trade Deficit's Unexpected Rise Sends the Dollar to Lower Levels

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar slumped against most leading currencies yesterday after a report showed that the United States trade deficit swelled sharply in January, much more than most analysts expected.
The large trade gap hurts the dollar by putting a wealth of dollars into the hands of foreign exporters, who sell them for their own currencies when taking revenue home. 
 Steady in European trading, the dollar fell after the Commerce Department said the deficit in goods and services widened to $12.2 billion in January, $5 billion more than in December. Economists had been expecting a deficit of $9.3 billion. .
"The number is just a shocker," said David De Rosa, director of foreign exchange trading at Swiss Bank in New York. "The dollar is dropping on this number. It means there are more dollars to be sold by our trading partners."
But while the trade gap was severe, the impact on the dollar was relatively restrained. Indeed, the dollar pared its losses briefly in early New York trading as investors focused on one bit of positive news in the report: a narrowing in the trade deficits with Germany and Japan. The United States deficit with Japan fell to $4.9 billion in January from $5.55 billion in December, while the gap with Germany shrank to $988 million from $1.1 billion.
"People are pointing to the two places where the dollar has been the weakest: Germany and Japan," said Ravi Bulchandani, international economist at Morgan Stanley. The dollar has fallen 10 percent against the German mark and 11 percent against the Japanese yen so far this year.
In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.4030 marks from 1.4132 marks on Tuesday. The dollar slipped to 89.00 yen from 89.27 yen, a record low for late New York trading and near its record intraday low of 88.40 yen, which it touched in trading on Tuesday.
Despite its muted reaction yesterday, the dollar remains vulnerable, currency dealers and analysts said.
"The U.S. is spending more than it is producing," said Michael Perelstein, director of international investments for the MacKay Shields Financial Corporation, a money-management firm with $12 billion in assets. "As a result, the dollar is a structurally weak currency."
In addition to the huge trade deficit, the dollar is weighed down by Mexico's financial turmoil and the growing belief that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates again soon.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Treasury Issues End the Day Mixed

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, despite concerns over the weakness of the dollar and signs of brisk consumer demand.
The price of the 30-year bond slipped 1/32 , to 102 4/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, edged up to 7.45 percent, from 7.44 percent on Tuesday. But the rates on shorter-maturity bills dropped slightly as some investors sold longer maturities for the less volatile short end of the market. The yield on the two-year note fell to 6.70 percent from 6.72 percent. 
 The market's mixed performance came after the Commerce Department reported that the United States trade deficit widened 68 percent, to $12.2 billion, in January. Imports continued to climb, to a record $72.9 billion for the month, suggesting that consumer demand remains strong.
The market's ability to remain stable after such a strong number suggested to some traders and analysts that the market was confident in the ability of the Federal Reserve to engineer a "soft landing" for the economy. Economists regard a soft landing as a slowdown in economic expansion to a 2.5 percent annual rate, compared with 4 percent last year.
"A higher trade deficit means lower G.D.P. growth, assuming everything else remains the same," said Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in New York.
But the trade report failed to lift the market, she said, because it "has already reacted, or priced in a slow-growth scenario, so what the market now needs is evidence that the economy is either heading into a recession, or that growth is at a very meager pace, for it to do much better."
The bond market was also weighed down by the continued weakness of the dollar, which slumped after the release of the trade data.
Elsewhere in the market, the Treasury announced the size of next week's auctions of new two- and five-year notes. On Tuesday, the Treasury will auction $17.25 billion of notes with a two-year maturity and on Wednesday $11 billion of notes due in five years. In when-issued trading late in the day the notes were being offered at prices to yield 6.76 percent for a two-year note and 7.05 percent for a five-year note.
Yields in the municipal market were little changed in trading, as California sold $385.53 million of general obligation bonds through competitive bidding won by BA Securities.
A major portion of the financing, series BD, BE, BF, is subject to the Federal alternative minimum tax, which means some purchasers of the bonds will have income from the securities taxed at a higher rate. Yields for serial bonds range from 5.20 percent in 2000 to 6.20 percent in 2012 and 2016. Longer-maturity bonds are priced to yield 6 3/8 percent for an issue due in 2027; 6.55 percent for a bond due in 2025; 6.40 percent for those due in 2020 and 2022, and 6.25 percent for those due in 2014.
Bonds not subject to the alternative tax, series BC, are priced to yield from 5.10 percent in 2000 to 6.10 percent in 2015, with a longer maturity of 2018 priced to yield 6.15 percent.
The financing is rated A1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and A+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. Bonds due in 2016 and 2027 are insured by the Ambac Indemnity Corporation and are rated triple-A by the rating agencies.

HEADLINE: The Early Bird Gets the Audition;
Lining Up for Hours to Sing for Three Minutes or Less

BYLINE: By JENNIFER KINGSON BLOOM 

 BODY:
At 6 A.M. Monday, the sun was still weak in the sky but 35 actors had already lined up by the Actors' Equity Association building on West 46th Street, waiting to sign up for auditions that would begin at 8 A.M. First in line was Alexandra Kolb, who had risen at 2 A.M., driven an hour from Lacey, N.J., and parked herself at the building entrance at 4:30 A.M.
"It just keeps getting earlier and earlier," sighed Ms. Kolb, who at 22 is a four-year veteran of the New York audition scene. "This month is the craziest I've ever seen it." 
 Being first in line meant Ms. Kolb would be able to get an appointment for an audition -- dozens would be turned away -- and could choose a coveted early slot, when casting directors are fresh. Six hours of waiting would earn her a chance to sing for three minutes, auditioning for leading roles in the Broadway and road versions of "Phantom of the Opera."
"Sometimes, they only let you sing six bars," said Ms. Kolb, pulling her coat tight against the spring chill. "Sometimes, it's only eight bars."
By 10 A.M., more than 500 people had made the pilgrimage to the second-floor waiting room at Actors' Equity, which this month resembles an airport terminal with all flights canceled.
March is the height of the auditioning season for Actors' Equity, with a total of 202 auditions, including 44 for Broadway shows and 65 for summer stock. (The slowest month, last October, saw only 33 auditions.) Union rules require that Broadway productions hold tryouts every six months, and a large concentration of these legendary cattle calls happen to being falling right now. For many actors, the tedium of waiting to sign up for an audition time is enhanced by the futility: many of the auditioning Broadway shows don't actually have openings.
But it is in the spring that summer-stock directors converge in New York, casting central, desperately seeking the perfect Stella or the ultimate Peter Pan. Performing in chestnuts in small towns may not be every actor's thespian ideal, but it offers a paycheck as well as experience .
Susan Levin has played the Baroness and Maria in summer productions of "The Sound of Music," once on a tour of New Jersey and once in Lake Placid, N.Y. She recently auditioned for a summer job with a theater company in Allenberry, Pa.
"I have a wonderful job as a full professor with tenure, but I can't stop doing this," said Ms. Levin, who teaches literature at the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken. This month, Ms. Levin and thousands of fellow actors will audition for, among other shows, an "Evita" in Oklahoma, a "Gigi" at the North Shore Music Theater in Beverly, Mass., and a "Forever Plaid" in Forestburgh, N.Y.
More and more performers from around the country are flocking to the sidewalk of 46th Street near Broadway, convinced that he or she is that one singular sensation. The odds of being discovered are long and the discomfort is severe, but dreams die hard.
"This is the third time I've come for a 'Phantom' audition, and I did get called back once," said Todd Frizzell, 37, a Denver native who went from the audition to his day job as a tour guide at Macy's. Mr. Frizzell was 99th in line and had arrived at 6:50 A.M. "My break may not be until I'm 60, but I'm willing to accept a lot of anguish. It's all formative to the artistic process."
Of 36,000 members of the Actors' Equity Association, 18,000 live in the New York metropolitan area. In 1988, the National Labor Relations Bureau required the union to open auditions to nonmembers who had logged enough hours on stage; there are 7,000 such "eligible performers" nationally, including 4,500 in the New York area.
Tony Nicosia Jr., who has directed the Actors' Equity audition department since 1982, said that auditioning has become more humane. Before the present system, actors used to have to wait all day for a chance to audition, and many were turned away when time ran out. Now, actors sign up in the morning for time slots. Each casting director sees 120 people, and latecomers are placed on a seldom-tapped waiting list.
Last month, Actors' Equity surveyed 500 members and found that 47 percent had found jobs through open casting calls. In calls for chorus work, which has its own system, casting directors size up the hopefuls who show up and point to those who resemble the "type" they are seeking before holding auditions.
On a recent weekday, 350 women showed up for a chorus call for "Big," a new Broadway musical, based on the Tom Hanks movie, that will open in October. The notice advertising the audition in the trade newspaper Back Stage called for "young suburban parents of babies, young teen-agers, New York corporate lawyers . . . various Times Square street people and Manhattan yuppies."
Only 100 were given a chance to sing half a song and hoof a few steps. Vincent G. Liff, the casting director for "Big" and "Phantom of the Opera," who turned away no less than 250 women for "Big" alone, called the turnout "frightening" but said the system, while patience-trying, was valuable. "We have cast dozens and dozens of people through these calls," Mr. Liff said.
Many actors try to prove their versatility. Richard Rice Alan, who was 100th in line on Monday, had glossy photographs of himself scowling in a black turtleneck, cheerful in a casual work shirt and looking corporate in a business suit. "I have three different looks," said Mr. Alan, who while in line read the book "Monologues for Men."
"I've waited out here in the rain for an hour and a half before, so this isn't so bad today," Mr. Alan said. A Houston native, he sold his belongings and arrived in New York last year with a small suitcase and big aspirations. "I'm trying to get an agent so I don't have to do this anymore," he said.
Once in the sparse audition rooms, actors must sing with passion or emote for one to three casting directors. The only other soul in the room is a pianist. Unemployed union members are hired to monitor the waiting room, where people apply makeup, read trade magazines and fuss with garment bags and costumes.
The crush is so great that Mr. Nicosia sometimes has trouble getting to his office. "It's a zoo, but this is the life of the actor," he said.
As is the early morning sidewalk scene, where the weary and unshaven dozed, warbled bits of song and fought the cold with coffee. Diane and Thomas Bradshaw, husband and wife who were third and fourth in line, had invested in a footstool and took turns sitting from 4:50 A.M. until the doors opened.
"You never know which day is going to be the lucky one," Mrs. Bradshaw said.

Hopefuls started lining up Monday at 4:30 A.M. to sign up for auditions at Actors' Equity on West 46th Street in response to casting calls in trade publications. "This month is the craziest I've ever seen it," said Alexandra Kolb, in her resume picture at right, who got up at 2 A.M. to be first in line. (pg.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
A simple proposal for cutting down on securities fraud suits.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
LET'S say you run a video game company. You've just been told that promised deliveries of this year's planned blockbuster, "Burn 'Em in Salem," will be delayed at least three months. The trouble is that the pitiful screams of the witches in the test version cannot be heard above the roar of the flames.
Who do you call first? Your ad agency? The big retail chains? Members of the corporate board? Ghostbusters? 
 More likely, the company's lawyers. For once the delay is announced, your stock is probably headed for a nose dive. And frequently -- arguably much too frequently -- securities fraud lawyers will be filing lawsuits on behalf of those who bought the stock (or chose not to sell it) on the implied promise that you were all set to send children to bed each night dreaming of incinerating witches.
Admittedly, not all cases in which a stock takes a sudden plunge lead to shareholder lawsuits. The law, after all, requires evidence of fraud or deceit to win a suit in Federal court. But enough horror stories about frivolous lawsuits aimed more at extracting big settlements than proving malfeasance have made the rounds that many lawmakers are convinced something needs to be done to curb the practice.
Representative Christopher Cox, a Republican from California, wrote the original draft of what is now known as the Securities Litigation Reform Act and shepherded a modified version of the proposal through the House. It is now pending in the Senate, where it faces a tougher battle. "The bill addresses all the key concerns," he says.
But does it? Experts who are sympathetic to the need to rein in securities suits see the final House bill as an unwieldy patchwork that will require years of court tests before its impact becomes clear. "Eventually," concluded Lester Brickman, a professor at the Benjamin Cardozo Law School in New York, "we'd find out just how many angels can dance on the head of this pin." Instead, Professor Brickman just may have a better idea.
In recent years, stockholders' lawsuits have grown like weeds. Originally seen as a desirable way to encourage full and timely disclosure, many people now believe that such litigation on behalf of injured "classes" has taken on a life of its own.
The law has not changed, but the aggressiveness of the plaintiffs' bar has. Hundreds of class action suits on securities fraud are filed in Federal court each year.
So what is wrong with that? Plenty. As Elliot Weiss of the University of Arizona Law School and John Beckerman of Cardozo Law School write in a forthcoming article in the Yale Law Journal, the market for such litigation responds to perverse incentives in which the cost of defending against these suits far exceeds the cost of pursuing them. Even where cases clearly lack merit, few defendants are prepared to spend millions of dollars in a lengthy discovery process or run the risk of a jury decision that might bankrupt the company. Rare as such extreme outcomes may be, the more prudent action is usually to settle any suit that survives the initial motion to dismiss. And because the burden of proof at the early stage is so low, most cases, legal experts for defendants say, make it past that first hurdle.
The House bill attempts to even the playing field, as Representative Cox put it, to help corporations avoid having "to pay ransom to the Barbary pirates." It includes measures ranging from a "loser pays" rule to a tougher standard of proof of fraud.
The corporate defense bar has probably gotten as much as it is going to get in the House bill. Still, Michael Halloran, general counsel for the Bank of America, is underwhelmed. "I give this bill a 7 at best on a 10-point scale," he said.
That's where Professor Brickman's idea comes in. He offers a disarmingly simple proposal that would eliminate institutional investors -- mutual funds, pension funds and the like -- from any class action fraud suit. They could file parallel fraud suits if they wished, but could not simply go along for the ride.
If the institutions chose not to sue, Mr. Brickman notes, the potential liability of the defendants (and the potential fees to plaintiffs' lawyers) would most likely be halved since institutions generally control about half the shares of most corporations. And if the institutions felt the case was worthwhile, the courts would generally consolidate the case, limiting the power of the plaintiffs' bar to run up fees. That could be better for everybody but the lawyers.
Would such a plan take a big whack at legal extortion? No one knows for sure. The Securities and Exchange Commission is uneasy about the House bill, fearing that it goes too far to undermine legitimate shareholder rights. But Simon Lorne, the S.E.C.'s general counsel, is prepared to say that the Brickman proposal at least "deserves further study."
Indeed, the highest virtue of the Brickman plan is that it represents an entirely fresh attempt to unravel a hopelessly twisted knot.

HEADLINE: Turkey Crosses a Line

 BODY:
In one of Turkey's largest foreign military operations since the days of the Ottoman Empire, 35,000 troops poured across its border with Iraq this week to attack the Kurdish guerrilla group known as the Kurdistan Workers Party, or P.K.K. Turkey contends its only purpose is to destroy a violent separatist group by wiping out its Iraqi base camps. But sending troops across another nation's border is a violation of international law that deserves harsh condemnation. The world would become even more dangerous if countries with strong armies and border frustrations felt free to take the law into their own hands.
France, which currently leads the European Union, a group Turkey desperately wants to join, has rightly condemned this invasion. The United States should have condemned it too. Instead, Washington, along with Moscow, has expressed understanding for the Turkish attack. 
 The P.K.K. is a Marxist revolutionary group that engages in deadly terrorism. But this foray into Iraq is symptomatic of Turkey's military approach to the whole Kurdish issue, of which P.K.K. terrorism is merely one element. Harshly repressive army tactics in Kurdish areas of southeastern Turkey have created a million and a half internal Kurdish refugees as well as driving thousands more into Iraq. These tactics have also encouraged five million Turkish Kurds to migrate to cities in other regions of the country. Kurds make up one-fifth of Turkey's population. No government can deliver on promises of democracy and economic growth if it wages so vast an internal war.
The fact that the international border being violated in this case is Iraq's should not obscure the underlying principle. Saddam Hussein may not show much respect for international frontiers, but the sanctity of borders was one of the main causes the Persian Gulf war's coalition fought to uphold.
The region of Iraq in which Turkish troops are now operating is currently under Western military protection as a result of the gulf war. That operation requires Turkish cooperation and rear bases on Turkish soil. That factor probably explains Washington's rush to bless the Turkish invasion.
But the only legitimate American military purpose in northern Iraq is to protect Kurdish civilians from Saddam Hussein's forces. Holding those forces at bay while Turkey invades Iraq is an abuse of American military power and an affront to the United Nations, whose authority governs American military activities in northern Iraq.
The Turkish Government has been promising that its operations in Iraq will be quickly completed. But now it says the fighting could last a month. The Clinton Administration has clearly bought into more than a brief border incursion. It is not too late for America to take a more principled stand.

HEADLINE: What Made the Dollar Swoon? Try the Deficit

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Peter Passell's March 16 Economic Scene column on the dollar ignores the most important factor behind the long-term decline of the dollar relative to most major currencies: the prospect that our huge budget and trade deficits will remain unless policies are changed. 
 With respect to trade, the lion's share of the deficit is with Japan and Southeast Asia. It reflects not market forces or disparate growth rates but the known barriers that keep United States exports or export-promoting investment out of those economies, as well as the use of high profits from those protected markets to subsidize cheap exports to the wide-open United States market.
Regarding Japan in particular, these structural factors hold down imports even when the yen is stong and even when the Japanese economy is growing. Worse, recycling its dollar surpluses in United States holdings is no longer so attractive to Japan -- both because previous dollar depreciation stuck Japanese investors with huge losses in America, and because Japan's domestic needs beckon. The combination of these factors puts downward pressure on the dollar and upward pressure on the yen.
The dollar's latest swoon also proves that the conventional wisdom on trade policy has been wrong -- United States activism was never responsible for the dollar's weakness, and macroeconomic mechanisms alone will not significantly reduce America's trade deficits with Asia in ways consistent with long-term national economic health.
The dollar can reverse its slide against the yen only if Japanese markets are opened and Japanese demand for dollars to buy American goods rises. It's time for stronger trade efforts, not surrender.
At the same time, our Federal budget deficit is also hurting the dollar, especially because of our need for foreign capital to finance it; talk of substantial tax cuts, and growing resistance to big cuts in domestic programs, have raised questions about whether or not deficits will be reduced.
To demonstrate real seriousness on deficit reduction, the President should postpone his tax cut until the deficit is lower, send a clear message to the Republicans that he will veto their tax cuts if they reach his desk and take a first step toward serious entitlement reform. These moves would also help stabilize the dollar against the yen and against the German mark and other currencies.

Happy V-E Day, Boris

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The accommodationists in charge of Clinton foreign policy put on a show of internal agonizing about whether to celebrate the golden anniversary of V-E Day in Moscow.
A visit by a U.S. President is eagerly sought by foreign leaders. President Nixon bombed Haiphong and mined its harbor confident that Leonid Brezhnev would not let that action interfere with an upcoming Moscow summit. Contrary to the dire predictions of dovish commentators, Nixon's provocative escalation did not stop the Moscow meeting. 
 Boris Yeltsin has just worked that same maneuver on Bill Clinton. Two headlines on the same page of The New York Times tell the story: "Russia Pounds Rebel Positions Outside Capital of Chechnya" and "Clinton Will Go to Moscow and Meet With Yeltsin in May."
Mr. Yeltsin desperately needs this meeting; why didn't Mr. Clinton use that need to gain major concessions beforehand?
Because he cannot tell a fig leaf from a real concession. In return for Mr. Clinton's propping up his increasingly autocratic Russian rule, Yeltsin promised not to embarrass the visiting American with a parade of the tanks that crushed resistance in Grozny.
As an added symbolic treat, Yeltsin will refrain from displaying nuclear missiles, lest they remind Americans of his deal with Iran to supply nuclear facilities that will enable the ayatollahs to build weapons to threaten U.S. cities.
Our naive President snatched the fig leaves and passed up the substance. It seems Mr. Clinton never learns; his last such blunder was to travel to Damascus to honor the leader of a nation high on our terrorist list. In return, Hafez al-Assad publicly stuck his thumb in Mr. Clinton's eye.
As critics like Senator Bob Dole deride his "Yeltsin-First" policy, Mr. Clinton will seek in Moscow what he failed to obtain in advance. Not a cessation of the brutal suppression of the Chechens' reach for autonomy; Clinton's pre-emptive cave-in has already given Yeltsin an additional six weeks to kill opponents. (To prevent the ironic juxtaposition of film clips at V-E Day ceremonies, Russian commanders may give the Chechen civilians a day off.)
Instead, Clinton's payoff for boosting Yeltsin's popularity should be an undoing of the Russian-Iranian nuclear deal. He must prevail on the Russian President to "do a Conoco" -- to sacrifice undoubted economic benefits by pulling back from a deal that would help make the dangerous Iranians a superpower.
If Clinton comes home from Moscow with less than that, his trip will not only be interpreted as having given Yeltsin a dismaying free pass on Chechnya, but as a personal diplomatic disaster.
We can also expect some Dole-deflection: well-photographed meetings with human rights leaders, long sessions with Russian reformers like Grigory Yavlinsky and Boris Nemtsov, a cold shoulder to Vladimir Zhirinovsky and Communist-agrarian apparatchiks. In his TV address to the Russian people, Clinton must not fail to dissociate the U.S. from the use of force in Chechnya.
On another aspect of his observance of the golden anniversary of World War II's end, I cannot cavil at Clinton's decision to skip London. The British Prime Minister, John Major, put the "special relationship" into a deep freeze with his contemptuous treatment of U.S. views on Bosnia. As Clinton showed on St. Patrick's Day -- courting Irish-American votes by turning the White House into an I.R.A. fund-raising platform -- it is now payback time.
Can you imagine Ike snubbing London on V-E Day? Or Ronald Reagan insulting Margaret Thatcher that way? Nope; Mr. Major has only his arrogance to blame. Would that Clinton had similarly suggested to Yeltsin that actions have consequences.
Looking ahead to V-J Day on Aug. 15, the Clinton Administration denies renaming it "Victory in the Pacific Day"; the reported renaming was probably a concoction of our hypersensitive Tokyo embassy.
This recalls the story of the Japanese tourist who walked down Broadway to 34th Street and, standing in front of the world's largest store, politely inquired of a New Yorker: "Where is Macy's?" To which the unforgetting native replied: "Pearl Harbor you found."

BYLINE: Reuters 

 BODY:
The Fingerhut Companies said yesterday that a slowdown in sales of big ticket items would mean lower earnings than previously expected. In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, shares of Fingerhut closed down $3.125 at $11.125. The company, a direct merchandiser of brand name and private label merchandise that is based in Minneapolis, said a slowdown in consumer spending was hitting its bottom line. The company said it expected first-quarter earnings to be 2 cents to 3 cents a share below consensus expectations of 15 cents to 17 cents a share. Second-quarter earnings are expected to be reduced by about 18 cents a share from consensus expectations, based on a continuation of current economic and consumer spending trends.

Carat Opening New York Office

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
The Aegis Group P.L.C., which owns Carat, Europe's largest media services company, said yesterday that Carat was opening an office, to be named Carat North America, in New York.
"This is a toe in the water," said Roger Parry, the former group development director of Aegis, who was named group vice president of Carat North America. "Within a few years' time, I suspect we'll be in it up to our neck." Aegis had hoped to expand into North America three or four years ago, he added, but postponed those plans to digest several acquisitions in Europe and wait out the worldwide advertising recession. 
 Initially, Mr. Parry said, the office would serve "as a gateway," making it easier for North American clients to work with Carat in Europe. Eventually, he added, the goal is to help serve advertisers' media needs in North America. The office, which opens today, is at 636 Broadway, between Houston and Bleecker Streets, in Manhattan.
Carat handles the media planning and buying on accounts with billings estimated at $6 billion for clients like Cadbury Schweppes P.L.C., Reckitt & Colman P.L.C. and Volkswagen A.G. Of that, about $1 billion is from handling media services in Europe for American marketers like the Walt Disney Company, the Kellogg Company and the Philip Morris Companies.

HEADLINE: Where the Everyday Is a Scarcity

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: CAMPBELLTOWN, W.Va.

 BODY:
For nearly a century, most residents of this tumbledown mountain hamlet 80 miles east of Charleston have been drawing their drinking water from a common well on a hillside just above the town's 70 houses.
Three years ago, state officials found that the water was contaminated with pollutants, and issued an order to boil it before drinking. 
 Like most other people in Campbelltown, Carroll Barlow says it is high time that she and her neighbors were finally hooked up to the municipal water system in Marlinton, less than a mile away. But neither the state nor the local governments can afford to pay for the pipes or the pumps to carry the water up the valley.
"I hope I live long enough to get safe water in this house," said Ms. Barlow, 55, who says she has to clean her sinks and toilet twice a day to deal with rust-colored stains that the water from the well leaves behind.
State officials say no medical problems can be traced to the water, but Ms. Barlow is not taking any chances. She uses the well water only for washing and buys drinking water in 69-cent gallon jugs at the Foodland grocery store in Marlinton.
From small communities like Campbelltown to isolated hollows with no names, access to reliable supplies of clean drinking water has long been a problem in West Virginia. The state's rugged geography, coupled with the endemic poverty of rural Appalachia, has severely limited the ability of both local and state government to extend water lines. Neither the state nor the Federal Government is required to connect isolated residents to existing water systems, and money to build water or sewerage systems to spur economic development in rural areas is likely to become increasingly scarce.
"We just can't do everything," said W. D. Smith, a regional director of the Appalachian Regional Commission, a Federal agency that helps promote economic development but is a perennial target of budget-cutters in Congress.
Mr. Smith said that with so many communities seeking financing for new systems, only those that could demonstrate an unusually urgent need or immediate economic benefit would succeed.
"We've got a third-world situation here," he said. "I've seen human suffering, old people, people coming to me in tears. But I always have to ask them, 'What's so unusual about your situation?' It's not enough anymore just to say they don't have any water."
A recent study by the Agriculture Department concluded that more than a million people living in rural sections around the country, including large parts of the Mississippi Delta and areas along the Mexican border, did not have clean drinking water piped into their homes. But experts say no other state has so large a percentage of its population unserved by municipal systems as West Virginia. By the state's own estimate, almost a quarter of its 1.8 million people have no access to municipal water, and 40 percent are not served by public sewerage.
West Virginians who do not get municipal water rely mostly on wells; in places, a single well serves an entire community. Water drawn from the wells must in some cases be boiled or chemically treated to remove impurities like the contaminants that seep into underground water reservoirs from abandoned coal mines. People living near active mines are especially vulnerable to pollution; even subtle shifts in rock formations can unloose new contaminants into the aquifers that supply well water, or even destroy the aquifers altogether.
Senator Robert C. Byrd's ability to funnel Federal money home for West Virginia's highway system and other programs is legendary, but officials say state agencies have only recently focused on water and sewerage needs to bolster economic development. Last year voters approved a $300 million bond issue for water and sewerage projects.
"More people are being served now," said Amy Swann, a division director at West Virginia's Public Service Commission. "But there will always be people who won't be served. It's just too expensive to spend $1 million to construct a water line to hollows where 12 people live."
State officials say water problems exist in all 55 of West Virginia's counties but most acutely in the rugged eastern half of the state. Here, amid thick forests of maple, elm and oak, gurgling rivers and dazzling scenic overlooks, dozens of small communities, some with fewer than 100 residences, straddle narrow mountain roads that once served rich coal mines and timber stands.
The coal and timber industries are long past their peak, but many of the children and grandchildren of the workers remain, drawing from the same wells or roadside springs, some in use for more than 60 years. Most of the people are now too old, too poor or too proud to move.
In Marlinton itself, the latest problem is that officials do not have the $3 million needed to carry water from the town's water plant to the new hospital, which was built on a hill to keep it above the flood-prone banks of the Greenbrier River.
For now, the hospital, scheduled to open this summer, will draw its water from the well that serves the local school, across the street. "We're struggling to find the funding," said Marlinton's Mayor, Douglas Dunbrack, who doubts that the well water supply will be adequate for the hospital, which is intended to serve some 9,000 people in eastern West Virginia. "We need a big-time grant, but there's just no money available."

HEADLINE: DIARY;
Yesterday in Washington

 BODY:

LINE-ITEM VETO -- The Senate voted 69 to 29 to give the President the power to veto specific items in spending bills. The measure, passed in another form in the House, is a central part of the Republicans' Contract With America. The measure could produce a major power shift in Washington and could give the Democratic White House a far more potent say over the Republican agenda.
 
WELFARE REFORM -- The House voted 426 to 5 to require states to adopt procedures to suspend driver's licenses and professional licenses of people who fail to pay child support that they owe. It provided a victory for President Clinton, one of the few he has enjoyed on welfare legislation. But Mr. Clinton still opposes the overall bill, which would make vast changes in social welfare programs enacted over the last 60 years. 

PROPERTY RIGHTS -- Senate Republicans introduced legislation requiring the Government to pay "just compensation" for taking private property. The bill requires that owners get compensation if their property has been taken for public use, if their rights have been abridged, if they have been deprived of the economic benefits of the land or if the property is diminished in value by one-third. A similar measure has been approved by the House.
 
SMUT IN CYBERSPACE -- In a move that pushes the battles over free speech and pornography onto the electronic frontier, the Senate Commerce Committee approved a proposal that would subject people who transmit indecent or pornographic material over a computer network to fines as high as $10,000 and jail terms of up to two years.
 
THE ENVIRONMENT -- The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee approved relatively modest changes in how the Government writes rules protecting health, safety and the environment. A House version replaces health considerations with economic calculations of costs and benefits as the main factor in setting protective standards, while the measure the panel passed calls for agencies to make "a reasonable determination" that the benefits of a rule justify the costs.

HEADLINE: Senate Limits Rule Changes On Health

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23

 BODY:
Considerably softening the radical changes that the House of Representatives approved last month, a Senate committee today approved relatively modest changes in how the Federal Government writes rules protecting health, safety and the environment.
The most important difference is that the version endorsed by Republicans and Democrats alike on the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee would not replace health considerations with economic calculations of costs and benefits as the main factor in setting protective standards under environmental laws. 
 Instead, the Senate bill calls for agencies to make "a reasonable determination" that the benefits of a rule justify the costs if such a finding is "not expressly or implicitly inconsistent with the statute under which the agency is acting."
If that language prevails over the House's, it will remove the central objection raised by the Clinton Administration, which opposes overturning the health-based standards of existing environmental laws.
But the Senate could also debate other alternatives that more closely resemble the House bill, including one sponsored by Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader. His version awaits consideration in the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Separately, conservative senators including Mr. Dole and his rival for the Republican Presidential nomination, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, reached agreement on a proposal to compensate property owners when their land loses value because of regulations restricting its development. Their proposal is at least as far reaching as the House version.
Although both the House and Senate bills are principally directed at preventing Federal regulators from interfering with development when they enforce laws protecting endangered species and wetlands, the Senate bill would also compensate landowners when other kinds of regulations reduce property values by at least one-third.
Both developments today reflected cautious jockeying for position among moderates and conservatives, especially Republicans, over how the Senate should handle the anti-regulatory proposals that the House has passed as part of its new Republican majority's Contract with America.
The Administration and its environmentalist allies have been hoping that the Senate will water down the House measures, which if enacted would dramatically restrict the Government's ability to enforce laws like the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species Act and laws on toxic and hazardous wastes.
The Senate's course depends on whether moderate senators from both parties coalesce around proposals like the one unanimously approved today by the Governmental Affairs Committee. It is named after Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, the panel's chairman.
Like the measures that passed the House, the Roth bill calls for more extensive consideration by regulatory agencies of how best to reduce health and environmental risks and more examination of whether the expected benefits are worth the costs of proposed regulations.
But the Senate bill would apply to fewer rules -- those costing industries at least $100 million a year. It would not impose such an elaborate set of new procedures as the House bill and would not subject agency decisions to such extensive review by the courts.

HEADLINE: Cutbacks to Save Washington From Bankruptcy Leave Residents Angry and Fearful

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23

 BODY:
With magnolias in bloom, tour buses crowding the streets and other welcome signs of spring in the nation's capital all about, Ollie Blocker stood in the noonday sun thinking about rats.
"I'm scared to death," she said, "With the city not picking up the trash, I'm fearful of them entering my house. All that debris, you know, that's how they breed." 
 A mother of three who works as a janitor for the Department of Labor, Ms. Blocker was about to join a noisy protest on Wednesday, one of a series of recent demonstrations by a public employees union to protest the way that District of Columbia officials are trying to resolve the city's $722 million fiscal crisis.
Today, members of the same group, the Service Employees International Union, disrupted a City Council hearing, and 20 others barged into the office of Speaker Newt Gingrich and demanded to meet with him. Mr. Gingrich was out, but 9 were arrested, bringing to 258 the number of union employees arrested in protests this week.
Two weeks ago, protesters complaining about cuts in the Police Department budget interrupted a City Council meeting, but there was no swift response to calls for help because the protesters were police officers.
To address the budget problems, the city has begun service cutbacks, layoffs and negotiations to win wage concessions from unions. And even harsher measures could result from negotiations involving Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., other city officials and Federal lawmakers to develop a plan to save the city from bankruptcy. Legislation is expected to be introduced in Congress next week to create a financial oversight board that would manage the budget and recommend changes.
Meanwhile, residents like Ms. Blocker, who earn little more than the minimum wage, say they feel angry, frustrated and powerless over the cutbacks, contending that the cuts are steadily eroding the quality of their lives.
Ms. Blocker said that in her case the cutbacks had made a bad situation worse. The city's rat-baiting patrols have ignored the alley behind her house in the northwest section of Washington for nearly nine months, she said.
"This city has always had rat patrols," she said. "Now there's no money for it."
For Clifton Smith, the city's financial crisis has compounded problems that started with Federal cutbacks last year. In his last job as a janitor for the Post Office, he earned $5.75 an hour. With his girlfriend working as a clerk at a variety store, they could afford the $635-a-month rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the southeast section, where they lived with their three children.
But Federal cutbacks cost him his job last year, Mr. Smith said, and his girlfriend lost hers eight months ago when the store refused to hold her job after she left to give birth to their third child.
Three months ago, he said, their money ran out. Mr. Smith moved back with his parents, while his girlfriend and the children moved in with hers.
Mr. Smith has periodically worked on construction projects. But with Congress insisting on larger cutbacks for the city than Mayor Barry has been willing to make, he said he was discouraged about finding steady work any time soon.
"When we were both working we were making ends meet," he said. "Now, I can't find anything. The city is getting rid of everybody. I'm hanging in there but only by a thin thread."
For the sake of his children, Mr. Smith said, he has vowed to avoid the opportunities of earning money illegally.
"It's crossed my mind," he said. "People in the neighborhood are selling drugs; everybody's kids have got to eat. But you've got to be stronger than that. You fight those thoughts because if you get caught, they will all be by themselves.
"But I know plenty of guys who have gone the other way. You just have to keep a positive attitude."
Jocelynn Johnson, who earns $30,000 a year working for the city's Department of Public Works, is fighting to maintain her middle-class status.
She has already felt the sting of two furlough days, and with Mayor Barry's plan that all non-essential city employees be furloughed for 10 days before the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, she said she was worried about falling behind on her car payments and rent of $550 a month.
Unlike Ms. Blocker and Mr. Smith, who said they believed that the Mayor was doing the best he could under trying circumstances, Ms. Johnson, who is 40 and single, said she believed he had not done nearly enough to ease the city's financial crisis. She cited the city's decision to stop picking up bagged leaves as an example.
"I was on his transition team," she said of Mayor Barry. "We gave him a plan for the city to make money by selling the leaves for mulch and compost. That way, the city is cleaner and the city makes money. But he didn't do it.
"Meanwhile, signs on the street where I live make me move my car so they can clean the street or else I get a ticket. I move my car, but they never clean the street."
"What's going on here is scary," she said. "It's very scary."

Morgan Now Seeks $1 Billion for Mexico

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
J. P. Morgan & Company is now seeking to raise $1 billion in financing for Mexico to help bolster that country's banking system, New York bankers said yesterday.
The planned financing, which would have a maturity of several years, is intended to replace an earlier $3 billion short-term bank loan, proposed in January but never brought to fruition. 
 The apparent failure to complete arrangements for that $3 billion in financing has raised concern that bankers are having cold feet as Mexico's financial crisis worsened.
But Mexican officials say that the revised plan reflects the realities of the financial support the country has since received from the United States and others since Jan. 9, when Mexico first requested the $3 billion to shore up its frail banking system.
Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz, in a letter dated Wednesday to his country's most important foreign bankers, said "a great deal has changed" since Jan. 9.
Mexico is now receiving nearly $50 billion of financial support from the International Monetary Fund, the United States and other countries, the minister wrote. So, a $3 billion bank loan, which would take some months to collect, "and then would only remain available until the end of this year, will not be of real benefit to Mexico," his letter said.
In the light of these circumstances, Mexico is now consulting with a number of banks to design a new, "market-based Government of Mexico" loan to support a Government program with the purpose of safeguarding Mexican banks.
In December Mexico devalued, then floated the peso, and in the last three months, the peso has lost roughly half its international exchange value, ending trading today at 6.90 to the dollar.
Many foreign investors who had eagerly rushed into Mexico in recent years to reap high returns have pulled out their money, their holdings having been badly mauled by the devaluation and by drops in Mexican stocks and bonds.
The Mexico City stock market rose today, with the main index closing at 1,615.70, up 24.54 points or 1.54 percent. For the year to date, however, the market has fallen nearly 32 percent in peso terms and just under 50 percent in dollar value. Some short-term debt notes have sold at a yield as high as 82 percent.
Amid all this, Mexico has been struggling to prevent damage to its banking system, also badly shaken by the peso's plunge.
Last year, the country allowed its current-account deficit, a broad measure of trade and services, to balloon. Mexico is now trying to follow a program of economic austerity to regain international confidence and increase exports.
The austerity program is imposing heavy economic costs on much of the middle and lower classes. And it is still not clear how bad the political repercussions will be for the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, which for decades has controlled Mexico's national Government as well as virtually all important state and local posts.
Mexico's commercial bankers seem to like the new economic program. The chairman of Citicorp, William R. Rhodes, told a group of American investors this week that the program was a good one, but he added that its success depended on its being carried out in disciplined fashion in order to restore confidence.

HEADLINE: Is Organized Crime Back at the Table?

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS

 BODY:
Just a few steps from the Cafe du Monde, a popular tourist spot here, is Frank's, a casual, Italian-style restaurant that not long ago caught the eye of a different class of sightseer -- the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The restaurant's habitues included some intriguing characters with nicknames like Noogie, Mr. A and Muffaletta Frank. And their table talk was not limited to food. Based largely on F.B.I. surveillance, Federal prosecutors won indictments last year of 17 suspected members or associates of the Marcello crime family here and the Genovese and Gambino families in New York. 
 Among other things, the 17 are accused of controlling a distributor of video poker machines and draining millions from the machines' manufacturer, Bally Gaming International Inc. All of those indicted have denied wrongdoing and say they have no ties to organized crime.
For their part, prosecutors say the scheme is a case study of how the mob is trying to take its place again at the nation's gambling tables. As sketched out in documents from regulatory hearings and bankruptcy filings and in search warrants, wiretapped conversations and the indictments themselves, it is a story of sour deals, greedy hustlers and terrified corporate executives that also raises questions about Bally Gaming's actions in the case.
The gambling industry has long been trying to shed its image as a mob-controlled domain for one in which publicly traded companies like Bally Gaming operate under regulatory scrutiny. Experts agree that the vast majority of gambling companies are now free of criminal influence.
But as more states race to open casinos, cracks may also be opening in the licensing and hiring process. Federal and state investigations in places as far apart as California and Minnesota suggest that organized criminals and other questionable operators may already have a foothold.
"You have a proliferation of gaming, which makes it ripe for a takeover by organized crime," said Wilmore W. Whitmore, president of the Louisiana Economic Development and Gaming Corporation, a state regulatory board.
Bally Gaming is still reeling from its experience in Louisiana. The company, based in Las Vegas, Nev., makes a variety of gambling equipment. Originally a unit of the Bally Entertainment Corporation, a casino operator, it was spun off in 1992.
Bally Gaming's troubles here grew out of a brief marriage of convenience that began in 1991, when it came looking for a local distributor to break into a lucrative new market. Prosecutors say that those lurking behind the company it found, Worldwide Gaming, were simply looking for a mark.
By the time the marriage unraveled in 1993, Bally Gaming says it was out about $18 million and Worldwide was in bankruptcy.
Because Worldwide was a start-up, Bally Gaming bankrolled its entire business and also lent it money to finance truck stop owners and others who wanted to lease or buy the company's machines. But Worldwide repaid little to Bally Gaming. A key reason was that payments collected from the machine operators by a company related to Worldwide were skimmed by the same mob figures who were behind the distributor, prosecutors have charged.
Views differ sharply, however, over whether Bally Gaming was an innocent victim or a victim of its own making. Some critics have questioned whether the company, in its haste to cash in on a gambling gold rush, overlooked or brushed aside warning signals.
Daniel Horgan, a lawyer for Bally Gaming, said that company executives did everything they could at the time to uncover problems at Worldwide and root them out. "Everything looks different with the benefit of 20-20 hindsight," he said.
But Mr. Whitmore, the state regulator, has his doubts, suggesting that organized crime figures may have found the perfect victim in Bally Gaming. "These guys probably couldn't believe it," he said. "They didn't even have to reach into their own pockets."
In January, a few weeks after an article appeared in The Times-Picayune of New Orleans questioning Bally Gaming's actions, Mr. Whitmore denied the company a permit to sell equipment to the giant Harrah's casino being built here, saying that Bally Gaming had allowed itself to be "infiltrated" by organized crime. He was overruled, however, by the full board. The board agreed with prosecutors, who described Bally Gaming as blameless, and it issued a temporary permit.
A fuller picture of the company's role is certain to emerge this fall, when those indicted go to trial.
The episode's roots stretch back to the passage in September 1991 of legislation that soon put video-poker machines in every bar and truck stop from New Orleans to Baton Rouge and beyond. Gambling-equipment manufacturers viewed the state as a bonanza, but the catch was that they would be required to operate through a local distributor.
The legislation also apparently posed a challenge to suspected members of the Marcello crime family, which had been active in gambling. To get into the new video-poker market, Anthony (Mr. A) Carollo, the family's reputed acting head, and his aide, Frank (Muffaletta Frank) Gagliano, needed to take control of a distributor run by seemingly legitimate front men to avoid the scrutiny of regulators, according to last year's indictments, which named both men.
That company was Worldwide Gaming, whose president was Steven R. Bolson, a lawyer who had worked for several Atlantic City casinos, and whose vice president was Christopher J. Tanfield, a concert promoter. With the help of Mr. Bolson's contacts, Worldwide became a distributor for Bally Gaming in late 1991. By mid-1992, it graduated to exclusive distributor after bringing in an order for 2,000 machines.
But even before that pact was completed, a warning sign had appeared. In early 1992, The Village Voice published an article that linked Mr. Tanfield with Eugene (Noogie) Gilpin, a reputed associate of the Genovese crime family who was also named in last year's indictments. Mr. Tanfield abruptly resigned from Worldwide Gaming, but stayed on as a consultant. Executives of Bally Entertainment, then in the process of spinning off Bally Gaming, say they looked into the newspaper's allegation but found no support for it.
They may not have looked hard enough. Federal investigators, who stumbled onto Worldwide as a result of a run-of-the-mill bookmaking inquiry, later maintained that Mr. Tanfield was an associate of both the Genovese and Gambino families. In a recent interview, Mr. Tanfield, who was also indicted and who denies the charges, said that no one from Bally Entertainment or Bally Gaming asked him about the article until November 1992.
By then, Bally Gaming executives were wondering how they got involved with him and others at Worldwide and how they could get out. "It's all fraudulent," John Garner, Bally Gaming's controller, told Jamie Perdiago, an outside lawyer for the company, in a wiretapped conversation cited in court documents.
Meanwhile, those later indicted in the case were keeping busy. Mr. Gilpin and others flew in from New York for discussions with Mr. Carollo. And Mr. Tanfield, for one, wildly boasted of future success, court papers indicate.
"I got as much clout as you need, anything you need," he proclaimed in a wiretapped conversation with a Government informant. "I got the Governor, I got the Senate, I got the Congressmen, I got the legislatures and I got the streets."
Events at Worldwide, however, were of increasing concern to Bally Gaming. When its representatives visited the distributor, they found that money was being lent to those leasing equipment without proper liens being placed on the machines, Mr. Perdiago, the lawyer for Bally Gaming, recently testified at regulatory hearings.
"Chris Tanfield had a saying that was really accurate," said Mr. Perdiago, who had been retained by Bally Gaming to monitor Worldwide."It was like they were driving down the highway with a grocery bag of hundred-dollar bills and the windows were down."
Suspicious-looking individuals also hung around Worldwide's office in the New Orleans suburb of Metairie and Bally Gaming executives did not relish run-ins with them. Jerry Flynn, a former executive who was sent to investigate problems at Worldwide, was terrified of Felix A. Riggio 3d, who ran the company close to Worldwide that collected money from the bars and truck stops.
"He would even run out of the room, run out of Worldwide, you know, out the back door when Riggio came in the front door," Mr. Perdiago testified. Mr. Riggio was also among those indicted.
By the end of 1992, Bally Gaming executives recognized that Worldwide represented a potential catastrophe. In a wiretapped conversation, Mr. Garner, the controller, told Mr. Perdiago, "This pig is getting sloppier and sloppier," court papers indicate. He also related how he had told another man to go "perfume this pig" before the auditors arrived, according to the court papers.
Mr. Horgan, the Bally Gaming lawyer, said that Mr. Garner was just using a "colorful choice of words" and was not covering anything up. Arthur Lemann 3d, a lawyer who represents Mr. Carollo, said that he intended to show at trial that Bally Gaming controlled the activities of its distributor, a contention that Mr. Horgan rejected.
Following an inquiry by a private investigator, Bally Gaming demanded in November 1992 that Worldwide end its association with Mr. Tanfield and several others. It clearly hoped to salvage its investment and keep Worldwide afloat.
That would prove to be wishful thinking. By then, Mr. Bolson, Worldwide's president, knew that the company was controlled by organized crime, according to a plea agreement he entered last year.
Finally, in May 1993, Bally Gaming dropped Worldwide, and the distributor immediately filed for bankruptcy-law protection. A year later, a Federal grand jury handed up its indictments.
Separately, in plea agreements, Mr. Bolson acknowledged that he helped conceal those controlling Worldwide, and Alan Maiss, a former president of Bally Gaming, pleaded guilty in January to charges of failing to tell regulators that Mr. Tanfield did not have a gambling license. Mr. Bolson and Mr. Maiss are cooperating with the Government.
Bally Gaming must still pass muster for a final permit here. And it may even lose its name. Bally Entertainment, which licenses the name to its spinoff, said it was thinking about taking it back because of the Louisiana debacle.

Chronology: "Key Dates in a Tainted Partnership"
For its foray into Louisiana, Bally Gaming bet on an exclusive alliance with Worldwide Gaming, a distributorship prosecutors say was controlled by organized-crime figures.
 
Sept. 1991: Louisiana passes state video poker law that requires out-of-state manufacturers like Bally Gaming Inc. to sell through an in-state distributor.
 Dec. 1991: Worldwide Gaming is formed, allegedly at the behest of several suspected organized-crime figures whose own license to distribute gambling machines in the state had been denied renewal by the state police.
 March 1992: An article in The Village Voice details Worldwide's alleged ties to organized crime. Bally Entertainment officials look into the allegations but say they found nothing to support them.
 July 1992: After Worldwide brokers an order for 2,000 of Bally's poker machines, Bally Gaming names Worldwide its exclusive distributor in Louisiana. Bally Gaming agrees to underwrite Worldwide's operations.
 Aug. 1992: Bally Entertainment, a casino operator and the parent of Bally Gaming, the equipment maker, spins off majority control of Bally Gaming as a separate company.
 Oct. 1992: Bally Gaming hires a private investigator to start looking into backgrounds of individuals associated with Worldwide. The inquiry finds that some have criminal records. Nov. 1992: Following additional concerns, Bally Gaming directs Worldwide to end its association with several people, including its former vice president, Christopher J. Tanfield, the subject of VV article. Worldwide complies, but by this time its president, Steven R. Bolson, is also aware that organized-crime figures are behind the company. May 1993: Bally Gaming drops Worldwide as its distributor. Worldwide immediately files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
 March 1994: A Federal grand jury indicts 17 people associated with Worldwide and a related company on racketeering charges.
 Jan. 1995: Bally is denied a permit by the president of a state regulatory board, Willmore Whitmore, to sell equipment to planned Harrah's casino in New Orleans on the ground that Bally allowed itself to be "infiltrated" by organized crime. He is overruled shortly afterward by the full board.
 Sept. 1995: Criminal trials of the Worldwide defendants are scheduled to begin. (pg. D2)

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Up 3,000 Last Week

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose last week by 3,000, the Labor Department said today, marking the first three-consecutive-week increases in nearly a year.
New applications for unemployment insurance totaled a seasonally adjusted 346,000 in the week that ended Saturday, the department said, up from 343,000 in the previous week and the highest since 348,000 in the week that ended on Feb. 11. 
 It was the first three-week increase since the period last April 2 through April 16, when claims rose 3,000, 14,000 and 11,000, respectively.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Edge Higher in a Light Up-and-Down Session

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities edged up in light trading yesterday, following the dollar up and down through most of the session but holding their own at the end while the dollar sank against the yen.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 2/32 , to 1026/32 for a yield of 7.44 percent, down from 7.45 percent on Wednesday. The rates on shorter-maturity bills were also a bit lower. 
 Analysts say that when the dollar is strong, dollar-denominated investments are more attractive to foreign investors. A strong dollar also reduces the risk that rising import costs will accelerate inflation, which causes fixed-income securities to lose value.
Anthony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said bond market participants so far had ignored the recent signals of strong economic growth.
"There is much confusion in the market," Mr. Dwyer said, "but it is confusion on the plus side. It is optimism about a soft landing, low inflation and continued growth." And that, he added, is the reason "the bond market is holding up so well despite the declining dollar, despite recent economic reports suggesting robust growth."
Mr. Dwyer said he expected the economic reports in April to provide a better look at the first quarter. "I think the quarter will show continued above-average economic growth," Mr. Dwyer said. "And since the economy is holding up well, it suggests that there will be more interest rate hikes in the offing" that will lead to "a more pronounced slowdown in 1996."
Mr. Dwyer added: "This scenario continues to make long-term bonds attractive in my opinion. As long as the Fed can keep inflation in check, the historical real rate of return for the bond market will continue to be quite compelling."
But traders say they need more economic data to make big trades. The handful of economic reports so far this week have provided mixed signals on whether the economy is slowing enough to reduce the risk of inflation. In the only economic report today, the Labor Department said the number of initial claims for jobless benefits rose 3,000 last week, to 346,000. Expectations were for a drop of 3,000.
In when-issued trading ahead of next week's note auctions, the two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 6.73 percent, while the five-year note was offered at a price to yield 7.02 percent.
In the municipal bond market, which some investors are beginning to find a bit too expansive, there was little reaction to the news that the State of Wisconsin Investment Board posted a loss of $95 million from a derivatives deal, traders said.
Among corporate borrowers, the leading asset-backed issuer yesterday was the Beneficial Mortgage Corporation, a loan unit of the Beneficial Corporation. It sold $1.1 billion of floating-rate securities backed by home equity loans through a specially formed BCI Home Equity Loan Trust.
By packaging some of this debt into bonds, lenders like Beneficial can free cash on their balance sheets, making room for more loans.
Morgan Stanley & Company led the underwriters, who sold $913 million of senior securities, with an average life of 2.16 years, at a price of par to yield 22 basis points more than the one-month London interbank offered rate, which international banks charge each other for loans. Yesterday Libor was 6.125 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
For $50 million of senior securities with the same average life and price, the yield was 25 basis points higher than the 30-day commercial paper rate, which was 6.07 percent late yesterday. All the senior securities are rated triple-A by both Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's.
A $110 million tranche of subordinated securities, with an average life of 3.51 years, was priced at par to yield about 35 basis points more than the one-month Libor rate, while $30.4 million in subordinated securities, with an average life of 0.4 year, was also priced at par, to yield 25 basis points more than Libor. Underwriters said the subordinated debt was rated A-3 by Moody's and A by S.& P.

HEADLINE: Defending Affirmative Action, Clinton Details Plan to Review It

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23

 BODY:
President Clinton today offered his most articulate defense yet of the concept of affirmative action -- and his most extensive explanation of his review of existing Federal programs to determine whether to drop some preferences based on race or sex.
Mr. Clinton said he wanted to find out which programs work, whether even some of those that do have resulted in reverse discrimination, and whether some economically disadvantaged groups are not adequately covered by current preferential treatment for women and minorities in hiring, promotion and Government contracts. But over all, he argued, such programs have greatly benefited American society since the mid-1960's. 
 "I'm against discrimination," Mr. Clinton told a group of college newspaper reporters in a question-and-answer session at the White House. "I'm against giving people opportunities who are unqualified. But we all have an interest -- including white males -- in developing the capacities of all of us to relate to one another, because our economy will grow quicker, it'll be stronger, and in a global society our diversity our greatest asset.
"We must not let this debate be another cheap political wedge issue to divide the American electorate."
Mr. Clinton also sharpened his vow to oppose Republican efforts to cut back college loan programs, saying, "The veto pen is always there."
Since Mr. Clinton announced the review of affirmative action last month in response to Republican calls to roll back preference programs, the White House has been under growing pressure from historically Democratic constituencies like blacks and women's groups to explain its purpose and to resist backing away from such programs.
On Friday, Deval L. Patrick, the Assistant Attorney General for civil rights, is to testify at a House subcommittee hearing on the subject. The White House had said for days that Mr. Clinton would find some opportunity before then to outline his views and set the tone, and he took the occasion of a friendly full-dress news conference with about 100 college journalists in the East Room to do so.
Reporters from Georgetown University (where Mr. Clinton went to college), Yale University (where he attended law school) and the University of Arkansas (where he taught at the law school) had seats of honor in the front row. Jeff Glasser of Yale asked the first question, and it brought satisfied smiles from senior White House aides standing at the side of the room.
"How do you plan to stop Congress from capping direct loans or cutting Pell Grants or paying the interest on loans taken out during college?" Mr. Glasser asked about various Republican proposals to trim popular college loan and grant programs. "Are you willing to veto legislation if it comes across your desk?"
Mr. Clinton replied: "Well, of course, I am in the areas of education, which are so important to me. But let me say again, what my first choice has been all along is to try to prevail in the debate in the Congress."
The President also said he thought Speaker Newt Gingrich's notion of making laptop computers more available to the nation's poor children as an educational aid was sound (though Mr. Gingrich himself allowed that his proposal for tax credits to do so might be "nutty").
But it was a question on affirmative action that seemed to animate the President most, as he summarized the history of the civil rights movement, recalling the days when restrooms were segregated and there were "no women in any number of jobs" where "we take it for granted that women will be."
"We have made a lot of progress because we tried to take action to open up more opportunities to people without regard to their race or gender," Mr. Clinton said. "It is in everyone's interest to see that everybody gets the best chance to live up to the fullest of their abilities. On the other hand, it is in no one's interest to see that people get positions if they are completely unqualified to hold them. So the question is, How do we now go forward?"
Mr. Clinton said he had no answers yet, but he listed the questions he has asked his aides: "I have said first of all how do these programs work, and do they have a positive effect? O.K.? That's the first question.
"Secondly, even if they work, are they sometimes, at least, unfair to others? Could you argue that in some cases there is reverse discrimination; and if so, how?
"Thirdly, are there now others in need who are not covered by affirmative action programs? Keep in mind that's really what's fueling this whole thing. You've got 20 years in this country where most hourly wage earners have not kept up with inflation. Most Americans are working harder for lower wages than they were making 20 years ago."

HEADLINE: Sammons Sells Remainder of Its Cable Systems for $800 Million

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
Sammons Communications Inc. completed its exit from the cable television business yesterday, selling its remaining cable systems with 440,000 subscribers for $800 million to a pair of companies associated with Tele-Communications Inc.
A spokeswoman for Tele-Communications, LaRae Schlichting, said the giant cable operator would divide the Sammons cable systems between the Lenfest Group, which is 50 percent owned by Jerry Lenfest and 50 percent owned by Tele-Communications, and TKR Cable, a joint venture of Knight-Ridder Inc. and Tele-Communications. 
 An industry executive with knowledge of the details of the transaction said about 293,000 Sammons subscribers, mostly in eastern and central Pennsylvania, would go to Lenfest. The other 147,000 subscribers, largely in central and northern New Jersey, would go to TKR Cable.
Sammons, based in Dallas, declined to comment on the transaction. But the executive said the company had issued an internal memorandum notifying employees that the cable systems had been sold. The transaction is being financed entirely with cash, according to the executive.
Earlier this month, Sammons agreed to sell cable systems with 650,000 subscribers to the Marcus Cable Company for $1 billion. That deal, which includes equity contributions from the leveraged buyout firm Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst and Goldman, Sachs & Company, is also being financed with cash.
In the latest transaction, the cable systems are being sold for roughly $1,820 a subscriber -- substantially more than the $1,520 paid in the Marcus deal.
Yesterday's deal reflects the premium that clusters of cable systems can fetch. Industry executives said the properties, which cover markets like Morristown, N.J., Atlantic City, and Harrisburg, Pa., are more closely grouped than the systems sold to Marcus, which are scattered throughout Texas, Northern and Southern California, the Midwest and the South.
Sammons is one of many small and midsized cable companies that have been selling their systems to giant operators like Tele-Communications and Time Warner in a striking consolidation of the industry. In general, the big buyers are seeking densely clustered cable systems, which are more economical to upgrade for new services.
Scripps Howard Cable said on Monday that it was seeking a buyer for its cable systems, which have 749,000 subscribers. And Viacom still hopes to sell its cable systems with 1.1 million subscribers, though Congress essentially derailed a deal that would have sold the systems to a minority-led investor group that included Tele-Communications.
Viacom had hoped to benefit from a Government program that allowed companies to avoid paying capital gains taxes on profits from the sale of television and cable properties to minorities. But the House of Representatives and the Senate Finance Committee voted to eliminate the tax break.
Sammons, a privately held company with interests in insurance and other businesses, was founded by Charles Sammons, who died in 1988. The company's assets were believed to be placed into a family trust, which is now selling the cable portion of the portfolio.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises to Another Record, but Broader Market Drifts

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
While the Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq indexes hit record highs yesterday, the overall stock market appeared to drift in advance of today's report on durable goods orders.
After rising as much as 12 points and falling as much as 15 points, the Dow finished the day up 4.84 points at 4,087.83. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.28 point, to 495.95, while the smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 2.29 points, to a record 811.39. 
 Bond prices rose a little yesterday, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond edging down to 7.44 percent from 7.45 percent. The dollar edged up against the German mark, settling in New York at 1.4037 marks from 1.4030 marks on Wednesday. But the dollar slipped to another record low against the Japanese yen, falling to 88.15 yen from 89 yen.
Some analysts say that as the five-month-long rally in bonds appears to have stalled, the stock market rally may also begin to falter, despite a month of record-breaking rises in the Dow.
One clue will be the market's reaction today to the important report on the demand for durable goods, like cars and refrigerators. If the figures are higher than expected, and thus seen as inflationary, stocks may fall sharply. If the report is soft, as expected, and stocks fail to rally strongly, it will be evidence that the stock market rally is coming to an end.
The steadily rising Dow is "concealing a lot of action," said Christine A. Callies, equity strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman & Company. "It is not that nothing is going on, it's just that a lot is going on at cross-purposes."
Particularly worrisome, she said, is the rise in gold and oil stocks, which often indicates a thriving economy that could prompt further interest-rate increases from the Federal Reserve, thus hurting stocks. Since early January, the American Stock Exchange Oil Index of 16 oil stocks has risen more than 6.5 percent and the Philadelphia Gold and Silver Index of 9 gold mining stocks has risen 10 percent.
"The real issue is whether there is much money left on the sidelines that could go back into the market," Ms. Callies said. "I don't think so."
The reason is a rush of money into high-yielding six-month and one-year Treasury bills. And many investors do not review their fixed-income investments for at least a year. "There may not be much money out there to exploit any good news to come." she said.
Among the big movers in the market yesterday, Alliance Semiconductor, a maker of memory chips, rose 3 1/4, to 49 1/4, on an optimistic outlook for the computer industry.
Roberts Pharmaceutical, a drug maker, fell 8, to 26 3/4, after warning that first-quarter earnings would be below Wall Street estimates. Putnam Trust Company, a bank holding company in Greenwich, Conn., fell 3, to 37 3/4, after it said it was exploring a merger with a company it would not identify.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 321.5 million shares, down from this year's daily average of 329 million shares.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.12 point, to 267.92, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining stocks by 1,046 to 1,012. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 2.37 points, to 458.52.
Of the component stocks of the S.& P. 500 index, 207 rose, led by Microsoft, up 113/16 , to 72 3/4, the second day after it announced a software venture with Dreamworks SKG, the new Hollywood studio formed by Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen.
The most active stock, at 7.7 million shares, was the Physicians Corporation of America, a managed health care company, which fell 4, to 20 3/4, after it announced an expected fall in earnings for the first and second quarter as a result of higher operating costs.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Lumber Prices in Sharp Decline On Shift in Canadian Rail Strike

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Lumber prices fell sharply yesterday after a move to end a rail strike in Canada raised concerns that a weak housing market could soon become flooded with supplies.
Lumber prices tumbled after talks resumed between CP Rail, one of the largest railroads in Canada, and a striking union. The news of the meeting raised hopes for a settlement that would end a series of walkouts that have brought the three big rail lines in Canada to a halt. But the talks broke off later in the day. 
 In other trading, coffee and cotton also fell, driving down the Commodity Research Bureau index by 1.42 points, to 234.06.
With as much as three-quarters of the lumber produced in Canada shipped by rail, an extended strike could slow lumber shipments and inflate prices, as mills scramble for more expensive and hard-to-find alternative shipping routes.
Lumber for May delivery fell $8.90 yesterday to settle at $275.60 for 1,000 board feet on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the lowest for the active contract since July 24, 1993. Lumber prices have plunged 12.6 percent in the last month.
A settlement of the strike would bring more lumber to a housing market in the United States that is suffering because of higher interest rates. Coffee dropped to its lowest price in five weeks, as producers opposed a plan to set export quotas in hopes of raising prices.
Under an agreement reached on March 13 by members of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries, individual countries have the option of either retaining coffee in warehouses until prices rise or setting overall export quotas that cannot be exceeded.
While Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer, had been expected to choose the quota system, producers are now calling for a retention plan. The opposition threatens to delay the decision by Brazil and has lowered the confidence in the overall agreement, traders said.
Coffee for May delivery fell 3.9 cents, to $1.6565 a pound, on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York.
Cotton fell the daily trading limit amid concern that a Government report would show sales for export were canceled last week because of record high prices. May cotton fell its 2-cent daily limit, to $1.0430 a pound, on the New York Cotton Exchange.
After the close of trading yesterday, the Agriculture Department said in its weekly report on export sales that cancellations had caused net new sales to fall by 7,100 bales.

German Metal Concern In Deal on Creditors

 BODY:
An effort to revamp Metallgesellschaft A.G., the troubled German metals and engineering conglomerate, was bolstered yesterday after Germany's two biggest banks agreed to buy out the company's American and French creditors for $107 million.
The last-minute move by Deutsche Bank A.G. and Dresdner Bank A.G. strengthened Metallgesell schaft's plan to seek fresh equity capital from stockholders. The plan, presented to shareholders today, had been opposed by nearly a dozen American and French bank creditors, notably Societe Generale and Credit Lyonnais of France. 
 The buyout was announced to reporters at the shareholders meeting by a member of the banking consortium, who refused to be identified by name. The announcement was made as Metallgesellschaft reported that all its operations, including its subsidiary in the United States, the MG Corporation, had returned to profitability.
Metallgesellschaft was on the brink of collapse in January 1994, after MG accumulated $1.33 billion in losses from trading in oil futures. A collapse was averted by $1.9 billion bailout by the creditor banks. Bloomberg Business News

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Trade Gap and Japanese Selling Send Dollar to Low of 88.15 Yen

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar continued its slide against the Japanese yen yesterday, slipping to another record low in New York trading.
Currency dealers attributed the dollar's decline yesterday to lingering concern over the huge United States trade deficit and selling by Japanese companies and investment funds ahead of the close of their fiscal year. 
 On Wednesday, the Commerce Department reported that the United States trade deficit widened sharply in January. The strong gain in imports suggested that foreign exporters have a wealth of dollars to sell. The deficit with Japan is at a record high.
And the dollar generally slumps leading up to March 31 as Japanese companies try to bolster their balance sheets by selling off dollar-denominated United States assets and converting the dollars into yen.
The decline yesterday prompted the Bank of Japan to intervene in the currency markets, buying dollars to prop up the value of the currency against the yen, dealers said. The Bank of Japan has repeatedly expressed its concern that a strong yen will make its exports too expensive for foreign markets.
 Japan's central bankers are "uncomfortable because their exporters are uncomfortable," said David Munro, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics. "The playing field has been tipped maybe 10 percent in our favor."
The dollar fell as low as 88.01 yen before settling in late New York trading at 88.15 yen, breaking the previous New York low of 89 yen set on Wednesday. The dollar has fallen nearly 12 percent against the yen in the last three months.
Some economists said they expected the Japanese asset flight might end by next week, but they expressed concern the decline might undermine international confidence in the dollar.
 "The problem is not based on U.S. economic fundamentals," said Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities.
Against the German mark, the dollar fared better yesterday -- a by-product of the recovery of other European currencies against the mark.
 The Bank of France was rumored to have intervened to lift the French franc against the mark, creating momentum that spread to other European currencies.
In New York trading, the dollar edged up to 1.43037 marks, from 1.4030 marks on Thursday. But the dollar slipped to 1.1605 Swiss francs from 1.1642 francs. And the British pound rose to $1.5948 from $1.5884.

HEADLINE: PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW;
From 1936 and 1956, Documentary Artworks

BYLINE: By CHARLES HAGEN 

 BODY:
There's no reason that an exhibition whose sole organizing principle is to present photographs taken in a single year should be meaningful, let alone interesting. If anything, the opposite is true: the overall quality of work produced in a given year is apt to be average.
On the other hand, no period is without some good work; judicious selection could make any year look good. And such a selection might suggest other understandings about the period in question. 
 No doubt that was the thinking behind "1936," at the James Danziger Gallery, and "Circa 1956," a companion show at the 292 Gallery, both in SoHo. Both focus on works made in a given year, although only "1936" adheres closely to that restriction; the show at 292 includes works from throughout the 1950's.
Marianne Courville, who organized "1936," increased her chances of success by choosing a particularly rich year. Despite, or in some cases in response to the economic and political upheaval that engulfed Europe and the United States, photographers produced significant images that year in a wide range of styles and genres.
The dominant pictorial mode of the day was documentary, which in photography meant images presented as evidence of social facts. But documentary works can be used for everything from propaganda to entertainment, and examples of this are included in the Danziger show.
Not only was 1936 a peak moment in the life of the Farm Security Administration, whose photographers were trying both to promote New Deal farm policies and to record the American social landscape, but it was also the year in which the first issue of Life magazine was published. Works from both sources are featured prominently in "1936."
Representing the Farm Security Administration are images by several of its most famous photographers, including Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Russell Lee and Arthur Rothstein. Margaret Bourke-White's cover shot of the Fort Peck Dam in Montana, for Life's first issue, is also on display, as is a gag photo of the exhausted Life editors after putting the first issue to bed.
Photo-reporting in Europe tended to have a more voyeuristic edge than in the United States, a quality that is fully apparent in Bill Brandt's photograph of a couple, locked in an embrace, in a dimly lighted bedroom. But Brassai, another leading practitioner of this sort of keyhole documentary work, is represented not by his titillating photographs of Parisian night life but by one of his strangely expressive close-ups of graffiti.
The Surrealist overtones of Brassai's picture can be found in other seemingly straightforward images here. The row houses in Berenice Abbott's "Fifth Avenue Houses" stand apart from their neighbors in blistering sunlight, and seem ready to spring to life. A more openly Surrealist image is Josef Breitenbach's hand-painted image of biomorphic cutouts squiggling across the surface of the print.
Some of the most interesting pictures in the show, even by well-known artists, are relatively unfamiliar. A prime example is a sweet and mysterious image by Andre Kertesz, the Hungarian photographer then working in Paris, which shows his wife, Elizabeth, shading her eyes with her hand.
In general, the 1930's were a period of high modernism in photography, and many pieces reflect the emphasis on form and the sharp-focus clarity that characterized the movement. A classic Edward Weston nude, of a model sitting on a stool with one knee raised so her body forms an elegant triangle, is present, as is Weston's quieter but equally moving image of feathery clouds over the beach in Santa Monica, Calif.
But photographic activity in 1936 was not limited to documentary work, photojournalism and art. The Danziger exhibition gains strength from its inclusion of sports and fashion photography; in fact, more examples would have been welcome. Harold Edgerton's prints of film strips showing a bullet exploding a balloon offer at least a reference to scientific photography, and there's even a snapshot by an anonymous photographer.
Behind the sense of exuberant experimentation in many works was the growing threat of war. Not that photographers were unaware of the direction of events: Robert Capa's photograph from the Spanish Civil War, of a Loyalist soldier felled by a bullet, foreshadowed the outbreak of World War II; Roman Vishniac's image of Jews in Poland studying the cabala was part of an effort to record the Jewish culture of Eastern Europe, soon to be destroyed in the Holocaust.
The time-capsule approach of "1936" challenges traditional notions of history, suggesting that a chronological slice through time can be as telling as a narrative approach. But the diversity of the images, and of the purposes for which they were created, frustrates attempts to organize them into a single conceptual structure.
The limitations of this strictly chronological approach are apparent in "Circa 1956." While it includes several notable images, from Robert Frank's shot of a glowing jukebox in New York City to Saul Leiter's delicate study of two men in hats outside a store window, the show lacks the scope or unity of the Danziger exhibition.
Of course, this may reflect a lack of available material rather than some deficiency in the work of that period. Nevertheless, in both shows the tantalizing notion persists that the pictures fit into some larger order. After all, weren't they all made in the same year?
The show "1936" is at the James Danziger Gallery, 130 Prince Street, SoHo, and "Circa 1956" is at the 292 Gallery, 120 Wooster Street, at Prince Street, in SoHo. Both shows are to remain on view through April 8.

HEADLINE: Turks Plan to Keep 35,000 Troops in Iraq

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, March 23

 BODY:
The 35,000 Turkish troops that now occupy the border area of northern Iraq will not be withdrawn until a buffer zone is set up to insure that Kurdish rebels do not move back into the region when the army withdraws, senior officials said today.
The decision by the Turkish Government caused some consternation among Turkey's European allies. 
 It defied earlier promises by Ankara to withdraw quickly from the region, which it entered on Monday, and raised the possibility of a prolonged occupation of Iraqi territory, which Turkey's allies, including the United States, have repeatedly cautioned against.
The French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppe, and his German counterpart, Klaus Kinkel, who were in Ankara today for meetings with the Turkish Prime Minister, Tansu Ciller, criticized the decision and asked that Turkish troops withdraw from the region as soon as possible.
[Turkish warplanes staged bombing runs into northern Iraq again early Friday, the fifth day of the assault, Reuters reported from Ankara. Other flights brought in reinforments and supplies to four points along the 178-mile border, the news agency added, quoting a military spokesman.
["We have reports of an increase in the number of rebels killed, from the 128 which we announced last night," the spokesman said. He gave no further details. ]
Western diplomats said Turkey's continued presence in northern Iraq could jeopardize Ankara's ambitions to build closer economic ties with the European Union, the subject of today's talks, which the Foreign Minister of Spain also attended.
The European Union, despite its questioning of Turkey's human rights record, signed a customs union with Ankara earlier this month. If approved by the European Parliament, the accord would begin in 1996 and would eliminate duties between Turkey and the European Union.
The German Foreign Minister said that if public opinion in Europe were to turn against the Turks, it would be difficult for the European Parliament to approve the customs union. Turkey's image has also suffered in Europe after its decision to imprison eight Kurdish members of Parliament and to charge Turkey's best-known author, Yaser Kemal, with sedition for criticizing the Government's treatment of the Kurds.
"The moment the world sees the picture of the first civilian casualty in northern Iraq, things will become very difficult for Turkey," Mr. Kinkel told reporters today in Ankara.
Europe, with a large and vocal Kurdish immigrant community, carefully follows Turkey's treatment of its some 11 million Kurds.
The Turkish troops have entered a region set up by the Western allies as a "safe haven" for Iraq's Kurds after Baghdad's defeat in the Persian Gulf war in 1992. The area is currently controlled by the two main Iraqi Kurdish rebel groups and monitored by Western forces.
The two Iraqi factions are vying with each other for control of the north. The Turkish Kurdish rebels have used the area to set up base camps outside the control of the Iraqi Kurds.
The Turks are attacking four principal guerrilla camps in the current offensive and since Monday have pushed 25 miles into Iraq. The army claims to have killed about 200 of the estimated 2,400 rebels based there and captured numerous munitions and weapons. It says 13 soldiers have died in the fighting.
This is not the first time Ankara has mounted huge military operations with the aim of wiping out the Kurdish rebels. The guerrilla war in southeastern Turkey has killed 15,000 people in the last 10 years.
Some 13,000 Kurds fled from southeastern Turkey last year after the army forced them to evacuate their villages or burned their settlements. Many have settled across the border in Zakho and in camps near Atrush, 45 miles to the southeast. Those refugees receive assistance from the United Nations.
Turkish officials said they hoped to bring their troops back eventually, but they also said they would not make the same mistake as in 1992, when 20,000 Turkish troops swept the border area and withdrew, allowing Kurdish rebels to move back and mount new cross-border raids.
"We have to have a guarantee and a new form of collaboration there before we go back," said Emre Gonensay, the chief adviser to the Prime Minister. "We realize now that just going in and pulling out is not sufficient. Those who criticize us for going in and staying there should find a solution with us."
Turkish officials contend that northern Iraq has descended into chaos since Iraqi forces withdrew after the gulf war. That power vacuum, they say, has allowed the rebel Kurdish Workers Party to establish base camps and arms depots. These officials say they will not permit a return to the status quo, even in the face of severe international criticism.
Ankara also dismissed criticism from Baghdad today that it had violated Iraqi sovereignty. Turkish officials said that since Baghdad did not have a presence in the north, it did not have sovereignty.
"This is not a violation of Iraqi sovereignty," Mr. Gonensay said. "Since there is really no authority there, as there are no forces there, we have a power vacuum in northern Iraq."
The de facto authorities in northern Iraq, the Turkish officials argue, are the Western coalition forces that established the safe haven there after the gulf war. The safe haven, which lies north of the 36th parallel, includes flights by coalition jets to monitor a no-fly zone. It also includes a tiny team of military observers in Zakho.
Turkish officials said they were considering various options to maintain control over the region, including a buffer zone similar to that set up by Israel in southern Lebanon. They also said they would consider manning the area with Western coalition forces if the allies, including the United States, would oversee a truce.

HEADLINE: Wisconsin Has Big Loss In Derivatives

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
In the latest fallout from the use of the complex financial instruments known as derivatives, The State of Wisconsin Investment Board said yesterday that one of its funds had lost $95 million speculating on the Mexican peso and on European currencies.
The board sought to play down the impact of the losses, saying they would be spread over many years and would not affect the fund's principal. 
 But an official conceded that the losses would cut the fund's earnings for the last year by about a quarter of a percentage point. That would reduce the affected fund's annual payout rate to 5.30 percent from 5.55 percent. Earnings during the next 5 to 10 years will also be reduced by a quarter of a percentage point.
Most of the money invested in the fund, known as the State Investment Fund, is cash balances from the state and local governments. But a part of the fund is from the state's pension system.
Patricia Lipton, executive director of the Wisconsin Investment Board, said that the bets on the peso and Eurpean currencies using derivatives were "inappropriate" and that the fund's portfolio manager was "under review."
She also indicated that the losses might be far worse than they had to be. The loss on the peso was touched off by the sudden devaluation of the Mexican currency in December and the sharp slide of the peso since then. But the fund kept its bet in until recently, even as the value of the peso slid an added 25 percent since mid-February.
Derivatives, which are financial products that are based on, or derived from, the underlying price movements of stocks, bonds, currencies or interest rates, have become controversial in the last year because institutions including Orange County, Calif., Gibson Greetings Inc. and the Procter & Gamble Company have announced sudden and heavy losses from their use.
Orange County, for example, reported losses of $1.7 billion from a combination of heavy borrowing to speculate on interest rates and the use of derivatives contracts. The county has declared bankruptcy and cut back its spending. Questions still remain concerning its ability to pay pensions, and the county faces a slew of pending litigation.
The Bankers Trust New York Corporaton, which sold the derivatives to Gibson and P.& G., has settled with Gibson but is still fighting with P.& G. to determine responsibility for the losses on its derivative contracts.
Wisconsin officials emphasized that the fund's losses were much smaller than in other recent debacles involving derivatives. The losses represent only 1.4 percent of the value of the $6.7 billion State Investment Fund, which handles cash balances for about 1,000 local governments, and manages the state's general cash reserves and some of its retirement monies. The state's investment board also manages another $30 billion in retirement funds, which were not affected by the losses.
Ms. Lipton said that the fund had sufficient liquidity "to meet any cash withdrawals by local government participants in the S.I.F."
"I'd like to differentiate us from Orange County," Ms. Lipton added. "We haven't leveraged the whole fund," referring to the borrowing done by Orange County's treasurer, Robert L. Citron, to support the bets he had made on interest rates swings.
"We found a problem, and we dealt with it immediately, we acted quickly, we got rid of it," Ms. Lipton said.
In general, she added, Wisconsin had used derivatives to manage and offset risk. Wisconsin officials also point out that the state investment fund, in the last 12 years, has averaged returns that have been about a percentage point higher than some index measurements for performances by money market funds.
The Mexican peso, of course, crashed in December, losing almost half its value in the following weeks. Why hadn't the state unwound the Mexican peso contract then?
"The portfolio manager hadn't made that determination," Ms. Lipton said. It was only later that "the management and the trustee decided to get out of the investment," she added.
In short, the portfolio manager was hanging on to a loss-making position in the hope that things would get better. The conduct of the portfolio manager is "under review," Ms. Lipton said.
Ms. Lipton also said that such swap investments were "inappropriate for that fund," and that they had been looked into as part of a recent review of the whole fund, conducted with the Price Waterhouse accounting firm. "The whole industry is scrambling to come to terms" with the risks posed by derivatives, she said.
While the loss was a surprise, the fact that the Wisconsin investment board took risks should not have been. The board has been among the most aggressive state money managers in the country. It has invested in a fund established by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, the leveraged buyout firm that has specialized in big takeovers and has at times struck fear in the hearts of many of America's top managers.
For example, the board, as one of the Kmart Corporation's largest shareholders, helped to start the revolt against its chairman, Joseph E. Antonini, that led to his ouster this week.
The Wisconsin board moved to contain the loss in the fund by getting out of 10 losing derivatives transactions in the last several days. The losses arose mainly from recent falls in the value of the peso, Ms. Lipton said. There were other, smaller losses from derivatives tied to movements by European currencies, according to bankers with knowledge of the transactions. Ms. Lipton said the derivatives were restructured to get rid of the risks they posed to the state fund.
Among the firms that sold the original derivatives to the fund, according to one banker, were J. P. Morgan & Company, Bankers Trust, Goldman Sachs & Company, Merrill Lynch & Company and Morgan Stanley. J. P. Morgan and Bankers Trust helped to unwind the losing positions.
Spokesmen for J. P. Morgan and Bankers Trust confirmed their role in helping to restructure the derivatives, and acknowledged their roles in organizing the original investments. Goldman and Merrill declined to comment. Morgan Stanley representatives could not immediately be reached for comment.

HEADLINE: Public Hospitals Chief Quits, Opposing Giuliani Over Cuts

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN 

 BODY:
The chairman of New York City's Health and Hospitals Corporation resigned unexpectedly yesterday, saying he could not support the deep Medicaid cuts that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki are seeking.
The chairman, Luis A. Miranda Jr., resigned minutes before the agency's board of directors was to vote on a resolution condemning the cuts, which would effectively slash the agency's budget by close to 30 percent. 
 Mr. Miranda said that as an appointee of the Mayor, he was obliged to support the administration's position, but that he could not in good conscience vote against the board's resolution.
But some people in the agency who were familiar with the move said the Giuliani administration made it clear to Mr. Miranda that if he defied the Mayor by voting to condemn the Medicaid cuts, he would be forced from his position.
The Mayor immediately appointed Maria Mitchell, his special adviser on health, as the interim chairwoman of the agency, which operates the city's 11 public hospitals. After she arrived to take Mr. Miranda's seat at the board meeting, Ms. Mitchell cast the deciding vote to defeat the resolution. The vote was 7 to 6 with 1 abstention. Two members of the 16-member board did not vote.
Just a day earlier, the Mayor added another supporter to the board, John Ballan, an attorney specializing in public finance. He replaced Dr. Calvin J. Simons, who was appointed by former Mayor David N. Dinkins and whose term expired on Monday.
The board changes consolidate the Mayor's influence on the agency at a time that the administration is seeking to sell at least three public hospitals and considerably reduce the size of the remaining institutions and the agency's bureaucracy. The Mayor has indicated that he would like to get the city entirely out of the health delivery business.
Mr. Miranda said that he generally supported the Mayor's goals of streamlining the agency and forcing it to be more efficient. He said that over the last 14 months, he had stood by the Mayor's decision to eliminate nearly 4,000 agency jobs, to shrink the number of beds and to consolidate overlapping departments at some of the hospitals. "I support this Mayor and I have supported his positions on many, many issues as they relate to H.H.C.," said Mr. Miranda, who is also president of the Hispanic Federation of New York, an umbrella organization of health and social service agencies in the Hispanic community.
As chairman of the hospitals agency, he said, "I need to reflect the views, the aspirations, the psyche of the administration and for 14 months I did and put them through to the board."
But on the issue of the Medicaid budget, Mr. Miranda said, there was no common vision. While acknowledging the need to control soaring Medicaid costs, Mr. Miranda said that many of the proposed cuts were wrong and unjustly penalized the city's hospitals because of the vast numbers of patients with special needs that the system treats, including those with AIDS and tuberculosis.
And so, after he failed to persuade the Mayor to re-evaluate the proposed cuts, he said he decided that "the right, honorable thing to do" was to resign.
Cristyne F. Lategano, the Mayor's press secretary, said Mr. Miranda was neither pressured to resign nor ordered by the Mayor to vote against the Medicaid resolution. She said Mr. Miranda came to his decision on his own after he and Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers discussed the resolution yesterday morning. "It was a mutual understanding," she said. "I don't think he agreed with the Mayor's philosophy on this."
One key City Hall official, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted that if Mr. Miranda was angry at the administration, he could have remained on the board, voted for the resolution and then resigned. That he did not do so, and chose not to fight City Hall's position on the issue, demonstrates a general lack of rancor between the Mayor and Mr. Miranda, the official said.
Some board members said they felt that the Mayor has been bypassing them as he plans the future dismantling of the agency. They cited as an example the fact that many of them first learned of the proposed sale of three public hospitals from the news media and that even the agency's president, Dr. Bruce Siegel, was left out of the deliberations leading to that decision.
In response, several board members introduced a resolution yesterday demanding that before any agency official discusses with city officials the sale of any of its hospitals or other facilities, the board must first be given a detailed plan about the overall restructuring of the agency.
The resolution failed by a vote of 9 to 6, with many board members saying that such a demand would only increase the bureaucracy everyone wanted to cut and noting that Dr. Siegel had always been forthright in sharing information with the board.
But it was the resolution about the Medicaid cuts that revealed the schisms within the board and underscored the Mayor's need for the cushion of support he now has.
James R. Dumpson, who was appointed to the board during the Dinkins administration, said that the Medicaid cuts, combined with simultaneous income tax cuts, served to "balance the budget on the backs of the poor."
He chided his fellow board members for not speaking out more strongly against such policies.
"It's high time this board made clear where it stands on a number of social and economic issues," he said, adding that "none of us get down to what the people we are mandated to serve in health care really need."
He urged the board to, "for the first time in a long time," send a message to the administration and the people of the city.
David R. Jones, another Dinkins appointee, agreed, saying that it "becomes ridiculous after a point" for the board to "sit on its hands at a time of such great crisis, when a third of our budget is being slashed."
But under the guidance of Ms. Mitchell, the majority of the board was persuaded to show their support for the Medicaid budget cuts by voting against the resolution.

HEADLINE: Trade Won't Make Cuba More Democratic

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Cuba: Time to Change Direction" (editorial, March 19): The claim that trade and contact will bring about the end of the Castro regime ignores facts that make the argument inapplicable to Cuba. 
 Fidel Castro has taken no steps that would allow increased trade and contact to lead to political or economic liberalization. Instead, any hard currency from United States trade and investment, and multilateral development loans that would follow, would substitute for reform.
The Cuban Government controls every industry that generates significant hard currency, including agriculture, mining, medical supplies and tourism. Almost none of the hard currency generated by foreign companies reaches ordinary Cubans.
Foreign companies in Cuba are not permitted to hire employees except through Communist Party-controlled agencies. The Government pays these workers the equivalent of $5 a month in pesos. Cubans themselves cannot hire employees, buy supplies from nonstate sources or protect earnings from arbitrary confiscation by Government squads created by decree to seize assets of those deemed unduly wealthy.
If, as the argument goes, the purpose of rapprochement with Mr. Castro would be to get money into the hands of ordinary Cubans, make them less dependent on the regime and enable them to support institutions independent of state control, like political parties, newspapers, church groups, and professional and labor organizations, the argument is settled. Mr. Castro is not permitting it. Investors from France, Spain and Mexico have been providing crucial support for the Castro regime for years, yet there is no benefit to ordinary citizens.
It is curious that you present Cuba's military threat as a paranoid fantasy. Cuba may not pose the same military threat it once did, but Mr. Castro's inclinations apparently remain unchanged. In November a Russian military delegation led by the chief of staff of Russia's armed forces visited Havana to discuss, among other things, the creation of a joint weapons production facility.
Russia is also providing $200 million annually in continued financing for Cuba's eavesdropping facility at Lourdes. Unsafe Soviet-era nuclear power plants are the subject of a possible French renovation project.
The attempt to ascribe continued support for the embargo and other anti-Castro measures solely to Senator Jesse Helms is inaccurate, and you should know better. Twenty senators, including Bob Dole and me, not to mention the Democrats Charles Robb, Joseph Lieberman and Ernest Hollings, support continued pressure on Mr. Castro by co-sponsoring the Cuban liberty and democratic solidarity bill.

HEADLINE: What Feminism Has Done in Workplace;
Welcome to the Battle

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your March 16 front-page article provides needed clarity to the subject of affirmative action, which has been deliberately misrepresented as an economic sop for less qualified black men. Though virtually ignored in the debate, white women have benefited far more than black men. 
 For example, in office towers in midtown Manhattan and on Wall Street, thousands of administrative, middle-level management, supervisory jobs once held exclusively by white men have now been filled by white women, not black men.
Yet all the attacks on affirmative action have been leveled against the latter. Oddly, white women were silent on this until recently, letting the opposition frame the argument in a black-white context and dredge up the old bugaboo of racism, a sentiment escalated by the racist commentary of right-wing pundits and talk-radio hosts. Their goal is to eviscerate major civil rights legislation.
With the Republican Party's offensive in full gallop, white women have finally raised their voices. I hope they haven't waited too late to join the battle.

'The City'
'New York Visions, 1900-1995'
 ACA Galleries
 41 East 57th Street
 Manhattan
 Through April 1
Dealing with the first half of the century, "The City" concentrates on images of daily life: neighbors chatting on a tenement rooftop, unemployed men loafing in front of garish storefronts, the boardwalk at Coney Island. The heroic modernist vision of New York is evoked in a few works on paper by Abraham Walkowitz, Joseph Stella and John Marin. Otherwise the tone is set by pictures like Edward Laning's 1931 "Street Orator" and Reginald Marsh's 1940 watercolor of guys and dolls at the beach. The subject matter is modern, but the style is not: the listeners surrounding Laning's orator are wearing suits and dresses of monochrome yellow, red, blue and green, like the saints in a quattrocento altarpiece, and Marsh's near-nude beachgoers are positively Michelangelesque. 
 The exhibition jumps abruptly from 1945 to the 1980's and 90's. Its second chapter fits uneasily with its first: what interests artists like Richard Estes, Rackstraw Downes and Yvonne Jacquette is the city's physical structure, not its street life. Romare Bearden's "Street," done in 1985, succeeds in capturing the vitality of a trio of street musicians, but it does so by using collage techniques dating from the 1920's. The paintings of two lesser-known artists, David Kapp and Robert Birmelin, are overly derivative of photographers like Alexander Rodchenko and Garry Winogrand. Architecture and life finally seem to come together in a 1992 canvas by Philip Pearlstein, "Two Models With Empire State Building, Night," but you can tell that the skyscraper is only making a guest appearance.

Salomon Brothers Bids For Block of Derivatives
 
Salomon Brothers offered to buy up to $8.1 billion of derivative securities, clearly deciding that the worst is over for derivatives and they are now probably underpriced.
Other securities firms quickly followed Salomon. Within hours, Morgan Stanley said it would bid for the same block of derivatives, and J. P. Morgan and Merrill Lynch also said they were active in the market. The firms hope to profit by trading, retaining or restructuring the securities. Page 1.
By using relatively simple techniques to diffuse the risk of the derivatives immediately, these firms can lock in a hefty profit. 38.
 
Durable Goods Signal Slowdown, Sending Stocks, Bonds Soaring
 
Orders for durable goods fell 0.8 percent in February to $163 billion, the first decline in four months. The report provided further evidence that the manufacturing expansion was slowing and eased fears that the Fed would increase interest rates next week. 36.
The report helped send the Dow up 50 points, to a record 4,138.67, and 30-year bonds up a full point, reducing their yield to 7.36 percent That's the lowest level in a week. The dollar rose to 1.4210 marks and 88.95 yen. 37.
 
Signs of Success Help Peso, Stocks
 
The peso rebounded to 6.815 to the dollar and the Mexican stock exchange roared back 107 points amid signs that the country's economic recovery plan was beginning to work. 38.
 
Senate Votes to Repeal Tax Break
 
The Senate voted to repeal a tax break aimed at helping minorities buy cable and broadcast companies. The vote is a setback for Viacom, which agreed last year to sell its cable operations for $2.3 billion to a black entrepreneur in California. 39.
 
Group Demands Tax Cut Delay
 
Dozens of moderate Republicans in the House, joined by 23 Democrats who have consistently voted with the majority, demanded that any reductions in taxes be delayed until Congress has passed spending cuts sufficient to compensate for the lost revenue as well as to balance the budget. 1.
 
Rules Proposed for Small Aircraft
 
The Transportation Department proposed tougher operating requirements and equipment standards for small commuter planes, bringing them closer in line to the standards for planes operated by the major airlines. Among the requirements, commuter pilots could no longer work longer hours than pilots for the major carriers and would receive the same level of training. 1.
 
Boeing Offers Retirement Option
 
Boeing announced retirement incentives intended to reduce the number of involuntary layoffs needed to reach its goal of cutting 7,000 jobs this year. The plan will result in a one-time charge of $350 million to $400 million in the company's second fiscal quarter. 39.
 
Time Warner to Sell Atari Stake
 
Time Warner plans to sell part or all of its 24.5 percent stake in Atari in a move to reduce its debt. The stake is worth about $42.9 million. 41.
 
Shareholders Say No to Rowland
 
Roland (Tiny) Rowland narrowly lost a shareholder vote to become president of Lonrho, after having been dismissed as co-chief executive. He was to be named president, but the board withdrew its support. 38.

HEADLINE: Upstate, Democrats Face Budget Quandary

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: JAMESTOWN, N.Y.

 BODY:
Assemblyman William L. Parment drives his 1989 Chevy, a harmonica on the dashboard and 121,600 miles on the odometer, around the hills of his district these days trying to figure out what his voters want. He is a Democrat who won re-election unopposed, but his constituents also voted overwhelmingly for the new Republican Governor, George E. Pataki.
And therein lies his quandary: Does support for Mr. Pataki in his district translate into support for Mr. Pataki's deep-cutting budget? 
 "If the perception in people's minds is, you blocked the new direction, it could cost you a lot of votes," said Mr. Parment, a seven-term incumbent who is only the second Democrat to represent the conservative 150th District in western New York since the Civil War.
Mr. Pataki and his fellow Republicans have made much of Democrats like Mr. Parment, casting them as the G.O.P.'s ace in the hole in this year's contentious budget battle: the Republicans are pouring hundreds of thousands of dollars into advertising in 19 Assembly districts outside New York City where voters elected a Democrat but supported Mr. Pataki. It is a high-stakes campaign to pressure the Democrats to break ranks with their leadership and support the Governor's budget.
And Mr. Parment, like many others, is beginning to feel the effect, even if he is not yet convinced the Republican strategy will work. By 11:15 A.M. on March 17 -- the day after the television ads went on the air, as part of a campaign that included radio spots and mailings -- his office received 22 calls urging him to support the budget. Over the previous six weeks, the calls had run 250 to 20 against it. A week after the ads began to run, Mr. Parment said, calls for and against were running about equal.
So far, Mr. Parment, 53, a soft-spoken country lawmaker and occasional blues harmonica player who is fond of quoting Walt Whitman, is treading a middle ground. He said he supports Mr. Pataki's broad goals of cutting taxes and spending, but is outspoken against many of the specific cuts, especially in higher education and health care. He said that in the end, he would listen to his voters, even at the expense of loyalty to his fellow Democrats.
"Neither side needs to count on my vote unless they present a budget that makes sense to me," Mr. Parment said on a drive through Jamestown, which has been hit hard by the state's economic decline and is apparently eager for change, based on the voting in November.
The Republican strategy assumes a breakdown in the normal way a budget is hammered out -- in private talks by the Governor and the Senate majority leader, currently both Republicans, and the Assembly Speaker, a Democrat. There are 94 Democrats and 56 Republicans in the 150-member Assembly. Of the Democrats, 25 represent districts that voted for Mr. Pataki. If the Republicans can pressure 20 of them to support Mr. Pataki's budget, they can pass it, even over the opposition of Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver.
"A great many Democrats in the Assembly, certainly more than the 20 that you would need to pass it, believe we are doing the right thing," Mr. Pataki said in an interview. He has sent his own mailing, paid for by the Republican Party, to most of the Democratic districts that supported him.
For his part, Mr. Silver said the strategy will never work. Diverse as the Assembly Democrats might be -- there are eight who run with the Conservative Party endorsement -- he said that opposition to the budget would hold them together. "I've been around the state, and I think people don't like the Pataki budget, plain and simple," Mr. Silver said.
But the Republicans say that even if they cannot put together enough renegade Democrats for a vote on Mr. Pataki's budget that excludes the Speaker, their strategy will put pressure on Mr. Silver. The idea is that upstate Democrats will push Mr. Silver closer to Mr. Pataki's version of the budget in internal Assembly negotiations.
The Republicans could also use the hold-outs' votes as a campaign issue against them in the elections of 1996.
There is also a worst-case scenario for Mr. Silver involving the upstate Democrats, though it is improbable. If Mr. Silver ultimately cannot make a deal with the Governor and the Senate majority leader because his members are too divided, he could simply let the upstaters vote with the Assembly Republicans to pass Mr. Pataki's fiscal plan. That would, in theory, allow Mr. Silver to avoid compromising his opposition to Mr. Pataki, but it would come at an enormous cost to Mr. Silver's leadership. "It just won't happen that way," Mr. Silver said.
In many ways, Mr. Parment -- a wry and dry fiscal conservative who has defied his party before by voting against budgets -- symbolizes the problem facing both upstate Assembly Democrats and Mr. Silver. The members of the Assembly's Democratic majority range from people like Mr. Parment, who grew up milking his family's cows before school, to representatives from New York City whose constituents rarely see a cow. Residents here in the westernmost corner of the state say that it is an easier drive to Wrigley Field in Chicago than it is to Shea Stadium, and that his district is midwestern in mindset and geography.
This translates into political interests that often put Democrats at odds, especially on state spending, and the November rejection of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo -- seen as the big-city liberal with little interest in upstate problems -- was but the most dramatic example.
But even while upstate voters rejected Mr. Cuomo, it is unclear how far they embrace Mr. Pataki and his budget. Judging from a dozen interviews with voters here, there appears to be a perception even among some Pataki voters that his budget is simply too much, too fast.
Kathleen Healey, 49, the co-owner of a frame shop, said of Mr. Pataki's budget: "In the long run, it's going to help -- in the next 10 years. Something has to be done, but why are we hitting the elderly and low-income people?"
But as the campaign on both sides heats up -- and if the Governor, the Assembly and the Republican-controlled Senate fail to agree on a budget through negotiations -- people like William Salter, a 44-year-old Republican banker, will no doubt have more say. Mr. Salter is not enthusiastic about many of the cuts either, but he said Mr. Pataki's budget was the only way to jump-start the state back to economic health.
"I've known Bill Parment for 10 years, and I believe in my heart Bill Parment will make the right decision," he said.
But, he added, if Mr. Parment votes against the Governor's budget, "he's going to have to tell me why he's not for it. And if he is picking one or two special interests and he is throwing the baby out with the bath water, then I've got a problem with Bill Parment."
Mr. Parment himself calls his position these days a "tightrope" and is busily working his district to learn where people stand. In November, he received 22,375 votes, but even without an opponent, 18,585 people who voted in other races failed to pull the lever for him. Misreading the electorate, he said, could be a fatal political mistake.
"It presents to me the possibility I could lose an important group of constituents in future elections," he said. "My job is really to convince them that however this battle appears, I'm fighting for their interests. And that's a tough job because it has to be done almost on a one-to-one basis."

HEADLINE: Securities Firms Seeking to Turn Derivatives Debacle Into Profits

BYLINE: BY PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
Wall Street is setting out to try to profit on the widespread fear of the complex financial instruments known as derivatives.
After creating the derivatives that have resulted in spectacular losses for investors ranging from Orange County, Calif., to Gibson Greetings of Cincinnati, Wall Street is trying to increase profits by recycling these much maligned instruments for making side bets on stocks, bonds, currencies and interest rates. Several firms, including those who sold the derivatives in the first place, now want to buy back the hybrid securities at low prices, clean them up and sell them again. 
 Salomon Brothers Inc. started the gambit yesterday morning by announcing that it would buy up to $8.1 billion of certain types of derivatives that were sold by a handful of quasi-government agencies. Other big securities firms quickly followed Salomon's lead, with executives muttering about the big trading firm's marketing savvy.
"We have done something that we hope will be beneficial for the market, and beneficial for us," said a managing director in Salomon Brothers' fixed-income department.
Here's the angle. Shaken by losses in Orange County, by Wisconsin's investment board and in parts of Corporate America, prices have dropped and buyers are scarce. The Wall Street firms are betting, therefore, that they can buy these derivatives cheaply.
And by buying so many of these derivatives, almost a quarter of such issues, the firms are getting the financial equivalent of a huge box of slightly used Legos. This makes it easier for them to mix and match these individual red, yellow and blue financial structures to create less risky new securities that they can sell to new customers at a higher price.
For those who own the derivatives now, the sale may mean a loss. But that may be better than having to hang on to them and worry whether the markets would rebound enough to find buyers and get out unscathed.
The Salomon official, who declined to be named, said this was the largest such offer he had ever seen, and underlined that his firm wanted to offer selling opportunities to holders of these derivatives, and show that there was a large and easily negotiated market for them.
Within hours of Salomon's announcement, Morgan Stanley & Company said it too would bid for the same $8.1 billion of derivatives, which are made up of a total of 59 different securities issued by several groups, including the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, and the Student Loan Mortgage Association, or Sallie Mae. "We wanted to have a chance to bid on these bonds," said David Carroll, a principal at Morgan Stanley.
A spokesman for Merrill Lynch & Company said: "We have been, we are, and we will continue to be, bidding in this market. If the Salomon offer illustrates the existing liquidity in the market, it can't be a bad thing."
J. P. Morgan Securities Inc. said it too continued to make markets in these derivatives -- known as agency structured notes. These notes, many of which involve twists that allow an investor to speculate on the direction and timing of interest rate changes, were mostly issued in the last couple of years.
Derivatives rely on the performance of stocks, bonds or currencies without actually having to own the underlying assets. When used prudently, derivatives can be useful tools that allow treasurers and financiers to manage risk. But they also can be used to make big bets on the direction of financial markets. And they became controversial last year when many of these bets went sour and many investors were faced with big losses.
Just this week, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board said that one of its funds suffered losses of $95 million mainly because it used derivatives to speculate on the Mexican peso and European currencies.
Clearly the big securities firms, following a recent rally in the bond markets, think the worst may be over in the derivatives debacle. Just yesterday, a senior investment banker speculated that if Orange County had held onto much of its derivatives portfolio it would now be happy with many of those investments. Many of these investments would have appreciated, he argued, as it has become clearer that the United States is close to the top of a series of interest rate increases.
Salomon, after almost $400 million of losses in 1994, is seeking ways to use its traditional trading strengths to take advantage of the current dim view that many investors take of derivative securities. After such a bad year in 1994, the firm is more eager than ever to find trading opportunities to make big profits.
This was also something of a publicity stunt by Salomon, its competitors assert. "We're open for business every business day," said Mr. Carroll of Morgan Stanley, "and these bonds have been traded in the past." Salomon's marketing ploy clearly unnerved its competitors. Morgan Stanley officers said they had received several telephone calls from investors inquiring whether Salomon had some kind of exclusive right to make offers to buy these derivatives.
The spread between bid and offer prices for many of these derivative securities has widened and their prices also have dropped, two Morgan Stanley executives explained. Thus, there are some interesting buying opportunities, particularly when many of the smaller investors like local governments may be unnerved by recent scandals involving derivatives, they added.
The Salomon offer to buy the 59 different securities issues gives investors the opportunity to sell either in a dutch auction or to sell using the firm's continuous price quotes for these securities. Unless it is extended, Salomon's tender offer will expire on April 7.

HEADLINE: In SoHo, an Outcry From the Lofts;
Artists Organizations to Fight Hotel in Neighborhood

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
To listen to neighbors, one would think the new hotel that is going up in SoHo portends a biblical scourge. Sunlight will be obliterated. Traffic will become even more congested as cars sputter out poisons during the endless wait at the Holland Tunnel. The sewer system, already overtaxed, will overflow. Tour buses will multiply, carrying with them that dread of dread, the untasteful.
 Preliminary construction began this week on the 370-room SoHo Grand, the first hotel to be built in SoHo in a century. An agreement was reached on Monday in which the developer, Hartz Mountain Industries, promised to drive piles gently so as not to rattle artworks near the site. 
 The agreement, reached in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, replaced a temporary restraining order obtained by the daughter of the late Chaim Gross, a legendary name in sculpture, whose works she feared might be literally shaken.
 The restraining order was just the first shot. The community is intensifying its campaign against the hotel, with plans to sue the city, mount protests, and contact eminent artists around the world to add their famous signatures to a petition.
 Over the years SoHo has evolved from a seedy manufacturing district into New York's biggest Euro-mall, with its vast minimalist stores, downtown-grunge cafes and pedestrians from the Continent. But it is also a tight community, locals insist, as well as a global art center and retail hub for ultra-trendy furnishings.
 Residents are fighting in the manner of any neighborhood defending its interests, especially one in which many acquired million-dollar lofts for peanuts. But they are also doing so with the conviction that they are defending Art from the barbarians.
 If the hotel is stopped, it would be the eighth proposed hotel for SoHo to be killed by opposition, or economics, in the last decade.
 Emanuel Stern, the Hartz executive vice president guiding the project, said it may be impossible to satisfy his opponents, who credit themselves not only in having brought human habitation but also style and attitude to what is still officially a manufacturing zone. The only SoHo they will stand for, he said, is the SoHo they pioneered -- one without a hotel.
 "To many of them, there is no such thing as change that's acceptable," he said.
 Stopping the Grand, opponents acknowledge, will be their biggest challenge, since there are few regulatory avenues. Hotels in manufacturing zones require no extraordinary permits. The most recent attempt to build a hotel on the same site failed because it also included housing, which needs a variance from the Board of Standards and Appeals to be built in a manufacturing area.
 The Grand, at 310 West Broadway between Grand and Canal Streets, is not in the landmark district that begins across West Broadway. Another hotel, planned for the corner of Mercer and Prince Streets, lies in this district, but its small-scale and artful restoration of a historic building has minimized opposition. That hotel, the Mercer, is still seeking financing but the developer, Andre P. Balazs, who owns the Chateau Marmont in Hollywood, hopes to begin construction this year. The Grand's ceremonial groundbreaking is scheduled for April 3.
 It is the Grand's size that opponents say offends them. Because of the purchase of air rights from surrounding property owners, the hotel will be 15 stories in a neighborhood of 5- and 6-story buildings.
 Although construction has consisted only of preliminary digging, neighbors contend that their life styles are already threatened.
 "It feels like an earthquake," Lauren Hyman, a movie publicist and spokeswoman for the Soho Alliance, a community group opposing the project, said of the excavation work. "I'm terrified."
 Nina Meledandri, an abstract painter whose loft overlooks the construction site, said: "I grew up on the Upper East Side and I never expected to find a community like this anywhere. Now I feel somebody is coming in and just taking what he needs. It's like being raped."
 Accordingly, the opponents led with a seeming ace, Chaim Gross, who died three years ago. Gross was a longtime resident of SoHo. Neighbors said they still expect the affable artist with a head of bushy white hair to amble around the corner, padding contemplatively between his two SoHo studios.
 Mr. Gross's daughter, Mimi, tends to one of the studios, which contains more than 100 important sculptures, bronze casts and plaster originals. When pile-driving tests began on March 14, she said, she felt vibrations in her building, adjoining the hotel site. Supported by neighbors, Ms. Gross got the restraining order.
 In Monday's agreement, Hartz Mountain agreed to proceed gently in driving 299 piles as far down as 85 feet -- at least for the two weeks likely required to pack and remove the art.
 "I understand development has to happen, but a 15-story hotel is a monster," Ms. Gross said.
 Mr. Stern said that he will go to great lengths to protect the Gross sculptures. "Tell us what you want," he said. "We'll drive piles so gently a nickel will stand on its edge."
 Mr. Stern pointed out that the hotel was designed to conform to its cast-iron environment with slabs of slate and a cast-aluminum facade. He also promised residents that Hartz, which manufactures pet food, develops real estate and owns The Village Voice, would operate the hotel itself and not turn it over to a management chain like Ramada.
 He expects the hotel to generate $1.2 million a year in property taxes and to employ 200 people full-time. He said that the Grand, a moderately priced hotel at $150 a double, will be stylish on the order of the Paramount Hotel on West 46th Street. A marketing study predicted that guests will come from visitors to New York University and Cooper Union, the arts communities of SoHo and neighboring TriBeCa, and trainees for Wall Street positions. Though Mr. Stern said tour buses would not be a central part of his business, he did not deny that they would be invited.
 Hartz bought the property in 1988 for $7 million with the thought that a luxury hotel would be the perfect thing for Gotham's booming economy. Then came the recession, and the land lay idle. Hartz thought hard about a youth hostel where lodgers would pay about $40 a night, but the numbers just wouldn't crunch. For years the property was on the market for $5 million. The community wants the land for a park.
 "I want to be accepted by the people who live and work in SoHo," Mr. Stern said.
 At a meeting of the SoHo Alliance this week in a loft filled with abstract art and many trees, about 40 people, many of them artists, mapped out their multifront war against the hotel. It did not include accepting Mr. Stern into the fold. In fact, one woman suggested trying to embarrass Emanuel Stern because he is "31 years old and vulnerable." Another strategy was to "build drama" in the media.
 They decided to collect signatures from artists and publish them in a downtown newspaper other than the Stern-owned Voice.
 Kathryn E. Freed, the City Council member representing SoHo, then advised them on how to hold an effective protest march.
 "You need a lot of people in the community to show up with dogs and baby carriages," she said. "The whole business."

HEADLINE: Are 'Cuts' Really Cuts? That Depends

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24

 BODY:
If the just-concluded House debate over welfare spending underscores anything, it is that Republicans and Democrats do not differ merely over ideology. They also use different accountants.
The result was a baffling skirmish in which Democrats, wielding their numbers, accused Republicans of slashing aid to hungry children and pregnant women, and Republicans, wielding their own numbers, claimed to be increasing aid to the same groups. Even more confusing, both arguments were accurate. 
 But neither was the whole truth. The fact is that any spending proposal can be judged only against a yardstick: what future Federal spending would be if the proposal were not enacted into law. Without such a measure, it is nearly impossible to say what effect any spending change would have.
Accountants call such yardsticks "base lines." And in effect Democrats are measuring by feet and inches in the present budget debate, while Republicans are calculating by the metric system.
The Democratic view of base-line budgeting, solidified over 40 years of control of Congress, is that any spending forecast must employ the best guesses of experts about what the future holds.
Inflation, and changes in demographics, the economy and social trends, all figure in: spending predictions for school breakfasts, say, rely in part on the assumption that more schools will join the program, raising the daily number of breakfasts to 1.4 million by 2000 from the current 1.1 million.
Republicans take a directly opposite view. They believe that future spending should be measured not against predictions, which never prove completely on target, but against what is actually being spent right now. And so when Republicans pushed a five-year, $95 billion package of cuts in domestic discretionary spending through the House Budget Committee this month, their base line was this year's level of such spending -- about $545 billion -- projected as far as the eye could see.
Republicans have advocated such flat-line spending forecasts, called "current law" base lines in budget parlance, since at least the 1970's.
In theory, this numbers-crunching debate should have no effect on policy or politics. Neither of the base lines is wrong; they simply offer different ways of looking at the same numbers.
But as the welfare debate in the House demonstrated, the method of budget calculus takes on immense significance when the Government is divided into opposing ideological camps.
In this week's welfare debate, for example, Democrats seeking to protect social spending assailed Republicans for reducing spending on child nutrition programs below the "current services" base lines, used by the White House and the Congressional Budget Office. And so Representative Dale E. Kildee of Michigan could accuse the House majority of favoring "drastically reduced funding" for school lunches. And Representative Lynn Woolsey of California could try to shame the Republicans by telling them, "Starving children is not the solution to balancing our budget."
While the language may be hyperbolic, the central argument, viewed through the Democrats' accounting prism, has some basis in fact: the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal policy group, calculates that the block-grant approach in House welfare legislation would cut some $2.3 billion, as measured by the Democrats' base line, over the next five years.
But from where Republicans in the House see matters, the picture is radically different.
"What is indisputable is that we are not proposing a cut of one penny in the school lunch program," Representative James C. Greenwood of Pennsylvania told Democrats on Wednesday. "The President, in this year's budget proposal -- the President of the United States, the one who went to visit the schoolchildren in Maryland for lunch -- he proposed a 3.6 percent increase this year. And we proposed 4.5 percent."
That may not be precisely true; other experts place the Republicans' increase, as measured by their own base line, at 4 percent. But Mr. Greenwood's basic contention -- that spending will rise as measured against what is now spent -- is accurate.
In a city where perception often creates its own reality, the use of numbers to tailor a political image -- of caring, compassionate Democrats or prudent, common-sense Republicans -- is no small matter. But the choice of budgeting base lines has even bigger implications.
Republicans make a case that the Democrats' method, with its built-in inflators, has created a fantasy world in which spending "cuts" are often really increases, with big increases made to look tiny when compared with a rising line on a graph. Budgeting by crystal ball removes all discipline from the spending process, they say, because it relies on assumptions that can be changed at a whim.
True enough, perhaps, but the Republicans' current-law base lines defy reality in their own way by ignoring the inevitability of changing circumstances. The 1994 Pentagon budget, for example, was roughly the size of the Pentagon budget in 1987 but paid for 600,000 fewer soldiers and 200 fewer ships.

GRAPHIC: Graph: "ON THE OTHER HAND: A Closer Look at Budget Proposals"
How much politicians cut spending depends entirely on how much spending politicians start with. Both the Clinton Administration and House Republicans have proposed cuts in discretionary spending that each says would pay for tax relief. But as the chart shows, they use different assumptions about the future to forecast spending - and so the savings they project are not comparable.
 
For example, when President Clinton's proposed cuts are measured against his base line, the cuts are quite substantial - about $100 billion over five years, But measured against the Republican base line, the president's proposals would cut spending not at all. Similarly, the Republicans say they are cutting $95 billion from discretionary spending over five years. But measured against the Clinton or Congressional Budget Office base line, they have proposed much deeper cuts.

HEADLINE: Texarkana Journal;
Twice as Difficult to Be Twice as Nice

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: TEXARKANA, U.S.A., March 23

 BODY:
The only post office in the nation that straddles a state line is evenly split between the cities of Texarkana. Its base is made of Texas pink granite and its walls of Arkansas limestone. The Chamber of Commerce logo features a hugging Razorback and Longhorn, and the tourism motto is, "Texarkana: Twice as Nice."
But there is a problem these days in these twin cities, which take their names from the two states they join, as well as nearby Louisiana, and which are divided through most of the downtown section by a yellow stripe down the middle of State Line Avenue. The two Texarkanas may be joined at the hip, but the people who run them are barely speaking to each other. 
 Mayor John Jarvis of Texarkana, Tex., says of his counterpart in Texarkana, Ark., the Rev. Londell Williams: "I've called many times and don't get a response. I understand he's very hard to get in touch with."
A visitor to the two Texarkanas, shuttling a few hundred feet to the Arkansas side's City Hall, found Mayor Williams sitting at his desk right inside the front door. "No, I don't see him that often," he said of Mayor Jarvis. "Of course, when I do, it's always courteous."
The Arkansas side recently formed its own economic development commission, a rival to the Chamber of Commerce that has theoretically represented both sides equally since 1914. And the two Mayors broke a Texarkana custom when they rode in separate parade cars in the local fair last fall.
The feud between the two cities stems from growing economic disparities between Texarkana, Ark., and its larger, somewhat wealthier Texas neighbor, and is exacerbated by a dispute over where to build a new Interstate highway to Shreveport, La., 60 miles to the southeast, that could bring major tax revenue to either side. And some people here also suggest that racial tensions are at work, as Mr. Williams is the first black Mayor from either side.
Whatever the cause, the rivalry provoked a warning this week from the Congressman representing the Arkansas side, Jay Dickey, who said it was undermining the efforts that he and his Texas counterpart, Representative Jim Chapman Jr., are making to save the Red River Army Depot, a major employer in the area. The depot was recently listed among the military bases the Pentagon plans to close. It is on the Texas side, but its 4,500 workers come from both states.
"What I'm observing is that we're pulling away from each other in Texarkana," Mr. Dickey, a second-term Republican, told the Chamber of Commerce this week. "We're harming the cause, making it extremely difficult for us to represent you, if, in fact, you want representation."
To be sure, many people here seem more bemused than bothered by the bickering.
"It's no big deal," said Jack Mills, the owner of Fat Jack's Oyster Bar, which is on the Arkansas side but is a shell's throw from Texas. "I don't think the people are fighting. But city officials are fighting."
There are clear differences between the two Texarkanas, some simply quirky -- one can drive south on State Line Avenue at 40 miles per hour, but northbound, on the Arkansas side, the speed limit is 45. And the Texas side, with a population of 51,815, is about twice the size of its Arkansas twin.
There are plenty of shuttered buildings in both downtowns, but the Texas side is nonetheless a bit more stylish. It has, for instance, the elegant Perot Theater, originally the Saenger, a 1924 Italianate Renaissance building that was restored several years ago with a nearly $1 million donation from a Texas-side native, Ross Perot.
While neither city can be characterized as affluent, the Texas side is better off economically. The 1990 census showed a per-capita income of about $12,000 on the Texas side and $10,000 on the Arkansas side.
One reason frequently cited by store owners on either side of the border is the Arkansas anti-usury law, which caps interest charges at about 10 percent, five percentage points above the Federal discount rate, while Texas retailers have no such limit. The most significant effect is that all new-car dealerships, the largest mall and many other stores are on the Texas side, where dealers can charge higher interest.
In addition, one of the largest employers in the downtown Arkansas city, the St. Michael Health Care Center, recently moved to the Texas side, saying it was simply a better place for a planned expansion. The departure blew a major hole in the Arkansas city's tax base and has left the downtown with an empty, peach-colored hulk.
Eventually, part of the building is to be converted to what is officially termed a community punishment center. "That's what we used to call a jail," Mayor Williams said, adding bitterly, "We'll take it, because one-tenth of something is better than no-tenths of nothing."
Mr. Williams also wonders whether racial factors are at work in the widening disparities. About one-third of the Arkansas side's population is black, and that percentage is growing, while the Texas side remains at about one-quarter black.
The president of the Texarkana Chamber of Commerce, Robert E. (Swede) Lee, insisted that city officials in Arkansas would be better off if they spent less time fighting over issues like the location of the new Interstate highway and more time trying to improve the whole region.
"We have always said one thing about the highway," Mr. Lee said. "We don't care which side of the line it passes on. What we want to do is get it built as fast as we can, and we'll all accrue the benefits from it."
But Mayor Williams said the location of the highway, and the tax money it will generate from gas stations, hotels and other businesses, was critical.
"People say it doesn't make any difference which side it comes on," he said. "Well, it does. When the cash register rings on the Texas side, it's for Texas. When it rings on the Arkansas side, it's for Arkansas."

HEADLINE: Americans Held by Iraq Are in Good Health

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24

 BODY:
Polish diplomats have visited two Americans held in Iraq and found them in good health, the White House said today as it renewed its call on Baghdad to release the men as a humanitarian gesture.
The two men have been imprisoned since they were arrested last week for crossing into Iraq from Kuwait. While expressing relief that Iraq had allowed access to them, the White House warned that Baghdad could serve no purpose in holding the men longer. 
 "Any delay will simply raise questions as to the motives of Iraq," said Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman.
But signals from Iraq suggest that it is unlikely the matter will be resolved quickly. Tariq Aziz, the Deputy Prime Minister, was quoted today as saying that the men could face jail sentences of up to eight years.
"The Americans violated Iraqi law," Mr. Aziz said in an interview with Energy Compass, an oil publication. "I expect they will be sentenced according to the nature of their violation."
The two men, William Barloon and David Daliberti, are civilian employees associated with the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which maintains Kuwaiti aircraft. They were arrested on March 13 after reportedly visiting friends in the demilitarized zone between Iraq and Kuwait.
Iraqi officials had offered assurances that Mr. Barloon and Mr. Daliberti were in good condition. But Iraq had refused to permit foreign diplomats or Red Cross representatives to visit them, and today's announcement was the first indication that they are indeed in good health.
The Administration relies on Poland to handle United States interests in Iraq. Washington has not had diplomatic relations with Baghdad since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, and relations have become even more strained in recent weeks after Washington persuaded the United Nations to maintain economic sanctions against Iraq.
Mr. Aziz was quoted as saying there was no connection between the treatment of the prisoners and the sanctions, which were imposed after the 1990 invasion. But other Iraqi officials have suggested that attention should be focused more on the suffering of the Iraqi people than on the fate of two prisoners.
In its statement, the White House was clearly intent on discouraging such comparisons.
"It remains our view that this situation is the result of an innocent mistake on the part of these two Americans and no purpose can be served by prolonging it or trying to link it to other, unrelated issues," Mr. McCurry said. He said Iraq "should now resolve this matter by releasing the two Americans on humanitarian grounds, and we hope this will occur in the near future."
Two other Americans are known to have crossed the border from Kuwait since the gulf war ended in 1991. One was released soon after his capture; the other served about six months of an eight-year sentence for illegal entry before he was released.

HEADLINE: Consumers Must Pay to Clean Environment, Commissioner Says

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 23

 BODY:
As he seeks to make New York State's environmental bureaucracy less adversarial toward business, Michael D. Zagata, the new Commissioner for Environmental Conservation, says the state should begin telling people that if they want cleaner air and water, they must pay more of the bill.
 "We've got to start educating the public about the fact that some of the burden for getting the last increment that's left is going to shift from industry to the consumer," he said in an interview after his confirmation by the State Senate on Monday. "We have not done a good job of that, and that's why I think you're seeing a revolt."
 That revolt, he said, is being led by ordinary citizens who object to paying more for cleaner-burning gasoline and cleaner-running cars, for public purchases of scenic land and the cleanup of toxic waste on industrial sites. He said that if people do not want to pay, they must understand that making industry foot the bill will hurt the economy.
 "Do we want to say, 'Industry, you're going to have to clean up even though it's a 200-to-1 higher cost,' and run the risk of driving industry out of the state?" he asked.
 In his quest to balance economic interests with environmental ones, Mr. Zagata reflects the dual -- critics would say contradictory -- mission of Gov. George E. Pataki. The Governor has won plaudits from environmentalists, but also campaigned last year to reduce regulation, often citing the Department of Environmental Conservation as a prime example of burdensome bureaucracy. Mr. Pataki now wants Mr. Zagata to satisfy both sides: be less onerous to industry without being less vigilant about pollution.
 Without offering details, Mr. Zagata said he envisioned a variety of policies to reverse his agency's reputation for punishing companies rather than working with them to solve environmental problems.
 He said he would establish programs to educate companies about regulations so arcane that "the way a piece of paper is filed" can be a violation. He would require inspectors to perform their work in fewer visits to avoid "interrupting production." He would speed issuance of pollution and building permits.
 And he would give companies more opportunities to correct pollution problems before the state takes enforcement action. To do that, he would have inspectors perform "environmental audits" that inform companies about possible pollution violations. Six months later, another team of inspectors would review whether the company had taken steps to reverse those problems. If steps were taken, no fines or penalties would be levied.
 "For the last several years, the appearance has been that our mission has been enforcement rather than compliance," he said.
 But Mr. Zagata said he did not want the agency to be all carrots and no sticks. "Enforcement is definitely a tool in my bag of tricks," he told a State Senate committee on Monday.
 Mr. Zagata cites economic issues in suggesting that he might change the department's direction on other matters. He questioned whether the state should continue plans to centralize its auto-inspection system and to require that 2 percent of all new cars offered for sale by 1998 be electric-powered. He voiced concerns about whether the state should buy more land in the Adirondacks, saying he did not want to hurt local towns by reducing their tax bases.
 And he said that any plan to protect New York City's watershed must not harm the economies of watershed towns, criticizing city officials for "walking away from the table" during negotiations with those towns.
 Mr. Zagata's comments have already infuriated some environmentalists. Lee Wasserman, executive director of Environmental Advocates, a nonprofit group, said Mr. Zagata's policies mean polluters "will get one free bite at the apple." Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, chairman of the Assembly Environmental Committee, attacked Mr. Zagata for allowing Mr. Pataki to make budget cuts that he said would gut the agency's enforcement abilities.
 Mr. Zagata, 52, is a native New Yorker who speaks with a Texas twang developed during 14 years working as an environmental manager in Houston for oil and natural gas companies. There, he pioneered a concept known as mitigation banking, which allows companies to earn permits for building on protected wetlands by first expanding existing wetlands. He said he planned a similar policy for New York State, starting with state highway projects.
 In 1994, he lost his job as vice president of environmental affairs for Transco Energy during a corporate downsizing, and was hired by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to be the Environmental Conservation Department's liaison to business.
 He holds a doctorate in wildlife ecology, has worked as a lobbyist for the National Audubon Society and has taught wildlife resources at the University of Maine.
 Born in the tiny rural town of West Davenport, Mr. Zagata is an outdoorsman whose office walls are hung with photographs of him hunting and fishing. Though he is only 5 feet 8 inches tall, he is a former football tackle who clearly takes some pride in his toughness.
 He recalls, for instance, being rapped on the knuckles by his parochial-school teachers whenever he wrote left-handed. Today, Mr. Zagata remains a proud and unrepentant southpaw with a pen.
 "Every time they hit me, I'd go home and practice with my left hand," he recalled with a smile.

HEADLINE: In Jericho, Pledges of U.S. Aid and a Glimpse at Arafat

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

DATELINE: JERICHO, West Bank, March 24

 BODY:
As the highest-ranking United States official to call on an area governed by Palestinians, Vice President Al Gore came to town today offering $65 million in American aid and trade benefits for exporters here and in the Gaza Strip.
But bigger news for many residents was the arrival of another stranger, Yasir Arafat, who for months had communicated with his Palestinian Authority constituents in Jericho mostly by rumor. 
 It was the first time that they laid eyes on Mr. Arafat, who is based in Gaza, since he visited for a few hours when he took the authority's helm last July. Even townspeople who support him feel bruised by the neglect. It is one reason, they say, that they are still waiting for a coveted economic boom in this place where many planned projects amount to nothing but billboard advertisements posted on vacant lots.
Mr. Arafat sensed the hurt feelings, and after flying in aboard an Egyptian military helicopter, he dealt with them in a speech from a City Hall balcony overlooking the main square. This time, he plans to stay for at least two days.
"I was supposed to have my headquarters here -- you know that," he said. Blame Israel for his long absence, he added, for it has yet to open promised land passages across its territory to connect the far-flung self-rule areas of Gaza and Jericho.
"I don't want to say that it's a conspiracy, but it is an Israeli attempt to keep us from being together," the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization said. But for all the difficulties, he asserted, the time is near when Palestinians will have autonomy throughout the West Bank and then a state, with its capital in Jerusalem.
If turnout is an indicator, Mr. Arafat no longer causes a sensation by his mere presence in the territories. Not many more than 1,000 people turned out for his speech in this town of 15,000 despite sunny, breeze-stroked weather. He even endured a rude sermon from a preacher at a mosque where he had gone for Friday noon prayers.
The speaker, Sheik Abdel Salam Abu Shkhaidem, railed at his congregants that Jews always break their agreements and are "the killers of prophets," according to a Palestinian journalist who was there. And anyone who trusts them and deals with them is their ally, he reportedly said, even "if they wear Arab dress."
That sounded suspiciously like a reference to Mr. Arafat. He was said to have glowered with enough menace that a mosque official signaled silently to the preacher to mind his tongue, which Sheik Abu Shkhaidem did, turning his thoughts to how, of course, "everyone has to do whatever he can."
With a presumption that the P.L.O. leader needs bolstering, Mr. Gore visited for about two hours, going to Jericho instead of Gaza because the Secret Service felt he could be better protected in this relatively staid desert oasis than in the roiling coastal strip.
As part of a United States pledge to give the Palestinian Authority $500 million over five years, the Vice President announced plans to spend $40 million on badly needed sewerage projects in Gaza and $25 million on programs that are supposed to show quick results. For a start, the Americans gave $8 million today to pave streets and improve refugee housing in Gaza, plans that officials said should create more than 5,000 short-term jobs.
In addition, Mr. Gore said manufacturers and farmers in Gaza and Jericho would have duty-free access to the United States market, although the dollar benefit to Palestinians was not clear.
The Vice President, who had traveled through the Middle East all week, warned that the Palestinian Authority must control Islamic suicide bombers and others whose repeated attacks against Israel have contributed to months of stagnation in peace talks. He welcomed as "an important step forward" a fresh promise by Mr. Arafat to set up special courts to hear security cases, even if there is no sign of when the first suspect will be put on trial.
On Thursday, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel told Mr. Gore that a recently set target date of July 1 for completing the next phase of negotiations hinged on Mr. Arafat's "curbing terrorism." It was a mild version of Mr. Rabin's often-stated caution that there are "no holy dates" in the talks, which are already many months behind schedule.
Mr. Arafat did not mention this matter. But a senior aide, Nabil Shaath, questioned whether the Israelis are serious about coming to terms, saying of the July 1 target that he "never believed that date in the first place."
"If Mr. Rabin says that dates are not holy, then it means the agreement is not holy and then that peace is not holy," Mr. Shaath said.

Yesterday in Washington

 BODY:

TAX CUTS -- Agitation over the Republicans' promised tax cuts broadened as dozens of moderate House Republicans, joined by 23 Democrats who have consistently voted with the majority, demanded that the cuts be delayed until it was clear how they would be paid for. Earlier in the week, 102 Republicans in the House broke ranks with the leadership on the proposed $500 tax credit for families with children. The combined developments suggest trouble for Speaker Newt Gingrich.
 
SPENDING CUTS -- The Senate Appropriations Committee slashed $13 billion from hundreds of Federal programs as a way to reduce the budget deficit and pay for disaster aid to California. The measure cleared the committee by unanimous consent after Democrats agreed to hold their amendments, and their rancor, for the Senate floor.
 
WELFARE REFORM -- The House approved one of the most important items on the Republican agenda, a measure to undo six decades of Federal social-welfare legislation. The vote, almost entirely on party lines, was 234 to 199.
 
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION -- The Senate voted to repeal a communications tax break intended to bolster minority ownership of cable and broadcast companies. The repeal, passed on a voice vote, is a blow to the entertainment giant Viacom Inc. The company's plan to use the 17-year-old tax break to defer nearly $500 million in Federal taxes on the sale of its cable systems propelled the provision into the spotlight.
 
On another issue, Deval Patrick, Assistant Attorney General for civil rights, told a House panel: "This Administration is committed to the goal of expanding opportunity for all Americans in education, employment and the economy generally. There will be no retreat from that commitment." The White House is reviewing affirmative action plans.

HEADLINE: Making Derivatives Pay: Take Apart, Sell Pieces

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
When Salomon Brothers announced yesterday that it wanted to buy up to $8.1 billion in unwanted and complex derivatives, it might have seemed to Main Street as sensible as offering to buy up spent uranium rods from nuclear reactors.
After all, there seems to be no end to the stories of investors who have lost money from complex bets made with derivatives. Just Thursday, the State of Wisconsin said these newfangled financial instruments cost it $95 million. 
 But in fact, Salomon -- or a competing Wall Street firm -- can avail itself of relatively simple techniques to diffuse the risk of the derivatives immediately while locking in a hefty profit.
That's why half a dozen other banks and brokerage firms said they wanted to buy the same derivatives that Salomon was trying to get.
The reason they can do this is that these derivatives, while large, are not so complex as they may appear. They were created originally by combining several of the simpler actively traded derivatives into a single package. These securities, known as structured notes, matched the market predictions of various investors, many of whom turned out to be quite wrong.
Now, Salomon -- or the successful bidder -- can buy the structured notes and in essence take them apart and sell the pieces for more than the whole.
"Think of a structured note as a sports car," one senior trader at a large bank said. "It's risky if you drive too fast and crash it into a tree, but you can buy a sports car, take all the components out and sell them for a profit with no risk."
Despite Salomon's unusual announcement yesterday, this is actually a routine business on Wall Street these days. Traders are constantly buying structured notes and various bonds and using derivatives to add or subtract features to make them more palatable to investors.
For example, one of the derivatives that Salomon wants to buy is a $300 million note issue from the Student Loan Marketing Association, or Sallie Mae, that pays interest of 10 percent minus the interest rate known as Libor -- the London Interbank Offered Rate -- which is what banks pay for large one-month deposits.
Since interest rates have risen sharply in recent months, the yield on this bond has fallen, causing its value to plunge as well. If rates rise more, it will lose even more value.
But Salomon or another Wall Street dealer that buys this bond is not likely to take that risk. Instead, the firm will simply buy two interest rate swaps, which are the most common and actively traded form of derivative, and combine them with the note to make an investment that simply floats up and down with Libor. There is a huge market for such conservative floating rate investments. And Salomon would have no trouble finding a buyer for the neutralized note.
Some of the notes are more complicated. There is a $175 million Federal Home Loan Bank issue that pays based on a formula of the prime rate charged by banks, plus 2.75 percentage points, minus the three-month Libor. So the owner of that would get more money if the prime rose faster than the London rate.
These more involved contracts may require Salomon to assemble a dozen different swaps, options or futures contracts to neutralize the risks fully. But from Wall Street's point of view, the more the merrier, because since they buy these hedges from their own derivatives departments, they make a profit on each component.

HEADLINE: Stock Prices Surge to Yet Another High

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
After essentially drifting for five sessions, the stock market vaulted to record levels yesterday, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finishing above 500 for the first time in history. Bond prices rose, too, helped by a stronger dollar overseas.
Stock prices were lifted, in part, because of a new Government report on factory orders for costly machinery and consumer goods, a key measure of economic strength. The report that durable goods orders had slipped eight-tenths of 1 percent in February appeared to indicate that the economy was slowing, exactly as traders had hoped. 
 But some analysts discounted the report's effect, saying the numbers were too volatile and unreliable. Other analysts discussing the rise in stocks pointed to the end of the first quarter, a time when many portfolio managers must move assets from cash to stocks to try to meet performance targets.
Still, the dollar, which has declined more than 12 percent against the yen so far this year, could mean a bumper crop of first-quarter profits for American multinationals, which get part of their revenues in stronger foreign currencies and then trade them in for a greater number of dollars. Stock traders may be bidding up prices for this reason. Meanwhile, the firmer dollar encourages foreign investors to buy stocks.
And there were clearly buyers yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial average started out strong and continued to build strength throughout the day, surging more than 50 points at 3:43 P.M. That set off the New York Stock Exchange's so-called circuit-breaker rules, which are intended to slow high-speed computer-guided trading.
By the close, the Dow had surged 50.84 points, to a record 4,138.67, while the broader S.& P. 500 rose 5.02 points, to 500.97, also a new high. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 7.27 points, to 818.66, still another record.
On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing stocks outnumbered declining issues by 1,625 to 657. New highs were hit by 108 stocks, new lows by only 25.
In the logic of the market, too strong an economy is just as bad, or worse, than too weak an economy. Traders hope for a "Goldilocks" economy, with just the right dose of economic growth to make stocks more valuable but too little inflation to hurt the value of fixed-income investments, like bonds.
The Commerce Department's report that orders for big-ticket durable goods, as diverse as airplanes, cars and refrigerators, declined eight-tenths of 1 percent in February was slightly less steep than private-sector economists' expectations of a nine-tenths of 1 percent decline, but it was the first drop since October.
But economists point out that durable goods orders are notoriously volatile, and some contended that the report was not a harbinger of a significant slowing. A big commercial aircraft order, for example, can send a single month's report skyward, as well as make the succeeding month seem earthbound by comparison.
Orders for nonmilitary capital goods like tractors, cranes, and cement mixers actually rose 5.5 percent a month on average for the January to February period after falling five-tenths of 1 percent in the November to December 1994 period.
Still, there has been some slowing in the economy. For the November 1994 to February 1995 period, durable goods orders rose an average of three-tenths of 1 percent monthly, only half the six-tenths of 1 percent average in the July 1994 to October 1994 period.
More important, according to Maria Fiorini Ramirez, who runs an economic consulting firm that bears her name, is the dollar, which firmed yesterday -- a good sign because traders dump worrisome currencies in advance of the weekend, when markets are closed. Yesterday, the dollar rose to 88.95 yen from 88.15 yen, a record low, and advanced to 1.4172 German marks from 1.4037 marks.
"I don't know whether we've reached a plateau level against the yen," Ms. Ramirez said, "but we've probably reached it against the mark."
However, she said the dollar was still fragile. "A Polish newspaper editor told me the other day," Ms. Ramirez added, "that even the poor little Polish zloty has appreciated against the dollar."
The fate of the dollar will be important for stocks, according to David D. Holt, vice president for research and strategy at Wedbush Morgan Securities. "If the dollar firms because of central bank intervention, then it's a sloppy Band-Aid on a major wound," he said. "If it's because currency traders have milked everything they could possibly milk out of the dollar, then you've got a net positive for stocks."
Among the day's big gainers was Adobe Systems, a developer of computer software, which jumped 11 1/2, to 50 1/4. It reported late on Thursday that first-quarter per-share profit was 54 cents, far more than the 38 cents expected by Wall Street.
Canandaigua Wine climbed 3 1/2, to 40 1/2, the second day after it said it planned to buy certain Guinness liquor brands.
The American depository receipts for Telefonos de Chile advanced 3 1/8, to 69, as the overall stock market in Chile gained.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was about 12 percent above normal, with 369.5 million shares changing hands.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.58 points, to 270.50; the American Stock Exchange market value index rose 2.38 points, to 460.90.
Of the Dow's 30 component stocks, 26 rose, led by Caterpillar, which tacked on 1 1/2 to close at 51. AT&T led the S.& P. 500's component stocks, rising 3/4, 52 5/8.
The most active stock, at 12.45 million shares, was Telefonos de Mexico, whose A.D.R.'s gained 3/4, to 27 3/4, even after a CS First Boston analyst downgraded it to "hold" from "buy."

HEADLINE: As H.M.O.'s Rise, New York Is Catching Up With Others

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Long considered stuck in the medical dark ages with respect to managed care, New York State is fast catching up with the rest of the country, experts say, as new figures show that a quarter of the state's residents have now joined health maintenance organizations.
Experts say that the 25 percent mark -- which means that about 4.5 million New Yorkers now belong to the organizations -- is a milestone for the H.M.O. industry, signaling that more change is right around the corner. 
 Once the 25 percent mark is achieved, the experts say, most patients will at least know someone in an H.M.O., making this new type of health care more familiar and therefore easier to sell. In addition, most doctors will now feel they have to participate in order to survive.
"That 25 percent means a lot," said Dr. Peter Kongstvedt, a partner at the consulting firm of Ernst & Young in Washington. "It's a critical mass, and after that you can see very rapid change. It's like dropping a crystal into a supersaturated solution and the rest crystallizes very quickly."
What's more, the experts say, once H.M.O.'s control a quarter of any market, they begin to have a profound influence on how all patients, hospitals and doctors do business, leading to the the possibility of cheaper health care and lower insurance fees in the next few years.
"Above a certain threshold, the H.M.O. philosophy begins to permeate the marketplace," said Dr. Alan L. Hillman, the director of the Center for Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania. "With 5 or 15 percent H.M.O. penetration, the market is not likely to pay a lot of heed. But when you have 25 or 30 percent, they command enough patients that doctors and hospitals have to play ball."
Once H.M.O.'s become powerful in an area, he said, they tend to force even reluctant members of the local medical establishment to change their ways. Under common insurance policies, hospitals are paid for each outpatient procedure they perform and each patient they admit, and so have little financial incentive to scrutinize the need for medical services to control costs. Until very recently, they have focused on expensive, technologically advanced specialty services, like cardiology or neonatal intensive care.
But H.M.O.'s offer patients full medical care for a set yearly fee, most often, in New York, by contracting with existing doctors and hospitals. And when they are looking to buy health care for their members, they demand comprehensive low-cost care, with an emphasis on primary care and prevention.
Already, hospitals in the New York City area are scrambling to upgrade their primary care capacity and shrinking their inpatient and specialty departments, to appeal to the area's newly powerful H.M.O.'s. And doctors, who once regarded a contract with an H.M.O. as a pact with the devil, are now organizing into physician networks to give them more leverage when negotiating with these groups.
"This is the wave of the future and there is no way we're going to stop it," said Dr. Stanley A. Steckler, a urologist who heads one such network of doctors formed by the Medical Society of the State of New York, a physicians' association. "But we do have problems with managed care programs as they now exist."
He said that while some patients liked the fact that all medical care was free after joining an H.M.O., many disliked the restrictions and limited access to specialists. Patients in H.M.O's generally pay little or nothing when they visit doctors within the network and have free access to preventive health care. But their use of medical care is meted out through a primary care physician and the patients cannot consult specialists without a referral.
From March 1993 to January 1995, the percentage of New York State residents who joined H.M.O.'s rose to 25 percent from 19 percent.
These figures include patients enrolled in all types of H.M.O.'s: from "staff-model" H.M.O.'s, which own clinics and employ their own physicians, to "network model" plans, which contract with existing doctors and hospitals to provide care. The new data include patients who belong to traditional H.M.O.'s, where members are entirely restricted to the plan's physicians, as well as people enrolled in the newer "point-of-service" H.M.O.'s, which encourage members to stay in their networks, but allow patients to leave the plan for some services if they are willing to pay part of the cost.
"We have seen strong growth in H.M.O. enrollment and we expect that to continue," said Leslie Moran, director of communication for the New York State H.M.O. Council, an industry group, which released the figures. She added that the New York City region had seen particularly impressive growth, with the enrollment rate rising from below 15 percent to above 20 percent in the last 20 months.
Some areas in upstate New York have had strong H.M.O. enrollment for a number of years. But New York still lags behind states like California and Minnesota, where H.M.O. enrollment tops 30 percent overall, and is above 40 percent in some major cities.
Douglas Sherlock, president of the Sherlock Company, an H.M.O. investment firm in Philadelphia, predicted that the rise in H.M.O. enrollment rates would mean a drop in insurance premiums in New York State over the next two years and a decline in the rate of medical inflation in the area. He said that these changes had occurred in other parts of the country, like Los Angeles and San Francisco, when H.M.O. enrollment topped 30 percent.
In its annual tabulations of H.M.O. membership in New York State, the H.M.O Council found particularly rapid growth among employees of small businesses, as well as the number of New Yorkers who belonged to point-of-service H.M.O.'s.
Such plans are popular with people who are new to managed health care and unlikely to join H.M.O.'s that restrict the choice of doctors and hospitals. The industry views such plans as bait to lure in reluctant customers to the world of managed care; once they become members, patients tend to stay with the H.M.O. and switch to its more restrictive but cheaper version within a few years, health economists say.
The largest H.M.O.'s in New York are the Health Insurance Plan of New York with 913,682 members, Blue Choice with 502,507 members, U.S. Healthcare with 479,351 members, and Oxford Health Plans with 353,100.
A few New York H.M.O.'s have recently experienced rapid growth, such as Oxford Health Plans, Aetna Health Plans of New York and U.S. Healthcare. Oxford, whose plans are known for offering patients a larger degree of choice than most H.M.O.'s, increased its membership to 353,100 from 170,000 between January 1994 and January 1995, a rate of over 500 people a day. "You blink and Oxford grows," Ms. Moran said.

Mexico's Recovery Plan Shows Signs It Is Working

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 24

 BODY:
Two weeks after it was introduced, Mexico's tough new recovery plan is showing the first signs that it may be working: The foundering peso has started to stabilize while the economy is being squeezed even more tightly.
The peso rebounded strongly today for the second consecutive day, ending at 6.815 pesos to the dollar from 6.9 pesos on Thursday. The gains in the peso are seen as a positive response to several moves taken by the Mexican central bank to control the currency's recent volatility. 
 The Mexican stock exchange, which has drifted aimlessly recently, surged today, with its main index rising 106.86 points, or more than 6.5 percent, as investors showed growing confidence in the new plan.
While analysts in New York and Mexico were cautious not to attribute too much to a one-day rally, they were clearly encouraged. "We're looking at the bottom of the market now," said Chip Brown, an economist with Morgan Stanley & Company in New York. "I don't see it getting much worse than it was a couple of weeks ago."
Stabilization, however, is so far coming at a high cost for Mexico. Although the official data will lag by several weeks, there are daily indications that soaring interest rates, a shrinkage of credit, higher prices for gasoline and other products produced by the Government and federal budget cuts are causing even more pain than what President Ernesto Zedillo had told Mexico to expect when he announced the recovery plan on March 9.
Indeed, there are increasing signs that the economy was even weaker than the Government had described when outlining the austerity measures.
Official unemployment figures now show that around 400,000 Mexicans lost their jobs in January, much more than the 250,000 jobs that the Government said just two weeks ago were lost for both January and February.
Recent figures show that domestic car sales fell more than 70 percent in February, while retail sales over all dropped 2.7 percent in January. Despite the slowdown, inflation has stubbornly refused to come under control. The latest figures for the first half of March show an inflation rate of 3.1 percent, the sharpest increase since the Government started keeping track of figures on a twice-monthly basis in 1988.
A 50 percent increase in Mexico's value-added tax, which applies to the manufacture and sale of most goods and services, is scheduled to go into effect April 1, and is likely to keep the pace of inflation high.
And while interest rates for the important 28-day Government treasury certificate dropped slightly in Wednesday's auction, they remain above 80 percent, assuring continued problems for consumers and businesses. Interest rates for credit cards, commercial loans and mortgages are directly tied to movements in the certificates.
Despite the rally in the market and the peso today, there have been indications this week that foreign investors were still skittish about Mexico.
The United States banks that announced in January that they would syndicate a $3 billion loan for Mexico quietly scuttled the transaction this week. One of those banks, J. P. Morgan & Company, is now seeking to raise $1 billion in financing to help bolster Mexico's banking system,
On Wednesday, the Standard & Poor's Corporation lowered its credit rating on the Government's long-term peso debt to BBB+ from A and darkened the outlook on Mexico's foreign currency debt to negative from stable.
But there were some slighlty encouraging signs this week. And in an economy as battered as Mexico's, any bit of positive news can be cause for celebration.
For the first time, the Bank of Mexico paid off holders of maturing Government bonds called tesobonos in dollars instead of pesos. Some $29 billion in such bonds at the beginning of the year spooked investors, and as the bonds matured every week, holders rushed to convert their pesos into dollars. This flooded the market with pesos and created a huge demand for dollars that sent the peso exchange rate into wild gyrations.
The Mexican Government released trade figures showing Mexico had exported $452 million worth of goods more than it imported in February, providing a measure of hope that Mexico will be able to slash its huge current account deficit, which contributed to the crisis that erupted last December.
Also this week, the Bank of Mexico started to issue what will be regular reports to help investors anticipate the peso exchange rate. The first balance sheet showed that Mexico's international currency reserves declined 12.5 percent from the end of February, while the nation's money supply -- the amount of coins and bills in circulation -- had shrunk more than 12 percent since the beginning of the year.
"There's a little bit more confidence in Mexico," said Francisco Blanco, director of analysis at the Arka brokerage firm here. "Things are getting better, but there's still a long way to go."

HEADLINE: Stay Tuned for 24-Hour Fairfield News

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

 BODY:
Cablevision, the Long Island-based cable television company, plans to bring round-the-clock local news to Fairfield County, Conn., this spring and is planning similar programming for Westchester County, northern New Jersey, the Bronx and Brooklyn.
 "I think it will be great," said Joseph P. Ganim, the Mayor of Bridgeport, whose city would share in the expanded coverage. "It will open up all kinds of new avenues for everyone in Fairfield." 
 The service will be modeled after News 12 Long Island, which the company says has become the fourth most-watched channel among Cablevision's 700,000 subscribers in Nassau and Suffolk County since it began operating in 1986 as the first 24-hour-a-day local cable news service in the country.
 Cablevision now broadcasts a local half-hour daily news program on Channel 12 in Fairfield, from offices in Norwalk. Its 25-member staff there will be more than doubled when the 24-hour service begins in June, said Norman Fein, vice president of news development.
 The format will be similar to that of News 12 Long Island, which focuses on Long Island news, weather, traffic, and feature stories, and then adds some national and foreign news from other news organizations.
 The Long Island news staff, which underwent cutbacks because of the recession in 1991, is now back to full strength at around 100, Mr. Fein said.
 "Although our emphasis is local, we are basically a part of the overall New York television market, which has 16.5 million people and is the largest in the country," Mr. Fein said.
 "It's so large, that each area -- Long Island, Fairfield, Westchester and northern New Jersey -- is a major television market on its own, and each is a vacuum we are trying to fill," he said.
 When News 12 Long Island provided live coverage of the trial of Colin Ferguson, who was convicted of killing 6 people and wounding 19 others on the Long Island Rail Road, it had its second highest ratings ever and drew more local viewers than the live coverage of the O. J. Simpson trial by CNN or Court TV.
 "We drew our highest Nielsen ratings -- between 16 and 23 -- when big storms hit the Island," Mr. Fein said. "The Ferguson trial drew ratings of 10 to 12, compared with 4 and 5 for soap operas on the three major networks."
 News 12 Long Island has cost Cablevision more than $20 million over the last nine years, but it is now starting to break even, Mr. Fein said. By developing similar 24-hour news services throughout the metropolitan area, Cablevision hopes to turn a profit by attracting more national advertisers.
 "Our goal is to complete the News 12 metro-ring, to make 24-hour News 12 services available to all our customers in the New York metropolitan area," said Charles F. Dolan, chairman and founder of the Cablevision Systems Corporation, which is headquartered in Woodbury, L.I..
 Industry experts said that 24-hour local cable news is a relatively new market for advertisers, but has made inroads in Orange County, Calif, and the suburbs of Chicago, as well as the New York area.
 "It's a tough market to crack, but if you can prove to national advertisers that you've got a track record, you can probably convince them to come aboard," said William Marchetti, an analyst with Paul Kagan Associates of Carmel, Calif., a television industry consulting firm.
 "There is a critical mass of potential customers that advertisers can reach in heavily populated communities ringing big cities," he said. "If you've got affluent households where there's a programming void and hunger for local news, then you have a market.."
 Next on line after Fairfield, where Cablevision has 190,000 customers, will be Westchester, where Cablevision has 60,000 subscribers and its Channel 12 has a half-hour nightly news program produced in Yonkers.
 In northern New Jersey, where Cablevision has 275,000 subscribers, there is a half-hour daily news program on Channel 12 in Monmouth and Ocean Counties. A 24-hour format would expand coverage to include Bergen, Essex and Hudson Counties.
 Cablevision Systems is the nation's fifth largest operator of local cable television systems. It serves 2.6 million subscribers in 19 states, about 1.5 million of them in the New York metropolitan area.

HEADLINE: OUR TOWNS;
A Conference on Gangs Where Gangs Have a Say

BYLINE: By Evelyn Nieves 

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
WHEN Mildred marched to the podium to plead her case, two middle-age women in the packed University of Connecticut auditorium gasped in sympathy. "She's so pretty," one whispered. "And young," the other said. "So young."
 Mildred, 22, looked like a chic high school student, with her gray pants and vest, and white blouse, and brown hair hanging down like a model's. In another life, she could have been homecoming queen or -- who knows? -- valedictorian. And she could still be what she says she wants to be, a social worker, though being a single mother of two makes studies harder. 
 In fact, she was on stage looking for help, for herself and the other women in her Hartford street gang.
 "Violence?" Mildred said. "That's the last thought in our minds. The best thing that I very much would like is help for our sisters. We would like very much to be as professional as most of you are today."
 She was part of a first in Hartford -- a conference on gangs where gang members had their say. The conference, organized by the university's Institute for Violence Reduction, included police officers, social workers, sociologists, clergy and students, as well as 15 members of two gangs, Los Solidos and 20 Love, and a couple of members of The Latin Kings.
 "One goal is dialogue," said I. Michael Borrero, the institute's director. "What conference have you been to where there has been the police chief and gang members in one room?"

ACTUALLY, the Hartford Police Chief, Joseph F. Croughwell Jr., who has stated that he does not negotiate with gangs, left after reminding the audience that gang warfare killed a 7-year-old girl last year. But police chiefs from nearby towns stayed all day. So did the gang members, who showed gumption by showing up. They could have been lectured and screamed and yelled at if the conference included more residents of neighborhoods where gangs have warred, or if any of the city's elected officials had accepted invitations to the forum.
 Spared a hostile public, gang members talked freely (though most did not give their full names). They discussed the love and support they receive from the gangs, or "families," and stressed their peacemaking efforts.
 In the last three months, they pointed out, the streets of Hartford have been quiet because they are determined not to start fighting.
 "That's our main goal," said Book, a professional barber and a member of 20 Love. Back in December, when some members of 20 Love and Los Solidos began shooting each other, he said, other members were negotiating a truce. "Every day, every hour on the hour, we were on the phone saying we got to stop that," he said.
 Members talked about being abused as children, ending up in prison, joining a gang for comfort. They described the economic peer pressures that lead members to deal drugs. They said the police harass them. Dr. Borrero's graduate students at the university's School of Social Work read gang members' accounts of police barging into their apartments, planting drugs, beating them up.
 Skeptics might say the gangs were whining, but the audience was sympathetic. People quickly corrected themselves when they used the word "gang" instead of "family." Many joined gang members in blaming the news organizations for reporting bad news and not telling the world what Kelly, a Solido, called "the positive side."
 "There's a lot of positive in the families," said Kelly, a 26-year-old with long corn rows, as she explained why she joined Los Solidos two years ago. "I was reaching out for someone to be there. And they helped me."
 "They paid for my mother's burial," she said, wiping away tears. "They paid for the whole thing."

SHE is irked, she said, when people believe being in a gang precludes a normal life. "My daughter's in the Girl Scouts," she said. "I go to Girl Scout meetings, like any other mother."
 But Kelly admitted she hides her membership in Los Solidos from her two children. "I have hid it for two years and I can hide it for two or three more years," she said. Did she mean, someone asked, that she didn't want her children to join a gang?
 "No, no, no, no," Kelly said, aware she was giving a mixed message. "It's a lot of hardship you go through," she added. "There's a lot of funerals you go through."
 In the end, Dr. Borrero said, the conference showed that there are gang members who want good jobs and education and opportunity. Until the conference, Dr. Borrero had been one of the few people in Hartford willing to deal with gang members. But members gathered five or six business cards apiece from organizations or individuals offering jobs, he said.
 On Thursday night, after the conference, younger members of the gangs who had heard about the excitement asked why they hadn't been invited. The institute is now looking at putting on a conference in June on youth violence. "At their request," Dr. Borrero said, "not at our request."

HEADLINE: Time Warner to Sell Part Or All of Its Stake in Atari

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24

 BODY:
Time Warner Inc., seeking to reduce its debt load, disclosed today that it planned to sell part or all of its 24.5 percent stake in the Atari Corporation.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the giant media and entertainment company said it expected to dispose of "some or all" of its 15.6 million common shares of Atari "from time to time in open market transactions or otherwise." 
 Time Warner recently said it would sell assets that were not part of its core businesses to improve its financial position and reduce its debt. In the S.E.C. filing, it included the Atari stake on the list of noncore assets.
At current prices, the stake is worth $42.9 million.
"This will make a little dent" in Time Warner's debt, said David Londoner, a media analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Company. Time Warner and its 63 percent owned subsidiary, Time Warner Entertainment, have $19.5 billion of debt.
The disclosure weighed on Atari's stock, which fell 37.5 cents, or 15.4 percent, to close at $2.75 on the American Stock Exchange.
But Time Warner's shares rose 25 cents, to $38.125, on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Atari stake is held by Time Warner and its Warner Communications Inc. subsidiary. The investors have already begun selling shares, according to the S.E.C. filing. Warner Communications sold 154,500 Atari shares between Feb. 17 and March 22 at $3.25 to $3.62 a share, the filing said.
"We're not going to sell at any price, but when it's economically beneficial to Time Warner," a Time Warner spokesman said.
Atari, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., manufactures video game systems.
The company was just taking off in the mid-1970's when the Warner Communications founder, Steve Ross, bought the company. From 1980 to 1982, Atari fueled profits at Warner Communications, almost dwarfing Warner's movie and cable business in size, and driving up Warner's stock price.
Emerging competitors in the game business gradually knocked Atari off its pedestal.
In 1984, Time Warner sold the bulk of the Atari Corporation to the Tramiel family. But it retained 80 percent of the video software games part of Atari, now called Atari Games.
Mr. Londoner said a likely candidate for a sale to raise money at Time Warner would be the cable systems that are not part of larger, and more profitable, clusters.
"They would have to sell them off piecemeal or swap them," Mr. Londoner said. "There is a significant amount of money there."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Recovers Against Mark And Climbs From Low vs. Yen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rallied against leading currencies yesterday, rising to a two-week high against the German mark as speculation grew that the Bundesbank might lower interest rates next week.
The dollar was also bolstered by gains in American stocks and bonds. And aggressive dollar purchases by the Japanese central bank helped the dollar rebound from record lows against the yen. 
 "It was a good day for the dollar," said Karl Halligan, a trader at the CIC Bank New York. "The mark was so high that it had to come down." The slightest possibility of a German rate cut was enough to send the mark lower, he said.
Though few traders said that they believed the Bundesbank would cut rates, many sold the surging mark to protect themselves against that possibility. A rate cut would lower the attraction of mark-denominated assets and could cause the mark to decline against the dollar.
The dollar rose to 1.4210 marks, its highest level since March 10, before settling at 1.4172 marks, up from 1.4037 marks on Thursday. The dollar rose to 88.95 yen from 88.15, which was a record low for New York trading.
Speculation that the Bundesbank might lower interest rates intensified this week after a report showed money-supply growth -- the central bank's preferred gauge of future inflation -- remained steady in February after four months of contraction.
The dollar rallied against the yen after the Bank of Japan mounted an aggressive effort to keep its currency from climbing higher against the dollar. Currency dealers estimated that the central bank bought $500 million to $1 billion with yen.
"It looks like the Bank of Japan really wants to hold the dollar up," said Richard Vullo, manager of currency sales at Bayerische Hypotheken und Wechsel Bank in New York.
The Bank of Japan may be stepping up its dollar purchases to keep the yen from rising 15 percent against the dollar compared with its rate on April 1, 1994, Mr. Vullo said.
Under Japanese accounting rules, if the yen rises 15 percent or more against another currency in a fiscal year, Japanese companies and institutional investors must declare losses on investments denominated in that currency.

Bonds Rally on Stronger Dollar and New Economic Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
A stronger dollar and further signs that economic growth is slowing combined yesterday to fuel a strong market rally and help drive the long bond's yield down to its lowest level in a week.
The price of the 30-year bond gained a full point, to 103 6/32 , for a yield of 7.36 percent, down from 7.44 percent on Thursday. Investors gained about $10 per $1,000 invested in bonds. Shorter-maturity bill rates also improved, rising about four basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. 
 The Commerce Department reported yesterday that durable goods fell in February for the first time since October; that eased investors' concern that inflation would accelerate and prompt the Fed to raise interest rates once again. Orders fell eight-tenths of 1 percent last month, after gaining a revised 1.4 percent in January.
For bond investors, the durable goods report was definitely a positive. It suggested that expectations of a "soft landing" were still very much alive, traders said. A soft landing would be a period of slower economic growth and moderate inflation without an increase in unemployment.
The resilient dollar also provided a comfort zone for the bond market. A stronger dollar enhances the return on United States Treasury securities for foreign investors when they sell the issues and convert their dollar proceeds into other currencies. It also reduces the risk of higher import prices, which would accelerate inflation.
Volume was initially low, but more traders jumped in as the session progressed. One reason was short-covering. Short-sellers borrow securities and then sell them, hoping to buy them back later at lower prices to repay the loan and pocket the difference. However, if prices begin to rise instead of fall, which was the case yesterday, short-covering ensues: the shorts buy back the securities either to protect profits or limit losses.
Kim Rupert, an economist with MMS International in San Francisco, a market research and analysis firm, said the market had a lot of bullish momentum behind it and was looking for an excuse to go even further. "And the durable goods report gave it just that today," she said.
However, she said that it was only the headline, or overall number, that was market-friendly, while the underlying data still indicated momentum for growth.
"The market continues to fool itself into believing what it wants to see," she said, "and so we'll probably stay on this bullish track."
Ms. Rupert added: "You can expect to see bonds remain in this range near term, but not necessarily lock with the dollar, but more likely to shadow it. I'm not looking for any Fed action to come out of next week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, but I still think a tightening is in order somewhere down the line, most likely at the May 23 meeting of the F.O.M.C."
Traders reported hearing rumors yesterday that the Fed was actively buying Treasuries, and the rumors helped lift bond prices. That is something the bank never announces, and traders noted that if the Fed was in the market to buy, it was most likely for a foreign central bank and not a signal of change in the Fed's monetary policy.
Supply will probably be of concern to traders next week as the Treasury auctions $69.5 billion in bills and notes, beginning on Monday with its regular weekly auction of three- and six-month bills, totaling $24 billion.
On Tuesday, the Government will auction $17.25 billion of new two-year notes and on Wednesday, $11 billion of five-year notes. On Thursday, it will auction $17.25 billion of a new one-year bill. In when-issued trading ahead of next week, dealers were offering the two-year issue at a price to yield 6.64 percent and the five-year issue at a price to yield 6.91 percent.

HEADLINE: Orders for Durable Goods Drop In Evidence of Slowing Economy

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24

 BODY:
Factory orders for durable goods fell in February for the first time in four months -- fresh evidence, analysts said, that the once robust manufacturing expansion was slowing.
The evidence of an economic soft landing eased fears that the Federal Reserve would push up interest rates again next week to brake inflationary growth and propelled the financial markets into record territory. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 50.84 points, to 4,138.67 -- its third new high this week. 
 "We're making a transition to more moderate growth," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist for Morgan Stanley & Company in New York. But he and other analysts emphasized that the industrial sector was not facing a collapse.
The Commerce Department reported today that orders for durable goods -- items like carpets and computers that are expected to last more than three years -- dropped eight-tenths of a percent in February, to a seasonally adjusted $163.2 billion. The drop was in line with analysts' expectations.
Still, it was the first decline since October, although growth had slowed in December and January from November's 3.4 percent surge. The report said orders in January rose 1.4 percent, which was larger than the initial six-tenths of a percent estimate.
Manufacturing has been a major component of the economic recovery, paced by orders for durable goods, which shot up 13.9 percent last year, the steepest in 16 years.
But the seven short-term interest-rate increases engineered by the Fed over the last 13 months appear to have softened demand recently and, as Mr. Roach said, "Manufacturing is driven by demand."
In addition to higher interest rates, Cynthia Latta, an economist for DRI McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass., said another reason durable orders were off was that consumers had assumed large debt burdens recently and were becoming less willing to take on more debt.
Orders for nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft fell 2 percent in February. These orders, a gauge of business plans to expand and modernize, have been a major contributor to economic growth during the recovery.
Orders for electronic and other electrical equipment posted the largest decline, falling 5 percent and erasing gains of seven-tenths of a percent in January and 4 percent in December. The decrease, largely in orders for communications equipment like telephones and facsimile machines, was the first since last July.
Primary metals were down 1.9 percent for the second straight drop.
Orders for industrial machinery and equipment such as computers rose 1.5 percent after jumping 9.4 percent a month earlier.
Military orders, an often volatile component, were up 3.4 percent after plunging 32.7 percent in January. They had risen 65.6 percent in December.

A Little Cyber Grouch

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
Does your blood run cold, friend, when you read about the glories of "cyberspace"? Do you have to repress a shriek of protest every time you hear or read or think about "the information highway"?
If so, it means you are an old stick-in-the-mud and are doomed to end up in the dustbin of history unless you surrender immediately and come along quietly into the age of electronics amok. 
 As a devout reactionary, I naturally despise what these zealous engineers propose to do to us, but cruel experience reminds me it is foolish to oppose them when they are in the heat of re-inventing the world.
My distaste for this latest creative onset begins with petty, unworthy, whining objections. Why, for instance, must they refer to what is being advertised as a magical, irresistible electronic playground as "cyberspace"?
People capable of afflicting anybody, anything or anyplace with a name like "cyberspace" surely cannot have the spiritual and esthetic delicacy essential to creation of a magical, irresistible playground, can they?
All right, call it a captious quibble, but if you were given a choice of places to spend a month, which name would you select -- Tuscany or Cyberspace?
As for "the information highway," sometimes called "the information superhighway," the underlying assumption strikes me as fatally defective. The modern world is not dying for want of more information. Quite the opposite; its plight is too much information. It is being battered senseless, then buried under avalanches of information.
Day and night it is assaulted by a ceaseless flow of information. Often so much information arrives so swiftly that no one can digest it, make sense of it or judge whether it's information worth having.
The national love of gadgetry is involved here. The prospect of hundreds and hundreds of TV channels emptying into our minds, of movies pumping into our eyeballs through the telephone while incoming messages are depleting our fax-paper supply and our computer is talking to the bank and paying the gas bill --
It is a horror reminiscent of the Mickey Mouse sequence in "Fantasia," in which the magically activated water buckets cannot be restrained in their determination to drown the world. Our love of gadgets, however, makes us see it as a delight.
Already people who once walked abroad on the great green earth and breathed the outdoor air now sit glued through the night to their electronic machines, chatting it up with similarly afflicted cyberspaceniks around the world.
All this is being promoted, most notably by Vice President Gore, as a blessing for humanity. And who is to argue with a Vice President?
Still, considering only that part of humanity that is American, it is hard to see how it is going to bless the substantial part of the population that (a) can't afford the machinery and (b) lacks the know-how to make it work.
Many high schools regularly graduate their young so innocent of computer knowledge that they have never worked a keyboard. This considerable part of the population is already going to have trouble avoiding the dustbin of history. The advent of Cyberspace Triumphant is likely to cripple it more thoroughly.
Holding itself together as a nation is already becoming difficult for the United States. The trend everywhere is toward slicing the country into slivers.
Congress, suddenly uneasy with the Union, tries to give power back to single states. Ethnic groups once content to parade one day a year now insist on year-round awareness of their tribal identities. A country that once insisted everybody be "American without a hyphen" is now restoring its hyphens.
The famous Kerner Report's prediction that increasingly divisive racial and economic-group differences would turn the United States into "two nations" looks more accurate with each passing year.
Mr. Gore apparently sees a happier future in which the good old one nation indivisible will go through life with a laptop on every knee. Let us hope so. The mood of the prevailing half of the country as expressed in the election just past and by the present Congress does not, however, seem to bode well for cyberspace for all.

HEADLINE: Filipino Migrant Workers Find a Harsh World

 BODY:
To the Editor:
On March 17 Flor Contemplacion, a Filipino maid from Laguna, was hanged in Singapore on murder charges despite evidence from witnesses who claim she was innocent (news articles, March 17 and 18). Her execution has become the rallying point of nationalistic rhetoric on the violent treatment of Filipino women migrant workers in Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, Hong Kong, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Britain -- in short, all over the world. 
 Most of the people who have written in the Manila newspapers appropriating Flor Contemplacion's execution are the elite. Most of these same Filipino elite treat their own women servants like animals and actually call them "hayup" (the Tagalog word for "animal").
I know too well the plight of Filipino women migrant workers abroad. I was born in Laguna, but grew up in Pangasinan, one of the poorest provinces in the Philippines with one of the highest rates of workers going abroad. I have an army of aunts, uncles and former neighbors who work as domestic servants in Abu Dhabi, the Netherlands, Britain and Japan, who send me letters about their humiliating experiences, of not being treated as human beings.
Like Flor, most of these aunts do not see their children and families for years, some as long as 10 years. Many have stories about being raped by their bosses, about escaping horrible working conditions by jumping from the third floor of a tall building, about organizing a trade union in Saudi Arabia and being arrested, imprisoned and sent home without pay.
I would be as expendable, a poor woman from some obscure village in a marginal former colony, if I had not been privileged to receive scholarships to study for a Ph.D.
It is easy to rouse anger about foreign injustice when it is done in a police state like Singapore. Almost anyone could be outraged. But it is much more difficult to talk about what is being erased -- the question of class. This is part of a pattern woven into a fabric of exploitative labor and daily humiliation.
The ruling elite all over Southeast Asia, regardless of nationality or race, collaborate and use the same tactics to make poor people shut up. This is really what the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Asia Pacific Economic Conference "solidarity" is all about. They turn dead women workers into martyrs and national heroines, then everyone will shut up. Then they can say that these women did not die in vain.
Meanwhile, women languish in prisons with no right to a fair trial and are executed for someone else's crimes.
The rhetoric of nationalism, which works best by obscuring class and gender, is inadequate to explain the complexities of the exploitation of female labor and the expansion of international capital in Southeast Asia. Poor women like Flor Contemplacion do not matter. Business goes on as usual.

UNCHAINED MEMORIES: True Stories of Traumatic
Memories, Lost and Found
By Lenore Terr. Basic Books, $13.
A child psychiatrist explains the process of remembering and how certain painful events, such as sexual abuse, may not be recalled until many years after their occurrence. At the same time, she acknowledges that some recollections may be false, consisting of fantasies brought on by suggestion. The result is "a balanced and valuable work," Walter Reich said here last year. 

MERRY MEN
By Carolyn Chute. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $15.
Egypt, Me., a scruffy rural town in which most of the people are related to one another -- and for all the wrong reasons -- is this author's fictional landscape. In her third novel, Lloyd Barrington, one of Egypt's own, decides to wage war on economic injustice by stealing from the town's few rich residents and giving the spoils to the poor. Last year our reviewer, Ann Hulbert, praised Ms. Chute's "eye for the surreal commonplace" and prose that "at its best continues to mix choppy concreteness with idiosyncratic elegance." Harvest/Harcourt Brace has also reissued both of Ms. Chute's earlier novels about Egypt. LETOURNEAU'S USED AUTO PARTS ($11) centers on two families connected through past marriages and present misery. One patriarch is big and kind, the other a vicious bully. It is "an energetic and unsentimental book," Clarence Major said here in 1988. THE BEANS OF EGYPT, MAINE: The Finished Version ($10), which has been revised by the author, reveals a degenerate and incestuous clan through the eyes of a neighbor, Earlene Pomerleau, who has the misfortune to take up with more than one of the irascible Bean men. In 1985 our reviewer, Bertha Harris, called it a "startling and original first novel," in which Ms. Chute shows "a gift for humor and image making."
THE AGENDA: Inside the Clinton White House
By Bob Woodward. Pocket Books, $6.50.
This portrait of the Presidency shows a chief executive who avoids conflict at all costs and frequently insists on the compatibility of mutually exclusive concepts. It offers "a compulsive, Grisham-like read" rendered in a "pleasingly breathless style," Andrew Sullivan said here last year. The same publisher has also reissued the autobiography of the President's mother, LEADING WITH MY HEART: My Life, by Virginia Clinton Kelley with James Morgan ($6.50). Its subject comes across as warm and unpretentious, a woman whose Arkansas odyssey was often painful but never inspired self-pity. Last year our reviewer, Joyce Carol Oates, said, "To the end, she maintains her stoical good humor; she does indeed strike us as an 'American original.' "
THE BILLION-DOLLAR MOLECULE: One Company's Quest for the Perfect Drug
By Barry Werth. Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $14.
Pharmaceutical research is often a hit-or-miss process: existing substances are marshaled against disease to see if they work. This book explores the world of biotechnology, which seeks to create such medications from scratch. The focus is on Vertex Pharmaceuticals, a young company experimenting with possible cures for autoimmune rejection and AIDS. The work is "exciting and timely," Charles C. Mann said here last year.
THE MUSEUM OF LOVE
By Steve Weiner. Overlook, $11.95.
This novel is a hallucinatory journey across the United States and through the mind of its narrator, a 12-year-old French Canadian boy subject to both strange imaginings and homoerotic desires. Set in the 1950's, "the novel's high-speed pageant of lust and loss is as painful as shrapnel, yet extraordinarily seductive and sublime," our reviewer, Michael Upchurch, said last year.
CUT WITH THE KITCHEN KNIFE: The Weimar
Photomontages of Hannah Hoch
By Maud Lavin. Yale University, $22.50.
An avant-garde artist who was the only woman in Berlin's Dada circle, Hannah Hoch used images cut from the illustrated weeklies of the Weimar era to critique sex roles in German society. In 1993 our reviewer, Christoph M. Kimmich, praised the author's "careful analysis" and "useful insights."
LOOSE WOMAN
By Sandra Cisneros. Vintage Contemporaries, $10.
This collection of poems by the author of "The House on Mango Street" and "Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories" examines love, sexuality and the Mexican-American experience. Hers is "a unique feminist voice that is at once frank, saucy, realistic, audacious," one critic said last year.
A DRINKING LIFE: A Memoir
By Pete Hamill. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $11.95.
Son of an Irish immigrant who was a regular at Brooklyn's bars, the author discovered both literature and liquor as he grew up during the 1940's and 50's. This book recounts his journey toward a successful career and eventual sobriety. Last year our reviewer, Vincent Patrick, said it shows "the pacing and eye for telling detail learned as a novelist and the hard, spare prose of a fine journalist." Another writer reaches maturity in LEAVING HOME: A Memoir, by Art Buchwald (Fawcett Columbine, $12). This well-known humorist recounts a distinctly unfunny youth, which included stints in foster homes, orphanages and the Marines. His book is "at turns touching, at turns comic," Avery Corman said here last year.
BROTHER TERMITE
By Patricia Anthony. Ace Books, $5.50.
If the Government sometimes seems as if it's from another planet, this narrative gives a reason: insectlike aliens have taken over; one of them is White House chief of staff. In 1993 our reviewer, Newgate Callendar, called this novel "dark, moody, scary, imaginative, sensitively written." LAUREL GRAEBER

HEADLINE: METHOD & MADNESS;
Dead Sure

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS WADE 

 BODY:
IN A LABORATORY IN Zurich, a creature that lived some 50 million years ago and was the unlikely ancestor of both the hippo and the camel has been restored to life. Well, a kind of life anyway.
Religions aside, there are two principal recipes for resurrection. Both are lurching toward the brink of possibility, thanks to recent enhancements in the power tools of molecular biology. 
 One recipe, "Jurassic Park"-style, is to find some ancient DNA and grow the creatures specified by the long-extinct genes. The other is computational, and works backward from the present. Take the gene for a protein -- hemoglobin, say -- from a bunch of different species and determine the sequence of each one. Then have a computer figure out the ancestral DNA sequence from which this family of genes most probably descended. With this data in hand, change the DNA sequence of a present-day gene at certain key points, converting the extant to the extinct.
The study of ancient DNA is still in its troubled youth. DNA was once thought to degrade after death just like the rest of a body's constituents. And so it usually does. But scientists suspected that DNA might sometimes survive in special circumstances. In 1984, intact DNA was extracted from the brains of Native Americans buried 7,000 years ago in a peat bog near Cape Canaveral. Smidgens were found in the tissues of a frozen mammoth some 40,000 years old.
Insects trapped in ancient amber were another source of preserved DNA, but the specimens didn't easily yield enough material for analysis. There the chase paused until a technique called the polymerase chain reaction came along. It permits even a single strand of DNA to be copied and recopied to produce usable amounts. The potential sources of ancient DNA multiplied overnight. With varying degrees of credibility, extremely ancient DNA sequences have now been reported from a variety of specimens, including a 17-million-year-old magnolia leaf and a 120-million-year-old weevil.
The DNA amplification technique vastly enlarges a narrow window into the past, but it brings its own distortions too. It will multiply any DNA it meets, no matter the source: cells sloughed off from the skin of museum curators; the ancient bacteria that attacked the specimen when it died.
Even when such pitfalls are carefully sidestepped, the DNA sequences that emerge from these ancient organisms are frequently very short, and the chemical groups that constitute the genetic information are liable to be changed or lost altogether. The disciples of ancient DNA, many of them former students of the late Allan C. Wilson, a biochemist at the University of California at Berkeley, are now wondering how to make sense of the degraded fragments they have triumphantly recovered.
The other path to resurrection is marking time while a voluminous new data base is being constructed through initiatives like the Human Genome Project. Though focused on humans, biologists are also sequencing the genomes of many lower organisms, like the mouse, the fruitfly and sundry bacteria.
A lot of history is written in these dry chemical sequences. In principle, given enough DNA sequences and computing power, it should be possible to reconstruct the tree of life, from its living leaves down to the twigs and branches, to a point near its very origin some 3.5 billion years ago. But much groundwork remains to be done.
The method of reconstructing ancestral gene sequences is still under test. In charting the genealogy of a family of protein molecules, computer programs are designed to walk back the cat in the most economical number of steps. But though biologists assume that nature loves parsimony, this remains to be proved.
Last month in Nature, Steven A. Benner and colleagues at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich reported an ingenious test of these computer reconstructions. They looked at a digestive enzyme that is used by some ruminant animals to break down bacteria. The chemical sequence of this enzyme, called ribonuclease, is known for some 20 living members of the artiodactyls, a group that includes buffaloes, deer, camels and hippopotamuses.
A computer then generated a family tree with 10 major branching points showing how an ancestral ribonuclease gene might have accumulated one mutation after another, giving rise to all the variants seen in living artiodactyls. Benner's team verified the computer's inferences by synthesizing the 10 genes it had predicted and then having bacteria make the proteins they specify.
All 10 proteins behaved just as digestive enzymes should, suggesting their parent genes had been accurately reconstructed. The earliest ribonuclease gene belongs to the animal that lived just before hippos broke away from the rest of the artiodactyl line. To have recreated a working protein that last existed 50 million years ago is an unusual achievement.
How far will this line of practical inquiry be extended? Biologists are intensely interested in evolution, and you can almost hear one arguing that the best way to learn how a pteranodon flew is to make one. The power to resurrect extinct animals would also raise some odd questions. Would the timber industry argue that old-growth forests should all be clear-cut forthwith, since the spotted owl could be put in cold storage and regenerated when the forests had regrown? Why would sperm banks continue to sell the sperm of famous fathers -- a sort of genetic lottery ticket -- when they could offer an allegedly sure thing: a cloned chip off the old block?
Such fantasies lie years away. Reconstructing ancient DNA sequences is one thing, cloning them is quite another. A set of genes embodies a program that unfolds in the special environment of its own species' egg cell. Even supposing the entire gene sets of long extinct animals can one day be reconstructed, finding appropriate wombs in which to nurture the creatures the genes specify would be quite another matter.
Nor is it a present goal of science. Some scientists feel that recreating an extinct species, or a chimera formed from ancient and contemporary DNA, would be unethical. "Any steps toward the realization of such vision would be prevented" because of "unsolvable problems and conflicts with other organisms and ecological systems," write the editors of "Ancient DNA," Bernd Herrmann and Susanne Hummel of the University of Gottingen in Germany.
The stirring of the ancient artiodactyl ribonuclease is a foretaste of biology's demiurgic powers. It may well prove best to keep resurrection an unroutine event.

HEADLINE: Coming Soon: Swatch Watch, the Sequel

BYLINE: By RITA REIF 

 BODY:
SWATCH COLLECTORS, TAKE note: The frenzy is back. The boldly graphic watches that were hot collectibles in the late 80's are attracting crowds again. And now the draw is several new lines of watches: one by hip-hop artists, another by famous film directors and a third to mark next year's Olympics in Atlanta. There's even a new museum.
The Swiss watch maker SMH International introduced the Swatch quartz watch in 1983. The watches took off when the designs, taken from motifs in art, food and fashion, made them irresistible to the public and collectors alike. By the end of the decade, 80 million Swatches had been sold around the world. But with recession in the early 90's, they had slipped out of the spotlight. 
 The new momentum began building last September when Swatch, the official timekeeper of the 1996 Olympics, unveiled a collection of nine watches decorated with images of Olympics posters, past and present. A second group of nine, due in July, will bear images of torches and medals.
This month, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, Swatch issued a chronograph embellished with symbols of world peace and racial understanding. The watch's plastic band is emblazoned with images of locked arms of different colors and a ravaged world being sewn together; sections of the band are transparent so the color of the wearer's skin becomes part of the design. The watch was conceived by young artists who are members of Ya/Ya, a nonprofit arts organization in New Orleans.
Three other watches, designed by the film directors Robert Altman, Akira Kurosawa and Pedro Almodovar, commemorate the 100th anniversary of the motion picture. The sleekest of the three is Mr. Altman's shimmering watch with a mirrored face and tiny black hands that say "time to reflect." The red and green Kurosawa watch has a face within a face, and Mr. Almodovar's has a floral-patterned face and leather bands encrusted with seed-size beads in a rainbow of hues.
Swatch seems to be trying to create the ultimate in packaging for a limited edition of the directors' watches, 36,500 of which were produced. A set of all three watches comes in a tin reel can with an 8-millimeter film strip about each designer and a miniature projector to view the films. The price for the set: $280.
"It's a collector's dream," said Lynne Cheson, who publishes the newsletter of the Swatchfanatics Worldwide Club from her home in Tenafly, N.J. "We've never before had packaging like this. The most important thing is that the set is limited in number to only 5,555."
Actually, Swatch sells more sports watches than artist-designed "specials," which are produced in smaller editions. But it was the artist designs that became a corporate trademark 10 years ago when Swatch introduced a watch by Christian Chapiron, who works under the pseudonym Kiki Picasso, that became an instant collectible. It was made to sell for $75, but the 100 produced were given away to celebrities and members of the press.
By then, Swatch had put Switzerland back on the map as a manufacturer of low-cost watches. Its quartz watches are housed in a solid plastic case and use 51 parts instead of the standard 91. Swatch prices were competitive in price and still are: $40 for most Swatch watches, $80 for the artist specials.
These days Swatch watches are exhibited at the Pompidou Center in Paris and the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice. The most complete display is in Swatch's new museum, which opened this month in its largest store, near Harvard Square in Cambridge, Mass. That collection includes 900 of the 1,200 models that have been made to date.
"Alas, we don't have the Kiki Picasso watch, but we do have Mimmo Paladino's," said Raman Handa, the store owner. The Paladino watch has a black mask at the center of its face and hands shaped like a red arrow and a black sickle. Produced in 1989 to sell for $75, the watch made Swatch history when two brought record prices at auction: the first was sold in 1990 at Sotheby's in Milan for $20,512 and the second in 1991 at Christie's in Zurich for $25,432.

AMONG THE RARITIES ON VIEW in Cambridge are watches by Keith Haring, Jean-Michel Folon, Alessandro Mendini and Kenny Scharf. And there are numerous other favorites, including the gilded watch, inset with glass jewels, by Christian Lacroix that stopped traffic last December when it was introduced at a Swatch store at Fifth Avenue and 42d Street in Manhattan. Only 75 of the 22,222 produced were delivered to the store; so when 400 people turned up to buy, the crowd spilled onto the sidewalk.
"The police came because people were pushed out into the street," Mrs. Cheson said. "It was great." A lottery was held in the store to determine who could buy the watches. Mrs. Cheson missed out in that drawing but found a Lacroix elsewhere -- and had the designer autograph it.
"I paid $80 for the Lacroix, and it's now going for $350," she said. "Of course I won't sell. Every collector dreams of wearing a special Swatch."

HEADLINE: Go Ahead, Make Him Cry

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
CLINT EASTWOOD APPEARED. HE FILLED the whole doorway of his office bungalow. He wore a shiny maroon golf shirt, old blue pants hiked up high on his waist and black rubber loafers.
"Hi," he said. 
 He had a curious shamanlike power.
He was a leopardlike creature who rode in on the tail of a comet.
He was a graceful, hard, male animal who did nothing overtly to dominate yet dominated completely.
He was a prairie wind you could ride like some temple virgin toward the sweet, compliant fires marking the soft curve of oblivion.

 But enough wallowing, or Wallering, in the overripe prose of "The Bridges of Madison County." Clint Eastwood, who will be honored tomorrow night at the Oscars (on ABC at 9 P.M.) with the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award, is bringing Robert James Waller's huge best seller to the screen in June. He will trade in his spurs for the sandals of Robert Kincaid, the shamanlike, leopardlike, prairie-windlike photographer who falls for Francesca Johnson, an Italian-born Iowa farmer's wife.
Francesca, played with dark hair and -- no doubt -- another perfect accent by Meryl Streep, senses that her lover is a "half-man, half-something-else creature." He is, in Waller's portrait, a vegetarian who wears a bracelet, names his truck, tacks up favorite words ("blue," "wood smoke") on the wall, writes ditzy metaphysical essays and poetry ("Before I became a man, I was an arrow") and, in the heat of passion, murmurs lines like this: "I am the highway and a peregrine and all the sails that ever went to sea."
Isn't this the sort of guy Dirty Harry wouldn't have even bothered to shoot?
Mr. Eastwood frowned a bit and languidly moved his Modigliani legs around, trying to find a comfortable place for them under, on top of or beyond the glass coffee table in his office at Malpaso Productions on the Warner lot in Burbank. The 64-year-old star does not see Kincaid as so far removed from his usual cadre of emotionally spare rebels.
"He is a vegetarian, but he's smoking all the way through the thing," Mr. Eastwood said in that famous voice, a mixture of caress and threat. "He's lighting up Camels all the time, and they're drinking beer all the time. He was a guy who was maybe a little more New Age. He's sort of an aging hippie, you know.
"He's traveling on these jobs in mid-America, and he meets that one woman. And everybody likes to think that there are moments in time when two people can just jell in the best possible way."
With Sharon Stone doing Clint Eastwood in her turn as a sneering, taciturn gunslinger in "The Quick and the Dead," it was perhaps inevitable that Clint Eastwood would go as soft and fuzzy as Alan Alda.
"I know a score of actors who would avoid exposing their emotions the way he does in this movie," Ms. Streep said. "He was very raw. I was shocked. I think he's just reached a point in his life where he doesn't give a damn."
She has not yet seen "Bridges" (the movie will open on June 2) but added excitedly, "I heard Steven Spielberg cried for 40 minutes" after a screening. Mr. Spielberg's company Amblin produced the film with Mr. Eastwood's company, Malpaso.

IN A SIGN OF THESE MORE tender times, Mr. Eastwood now keeps a stroller in his office for toddlers who drop by, among them Francesca, his 18-month-old daughter with the actress Frances Fisher, with whom he lives in Los Angeles. He met Ms. Fisher when she was cast in his 1989 film "Pink Cadillac," and he gave her the part of an unforgiving prostitute in his Oscar-winning 1992 western, "Unforgiven."
"I'm all for day care," said the man who put the phrases "Go ahead, make my day" and "Do you feel lucky, punk?" into the national lexicon.
The actor who made a career out of blowing away bad guys says he enjoyed losing control in the tale of a man "desperately in love." His longtime press agent, Joe Hyams, said that it was weird to watch a rough cut of the film. "Clint has kissed ladies before -- he kissed that nice woman in 'In the Line of Fire' -- but this is a serious romance," Mr. Hyams said.
Mr. Eastwood said, "There are a lot more men that are romantics than I think people give them credit for."
Is he one?
"Yeah," he said. "I enjoy a fantasy thing like that."
Asked his idea of a romantic evening, he replied, "I like atmosphere, candlelight, a nice glass of wine, good music."
Is there a woman present?
He laughed. "Once in a while I call someone," he said, "and tell her 'You should have been here. I was never better than tonight.' "
Mr. Eastwood comes across as the sort of man many women might want want to run off to a covered bridge with, if they were anywhere near a covered bridge, which most people are not. What is most noticeable is his stillness. He laughs easily, which is startling, since he hardly ever laughs in his movies. He looks laid-back, but there is also something coiled about him, a watchfulness.
When he talked about Hollywood and politics this particular evening, he noted the importance of presence and mystery and great vocal quality. And certainly, in person, Clint Eastwood conveyed all those qualities, as he slouched on his couch, his face in the shadows thrown off by one dim lamp and his own famous image squinting down from posters for "A Fistful of Dollars" and "The Outlaw Josey Wales."
He has the cool economy of his characters, scorning the traditional excesses of Hollywood -- from illegal drugs to bloated budgets to warped egos. This is not the sort of man who would find himself in a profligate fiasco like "Waterworld." He brags that he has the same brown curtains and nondescript beige office furniture that the guy who had the bungalow before him left behind two decades ago. "We may have had it recovered once," he said, fondly patting the nubby cotton couch.
While other big-name actors seem to work hard at projecting a certain image, Mr. Eastwood seems casual about his stardom. He once compared his shock at getting famous to waking up with an "ugly hooker." Now he has a wry attitude about his status as an establishment favorite. "I didn't worry about that when I was on the far outside, and I sure as heck don't worry about it now," he said.

 HE RARELY WATCHES HIS movies, except to catch a few moments of ones he likes on television, to see how they are holding up. And, like Cary Grant, he says he will stop acting when he no longer likes seeing that guy up on the screen.
Mr. Eastwood's 31-year marriage to Maggie Johnson ended in 1984, following a long separation. His son, Kyle, 26, is a musician and appeared with his father in "Honky Tonk Man"; his daughter Alison, 22, who appeared with her father in "Tightrope," is a model in Paris. But Mr. Eastwood's second long relationship ended more acrimoniously.
He still faces legal fallout stemming from a nasty palimony suit filed against him in 1989 by his longtime co-star and girlfriend, Sondra Locke. It was a difficult period for Mr. Eastwood because it was the only time, as one of his pals told GQ magazine, that he wasn't "treated like Mother Teresa" by the press. Ms. Locke, still bitter, has now involved him in a second lawsuit, this one over business matters.
Professionally, however, the man once scorned by the Hollywood elite as too right-wing and lowbrow continues to pile up accolades. He has been hailed as intellectually chic in Europe -- despite appearing with an orangutan in "Every Which Way But Loose" in 1978 -- and as a feminist director. Two years ago, he won Oscars for best picture and best director for "Unforgiven."
The Thalberg award he will receive tomorrow night has been given in the past to producers like David O. Selznick, Walt Disney, Alfred Hitchcock, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. Perhaps, by reshaping Mr. Waller's New Age cowboy in his own lean image, Mr. Eastwood is hoping to capture the one honor that has eluded him -- an Oscar for acting. It has been a gradual transformation from the cigarillo-smoking, dirty-poncho-wearing Man With No Name and the flinty, squinty Dirty Harry to the romantic lead for the middle-aged version of "Love Story."
Mr. Eastwood had already made what the movie historian David Thomson called "welcome departures from male supremacy" -- the 1980 film "Bronco Billy" and the 1982 "Honkytonk Man." (In those films, Mr. Eastwood played a New Jersey shoe clerk and an aging alcoholic country singer, respectively.) The actor has always preferred spunky female leads, because they make better foils for his unreconstructed (but secretly sensitive) males.
"I loved the actresses from the 30's and 40's -- Barbara Stanwyck, Rosalind Russell, Bette Davis," he said. "They all had great voices, and they weren't afraid to be salty."
His Secret Service agent in the hit 1993 thriller "In the Line of Fire" was a big jump on the evolutionary scale, the kind of guy who played "As Time Goes By" on the piano, sniffled helplessly with the flu and offered to give up his career for the woman he loved. Now the actor has gone that final step, as the star and director of "Bridges," a purely sentimental movie.
Some are skeptical. Movieline magazine tweaked: "Sex objects (don't laugh) Meryl Streep, Clint Eastwood."
Some are thrilled. "My mother's 86 and she liked the book and she's very excited about me doing it," Mr. Eastwood said. "She thought Meryl was a great choice."
Mom may have considered Meryl Streep a great choice, but, Hollywood being Hollywood, those making the movie for Warner Brothers were reluctant to allow a 45-year-old actress to play a 45-year-old farmer's wife. (On the other hand, letting a 64-year-old actor play a 52-year-old photographer made perfect sense.)
The first director on the movie, Bruce Beresford, "was not a fan," Ms. Streep said. "I hear they were interested in all sorts of authentic European women."
Mr. Eastwood added: "I had a huge argument when we started this project. They were testing all these 30-year-old women. And it just shocked me. I said, "You know, the best actresses in this world are somewhere probably between 40 and 60. I said, 'What about Meryl Streep?' And they said, 'Well, she's not Italian, and she'd just be doing another accent.' And I said, 'Yeah, but she does them so marvelously.' "
The film makers thought they could get away with casting a younger foreign actress, Mr. Eastwood said, because, as they put it, "some European women are more mature looking at a younger age."
He said the pressure on women to stay young is unfair. "Men are taught the 40's are great, the 50's are great. And women are taught, 'I'm past 30. What do I do now?' They are taught, as soon as they get their first wrinkle, they should go out and have it removed. And really, the character a person has in his face, whatever life has been lived, can really be the most interesting part of them.
"Actresses, at 35, they're looking back at the 28-year-old behind them, and the 28-year-old's looking back at the 22-year-old, the flavor of the month . . . the chickadee-down-the-street. There's something about a woman who knows something that is more interesting."
Those sentiments could not have been rendered better by Robert Kincaid, who considered the "subtleties of the mind and spirit" as important as the way a woman fills out a pair of jeans.
It might have seemed that there would be a clash of mind and spirit between Mr. Eastwood's instinctive acting style and Ms. Streep's elaborate technique. She was groomed at Yale Drama School and in Shakespearean drama. After a stint as a lumberjack and some time in the Army, he was discovered hanging around the coffee wagon at CBS and learned his art playing Rowdy Yates in the television series "Rawhide" in the 1950's and early 60's.
"It doesn't matter whether you get a Ph.D. in engineering or come up through the ranks as an apprentice to engineers," he said. "It's all the same knowledge."
Ms. Streep objected to the notion, too, drawling, "I'm the instinctive one."
As a director, Mr. Eastwood often tries to get a scene down in one take, a trait that some people ascribe to his notorious thriftiness. He said that working swiftly "keeps the energy and the inner life going" and that actors should not use the first 10 takes as a warm-up period. Was his speed a problem for the meticulous Ms. Streep?
"She loved to kind of go for it," he said. "Sometimes we'd go for it without ever rehearsing it."
Ms. Streep said she "fought long and hard not to do this movie" because she found the book overwrought. But when Mr. Eastwood sent her a script, she loved it. "All that florid stuff from the book is gone," she said, slyly sending up Mr. Waller's prose: "He still moves over me like a panther." (Actually, it's like "some fine leopard might do in long grass out on the veld.")
"The only daunting thing" Mr. Eastwood said to her during the filming was -- here she imitates the Eastwood purr -- "I don't think you should do an accent."
"That threw me completely for a loop," she said, "because Francesca had lived in Italy for the first 20 years of her life." She had already prepared for the role by drawing on an Italian war bride who lived down the street from her when she grew up in Summit, N.J. When they shot the first scene, in which Robert Kincaid asks Francesca for directions, Ms. Streep simply came out on the porch and did her Italian accent.
"I ignored him like I do with most directors," she said, "and he laughed."
For the first two weeks he said nothing about her performance. Then he came up to her and said, "You know, if I don't say anything, that means it's good."
Asked how she would describe his voice, she said that its flat, husky character came from the fact that very little vocal range. "On the rare -- very rare -- occasions when he screamed on the set, he would blow out his voice for the rest of day," she said.
Mr. Eastwood's icon-hood was underscored earlier this month when the Society for Cinema Studies Conference at the College of Staten Island, part of the City University of New York, offered a panel on Clint Eastwood in the 1990's. One paper, presented by Peter Lehman of the University of Arizona, was titled, "In an Imperfect World, Men With Small Penises Are Unforgiven." (The treatise examines Mr. Eastwood's "attempt to foreground and integrate issues . . . narratively and thematically" about the male anatomy and the threat of inadequacy.)
Although Mr. Eastwood now seems more involved in movie making than ever, he still follows politics. He was Mayor of Carmel, Calif., from 1986 to 1988, and has been approached for higher office, but says he is not interested. He describes his philosophy as more libertarian than conservative: "The less you mess around with people, the better off people are." He believes that the last two Presidents have not been Presidential enough. "People want the President to be somebody who's rock solid, not arguing with every guy who yells at him over a fence."
He does, however, think the Republicans are on to something with their nostalgia for the old values. "Everything that's the fodder for comedians -- terrible, violent instances, like the current trial here" -- a reference to the O. J. Simpson trial, which he will not watch -- "and people telling Jeffrey Dahmer jokes. In the old days, people would have gone, 'Maybe that's in bad taste.' The country should be interested in better things."
These days he is spending time again being a father, and he has already noticed a genetic quirk. "My daughter doesn't even completely talk yet, but sometimes she'll look at me like this and go" -- here Mr. Eastwood gives his famous squint -- "or she'll make a lot of faces like kids do and you'll say, 'O.K., squint,' and she'll go" -- again he demonstrates his daughter's squint.
His idea of a good evening is still pretty basic: "I have two Budweisers in front of the fireplace. Squeeze the cans. Even though they're aluminum and it's easy to do nowadays, you know, you still feel kind of macho about it. You toss 'em in the wastebasket, you belch three times and go to bed."

At New York Hotels, Things Are Looking Grand

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
CDL International, a Hong Kong hospitality company, buys the Hotel Macklowe on West 44th Street for nearly $164,000 a room, second in per-room price nationally in 1994 only to the Phoenician, the Babylonesque Arizona resort hotel that sold last year for about $386,000 a room.
Thayer Capital Partners, an investment group, raises $120 million to invest in all-suite hotels, while LaSalle Partners forms a hotel group to help clients pick which properties to buy. 
 Hartz Mountain Industries, proving it really means it this time, invites Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to attend a groundbreaking ceremony on April 3 for the SoHo Grand, a 370-room hotel at West Broadway and Grand Street that it first talked about building in 1989.
"We've been in circle-the-wagons mentality since then, even tried to sell the property once," said Emanuel Stern, Hartz Mountain's executive vice president. "Now we are again ready to bet on the future of SoHo and the city."
For the first time in a long time, New York hoteliers have a lot to smile about -- and even more to talk about. The much-despised 5 percent state surcharge on hotel rooms has been gone since September, and 1 percentage point of the New York City tax disappeared in December. Average room rates were up 6.8 percent last year, to $144 a night, the first increase since 1989. PKF Consulting, which specializes in the hospitality industry, says that in December, average room rates hit $157.14, the highest average ever.
And people readily paid the hefty rates. A surge in both business and tourist travel combined to bring occupancy last year to 75.5 percent, the highest it has been since 1988. The persistently cheap dollar, which makes it inexpensive for foreigners to come here and very expensive for Americans to go overseas, is boosting room sales even higher.
"We are having our best quarter since 1990," said an exuberant Arthur A. Surin, senior vice president of the New York Hilton. Hotel consultants say the good news is echoed throughout the hotel community. "Last year was the best year this industry has seen since 1988, and this year will be even better," said Michael Fishbin, a senior manager of the Kenneth Leventhal accounting firm's hospitality services practice.
But while the business recovery may represent the hotel world's most heartening news, it is not the most intriguing. That designation goes to the sales activity bounding through the industry.
"Two years ago, 'hotel' was a nasty word in real estate circles," said Daniel H. Lesser, director of Cushman & Wakefield's national hospitality valuation group. "But investors see a real window of opportunity now."
Indeed, sellers report that buyers have grown much easier to find. Chemical Bank took control of the Millenium Hotel in 1993 and of the Macklowe in 1994, and marketed both hotels immediately.
"We got three bids for the Millenium, yet a year later 11 buyers wanted the Macklowe," recalled Ben McGrath, Chemical Bank's managing director of real estate investment banking, who says that differences in location and facilities were built into the prices. "There were bidders with money in 1994 who did not have money in 1993." (CDL International eventually bought both hotels.)
Apparently, investors now see the hospitality industry as a lucrative place to be. Last year, the Millenium, on Church Street, went for $75 million, or $133,700 a room, while the Macklowe commanded a total of $101 million. Metromedia, the investor John W. Kluge's company, grabbed the Barbizon Hotel on East 63d Street for $19 million, about $62,300 a room. Host Marriott Corporation, which had been running the Marriott East Side, at Lexington Avenue and 48th Street, bought it, with the investor Morris Bailey, for $55 million -- $82,800 a room.
Off-the-beaten-track hotels attracted buyers, too. Bernard Goldberg, a real estate lawyer, has bought and renovated several older New York hotels, including the Wales at 92d Street and Madison Avenue and the Shoreham on West 55th Street. He just took a long-term ground lease on the Roger Williams Hotel at 31st Street and Madison Avenue, and is ready to renovate that. "I believe you make your own location," said Mr. Goldberg, who often holds free classical music concerts at his hotels.
The buyers run the gamut, from hotel companies to investor groups to hotel-based real estate investment trusts. "As with any real estate investment, there's a herd mentality, with everyone coming into the market at the same time," said Joseph D. Long, a LaSalle vice president who says that the market for hotels has "heated up dramatically" over the last 18 months. "People no longer have to speculate about a turnaround -- hotels have turned the corner."
Nor is Hartz Mountain the only company with construction plans. Four development teams are vying to build a 1,000-room hotel at 43d Street and Eighth Avenue, and the city is expected to pick a winner this spring. Hotel analysts say that this may be the year that developers get financing to turn a 100-year-old building in SoHo into the Mercer Hotel, a tiny (73-room) but much discussed boutique hotel at Mercer and Prince Streets. And talk has started up again about possible new hotels near Battery Park City and the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.
Still, today's hotel boom bears little resemblance to the one of a decade ago. Back then, travelers would seemingly pay anything to stay in a glitzy setting. Corporations would include breakfast, lunch, dinner and free-flowing drinks as part of meetings. Investors and hoteliers flooded the country with new hotel rooms. When the recession hit in the late 1980's, the hotel market was suffering from a glut.
This time, the market is recovering at a time when the supply of hotel rooms has remained static. "If the economy turns down again, there will be a soft landing because there's been virtually no new room growth," said Frederic V. Malek, a former Marriott executive and now chairman of Thayer Capital Partners, which recently teamed up with Marriott International to buy part of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company.
But the conservatism of the 90's poses difficulties, too. Today's travelers, hoteliers say, are less free-spending. Meetings are shorter, and include fewer meals. And guests willing to spring for high-priced rooms expect telecommunications systems, fax machines and other services.
"People will pay $150 a night, but they will not settle for $20 worth of value for it," said Franz Zeller, general manager of the Vista International, at the World Trade Center.
That search for value has made hotel management a less hit-or-miss proposition. Increasingly, hotel owners are insisting on cancellation clauses in the management contracts they give hotel chains, stipulating that they can terminate the contract if they do not like the way the hotel is being run. They are demanding a greater say in how much is spent and what it is spent on.
"In the past there was a lot less oversight," noted Michael Littler, the Hotel Macklowe's general manager.
MANY investors, in fact, are teaming up with hotel chains: the investors supply the funds, the hotel companies the expertise. The Blackstone Group has aligned with Interstate Hotel Corporation to seek out new properties; it is particularly active in Texas. Thayer Capital has bought hotels with Marriott and Doubletree.
"It is savvy investors who are back in the market, and they recognize they need expertise to turn hotels into viable investments," said John A. Fox, a senior vice president of PKF Consulting, who says that he is averaging two or three calls a week from investors looking to buy New York hotels.
There is no dearth of properties available for would-be buyers. Prudential wants to sell its half of the New York Hilton hotel, at 54th Street and Sixth Avenue. Last week speculation was rife throughout the industry that CDL would buy The Plaza Hotel, at 59th Street and Fifth Avenue. Some industry experts say that Donald Trump, who still owns 51 percent of the hotel, wants to hold out for a very high price. But he may not have the choice. Under a settlement that kept Mr. Trump out of bankruptcy, a group of banks, led by Citibank, got 49 percent of the hotel and the right to sell it for a specified (but undisclosed) minimum price, as long as they give Mr. Trump rights of first refusal.
The Mayfair Regency on East 65th Street, the home of Le Cirque (which is said to be looking to move, a rumor its owner denies), is for sale. So are all of Doral's properties, including the Tuscany, the Doral Court and the Doral Park, all clustered around East 39th Street. And Mayor Giuliani is talking about putting the United Nations Plaza Hotel, which was built by the United Nations Development Corporation in 1976 as part of a larger project to help meet the U.N.'s growing demands, on the market for somewhere between $70 million and $90 million. The development corporation gave the entire project, which is on 44th Street and First Avenue and which includes office space, to the city so that the properties would not be taxed, thus keeping the U.N.'s rents low. The hotel, which Hyatt International has been running, has been perennially profitable, but the Mayor wants to sell it to raise cash to help close the city deficit.
And those are just the hotels everyone acknowledges are for sale. Industry insiders say that ITT Sheraton has been looking to sell the Sheraton Park Avenue hotel at 38th Street, which it owns with John Hancock, although some say the partnership, which could not get the price it wanted, is now taking the hotel off the market. Hotel experts also say that Hilton Hotel Corporation is looking to spin off all of its non-gaming facilities, and thus would happily sell its share of the New York Hilton, too. (Spokespersons for both Hilton and Sheraton would only acknowledge that they were evaluating their strategies.)
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which has openly discussed privatizing airports, the World Trade Center and other properties it owns, is said to be considering selling the Vista. (Also in keep-mum mode, spokespersons for both the Port Authority and for Hilton International, which manages the Vista, would neither confirm nor deny the talk.)
The for-sale hotels are not necessarily unprofitable. Many are simply laboring under debt burdens that, once the booming 80's ended, no property could sustain.
"We were operationally successful from the first," said Mr. Littler of the Macklowe. "The problem was always debt service." (Chemical Bank confirms that, in 1994, the property's debt service was higher than its cash flow, of just under $7 million.)
AND many older hotels went through expensive refurbishing programs in the last few years, some in anticipation of the Democratic Convention of 1992, others because their aging facilities could no longer entice customers. "There's no question our business is up, but we figure only about 40 percent of that is due to the general market," said Mr. Zeller of the Vista, which renovated extensively after the World Trade Center bombing caused it to close two years ago. "At least 60 percent is due to our renovation."
The hotels also have learned to target specialized customer bases. The large, centrally located hotels like the Hilton -- and even smaller ones like the Macklowe, which has an adjoining theater and convention center -- continue to rely on conventions and meetings for much of their business. But many newer hotels are marketing themselves to other groups.
The SoHo Grand, for example, is going after Wall Street trainees, as well as art aficionados attracted to SoHo. The Vista, which lost much of its corporate business while it was out of commission, has chased tour groups. Mr. Goldberg, who is also renovating the Mansfield Hotel, on West 44th Street, is targeting Europeans and overflow guests from the myriad university and other private clubs on the block, and even from the Royalton and Algonquin.
Marketing, in fact, is becoming a more economical proposition for many New York hotels as more of them get snapped up by worldwide chains. CDL, Doubletree, Marriott, Hilton, all are seeking ways to get more mileage out of their international reservations systems and their marketing dollars.
Even mini-chains may get marketing synergies. Metromedia, the Barbizon's new owner, also owns the Empire Hotel. Both hotels appeal to travelers who consider being on the northern fringes of midtown a viable sacrifice for a lower room rate, and who have things other than business on their agendas. The Empire, after all, is right across from Lincoln Center, while the Barbizon is convenient to Bloomingdale's and the luxury shops, museums and galleries on upper Madison and Fifth Avenues.
"You stand on 57th and Fifth, you see all these hotels charging more than $200 a night, and then there's the Barbizon," said Thomas Arasi, executive vice president of Tishman Realty, which represented Metromedia in the purchase. "Metromedia has mid-priced hotels at great locations."
Moreover, the smaller hotels are hoping that the larger ones will mount marketing blitzes that will woo more business to New York in general. The Macklowe's Mr. Littler, for one, relishes the idea of the anticipated behemoth on Eighth Avenue, between 42d and 43d Streets.
"This whole area is already a hub of family entertainment, and a new hotel will market the area even more,"he said.
Of course, lots of factors could mitigate all the good cheer. Last year's stellar numbers cannot be attributed solely to a healthy industry; the World Cup soccer matches and the Gay Games brought business to town that will not be repeated this year.
And hotel labor costs may soon rise. Hoteliers say that wages and work rules in the current contract with the Hotel Trades Council, the primary hotel workers union, have made New York's operating costs 50 percent higher than in comparable cities. That contract expires this summer, and the hotels are gearing for a strike.
"The union has made ridiculous demands, the hotels are taking a tough stance and a big fight seems inevitable," said one hotel consultant who insisted on anonymity.
MOREOVER, room supply is creeping up. After pumping $65 million into the aging building, Wharf Holdings, which bought the Omni Berkshire Place Hotel at Madison Avenue and 52d Street for $84 million in 1988, is putting the hotel's 396 rooms back on the market this fall. The Kitano Hotel, at Park and 38th Street, has been renovated and expanded, and will reopen this year. Mr. Goldberg should finish renovating the Mansfield by June. The New Yorker Hotel at 34th Street and Eighth Avenue, once used to house followers of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, has opened 240 rooms to the public.
Even more rooms should turn up in the next couple of years. The SoHo Grand is slated to open in the summer of 1996. The Trump Organization has incorporated 150 hotel rooms into its plans for the former Gulf & Western Building at Columbus Circle. City officials, meanwhile, still talk of a hotel and meeting center where the Coliseum now stands. And of course, there is the prospect of the new Times Square hotel.
Prospective developers insist that their projects will create business, not siphon it from other hotels. "This hotel will capture latent demand from the Javits Center and from Times Square, but its impact on existing properties will be minimum," said Mr. Arasi of Tishman, which has bid for the job of building the Times Square hotel.
Not everyone is so sure. Indeed, there are still many investors who, beset with sour memories of the 80's, are refusing to drink at the hotel trough this time around.
Chemical Bank, for one, has no further hotels in its portfolio. Nor does it intend to add any. As Mr. McGrath put it, "There are easier ways to make a buck."

HEADLINE: Ladies' Mile Restoration

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It has been a pleasure to witness the restoration and revitalization of Ladies' Mile ("Restoration for the Final Stretch of the Ladies' Mile," Feb. 12). These magnificent buildings, protected by the Landmarks Preservation Commission, now draw thousands of shoppers to the neighborhood and have growing economic viability. However, Gil Yesnowitz, representative for the owner of The Ehrich Brothers Stores, complains of increased "difficulty" and "expenses" due to landmark designation. Did he ever think that if it wasn't for the Landmarks Preservation Commission, Ladies' Mile might not have achieved such a dramatic transformation that has allowed building owners to command higher rents for their landmarked properties?

Sales Rising at Big Downtown White Plains Condos

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
AFTER years of stalled sales, sponsor defaults and other financial difficulties, Westage Towers and Stewart Place, two large high-rise condominium buildings in this city's downtown area, have been attracting renewed sales interest, especially in the last few months, according to brokers.
A third building, the Seasons, the largest of the three major downtown condominiums with 316 apartments, has temporarily taken its available units off the market in the hope that their values will appreciate. Westage Towers has 254 units and Stewart Place has 182. 
 "Since February, all of my people say that things have picked up for the high-rise condos," said Rita Cohen, president of The Prudential Rita Cohen Realty, in White Plains. "The weather helped, and so did the concern over rising interest rates."
Some of the uptick in interest can also be attributed, Ms. Cohen said, to the impact from construction projects in the city: the new Federal courthouse scheduled to open in the spring, and, to some extent, The Westchester, a 2.5 million-square-foot megamall that opened on March 17.
"With the courthouse, we've gotten a lot of lawyers," she said, adding that the impact from the Westchester had not been as strong. "Some of the people who were transferred to work at the mall are helping the upper rental market now," she said. "If they are transferred in permanently, then we'll probably see them buying."
Westage Towers, at 25 Rockledge Avenue, is closing on its final three units this month, said Mitchell Rutter, president of Essex Capital Partners, a Manhattan-based real estate investment company. Fourteen months ago, Mr. Rutter's firm, which specializes in buying undervalued properties, acquired the Westage Tower's 36 remaining unsold units.
"This has been a very fine transaction for us," he said. "Our first buyer was a New York Knick, and the second was a New York Ranger. I think people like that prefer our building, because we're not on a city street, but in a gated enclave community." He declined to disclose the athletes' names.
Both the Seasons, which is across from the White Plains Metro-North station, and Stewart Place, near the College of White Plains, are directly on city streets.
In January 1994, Haseko Corporation, a real estate company based in Tokyo, purchased 91 unsold units at Stewart Place. "We didn't start marketing the units until April 1994," said Edward G. Bissen, sales manager. "In less than a year, we've sold 40 units, 12 since the first of the year."
Mr. Bissen said the building has been attracting a wide range of buyers, including "first-time home buyers, who can be young married couples or singles."
"We're also getting people who have recently become single, some transferees and empty-nesters," he said.
When 25-year-old Louis Mauro decided to move out of his parents' home in Scarsdale he wanted an "ultramodern one-bedroom condominium, with new appliances and a clean look," he said. He was the second buyer at Stewart Place when it reopened sales last April, purchasing a one-bedroom with a terrace for $135,000.
"I was prepared to pay anything from $125,000 to $200,000 to get what I wanted," Mr. Mauro said. "But this had everything I was looking for, including low taxes and a central location. The taxes here are low compared to a place like Scarsdale." And the business he owns, A & C Autobody, is around the corner from his new apartment.
ALL three condominium buildings were constructed in the late 1980's, when one-bedroom apartments commanded prices as high as $210,000. Soon afterward, demand for such units dropped off. The Robert Martin Company, the sponsor of the Seasons, converted its unsold units to rental apartments in November 1991. At Stewart Place, only half the units were sold when the recession hit. The sponsor defaulted on the remaining units in October 1991.
What's spurring sales now at all the buildings is price, Ms. Cohen said. "They've gone back to 1986 prices, which is realistic," she said. "If people would only realize that 1988 and 1989 were aberrations. We're not going to see those prices again. Everything is price point today. If apartments are priced well, they will sell."
That strategy accounts for the sales success at Westage Towers, Mr. Rutter said. "The key for us was buying the remaining units at a discount," he said, "then offering them at below-market prices," which translates to one-bedrooms at $139,000, two-bedrooms at $240,000 and three-bedrooms at $315,000. "This way there's still a profit for us and a gain for our buyers," he said. "We were also able to offer buyers 90 percent financing."
Mr. Bissen said that at Stewart Place, one bedrooms are about $130,000, two-bedrooms $161,500 and two- and three-bedroom penthouses $300,000.
PRICE was the primary concern of Floria Watson and her husband, Philip, when they bought their one-bedroom apartment at Stewart Place. "We had looked at the other buildings, but thought they were overpriced for what you were getting," Ms. Watson said. The Watsons had been renting their apartment for four years before deciding to buy.
"We wanted to see how things were with the building and wait for the prices to come down," she said. "When they decided to sell again, the price for our apartment was $127,500, which we thought was really, really great. For that we got a one-bedroom with two baths, a terrace, a dressing area and a parking space in an indoor garage."
The current selling activity is quite a change from a year ago, when high-rise condominiums in downtown White Plains were just beginning to be remarketed after a period of few or no sales. Hoping to jump-start sales and determine market prices, the Robert Martin Company, a real estate developer and manager based in Elmsford, held an auction last summer of 50 units at the Seasons.
It generated the sale of 26 apartments, at an average sales price of $159.75 per square foot, or about $115,000 for a one-bedroom. "We had hoped to sell for $160 per square foot, so we were pretty pleased," said Robin B. Steiner, a vice president with Robert Martin's real estate division.
A few months later, a Hong Kong-based investment group, Glorious Sun, purchased the remaining 173 unsold units for a reported $18 million. Mr. Steiner said that the company planned to continue renting the units until their values appreciate.
"Seeing a white knight like that come in could have helped things along for the other buildings," he said. "It brought a new interest to this kind of housing."
Sales at the Westage Towers picked up before the announcement of that transaction, Mr. Rutter said. "Around the time of Robert Martin's auction, we saw an increase in sales. We benefited by all the publicity surrounding that. I thought people would wait until they saw what prices the auction would bring but they didn't."

HEADLINE: The View From: Taftville;
Life Returns to a 19th-Century Textile Mill

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER 

 BODY:
THE rhythmic hum of a twister, a machine used to ply yarn, fills the turn-of-the-century red brick building at the Ponemah Mill in Taftville. A pile of grayish-white Cotswold wool lies on the floor near a carding machine. Boxes overflowing with skeins of Ponemah woolen yarn are everywhere. The mill, which closed in 1972 after a century of textile manufacturing, is stirring with life again.
In 1990, the newly formed Quinnehticut Woolen Company moved into 10,000 square feet on the ground floor of Ponemah's Mill No. 3. Antiquated textile machines are again spinning Ponemah yarn for knitters and weavers. Squeezed into a corner of the ground floor is the factory store, where samples of sweaters, socks, and other items made from the yarn hang on the walls. The company also supplies yarn to several hundred small retail shops aroud the country, said Dale Plummer, a founder of the company. Its list of mail order customers is growing, he said, and business at the factory store is steady. 
 There are other signs of a revival in New England's textile industry, Mr. Plummer said, pointing to what he described as prosperous mills in Stafford Springs and Unionville.
"There has been a lot of investment in new machinery and equipment in the larger mills in New England," said Mr. Plummer, 45. "That's a good sign. I don't think you're going to see anything like the old Ponemah Mill, which employed thousands. There will be smaller operations that do specific kinds of things, like spinning or weaving."
Unlike the successful mill owners of the late 1800's and early 1900's, who lived in hilltop mansions overlooking their mills and rarely became involved in the daily operations of their businesses, Mr. Plummer works long hours on the factory floor. His customary work outfit these days consists of a plaid flannel shirt and black work boots.
Mr. Plummer was a self-employed consultant in historic preservation for 20 years before starting Quinnehticut Woolen Company. The idea to go into yarn manufacturing grew out of his discussions with Mary Wellemeyer, an economist from Manchester who is now a partner in Quinnehticut. "Eastern Connecticut has all this vacant mill space, old machinery, sheep and people with skills to make yarn," Mr. Plummer said. "I asked why we couldn't take that and make something worthwhile out of it."
When the recession took hold in the late 1980's, and landmark-preservation projects were cut back, Mr. Plummer thought about opening a mill, he said. The fact that he knew nothing about the business did not faze him. He plunged in, he said, even though "some of the old-timers in the textile industry told us not to do it, because we didn't have any experience."
Ms. Wellemeyer and Mr. Plummer saw opportunities to market their product to individual knitters, who complain about a shortage of good quality yarn, and to New England's textile weavers. "A lot of the small yarn stores are disappearing, and I have gotten letters from customers asking to buy it directly from me," Mr. Plummer said.
Ms. Wellemeyer, who said she enjoys starting businesses, is in charge of marketing Ponemah yarn. (The original mill owners took the name, meaning "our future hope," from Longfellow's "Song of Hiawatha.") In her previous job with Habitat for Humanity in southeastern Connecticut, Ms. Wellemeyer said, she realized that the shortage of jobs was a growing problem.
"I talked with Dale about reusing old equipment and buildings and undervalued fibers. There seemed to be a potential there," she said.
With an initial investment of less than $100,000, the partners bought and transported picking, carding, spinning and winding machines from defunct mills as far away as Quebec and Pennsylvania. Some machines came from Hale Manufacturing in Putnam, makers of synthetic yarn until 1989, Mr. Plummer said.
Mr. Plummer said he turned to mill owners and former textile workers when he needed help in assembling, installing and repairing the machines. "I learned as I went along," he said. "It's an unusual industry in many ways. It's a closely knit community of people who feel very supportive of one another. They see their fortunes as being linked. What harms one harms everybody."
Many different processes go into making a skein of Ponemah yarn. Mr. Plummer buys wool from sheep farms in northwestern Connecticut and other parts of New England. He sends the wool to Philadelphia for scouring, to clean it of lanolin and sweat, and then to Woonsocket, R.I., for dyeing. The wool is carded -- basically, untangled -- and spun in Taftville.
The Quinnehticut Woolen Company discovered another niche in the market when it started accepting jobs from mills that needed extra spinning time in order to fill their own orders. Shortly after the business opened, Mr. Plummer said, a woolen mill in Maine called looking for a mill that could spin 20,000 pounds of wool a week.
"That was a challenge," he said. "We had one carding machine and one spinning frame at the time. The most we could do was 2,000 pounds a week. But the man took our offer because he needed the help. We called in all the old-timers for advice and managed to do it."
The company also takes custom orders to spin small lots to particular specifications or to make yarn in a particular color. It has also devised ways of swapping materials and labor with other mills, Mr. Plummer said. For instance, the company spins wool for a weaving mill in Pennsylvania, which pays for the service with woven blankets, which Quinnehticut sells in its factory store. But Mr. Plummer said he expected to make the greatest profits by selling as much yarn as possible at the factory store and by mail order.
Photos on the wall at the Quinnehticut Woolen Company tell the story of profits made by the Ponemah Mill, which was said to be the largest cotton manufacturing plant in the world. The mill produced typewriter-ribbon cloth, cambric and percale. During World War I, it added cloth for airplane wings to its product line.
The mill's first building opened in 1871. Designed in the French second empire style, it has five floors. Two square stair towers topped with ornate cupolas dominate the facade. The building is 750 feet long and 74 feet wide, and a 228-foot-long L-shaped section extends from the rear of the main structure toward the Shetucket River. Five granite-and-masonry arches beneath the rear section collected water from the river to generate electric power for the mill. Two more brick mills were built later to house Ponemah's expanding weaving operation.
At one time, 1,500 workers lived in Taftville, the mill village. The village's name came from two investors in the mill, Cyrus and Edward P. Taft. The owners of the Ponemah Mill built more than 200 identical workers' houses on streets laid out in a grid pattern. Each had a white picket fence in front. The mill and village are on the National Register of Historic Places, and every original building is still standing.
Six people now work, either part or full time, at the woolen company. Although business this winter has been slow, because of the mild weather, Mr. Plummer said, he expects to show a profit for the first time this year and to create more full-time shifts. The company has already begun diversifying by making woolen batting for a futon manufacturer in Manchester.
The mills in Connecticut are beginning to shed the stigma of their long decline, Mr. Plummer said. "Now, there is more pride among people in the industry," he said, "and we're taking a different look at its history."
People who worked at the Ponemah Mill visit the woolen company and stop to examine the pictures on the wall, Mr. Plummer said. "They want to see these skills continue," he added. "It has a lot of meaning for them."

 BODY:
I read with interest and hope Max Frankel on "Innumeracy2 " (Word & Image, March 5).
Is it possible that journalists, Washington's "experts" and all media may take this information and use it wisely? I rather think not. Obviously, to the careful reader/ listener, numbers are crunched and molded to one's direction. 
 One of the most interesting was done during the Nixon Administration. A Department of Labor spokesperson came on camera to say:
"The rate of increase of unemployment has slowed."
Small comfort to the man/ woman registering at the local unemployment office. Unemployment, in fact, was increasing even as the Department of Labor representative spoke.
It was interesting that when I tried to discuss this with my generally wise and critical groups that I made no sense to them.
If reporters would report and check facts and media would not try so hard to look wise, perhaps people would be less led down dead-end paths.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Picking Stocks Its Own Size

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
A TINY mutual fund just two years old is popping up at the top of many stock fund rankings and attracting new money at a fast clip. But before investors send their checks, they should take a close look at the fund's portfolio and decide how much risk they are willing to take.
The fund, called Perkins Opportunity, belongs to one of the riskiest categories -- funds that buy stocks of small companies. And even within that category, it appears to be among the riskiest. 
 Largely because of its aggressive investment style, the fund has gained a stunning 15.2 percent already this year, compared with 4.9 percent for all growth funds. It rose 14.8 percent in 1994, while the group lost 2 percent, according to Morningstar Inc., fund researchers in Chicago.
Such performance does not go unnoticed. The fund's assets have nearly doubled since the beginning of the year, from $5 million, to $9 million, though that total keeps it below the $30 million cutoff for listing in this newspaper.
The Perkins fund specializes in the smallest companies, many of which are not tracked by Wall Street and which are thinly traded. The median market capitalization, or the number of shares multiplied by the share price, of the stocks it owns is $70 million. Only four of the 1,620 diversified stock funds tracked by Morningstar own smaller stocks. Stocks of small companies tend to be more volatile than their large counterparts. And very small companies, sometimes called micro-caps, are more volatile still.
"We've always been more interested in micro- and small-cap stocks," said Richard W. Perkins, who manages the fund with his son, Daniel, from Minneapolis. In total, their firm manages $200 million in assets.
The managers are fond of shopping for penny stocks, a bit of a misnomer since the classic definition is a stock that costs less than $5 a share. By this measure, more than a third of their portfolio is in penny stocks.
The companies that issue such stocks often have erratic revenue and earnings histories, if they have any record at all. Many of these stocks do not trade on the major exchanges either, meaning the fund may have trouble finding a buyer when it decides to sell.
The fund's largest holding is Innerdyne Inc., a maker of surgical equipment based in Salt Lake City. The company went public at $11 a share in 1992 and leaped to $17 on its first day of trading. By the fall of 1993, its stock had fallen to $1.25.
Although Innerdyne has yet to have a profitable quarter, it has been a winner for the Perkins fund. It paid an average of $2.65 for the company's shares, which have risen in value to $4.38, and the stock accounts for 3.6 percent of the fund's holdings. Innerdyne's market capitalization is $72 million, typical of a Perkins stock.
In another attempt at bottom fishing, Mr. Perkins bought shares of the Cooper Companies, whose chief executive was convicted of fraud and whose board recently paid a multimillion-dollar fine to settle charges of lax oversight brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The fund paid $2.02 a share for Cooper stock, now trading at $2.13.
"This is a forgotten, down-trodden company," the senior Mr. Perkins said of Cooper, which is based in Fort Lee, N.J., and makes ophthalmic supplies. "New management came in, saved it from bankruptcy and is fixing it."
A stock that has not proved profitable is General Magic Inc., a computer software company. The fund bought it at $22 a share, but the price now hovers at $13.38. "I wish I hadn't bought it," Mr. Perkins conceded.
Perhaps the most notable thing about the Perkins fund besides its small-company bent is its technology fascination. About 45 percent of the fund's assets were invested in technology stocks in June 1994. Such shares now account for roughly a quarter of the portfolio, Mr. Perkins said.
Technology and small companies add up to volatility in the stock market. But the volatility has all been positive for shareholders of the Perkins fund -- so far.
The fund "is lucky enough to have been around in an environment that hasn't punished really small-cap technology funds," said John Rekenthaler, who edits the Morningstar 5 Star Investor, an investment newsletter.
The fund dabbles in restricted securities and warrants. Restricted securities, which accounted for nearly 3 percent of the fund's assets on Sept. 30, cannot be sold on stock exchanges, and their prices are determined by the fund's trustees. What the fund would actually get for them if it needed to sell is impossible to know.
With warrants, investors get the right to buy a certain amount of common stock at a fixed price for a period of time. If the stock never reaches that conversion price, the warrants expire worthless. The Perkins fund carried warrants for Work Recovery Units of Tucson, Ariz., which makes equipment and supplies for medical rehabilitation, on its books at $33,000 on Sept. 30 but has since marked them down to nothing.
While not a good fit for the timid, the Perkins fund does have one big advantage. Its small size allows it to buy and sell stocks in companies without driving the price up or down the way a behemoth Fidelity fund would.
On the flip side, the Perkins fund owns only 56 stocks. That highly concentrated portfolio means declines in just a few stocks could send the fund reeling.
"If we have too many stocks, we will have market performance," rather than above-average performance, Mr. Perkins said of his strategy. Acknowledging the risk, he said that investors might want to put only a portion of their assets, perhaps 5 percent or 10 percent, in the fund.
One final caveat for investors. The Perkins fund's expenses are sky high, perhaps because the fund is so small and cannot reap economies of scale. Expenses exceeded 5 percent of assets on Sept. 30, leading the fund to pay more than 2.5 percentage points of those costs itself to comply with various state laws. Should annual returns decline from their double-digit levels, those expenses could be a big drag on performance.
Of course, Mr. Perkins expects the fund to grow and expenses to wane. And there's little danger of this fund turning investors away anytime soon. How big would be too big for a fund that specializes in the teeniest companies? About $100 million, Mr. Perkins ventured.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Making Gains on the Winds From Washington

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
IN its fervor to challenge unnecessary government regulation, the Republican-dominated Congress will soon place another Federal agency in the cross hairs: The Food and Drug Administration. For many investors, this political hunting party may signal a time to bag some big game -- or to duck for cover.
Of course, the average person may pay more attention to the moral and economic aspects of the F.D.A. dispute than to its meaning for stocks. House Speaker Newt Gingrich has denounced the F.D.A. as the "leading job-killer in America," for instance, while the agency's supporters have conjured up the specter of babies deformed by drugs like thalidomide under deregulation. Big questions, and great theater. 
 But as the Republican Congress puts affirmative action, product liability, the F.D.A. and other topics on the table during this session, the average investor should learn to do what investment professionals do: study exactly how the winds from Washington can buffet Wall Street.
The F.D.A. makes a good case study.
Lesson No. 1 is about uncertainty. With the F.D.A., no one knows which, if any, of the harsh medicines proposed will be administered. The calls range from outright abolition of the agency to privatization to merely a vigorous housecleaning.
And some of the ideas for the agency, like privatization, are so thorny that prediction is particularly difficult. "Do you really want to privatize the F.B.I.?" asked Paul Brooke, a managing director at Morgan Stanley. "That, too, is an enforcement agency, like the F.D.A."
But uncertainty is no reason for investors not to pay attention. Once things are clear, it is too late on Wall Street. So, before the political dust settles, investors must understand not only the impact of potential change but also the roster of likely potential winners and losers.
With the F.D.A., the stakes are huge. The agency's province, which includes prescription drugs, biotechnology and food safety, reaches deep into the American economy. If the agency were drastically transformed, said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer, "It would be one of the great bullish wild cards in American business, because it costs half a trillion dollars a year for American businesses to comply with tens of thousands of pages of regulations."
And even a slight relaxation of F.D.A. regulation could be a bonanza for some companies. For a new drug that is expected to earn $500 million over its life, every week's delay costs $10 million in revenues as a company awaits approval, said Viren Mehta, a partner at Mehta and Isaly, pharmaceutical investment advisers.
Also, even the possibility of change can make things happen. Health reform failed, but many health-care companies merged and downsized anyway. Similarly, there are signs that the F.D.A. itself is already speeding up some regulatory procedures, analysts say.
Who stands to gain if the agency's approval procedures are liberalized? One clear set of winners is companies "that have a track record of innovation," said Margo L. Vignola, an analyst for Salomon Brothers. "Companies with plenty of product in the pipeline," she said, include such drug and medical-device businesses as Johnson & Johnson, Abbott Laboratories, Medtronic and St. Jude Medical.
Mr. Mehta said that other active product creators are Pfizer, Allergan and -- in Europe -- Astra, Roche, Sandoz and Schering.
Many biotechnology companies -- Amgen and Immunex are strong examples -- are product innovators by definition, and they may thrive in another way under deregulation. Because biotech companies are symbols of innovation, and because Republican reformers charge that the F.D.A. restricts new product development, biotech companies may benefit from the "sympathy-vote factor," said Mr. Mehta. "The F.D.A. realizes that they are taking the risk of doing cutting-edge science, and the F.D.A. is more likely to help these companies, permitting them not to have to jump through so many hoops."
Companies that regularly enhance their products also may gain greatly, said Ms. Vignola, such as manufacturerers of pacemakers and sutures. Follow-up approvals for product extension often involve "modest controversy," she explained, and already "the F.D.A. appears to be loosening up." Also, "since in the past the length of the approval time has been very extended" for these products, she said, the time savings may be particularly large.
Investors should also ask if deregulation might benefit a whole industry. For example, many European sodas contain noncaloric sweeteners that taste more like sugar, but that have not yet been approved by the F.D.A. If the rules get looser, "the growth of the soft-drink companies could increase if they could market a better diet product that would taste the same as the regular soda," said Emanuel Goldman, a food and tobacco analyst for Paine Webber.
Other food companies that have many dealings with the F.D.A., such as Conagra, Hormel, Tyson Foods and other meat producers, also might realize savings from relaxed regulation, said Terry Bivens, a food analyst for Argus Research.
What does the F.D.A. think about the proposals? The agency "doesn't comment on advice to investors," said William E. Schultz, the deputy commissioner for policy. Still, investors may want to think about his observation that F.D.A. review "not only benefits consumers here, but also benefits the companies." Many other countries, he explained, "look to the F.D.A.'s approval as a criterion for their own approval."
Who will be the big losers if F.D.A. regulation is relaxed? "Companies whose existing products have served them well because there isn't any new competition," said Ms. Vignola.
In general, looser regulation may hurt incumbent companies. "Any existing product will lose if a competing product finds it easier to come to market," Mr. Metz said. High regulatory hurdles, in other words, protect companies from competitors who have not cleared them.
According to industry executives who declined to be identified, among the companies that are benefiting from such regulatory protection are American Home Products and Upjohn.
As they look at the F.D.A. issue through an investing lens, however, people must be sure not to overassess the impact of Washington on Wall Street. For example, tobacco companies already look like big winners; they no longer face the embarrassment of hearings in the Democratic Congress or the threat that the F.D.A. might declare tobacco an addictive drug.
But because the low price of tobacco stocks is "a function of the threat of litigation, not regulation," said Mr. Goldman, it is unlikely that tobacco shares would rebound even if the F.D.A.'s operations were substantially curtailed.
 
Chart: "From Discovery To Drug Store"
Som e Republicans say business id hobbled by F.D.A. approval procedures, Here is the path a company must follow to bring a drug to market.
 
1 -- Discovery of a Drug
The sponsor of a drug must be able to describe it in detailed chemical formulas and must try it out on animals for human toxity. This testing can take months or decades.
 
2 -- First Formal Permission
Data from animal tests is submitted to a local Institutional Review Board. If the board approves, human testing can begin.
 
3 -- Initial Human Tests
The drug is given to a few people, at low doses. They are carefully watched for harful side effects. These tests take several months.
 
4 -- Primary Human Tests
The drug is tested to see if it works against targeted disease. Under medical supervision, hundreds of people are given the drug and are folloed closely. This phase can take several months to two years.
 
5 -- Late Human Tests
Full-scale human testing is performed with thousands of patients. Doctors watch again for side effects and proof of effectiveness, and carefully adjust doses. This phase may take two to four years.
 
6 -- F.D.A. Review
The sponsor presents all the collected data to the F.D.A., along with a new-drug application. Agency approval takes about 19 months.
 
7 -- Market Approval
After the drug is approved, the sponsor can market it. But the F.D.A. continues to monitor the medicine.

ENTERTAINMENT
Investing in a Dream Team
For a decade or so, Paul Allen has followed his bliss about as far as money could take him. That's pretty far, for Mr. Allen was a Microsoft co-founder -- he went to high school with Bill Gates -- and left as a billionaire in 1983. Since then, he has indulged all manner of passions -- from buying a basketball team to financing a Jimi Hendrix museum in Seattle. Now he's made his biggest investment yet, putting $500 million -- even for him, a hefty bet -- into that ultimate entertainment dream team, Dreamworks SKG (Spielberg, Katzenberg and Geffen, that is). That sum gives him an 18.3 percent stake, with the three founders retaining two-thirds. Mr. Gates later got in on the act, too (does he have a finger in everything?), with Microsoft forming a multimedia joint venture with Dreamworks. 

HISTORY
A Lot of Water Over the Dam
William Clark's grandfather, it seems, worked for Morrison Knudsen when it built Hoover Dam in the 30's, and that link to the past brings vividly to life the contrast between the company's glory days and its current sad state. One possible cause for the problems has emerged: the directors who for so long backed William Agee's actions as chairman, even as warning signs flared, also had close ties to a charity run by Mr. Agee's wife, Mary -- ties so close that one expert on such matters said, "I have never seen a situation like this." And last week, in the latest blows, Mr. Clark resigned as acting chairman, even as Morrison disclosed losses even worse than expected. To top it off, the next day Zbigniew Brzezinski also resigned from the board. Hoover Dam is intact.
 
COLA WARS
D.C.U.'s? XL to the Rescue
Don't look now, but there's a vast, confused group taking shape across the land -- "dual-cola users" is what Pepsi calls them, with that poetic solemnity special to marketing. And those fickle souls just won't stick with either regular or diet cola, so -- yes -- they switch back and forth. Now this is heavy stuff. Sodas are a $50 billion business, and $30 billion of that's in colas; the cola wars are BIG. Just last week, to try to nab those D.C.U.'s (as marketers no doubt call them), Pepsi introduced a low-sugar concoction called Pepsi XL in a few Florida cities. The company had some convoluted explanation for that "XL" -- it mixes sugar with artificial sweetener -- but what it surely comes down to is that Pepsi wanted it to sound like a car. Slurp. Vrrooom. Help.
 
EXECUTIVE SUITE
At Sony, Software Is In
In consumer electronics, there's "hardware" and "software" -- the machines and the stuff they play, like movies or CDs. For half a century, Sony has been the master innovator of hardware -- just look at the Walkman and its billions of descendants. In software it's been a rougher ride -- look at its billions in Hollywood losses. But it's a new era at Sony -- its visionary co-founder Akio Morita just stepped down as chairman, Norio Ohga moved up to that job from president, and all eyes were on his successor. And the choice, last week, was a shock: Nobuyuki Idei, who leapfrogged over at least 10 higher-ranking executives. But the appointment sent a crystal-clear message: with Mr. Idei, a movie buff with the "software spirit," running things, software is definitely in.
 
THE PRESIDENT
And Think of His Aching Wrist
In the spirit of the latest times, here's a stock tip: invest in companies that make pens. In the House version of the line-item veto, the President could strike offending budget items. But in the Senate version, passed last week, he would accept or reject each budget morsel separately -- by one estimate, perhaps 10,000 separate bills. That's a lot of Presidential autographs -- and a lot of pens. But why do (Republican) legislators want to give the (Democratic) White House such power? Maybe they figure it's the only way they can get out the pork (which they, of course, put in). Or maybe it's because they have this idea that Bill Clinton will be back in Arkansas come 1997. Another point: Is a line-item veto even constitutional? Probably not, said Pat Moynihan.
 
POLITICS
Snippets of Discontent
Yes, old-style liberalism may be dying, gunned down by Republican assault rifles, but it's not going quietly. All last week, protests rippled across the land against Federal and local budget-slashing. In the House welfare debate, several lawmakers, including Sam Gibbons, showed a commitment to children by wearing ties or scarves designed for Save the Children. And hundreds of children, with the message "Pick on someone your own size," rallied on the Capitol steps to protest school lunch cuts. Later, more students converged on the Capitol -- one, in a towel, bearing a sign reading "We Are Being Stripped" -- to protest cuts in school aid. Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson led a march to Albany to battle Governor Pataki's proposed cuts to Medicaid, education and programs for the homeless. And New York City's hospitals chief quit abruptly, saying he couldn't back deep Medicaid cuts.
 
CYBERSPACE
alt.ban.internet.sex.but.how
There they are on the Internet listings, news groups like "alt.sex.beastiality" and "alt.sex.masterbation." Such spelling, apparently, causes no outrage, but the content does. Everything from Playboy photos to the crudest of language is available at a click, no matter how young the wielder of the mouse, and many people want it stopped. But how? Cyberspace is the Wild West of the 90's, untamed and, for now, untamable. Stuff can come as easily from across the street as from across the globe. Trying to control it would be like spitting digits into the wind. But the Senate Commerce Committee is trying anyway. Last week it approved a ban on cyberporn, vowing $100,000 fines and two-year prison terms. Senator Jim Exon, who wrote the bill, admitted that it was probably futile, but he said he had to try.
 
THE MARKETS
A Slowdown, and Stocks Soar
The stock market loved Friday's economic news -- an 0.8 percent drop in orders for durable goods (stuff that's supposed to last longer than bananas or most electronic gadgets). By the market's current upside-down thinking, any slowing means less chance that the Fed will raise interest rates this week. And such a strong negative number was especially positive, as the Dow jumped 50, to 4,138.

A Suspect Story of Success

 BODY:
The franchising industry says franchises have a 95 percent success rate. That sounds terrific, especially since four out of five independent businesses fail within five years. But the figure comes from a survey done by the Commerce Department in 1988 that has serious flaws, according to Tim Bates, an economics professor at Wayne State University in Detroit. Dr. Bates said that the survey was conducted by mail and that weak franchisers simply didn't return their questionnaires. "There's no question that the franchise industry has overhyped its success rate," he said. 
 Dr. Bates's own research paints a gloomy picture. His study of 7,300 small businesses that were started in the mid-1980's, including 400 franchises, found that about 35 percent of the franchises had gone out of business by late 1991, as against 28 percent of other small businesses.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Best and Worst Franchise Bets" shows ranking of selected businesses by the prospect of franchise success over the next five years. The analysis, conducted by Marketdata Enterprises, was based on economic and demographic forecasts, including the projected growth of the industries and the current share controlled by franchises.
