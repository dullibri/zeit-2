HEADLINE: U.S. Carriers Expected to Add Few New Planes to Their Fleets

BYLINE: By JEFF BAILEY

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 8 

 BODY:
Think the planes are full now? Just wait.
 United States airlines are expected to add very few new planes to their fleets between now and the end of 2007, according to a study released yesterday, even as the number of passengers is expected to grow along with the economy.
David Strine, an analyst at Bear Stearns & Company, concluded in his report that the supply of seats on United States carriers will probably rise just 0.6 percent this year and 3.3 percent in 2007. But he expects strong demand to push prices up 8.1 percent this year and 3.9 percent next year. 
 That means flights will be fuller, continuing a trend that has made travel increasingly unpleasant in recent months. The airlines are particularly vulnerable to the ups and downs of fuel prices and the economy, and one of the few areas where it can exert some control, in the hopes of improving profitability through higher fares, is capacity. ''It's absolutely critical,'' said Mr. Strine.
 The industry is now, on average, filling about 80 percent of its seats, a record high. By comparison, the airlines did not fill more than 70 percent of their seats, on average, until 1997. Their ''load factor'' regularly ran below 60 percent full before deregulation in 1978.
 Passengers may feel like they can't take it anymore, but Henry C. Joyner, senior vice president of planning at American Airlines, said the industry, after more than $30 billion of losses in recent years, can't take any less. 
 ''I don't think you can survive in this business without a load factor of 80 percent, certainly the high 70's,'' he said. ''The domestic industry has to run at or above the load factors we're at today.''
 On heavily traveled routes, ''By and large you can expect a completely full airplane,'' said Mr. Joyner.
 In past upturns, airlines ordered so many new planes that, by the time they were delivered, a glut of seats developed, depressing fares and profits. 
 What is different this time is that the industry -- after Sept. 11, 2001, led to a sharp drop in air travel -- either canceled or delayed delivery on most of its airplane purchases. American, for instance, has two Boeing 777's arriving this year, but no other planes on firm order until 2013, said Mr. Joyner.
 With about 5,000 planes in service at domestic airlines, Mr. Strine expects just 142 new planes to be delivered this year, 140 next year and 136 in 2008. Most are going to low-cost carriers like Southwest and JetBlue.
 The new planes will not replace all those that have been grounded by the airlines. Six big airlines unloaded about 700 planes, or about 20 percent of their fleets, since June 30, 2001, the Air Transport Association said. American said last month that it would ground 27 MD-80's by July 1, further cutting capacity. And Alaska Airlines in March said it would accelerate the retirement of its MD-80's, ending their use by the end of 2008. Delta and Northwest, both in bankruptcy, are sharply cutting their fleets.
 Boeing and Airbus, the two big manufacturers, have shifted their sales efforts to faster-growing economies in Asia. So, there are very few new planes available for United States airlines, either from the manufacturers or from leasing companies.
 To be sure, an economic slowdown in Asia could cause airlines there to delay or cancel airplane orders, and that would make planes available to carriers here. The other way domestic airlines can increase capacity is to fly existing planes longer hours, and they are beginning to do that. Mr. Strine said carriers could potentially increase their capacity by as much as 9 percent by flying existing planes longer hours or turning them around faster at the gate, but he doubts that they could swiftly make such a big of a leap in efficiency.

Loss Widens for United
By Bloomberg News
 United Airlines' parent, the UAL Corporation, which exited bankruptcy three months ago, said yesterday that its first-quarter loss widened as spending for fuel rose by a third.
 UAL had a loss of $306 million excluding a bankruptcy accounting benefit, compared with a loss of $302 million a year earlier. Sales rose 14 percent, to $4.47 billion, UAL said.
 Spending for fuel climbed 33 percent from a year ago, to $1.07 billion, even though consumption was little changed. 
 Higher ticket prices and more passengers could not compensate for higher costs, and United said it would cut annual expenses beginning next year by $400 million more than originally planned.
 Stock in UAL, which is based in Elk Grove, Ill., fell $3.47, or 9 percent, to $35.50 a share. Excluding fuel, costs rose 3 percent per seat flown a mile, and United said it would cut some administrative jobs, reduce spending for advertising, combine cargo and airport operations and adjust schedules to get more use out of each plane.
 The company declined to say how many jobs might be eliminated or how much spending on marketing and promotion would be cut.
 Including the bankruptcy gain, first-quarter net income was $22.6 billion, compared with a loss of $1.07 billion a year earlier. United did not provide per-share figures for the first quarter.

HEADLINE: Interest Rate Concerns Keep Lid on Dow

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks failed to get a lift from proposed takeovers yesterday as concern that the Federal Reserve might keep raising interest rates left prices little changed.
 The Dow Jones industrial average pushed slightly closer toward the record high it set six years ago, helped by Intel, which rose on speculation that the company, the world's No. 1 semiconductor maker, might spin off its memory-chip unit.
Golden West Financial, the California-based regional bank, had the biggest gain in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index after Wachovia agreed to buy it. 
 Fisher Scientific International rallied on a bid from Thermo Electron, the world's top maker of medical laboratory instruments.
 The Dow average gained 6.8 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 11,584.54, about 139 points from its record set in January 2000. The S.& P. 500 lost 1.1 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,324.66. The Nasdaq composite index added 2.42 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,344.99.
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose a percentage point, to 5.11 percent. The price fell 2/32, to 95 11/32.
 Oil prices fell below $70 a barrel, helping to support the market, after Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, wrote in a letter to President Bush that the country was seeking ways to ease tension with the United States over Iran's nuclear program. Crude oil for June delivery fell 42 cents, to $69.77.
 Economists at all 22 securities firms that trade with the Federal Reserve expect Fed officials to raise their target rate tomorrow by a quarter percentage point, to 5 percent. Seventeen of the so-called primary dealers said that would be the last increase until at least August. 
 Golden West Financial jumped $4.39, or 6.2 percent, to $74.90. Wachovia is making its largest purchase ever in buying Golden West to accelerate expansion into the fast-growing California market.
 Fisher, a provider of laboratory supplies and services, rose $2.22, to $75.95. Fisher investors will get two Thermo shares, or $78.90, for each of their shares. Thermo lost 91 cents, to $38.54.
 Alcoa, the world's largest aluminum producer, added $1.02, or 2.9 percent, to $36.12 for the second-highest gain in the Dow average behind Intel. The Age, an Australian newspaper, reported that Alcoa might attract takeover offers from mining companies as aluminum prices rise. Kevin Lowery, a Pittsburgh-based spokesman for Alcoa, declined to comment.
 Berkshire Hathaway, the insurance and investment company run by the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett, gained $490, to $89,200. Berkshire said first-quarter net income rose 70 percent, to $2.31 billion, and announced a $4 billion acquisition of the Iscar Metalworking Companies, an Israeli tool maker.
 Shares of Intel rallied 60 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $20.11 for the best performance in the Dow average. Intel separated the production of memory chips from other processors, which may be a precursor to a spinoff or sale of the unit that makes semiconductors to store programs on cellphones and DVD players.
 About the same number of stocks rose and fell on the New York Stock Exchange. Some 1.55 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: A General in Charge: Why the Fuss?

BYLINE: By MARK MAZZETTI; Scott Shane contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8 

 BODY:
In recent years, the Central Intelligence Agency has stood largely alone as an American intelligence agency run by civilians -- an island of pinstripes in an ocean of military greens and blues. 
 That is one reason the choice of Gen. Michael V. Hayden as the next C.I.A. director has prompted concern on Capitol Hill, where some lawmakers have said they are worried about a clean sweep by the Pentagon, which already controls the vast bulk of American intelligence resources.
Throughout its history, the C.I.A. has prided itself for its independence and flair, and for a culture that values truth-telling and risk-taking over deference to authority. Military officers salute and follow detailed battle plans, the thinking goes, while good intelligence operatives often make up the plan as they go along. 
 ''Good soldiers are trained to follow their orders, and General Hayden is a good soldier,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate. ''I am concerned that General Hayden may not be able to provide the president with the independent voice he needs at the C.I.A.''
 The concern behind having a general in charge at the agency reflects uneasiness over other prospects. Some lawmakers have said they worry that General Hayden may prove more acquiescent than a civilian to efforts by the Pentagon to muscle onto the C.I.A.'s turf; others have said they worry that the agency may become too attuned to the demands of the Pentagon to perform its mission.
 Representative Peter Hoekstra, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, a leading critic of the nomination, said he feared that a military officer leading the C.I.A. might pull the agency too far toward merely providing battlefield intelligence for American troops. 
 ''Our nation needs to maintain a balance between intelligence support to the military and long-term intelligence support to policy makers,'' Mr. Hoekstra said Monday in a written statement. ''By placing a military officer atop the C.I.A. we risk losing this balance.''
 With no spy satellites or high-tech listening dishes under its control, the C.I.A has always received just a fraction of America's intelligence budget, which is an estimated $44 billion annually. The National Security Agency, the National Reconnaissance Office and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, all run by uniformed officers or part of the Pentagon's chain of command, are much larger than the C.I.A. 
 Gregory F. Treverton, former vice chairman of the National Intelligence Council and now an analyst at the Rand Corporation, said the C.I.A. ''was created to be and has always seen itself as a check on the military,'' an independent source of information with a competing view of intelligence priorities.
 General Hayden has shown a willingness to challenge Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld by suggesting, unsuccessfully, in 2004 that the Pentagon intelligence agencies be put under the control of the new director of national intelligence. The White House, in fighting its critics, has gone out of the way to emphasize General Hayden's independence. 
 Adm. Stansfield Turner, the last man to be nominated as C.I.A. director while still in uniform, in 1977, said Monday that he had little concern about General Hayden's ability to stand up to Pentagon officials. 
 ''I can't imagine that Hayden is going to kowtow to Rumsfeld in any way, shape or form,'' said Admiral Turner, who is retired.
 What is most likely to give General Hayden problems on Capitol Hill is his association with the domestic eavesdropping program that he ran while leading the National Security Agency. Republicans and Democrats have criticized the program, and some lawmakers suggested Monday that General Hayden's public defense of the White House after the existence of the program was revealed showed that he might be too willing to be brought into the political fray. 
 ''General Hayden will have to prove his independence from the policy and political decisions of the White House,'' said Representative Jane Harman of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. 
 Ms. Harman added: ''He unfortunately allowed himself to become part of the White House's defense of the president's domestic surveillance program. An intelligence officer is supposed to collect, analyze and report facts, not defend policy decisions.''
 When President Jimmy Carter nominated Admiral Turner to lead the C.I.A., there was little public angst about a military officer encroaching on civilian turf, although Admiral Turner stirred resentment at the agency by bringing in a team of Navy officers as his top aides.
 The events of recent years have made the tensions between the C.I.A. and the Pentagon more acute. There is widespread belief within the agency that it was the C.I.A. alone that stood up to the Pentagon and the White House to provide an accurate picture of there being limited links between Iraq and Al Qaeda.
 Some lawmakers have suggested that if the C.I.A. were brought further into the Pentagon's orbit, its chances of serving as an independent check on the inclinations of policy makers would be reduced. 
 And in the intelligence community, some point to a separate concern that General Hayden will have to address: the perception that he was sent to the C.I.A. to do the bidding of John D. Negroponte, the director of national intelligence. 
 The tenure of General Hayden's predecessor, Porter J. Goss, was doomed partly by Mr. Goss's turf battles with Mr. Negroponte. Some say that General Hayden, who was most recently Mr. Negroponte's deputy, will have to strike a delicate balance in his new job. 
 Amy B. Zegart, an associate professor of public policy at the University of California, Los Angeles, who is writing a book on intelligence changes, said Congressional concern about Pentagon encroachment on the C.I.A. was justified, because Mr. Rumsfeld had rushed to fill a ''power vacuum'' as Mr. Negroponte was starting up his own office. 
 ''The Pentagon is basically creating a parallel intelligence universe, duplicating the jobs traditionally done by civilian agencies,'' Ms. Zegart said. ''We should all be nervous about that.''

HEADLINE: The High Costs Of Cheap Gas And Vice Versa

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
BEFORE we were old enough to have jobs, my college roommate and I set out to take a vacation that would cost as little as possible. Our transportation was a borrowed Volkswagen, and friends scattered around the country put us up on spare beds or sofas. Entertainment came from a carefully planned schedule of minor league baseball games and from whatever else caught our eye along the way.
 The first trip, in 1992, went so well that it became a near-annual tradition. By the time we stopped it eight years later, we had been to both coasts, the Smoky Mountains, the Great Plains, the Herbert Hoover museum and perhaps the nation's finest ballpark food stand, a barbecue pit in Stockton, Calif. On a good day, we spent $50 between us. 
 I didn't realize it at the time -- I didn't realize it, in fact, until last week -- but our timing was impeccable. Starting in the early 1990's, Americans got to enjoy a decade of the lowest gasoline costs in the nation's history. As Daniel Yergin, the author of a Pulitzer Prize-winning history of oil, says about those years, ''Gasoline was truly one of the great bargains of the Western world.''
 And, boy, did the country take full advantage. We fell in love with the high, comfortable ride of the sport utility vehicle without having to worry much about the gas bills, and we bought homes in distant exurbs like Sugar Grove, Ill., and Frederick, Md., that required long commutes to get just about anywhere. 
 Now, the good times seem to be over. The price of gasoline is hovering around $3 a gallon, and politicians are falling over each other to pander to voters' gas fears. In a recent Gallup Poll, 70 percent of people said they favored price controls, a relic of Richard Nixon's day. 
 But it's time to take a deep breath and consider a radical fact: gas still isn't all that expensive. I'm not just talking about the disparity between prices here and in Europe, where gas taxes are much higher. What really matters to people is the cost of the gas that is needed to drive a mile, a function of both the price of oil and the fuel efficiency of cars. 
 By this measure, gas for the average American now costs about what it did throughout the 1960's and early 70's and much less than in the early 80's. The 1990's, in other words, were the big exception. And the fact that gas has gotten a lot more expensive in the last few years is actually good news.
 GASOLINE is the only product whose price is displayed on 20-foot-high signs in just about every town in the United States, which is why we get a little crazy when the price of it is rising. But those signs aren't an especially useful way of thinking about the cost of gas, for two big reasons.
 The first, more obvious one is that people forget about general inflation. Over time, the price of most everything -- milk, blue jeans, movie tickets, health care, life insurance -- rises, as do people's incomes, and the increases largely cancel each other out.
 There is a man in Texas named Phil Stuart who claims to have kept track of all his gas purchases since 1979, and he posts his records on the Web at www.randomuseless.info. On May 20, 1992, for instance, he put 17 gallons of super unleaded in his Corvette and paid $22, or $1.26 a gallon. 
 He has gone so far as to graph the price over time, both with and without inflation adjustments, and the difference between the lines is striking. The one that doesn't take inflation into account fits our perceptions: since the late 70's, gas has gotten ever more expensive. The other line fits reality: adjusted for inflation, gas is still cheaper than it was in the early 80's.
 But the cost of gas itself is only part of the story. The other part is how far that gas will take you. If you think about it, you care about how much you pay to drive 100 miles, not how much you pay for a gallon of clear, pungent fluid. 
 In the 1960's, when people were buying Country Squires and El Caminos, vehicles were getting just 14 miles to the gallon on average. Gas was cheap at the time, but with all the guzzlers on the road, drivers were still spending an average of 15 cents a mile on gas. (All these numbers are adjusted for inflation.) 
 Yet people didn't seem to mind. If anything, they cared more about getting their hands on bigger, more powerful cars, and, as a result, the overall fuel efficiency of the nation's vehicles actually fell somewhat in the 60's, notes Lee Schipper, research director at Embarq, a transportation consulting group.
 But the oil crises of the 1970's and early 80's changed everything. The cost of gas spiked, eventually reaching 20 cents a mile, and the government passed a law in 1975 forcing vehicles to become more efficient. Thanks to that law and 20 years of mostly falling oil prices, Americans spent less than 7 cents a mile for gas in 1998.
 If oil were any other product, this would have been cause only for celebration. But the law of supply and demand being what it is, cheap gas also means more gas use. And using a lot more gas is about the worst thing we can do right now. More oil use, we now know, means a dangerously warmer planet. It also means more money for some of the world's worst governments. Eventually, some of that money makes its way to Al Qaeda and other terrorists. 
 Today, gas again costs about 15 cents a mile for the average driver, which gives the country some incentive to become more energy-efficient. You can cut the cost to 10 cents a mile, for example, by driving a Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla. 
 I know the price jump has made life hard on poorer people who do a lot of driving, and we should by all means be looking for policies to help them. But the next time you pass a sign advertising gas at $3 a gallon, remember that it is exactly what the country needs right now. Cheap gas just isn't worth it anymore.

HEADLINE: Boston U. Gave Ex-Chief $6.1 Million, Officials Disclose

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO

 BODY:
Officials at Boston University disclosed yesterday that the institution's long-term president and chancellor, John R. Silber, collected $6.1 million last year, two years after he stepped down as leader. 
 The money includes $3.3 million in deferred compensation from the 32 years that Dr. Silber worked at the university and a house in the Chestnut Hill neighborhood of Boston that university trustees agreed he could live in for the rest of his life. Living in the house was valued at $305,000 a year. The package also includes $770,000 from an unusual arrangement in which the university rewarded Dr. Silber with an extra year's salary for every five years worked.
 The compensation package, which some experts said was the largest in academia, was defended by university officials but touched off outrage among other academics. Disclosure of the amount comes as the university is overhauling its governance policies, hoping to rehabilitate its image after several expensive mishaps. 
 Three years ago, the university offered the president's job to Daniel S. Goldin, the former administrator of NASA, then paid him $1.8 million not to take the job after he clashed with Dr. Silber and the university trustees. Before that, a family that donated $3 million for a library expansion threatened to sue, saying the university had used the money for other purposes. Eventually, the university was forced to return the donation.
 In a written statement, Dr. Silber, 79, said the bulk of the payout, totaling $4.5 million, was money he had earned and set aside in a ''segregated investment account run by the university'' during his years as president and chancellor, plus returns on those investments.
 ''None of the deferred salary nor any of the income earned from it came from an additional payment by the university,'' Dr. Silber wrote. ''Boston University paid me nothing beyond my salary.''
 ''This is not a bonus,'' he added. ''It is not a golden parachute or a gift from the university.''
 Dr. Silber has long been a mainstay in the annual rankings of highest paid university leaders published by The Chronicle of Higher Education. In 2004, the university reported that he earned $1.25 million. Dr. Silber, though already retired, was listed by The Chronicle as one of only five university leaders earning more than $1 million. 
 The university revealed details of the package before making them public through a required tax filing next Monday, said Stephen P. Burgay, a spokesman for the university. The university's current president, Robert A. Brown, receives a salary of $650,000, Mr. Burgay said.
 Experts said Dr. Silber's compensation package was the steepest they had seen, and it was revealed at a time of wide discontent over tuition increases at universities that regularly outpace inflation. Tuition, room and board at Boston University is $41,600 a year, officials said.
 Roger W. Bowen, general secretary of the American Association of University Professors, described the Silber package as ''symptomatic'' of something larger happening on campuses. ''Presidents once upon a time were seen as colleagues, and professors hold on to that romantic notion,'' Mr. Bowen said. These days, he said, they are becoming more like C.E.O.'s. ''There is outrage,'' he said.
 ''Is student access to higher education improving or otherwise?'' Mr. Bowen asked. ''Is faculty compensation improving or otherwise? Are health benefits getting better or worse? The answer to all those questions is they're getting worse.'' 
 ''Some presidents make five times what the average full professor makes,'' he said. ''You've got to ask, 'Is that right?' ''
 Sheldon Steinbach, general counsel for the American Council on Education, which represents universities, described Dr. Silber's package as ''the largest compensation package that I've ever seen'' in more than 30 years. Previously, $1.75 million to $2 million ''has been about the tops,'' he said.
 Joseph Mercurio, executive vice president at Boston University, said much of the money had been set aside as it was earned, ''meaning we did not have to go into the '05 budget and pull $6.1 million out.''
 Alan Leventhal, chairman of the university board, acknowledged that the package represented ''a very significant number,'' reflecting ''an extraordinary length of time on a job that was done extremely well, given that the stature of Boston University was raised so significantly during those years.''
 Despite defending the package, both men said the university had instituted broad changes, including term limits for board members, policies covering conflicts of interest and reviews to bring executive pay in line with national norms.
 What is most important, Mr. Leventhal said, ''is that the university has taken steps to make sure that we have the right governance for today looking forward.''
 Mr. Steinbach noted that Dr. Silber, a fiery figure often credited with transforming the university from an unremarkable commuter institution to a reputable research center, had negotiated the terms of his compensation with the board in another era.
 ''The whole ethos of the post-Enron, post-WorldCom era went into effect long after the basic contractual agreement between Dr. Silber and the board was executed,'' he said. 
 He predicted that, given the efforts to improve transparency at the university, donors ''will most likely view this entire incident as part of yesterday's ballgame, and a matter to just move beyond.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Devises Deal to Extend Some Tax Cuts 

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9 

 BODY:
House and Senate Republicans reached agreement Tuesday on a $69 billion bill that would extend President Bush's tax cuts for investors for two more years and temporarily block a big jump in the alternative minimum tax.
 The agreement, which has a good chance of passing both chambers later this week, would lock in one of Mr. Bush's signature tax cuts through 2010 and give Republicans a victory at a time when most of their other efforts have stalled.
But the bill falls far short of Mr. Bush's original goal, which was to make permanent all of his major tax cuts from 2001 and 2003. Nor did Republican leaders work out their differences on a separate measure that would extend scores of other tax cuts that expired at the end of last year. 
 ''We've never had a more difficult melding of both houses' ideas,'' said Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. 
 Since last fall, House and Senate Republicans have been unable to agree on which tax cuts to include in a special ''budget reconciliation'' bill that could be passed in the Senate without needing 60 votes to stop a filibuster.
 But critics said the agreement's tax benefits would overwhelmingly favor the nation's wealthiest taxpayers and fudged the true cost of some measures. Senate Republicans passed a tax-cut bill last fall that prevented an increase in the alternative minimum tax, a parallel tax intended to stop very wealthy people from taking too much advantage of special tax breaks. Partly because it is not adjusted for inflation, it is engulfing millions more families each year.
 Preventing an increase in the alternative minimum tax would cost $34 billion for just one year, so Senate Republicans decided to postpone an extension of the tax cut on stock dividends that would cost about $20 billion over just two years.
 House Republicans did the reverse, passing a bill that extended the tax cuts for investors, leaving the alternative minimum tax in a separate bill that could have been blocked by a filibuster in the Senate.
 Those tax cuts on dividends and capital gains were the heart of Mr. Bush's 2003 tax-cutting package, and Republicans had credited them with spurring a rebound in investment and economic growth in the past three years. They also had enormous support from business groups and Wall Street.
 Democrats and some Senate Republicans opposed extending them this year, arguing that the dividend tax cuts would not expire until 2009 and would primarily benefit the top 10 percent of income-earners. 
 ''These were not wise choices or even fair choices for the American people,'' said Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. 
 The deal agreed upon Tuesday covers the tax cut for investors, the alternative minimum tax and the extension of an expiring tax cut on foreign profits earned by American corporations.
 But lawmakers are still working on a second bill that would extend scores of other popular tax cuts that are expiring. Those include a costly tax credit for research and development, tax deductions for college tuition payments and tax incentives for low-income families.
 Mr. Thomas and other top Republicans refused to say what provisions would be in the second tax-cutting bill. Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, had insisted that he would not approve any agreement on the main tax-cut extensions until he had agreement on the second bill. 
 But Mr. Grassley relented on Tuesday, apparently under pressure from Senate Republican leaders who were desperate to pass the main tax bill without further delay.
 ''The message is clear, the tax cuts have worked,'' said Treasury Secretary John W. Snow in a speech to homebuilders shortly before the agreement was announced. ''We want to make sure that tax rates remain low on equity capital.''
 Opponents of the tax cut for investors, which reduced the rate on dividends and capital gains to 15 percent, said the new tax bill would overwhelmingly benefit the very wealthiest taxpayers. 
 The Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, recently estimated that the top 10 percent of income-earners would get 81.8 percent of the benefit from lower taxes on investment profits and 73 percent of the benefit from freezing the alternative minimum tax.
 The agreement also has several provisions that seem to offset the cost of tax cuts but really may not. One ''revenue-raising'' provision, for example, allows high-income people to convert traditional Individual Retirement Accounts to Roth-style accounts in which all future investment income is tax free. The provision raises money in the first few years because people have to pay taxes when they take money out of their older I.R.A.'s, but over the long term the government loses billions of dollars because the new accounts are tax free.
 Most Democrats strongly support the provisions on the alternative minimum tax, which has a disproportionately large impact on many Democratic-leaning, high-income states on the East and West Coasts. They also support many of the tax cuts that are likely to be extended in the second bill, and Republicans are calculating that Democrats will not want to sacrifice the tax cuts they support to stop the ones they oppose.

HEADLINE: An Economy With Safety Features, Sort of Like a Volvo

BYLINE: By Alan Cowell

DATELINE: NYNASHAMN, Sweden 

 BODY:
When people talk of ''the Nordic model'' as Europe's panacea they may consider places like this ferry port in southern Sweden, where the Baltic wind lofts the sigh of seagulls over a stilled and silent Ericsson plant.
 The factory closed last year after years of job cuts as the telecommunications company reduced its global work force of 107,000 to about 63,000. But for people like Marie-Louise Nordstrom, 53, who lost her position as a purchaser after 35 years in the same factory, the change has been relatively painless. 
Under a deal between bosses and labor unions, she and some of the 450 other workers who switched off the lights in December will remain on full pay for 12 months, she said. Then she will qualify for unemployment benefits worth 80 percent of her salary. In the meantime, a private company sponsored by Swedish employers is helping her retrain and recover from the shock of losing her job. ''I have learned to be self-confident,'' she said. ''I am not worthless.'' 
 At a time when major nations in Continental Europe -- France and Italy in particular -- are questing in vain for release from the economic doldrums, Mrs. Nordstrom's confidence does not seem misplaced. 
 The Swedish economy is set to grow by 3.7 percent this year -- almost twice the rate forecast even for Germany, the only one of the big Continental European economies showing signs of confidence. Unemployment, though higher than the Social Democratic government admits, is still lower than the nearly double-digit joblessness of France or Germany. 
 Yet, defying conservative American beliefs, the economy prospers -- even though taxes here remain high and big government administers cradle-to-grave social programs that absorb more than half of the national output.
 It is called the Nordic model. The question some Europeans are asking is: Would it work farther south, in Germany or France, or even Italy?
 The roots of Sweden's current prosperity lie in the early 1990's when the Scandinavian nations were buffeted by recessions that sent unemployment and budget deficits soaring.
 In response, businesses from telecommunications to airlines to banking were deregulated and sold on the open market. State spending was capped, and the budget moved to surplus. Labor laws, which still protect full-time workers, were modified to permit temporary work. The state pension system was overhauled, adding private accounts and encouraging workers to postpone retirement in return for higher pensions. 
 Technology and service companies flourished even as manufacturing jobs were lost. Labor unions, said Ingemar Goransson, a blue-collar union negotiator, saw their mission as ''not trying to save jobs.'' 
 ''Our job is to create a society where people are protected and suffer as little as possible and get new chances in society with education and training,'' Mr. Goransson said. ''There's a social charter, a social contract. There's a general peace contract in Sweden. There's a general culture of problem-solving instead of fighting.''
 Indeed, as in purchasing their homegrown Volvos, Swedes are prepared to pay top dollar for the safety features: income taxes peak at 55 percent. Traditionally, too, Sweden and other Scandinavian lands have drawn economic benefit from policies that bring women into the work force far more than in some other European countries. 
 But there was another element that distinguished them from Continental Europe, where globalization is seen as little more than code for the imposition of American slash-and-burn capitalism and the destruction of the welfare state.
 ''I think the fundamental aspect of the Scandinavian model is trust'' among the unions, the government and the people, said Joakim Palme, a leading expert on Nordic welfare systems and the son of the murdered prime minister, Olof Palme. While many in France or Germany fear globalization, he said, ''the Scandinavian experience has been to be positive to this change, because it is producing more wealth in the end.'' 
 That might be precisely why the Nordic model will not easily take root elsewhere in Europe, as recent street demonstrations against a new labor law showed in France. The question, too, is whether the Nordic model itself can survive at a time when the region, like the rest of Europe, is challenged by immigration, reshaping the social fabric that once hastened reform. 
 ''Sweden is a small country,'' Mr. Goransson said. ''Up to 10 years ago it was very homogeneous as a country. Everything was very alike. Up until then all Swedes looked the same; almost thought the same. Because we are all so equal, we can share the pain of the problems.''
 These days, though, an estimated 13 percent of Sweden's nine million people were born outside the country, and unemployment among immigrants is significantly higher than among native Swedes. ''As Sweden gets more divided, it's more difficult to keep this idea of sharing the pain,'' Mr. Goransson said.
 A report last year by the European Policy Center, a research institute in Brussels, said Scandinavia's ''negative approach towards immigration'' might ''represent the biggest threat to the long-term survival'' of the Nordic model, since Scandinavian economies need ''a constant flux of foreign talent and workers in general.''
 Of course, the Nordic model has its quirks. 
 Sweden's official unemployment rate of 4.8 percent, many economists say, is distorted by the omission of people in government-financed retraining programs. The labor unions calculate the real figure at closer to 8 percent. According to some estimates, Swedes take an average of 17 weeks a year off from work on sick, disability or parental leave, further twisting the statistics. Absenteeism is the highest in the developed world.
 And in this debate, size, geography and history do matter. Sweden has been free of war for 200 years. Norway, with 4.6 million people, is rich in oil but fiscally cautious. The economy in Finland, with some 5.2 million people, revolves around the fortunes of the cellphone giant Nokia. 
 Also, the Nordic countries tend toward the individualism of seafaring lands whose past spanned trade and conquest. Only Finland, the lone republic among the Scandinavian monarchies, joined the euro common currency, and Norway has rejected membership in the European Union altogether. 
 Compared with some other parts of Europe, there is still some optimism here -- at least for people like Mrs. Nordstrom. ''I see possibilities, not problems,'' she said as she surveyed the plant where she worked for 35 years. ''I'm glad I have a future.''

HEADLINE: Bush Aides Struggling With Yuan

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8 

 BODY:
After nearly three years of pushing China to let its currency float more freely, with only modest results, the Bush administration still appears reluctant to accuse China of manipulating its exchange rate.
 On Wednesday, the Treasury Department plans to release its latest assessment of Chinese foreign exchange practices and declare whether or not they represent a form of manipulation aimed at artificially increasing Chinese exports.
A decision to officially brand China a manipulator would require the administration to formally open negotiations with the government in Beijing, but its main effect would be as a signal to currency markets that the United States wants the dollar to decline in value. 
 American manufacturers and many members of Congress have complained for years that China has kept its currency, the yuan, at an artificially low exchange rate to the dollar as a way of selling its exports at cheap prices. 
 Treasury Secretary John W. Snow has resisted demands to threaten Beijing, arguing that Chinese leaders are making ''progress'' toward a more flexible exchange rate and a more open financial system.
 This week, a Treasury official again emphasized China's steps toward openness. 
 ''If you look at what China is doing in exercising their commitment on putting in place a foreign-exchange regime that has greater flexibility,'' Mr. Snow's principal spokesman, Tony Fratto, told reporters on Monday, ''you see some evidence that they're doing that.'' 
 But changes in the yuan's value have been relatively minor. Chinese leaders let the yuan climb about 2 percent against the dollar last July, and another similarly small amount more recently. 
 When President Hu Jintao visited President Bush in Washington last month, top Chinese officials re-emphasized a need for ''stability'' and offered no hint of when they might let the yuan move more freely.
 C. Fred Bergsten, president of the Institute for International Economics, warned that Mr. Snow would lose credibility and cede control over the issue to members of Congress who support punitive measures against China.
 ''If they don't label the Chinese,'' Mr. Bergsten said, ''they lose complete control of the issue to Congress, at which point you give Congress almost a free license to do what it wants.'' 
 Supporters of calling China a currency manipulator contend that it would bring significant new pressure on the country's leaders to stop a practice that is aggravating global imbalances and unfairly undermining some American manufacturers by making it much harder for them to compete against Chinese goods.
 The United States' trade deficit with China ballooned to $202 billion in 2005, an imbalance that might ordinarily have pushed up the value of the yuan in relation to the dollar. China has prevented the yuan from rising by buying hundreds of billions in dollar-denominated reserves.
 Opponents of name-calling say that labeling Beijing a currency manipulator would probably harden Chinese resistance. 
 ''What worries me is that it sets up a situation where any concession by China is seen as a gain for the United States,'' said Brad Setser, an international economist at Roubini Global Economics, a consulting firm in New York, ''and leads to headlines saying that China caved under U.S. pressure.'' 
 But the Bush administration risks looking as if it has capitulated to Chinese obstinacy without getting much in return. Treasury officials contend that China has indeed moved toward modernization of its financial system, and they say that the United States' broader interest is in opening the Chinese market to American financial services.
 Administration officials refused to predict what they will say on Wednesday, and it is possible that Mr. Snow will still decide to label China a manipulator.
 But administration officials think they have other alternatives for stepping up pressure. Last month, the International Monetary Fund agreed to take a more active role in resolving disputes about foreign exchange practices. In the past, the fund has held discussions with individual countries that seemed to be manipulating their currencies. 
 Under the new approach, the I.M.F. would try to unravel disputes by bringing together officials from many different countries and looking for a coordinated set of actions.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Europe Plan New Offer To Entice Iran Away From Arms

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 9 

 BODY:
The United States and its European negotiating partners are preparing to repackage economic incentives aimed at inducing Iran to cooperate in eliminating its suspected nuclear weapons program, and to add some ''new ideas'' for Iran to consider, American and European officials said Tuesday. 
 A senior State Department official said the ''new ideas'' would not substantially change the package of economic incentives offered to Iran last August, when the Europeans told the Iranians they could achieve a full political and economic relationship with the West if Iran ended its nuclear activities, which are suspected to be part of a weapons program.
He said that, contrary to some reports circulating Tuesday, the new package would not include security guarantees for Iran and would not allow it to continue enriching uranium, an activity that Iran defends as part of a nuclear energy program but that the United States views as a cover for a weapons program.
 Disclosure of the new initiative on incentives came from European diplomats on Tuesday, following a full evening of discussions with American officials on Monday. Envoys from Russia and China also attended that session.
 American officials say the evening discussions failed to break an impasse over the American, British and French drive for a United Nations Security Council resolution that would make it mandatory for Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment activities, stop construction of a heavy-water nuclear reactor and resume talks with the West.
 Russia and China oppose such a resolution as too threatening and are likely to provoke a counterreaction, causing Iran to abandon all cooperation with international nuclear inspections.
 European diplomats said one emphasis of the dinner on Monday, which was led by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, was a new effort to persuade Iran that the West was offering ''carrots'' as well as ''sticks'' to get it to change course.
 ''My point of view is that Iran must be faced with a choice,'' Philippe Douste-Blazy, the French foreign minister, said in an interview. ''If Iran is closed to our proposals, we are prepared to discuss deterrent measures. But it seems stupid for us not to stretch out our hand.''
 Ms. Rice said lower-level diplomats would try to iron out differences on a Council resolution on Iran next week in London and possibly in further meetings after that. Separate discussions on presenting a package of incentives to Iran would also occur at that time.
 The original incentives offered to Iran by the Europeans entailed restoration of economic and technical assistance for Iran's development. As part of that package, the United States consented to let discussions start on Iran's joining the World Trade Organization and receiving aircraft spare parts.

HEADLINE: POLL GIVES BUSH WORST MARKS YET ON MAJOR ISSUES

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and MEGAN THEE; Marjorie Connelly and Marina Stefan contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Americans have a bleaker view of the country's direction than at any time in more than two decades, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll. Sharp disapproval of President Bush's handling of gasoline prices has combined with intensified unhappiness about Iraq to create a grim political environment for the White House and Congressional Republicans.
 Mr. Bush's approval ratings for his management of foreign policy, Iraq and the economy have fallen to the lowest levels of his presidency. He drew poor marks on the issues that have been at the top of the national agenda in recent months, in particular immigration and gasoline prices.
Just 13 percent approved of Mr. Bush's handling of rising gasoline prices. About a quarter said they approved of his handling of immigration, as Congressional Republicans try to come up with a compromise for handling the influx of illegal immigrants into the country. 
 The poll showed a further decline in support for the Iraq war, the issue that has most eaten into Mr. Bush's public support. The percentage of respondents who said going to war in Iraq was the correct decision slipped to a new low of 39 percent, down from 47 percent in January. Two-thirds said they had little or no confidence that Mr. Bush could successfully end the war.
 The poll comes six months before Election Day and well before Labor Day, when Congressional campaigns will be fully engaged. Mr. Bush has shaken up his staff in an effort to improve his political fortunes, and White House aides said they were confident that events in Iraq were improving and that the political effects of high gasoline prices could fade by the election.
 Nevertheless, the Times/CBS News poll contained few if any bright notes for Mr. Bush or Congress.
 Mr. Bush's political strength continues to dissipate. About two-thirds of poll respondents said he did not share their priorities, up from just over half right before his re-election in 2004. About two-thirds said the country was in worse shape than it was when he became president six years ago. Forty-two percent of respondents said they considered Mr. Bush a strong leader, a drop of 11 points since January.
 Mr. Bush's overall job approval rating hit another new low, 31 percent, tying the low point of his father in July 1992, four months before the elder Mr. Bush lost his bid for a second term to Bill Clinton. That is the third lowest approval rating of any president in 50 years; only Richard M. Nixon and Jimmy Carter were viewed less favorably.
 Mr. Bush is even losing support from what has been his base: 51 percent of conservatives and 69 percent of Republicans approve of the way Mr. Bush is handling his job. In both cases, those figures are a substantial drop in support from four months ago.
 ''We should have stayed out of Iraq until we knew more about it,'' Bernice Davis, a Republican from Lamar, Mo., who said she now disapproved of Mr. Bush's performance, said in a follow-up interview on Tuesday. ''The economy is going to pot. Gas prices are escalating. I just voted for Bush because he's a Republican, even though I disapproved of the war. If I could go back, I would not vote for him.''
 Although the composition of Congressional districts will make it hard for the Democrats to recapture control of Congress in the fall, the poll suggested that the trend was moving in their direction. Just 23 percent said they approved of the job Congress was doing, down from 29 percent in January. That is about the same level of support for Congress as in the fall of 1994, when Republicans seized control of the House.
 Americans said Democrats would do a better job dealing with Iraq, gasoline prices, immigration, taxes, prescription drug prices and civil liberties.
 Fifty percent said Democrats came closer than Republicans to sharing their moral values, compared with 37 percent who said Republicans shared their values. A majority said Republican members of Congress were more likely to be financially corrupt than Democratic members of Congress, suggesting that Democrats may be making headway in their efforts to portray Republicans as having created a ''culture of corruption'' in Washington.
 By better than two to one, Democrats were seen as having more new ideas than Republicans. And half of respondents, the highest number yet, said it was better when different parties controlled the two branches of Congress, reflecting one of the major arguments being laid out by Congressional Democrats in their bid to win back the House or the Senate.
 Americans said that Republicans would be better at maintaining a stronger military than Democrats. But the Republicans had only a slight edge on combating terrorism, an issue that has helped account for the party's political dominance since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
 The nationwide telephone poll, of 1,241 adults, was conducted from May 4 to May 8. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
 Seventy percent of respondents said the country was heading in the wrong direction, compared with 23 percent who said they approved of the direction in which the country was heading. Those findings are not significantly different from the responses to a CBS News poll last week and suggest that Americans are more pessimistic about the country's direction than at any other time in the 23 years that The Times and CBS News have asked the question.
 Immigration is another issue undercutting Republicans and Mr. Bush. As Republicans battle over how to respond to illegal immigration, the poll found considerable opposition to the strict measures being pressed by conservative Republicans in the House. 
 About 60 percent of respondents said they favored the plan proposed by some Republicans in the Senate that would permit illegal immigrants who had worked in the United States for at least two years to keep their jobs and apply for citizenship. Just 35 percent endorsed the view of some conservatives that illegal immigrants should be deported. Two-thirds opposed building a 700-mile fence along the United States-Mexican border. 
 The two biggest problems for Mr. Bush and Republicans are gasoline prices and Iraq. By 57 percent to 11 percent, respondents said they trusted Democrats more than Republicans to find a way to curb gasoline prices.
 Nearly two-thirds of respondents said the increase in gasoline prices was not beyond the control of a president, but 89 percent said this administration did not have a plan to deal with the problem.
 More than two-thirds said the war in Iraq was to blame for at least some of the increase in gasoline prices. Seventy-one percent said they believed that oil companies were profiting from higher prices, and a majority said oil companies were much closer to the Republican Party than to the Democratic Party.
 ''Bush could put in some kind of regulation to control the profits of the oil companies,'' said Jane North, 43, a Republican from Reisterstown, Md., who said she recently changed her registration to Democrat. ''He comes from the oil business, so he certainly knows how it works. I think Bush will just run out his term and not do anything to control gas prices.''
 On Iraq, two-thirds of poll respondents said they disapproved of how the president had handled the war. Fifty-six percent said going to war in the first place was a mistake, up from 50 percent in January. And 60 percent said things were going ''somewhat or very badly'' in the drive to stabilize the country. Sixty-three percent disapproved of Mr. Bush's handling of foreign policy in general.
 Still, 55 percent said they believed the effort in Iraq was somewhat or very likelyto succeed.
 ''We have enough problems here at home without worrying about Iraq,'' said Bill Trego, 64, a Republican from Waymart, Pa. 
 ''I believed him at first, in the beginning,'' Mr. Trego said of Mr. Bush, ''that there were weapons of mass destruction and if that was a fact, it was probably not a bad move to go in there. But they didn't find anything. When they couldn't prove it, I realized it was just a barefaced lie.''
 The problems plaguing the Republicans have clearly helped the Democrats: 55 percent said they now had a favorable view of the Democratic Party, compared with 37 percent with an unfavorable view. By contrast, 57 percent had an unfavorable view of Republicans, compared with 37 percent who had a favorable view.
 The political situation has not helped some of the more prominent members of the Democratic Party. Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, who was Mr. Bush's opponent in 2004, had a lower approval rating than Mr. Bush: 26 percent, down from 40 percent in a poll conducted right after the election. 
 And just 28 percent said they had a favorable view of Al Gore, one of Mr. Bush's more vocal critics.

How the Poll Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times/CBS News poll is based on telephone interviews conducted May 4 through May 8 with 1,241 adults throughout the United States. For purposes of analysis, respondents age 65 and older were oversampled and then weighted back to their proper proportion of all adults.
 The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges nationwide.
 Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers alike. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
 The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variation in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, marital status, age and education.
 In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, overall results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
 For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger. For instance, for the 500 respondents age 65 and older, it is plus or minus four points.
 In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: The Post-Post-Cold War

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: BUDAPEST 

 BODY:
Being in Eastern Europe in the wake of Dick Cheney's warning to Russia against using its oil and gas exports as ''tools for intimidation and blackmail'' has been revealing. The Financial Times noted that some Russian media presented Mr. Cheney's remarks as echoing Winston Churchill's 1946 speech in Fulton, Mo., warning that an ''Iron Curtain'' was descending on Europe.
 I actually don't think we're going back to the cold war. I think we're going forward. We're leaving the world we've been in -- the post-cold-war world -- and entering the post-post-cold-war world. Americans won't like the post-post-cold-war world, unless they get serious about energy. 
The cold-war world was a bipolar world, stabilized by a nuclear balance between two superpowers. The post-cold-war world was, for Americans, a unipolar belle epoque, in which an American Hyperpower, as the French dubbed it, seemed to dominate the global scene, economically and strategically -- a scene characterized by a steady expansion of free markets and freely elected governments.
 The post-post-cold war is a multipolar world, where U.S. power is being checked from every corner. China is rising as a power, thanks to hard work and high savings. Beyond China, though, other powers are rising thanks only to soaring oil prices -- powers that were on the decline in the post-cold war. 
 These are: Vladimir Putin's Russia, which is countering the U.S. on a variety of fronts; Hugo Chavez's Venezuela, which is Castro's Cuba on steroids in the post-post-cold-war world, leading a new wave of nationalizations and anti-Americanism in Latin America; and, of course, Iran -- using its oil windfall to go nuclear. Yes, $70-a-barrel oil is making this post-post-cold-war world a multipolar world. 
 ''It's the 'axis of oil,' '' says Michael Mandelbaum, author of ''The Case for Goliath.'' ''It is more lasting and more important than terrorism -- and we don't have any policy for it.''
 Not only are others becoming more assertive: the U.S. has become less intimidating. With Americans bleeding in Iraq, with George Bush hugely unpopular in Europe and with the U.S. two-party system so warped it can't even respond to a crisis like energy, America is not as feared as it was. 
 ''In 2002 and 2003 everyone was talking about the American 'Hyperpower,' '' said Eric Frey, editor of the Austrian daily Der Standard. ''No one these days is talking about overwhelming American power, and that has even added to the anti-Americanism. Because before you had resentment and respect, and now you have resentment and scorn.''
 At the same time, the re-emergence of Russia has gotten the attention of Eastern Europe. Hungary gets more than half of its natural gas from Russia. Lately, some Hungarians have started to recall an old cold-war joke: After the Hungarian soccer team beat the Soviet team, the Kremlin sent Hungary's leaders a brief telegram that read: ''Congratulations on your victory. Stop. Oil stop. Gas stop.''
 ''If you had asked me five years ago, I would have told you the whole story is finished -- no more Russian bear,'' said Pal Reti, editor of HVG, the Hungarian economic magazine. ''They have so many problems themselves they would not have time to care about others' problems. But I've found that they have another set of priorities and they now have the muscle'' to act on them. Yes, Russia no longer has much of an army or any ideology, but it still has a lot of brutish instincts, and now it has the oil money to push them.
 In the post-cold-war world, European integration and economic reform seemed irreversible and certain to make Europe into a world democratic power. But in the post-post-cold war, Europe can't unite on anything -- even on an energy policy -- so it is being pushed around by Russia. 
 ''I am very pessimistic about Western Europe -- and that is new,'' remarked Lajos Bokros, a professor of economics at the Central European University in Budapest. Too many Western Europeans ''are not competitive enough'' and ''do not want to implement the reforms.'' Unless Europe chooses the high-growth Irish model, as opposed to the French, Italian and German models, Mr. Bokros added, ''the whole European region will decline further and become insignificant and irrelevant for this global game.''
 For all these reasons, I don't miss the cold war, but I do miss the post-cold war. Because this post-post-cold-war world seems infinitely more messy, difficult to manage and full of way too many bad guys getting rich, not by building decent societies, but by simply drilling oil wells.

HEADLINE: Spy vs. Spy 

BYLINE: By Thomas Powers. 
Thomas Powers is the author, most recently, of ''Intelligence Wars: American Secret History From Hitler to Al Qaeda.''

DATELINE: SOUTH ROYALTON, Vt. 

 BODY:
THE resignation of Porter Goss after 18 months of trying to run the Central Intelligence Agency and the nomination of Gen. Michael Hayden to take his place make unmistakable something that actually occurred a year ago: the C.I.A., as it existed for 50 years, is gone.
 Once the premier American intelligence organization, the agency has now been demoted to a combination action arm and support service for the rapidly growing Office of the Director of National Intelligence, headed by John Negroponte.
 The C.I.A. used to coordinate, write and sign all ''finished national intelligence'' -- no longer. The C.I.A.'s director used to lead the meetings of the heads of the numerous organizations that make up the ''intelligence community'' -- no longer. The C.I.A. used to have final say on many aspects of intelligence ''tasking'' -- no longer. Last to go was the role that made the agency pre-eminent, responsibility for briefing the president. Now that job belongs to Mr. Negroponte, with his $1 billion budget and staff of 1,500. 
 What finally humbled and gutted the C.I.A. after decades of Washington bureaucratic infighting was a loss of support where it counted most: the refusal of the Bush White House to accept responsibility for the two great ''intelligence failures'' that prompted Congress to reorganize our services. 
 The first failure laid at the feet of the agency was the inability to prevent the surprise attacks of 9/11. In fact, the C.I.A. (and others) warned the White House often during the first eight months of 2001 that an attack was coming and where it was coming from, but the Bush administration did nothing. For reasons of broad national psychology, the White House's failure to stir itself was simultaneously overlooked and forgiven by the public, while the C.I.A. (and others) got held to strict account for failing to predict the day and the hour. 
 The second failure was the claim -- ''with high confidence'' -- in a National Intelligence Estimate sent by the C.I.A. to Congress in October 2002 that Iraq was making vigorous progress on programs for weapons of mass destruction. But this finding was in effect dragged out of the agency by the White House and the Pentagon. Agency analysts working on the issue assumed that Saddam Hussein was up to something, but they knew their evidence was thin and ambiguous; many of their superiors knew about contrary evidence but suppressed it. 
 Everybody at the C.I.A. -- from George Tenet, then the director, down -- knew the agency could not tell United Nations weapons inspectors where to find anything over a period of months. The C.I.A. knew it didn't know what sort of weapons program Iraq really had, and absent White House pressure the analysts would have written an intelligence estimate reflecting their uncertainties. (It is worth noting that the Senate Intelligence Committee, despite a promise to do so, has been conspicuously reluctant to examine the source of the pressure for the drumbeat of alarming weapons intelligence, or how the White House made use of it.)
 President Bush might have accepted responsibility for these two failures. He might have followed the example of President John F. Kennedy, who took the blame for the disastrous C.I.A. attempt to put a rebel army ashore in Cuba in 1961. Instead, the administration hid the existence of the pre-9/11 warnings for as long as possible and continued to insist for many months after the Iraq war that Saddam Hussein's illegal weapons might still turn up, and it has blocked any official investigation of its role in exaggerating the slender intelligence that existed.
 Blaming the C.I.A. for these failures led to Porter Goss being sent to Langley. First on his to-do list was to put an end to what White House perceived as a lack of loyalty to administration policy. This supposed treachery took two forms: leaks of pre-Iraq war intelligence findings that predicted problems the White House is to this day still trying to minimize; and pessimistic reports from the field that contradicted rosy announcements of progress from the Pentagon. 
 Mr. Goss, however, ran into two major obstacles: the agency's balkiness at being asked to fix something (intelligence collection and analysis) that wasn't really broken; and the demoralization of its ranks from playing second violin to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Historically the C.I.A. had a customer base of one -- the president. When its primacy in reporting to the White House was taken away, the agency was being told in effect that henceforth it would be talking to itself.
 In addition, on a purely human level, it is apparent that Mr. Goss rubbed practically everybody at the C.I.A. the wrong way. Wholesale resignations bled the agency of experience and talent, until the White House -- and Mr. Negroponte -- apparently concluded it was time for Mr. Goss to go, too.
 The tasks faced by the next director of the C.I.A. will be those left unfinished by Mr. Goss -- renewing the agency's pride and elan despite its narrowed role and lowered status; buoying the morale of intelligence analysts who know policy-makers are going to be reading paper from Mr. Negroponte's office now; and reviving the ability of the agency's Directorate of Operations to recruit human spies, infiltrate hostile organizations and mount clandestine operations. 
 At the same time, the C.I.A.'s next chief will have to protect the agency's flanks from determined turf-raiding by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, who has been building the Pentagon's capacity for recruiting human spies and running covert operations, which in his opinion do not require the same kind of oversight mandated by law for C.I.A. activities. 
 It may be that the White House chose Michael Hayden, an Air Force general now working as Mr. Negroponte's deputy who was chief of the National Security Agency for seven years, because they hope his rank will strengthen him in turf battles with the military. In other ways, however, General Hayden seems an odd choice, bound to meet trouble in the confirmation process. 
 His biggest problem may be the fact he created and helped to hide from scrutiny a large-scale N.S.A. eavesdropping program aimed at Americans, still illegal in the eyes of many. Or it may be that senators will brush that aside and object instead to his lack of experience in running a classic spy service, the sort the C.I.A. is intended to be -- again. 
 RECRUITING spies is not best achieved through a chief-executive mentality focused on economy and productivity; running covert operations requires sensitive human judgment to keep out of trouble. If intelligence experience and ''feel'' were the most important qualities to look for in the next director, General Hayden would be at the bottom of the list. As his name goes to the Senate the road seems to be largely uphill; even many Republicans have objected to giving the job to a military officer, or to this officer in particular.
 But somebody is going to get the job, and he won't get anywhere trying to ''turn the agency around,'' if by that we mean make it what it once was -- the premier American intelligence organization. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has that job now. Probably the best the next C.I.A. director can hope to do is get everybody back to work, while reminding the agency staff that there is honor in having fallen on your sword, and next time the national intelligence director will have to take the blame.

HEADLINE: Barely Staying Afloat

 BODY:
President Bush's advisers say that the administration should receive more credit for the state of the economy, which, over all, is growing at a strong clip. But voters don't base their opinions on aggregate statistics. They react to their own paychecks and benefits, weighed against their fixed costs, like housing, health care and gasoline. For all but the wealthiest Americans, the latter are rapidly outpacing the former. 
 In a time of plenty, more American workers are in danger of slipping into outright poverty. As Erik Eckholm reported this week in The Times, about 37 million Americans lived below the poverty line in 2004: $19,157 a year for a family of four. An additional 54 million lived between the poverty line and double the poverty line: $38,314 for a family of that size. They are the ''near poor,'' and they generally receive little attention. But they are often one injury or layoff away from slipping into poverty themselves.
If the ''near poor'' feel insecure, they have good reason to. A group of academics found that during the 1980's, 13 percent of Americans in their 40's spent a year or more below the poverty line. In the 1990's, that percentage nearly tripled, reaching 36 percent. While workers once believed that pensions would provide for them in their old age, now they fret over underfunded 401(k) accounts. Houses are supposed to provide stability, but those with adjustable-rate mortgages are watching their payments rise, and some fear losing their homes. 
 The issue here is not handouts; it's about buffering against the shocks inherent in a fast-paced global economy. Perhaps one of the reasons President Bush is generally regarded as such a poor economic steward is that his administration has done little to make the most vulnerable members of the working class believe that any of the good news is directed at them.

HEADLINE: Microsoft and Google Grapple for Supremacy as Stakes Escalate

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The Microsoft-Google rivalry is shaping up as a titanic corporate clash for the ages.
 It may not turn out that way. Markets and corporate fortunes routinely defy prediction. But it sure looks as if the two companies are on a collision course, as the realms of desktop computing and Internet services and software overlap more and more.
Microsoft, of course, is the reigning powerhouse of computing and Google is the muscular Internet challenger. On each side, the battalions are arrayed: executives, engineers, marketers, lawyers and lobbyists. The spending and competition are escalating daily. For each, it seems, the other passes what Andrew S. Grove, a founder and former chairman of Intel, calls the ''silver bullet test'' of strategic competition. ''If you had one bullet, who would you shoot with it?''
 How the Microsoft-Google confrontation plays out could shape the future of competition in computing and how people use information technology. 
 Do the pitched corporate battles of the past shed any light on how this one might turn out? 
 Business historians and management experts say the experience in two of the defining industries of the 20th century, mass-market retailing and automobiles, may well be instructive. The winners certainly scored higher in the generic virtues of business management: innovation, execution and leadership. 
 But perhaps even more significant, those who came out on top, judging from history, had two more specific attributes. They were the companies, according to business historians, that proved able to adapt to change instead of being prisoners of past success. And in their glory days, these corporate champions were magnets for the best and brightest people. 
 ''One area where Microsoft and Google are really competing head-to-head now is in the war for talent,'' said Richard S. Tedlow, a historian and professor at the Harvard Business School. ''Historically, the company that won the war for talent, won the war.''
 Mr. Tedlow points to Montgomery Ward as a company that lost talented managers to its rival Sears, and then lost its way. The crucial defection, Mr. Tedlow said, was Robert E. Wood, a former Army general who joined Montgomery Ward in 1919 as a general merchandise manager. 
 Even in the Army, Mr. Wood was a close reader of the Statistical Abstract of the United States, the Census Bureau's annual tracking of social and economic conditions. Mr. Wood became convinced that America was at the beginning of a huge population shift from rural regions to urban areas. 
 That meant, he understood, that the mail-order giants like Montgomery Ward and Sears needed to move from being catalog retailers serving a dispersed market to department store merchants with stores in city and suburban population centers.
 Sears, as a company, grasped that fundamental change in the marketplace in a way that initially Montgomery Ward did not, Mr. Tedlow said. 
 In 1924, Mr. Wood left Montgomery Ward to join Sears, and he later recruited others. In 1945, Mr. Wood, then the chairman of Sears, made another smart call on economic trends. The postwar years, he decided, would bring a long expansion, as pent-up consumer demand from the war years was unleashed.
 So Sears embarked on a national store-building binge. His counterpart at Montgomery Ward, Sewell Avery, made the opposite bet, keeping money in the bank to prepare the company for a postwar depression, which he was convinced was around the corner.
 Over the next several years, sales at Sears doubled, while Montgomery Ward's shrank 10 percent. ''Losing Robert Wood was catastrophic to Ward,'' Mr. Tedlow observed.
 In its recruiting face-offs against Google, Microsoft insists that it fares quite well over all. But there have been some high-profile defections of leading engineers, who said they preferred Google's technological direction and corporate culture.
 The most prominent was Kai-Fu Lee, a stellar computer scientist and manager. Mr. Lee not only established Microsoft's research labs in China, but he is also an expert in areas like natural language and speech-recognition technologies -- important ingredients to Internet search today and to the way people will interact with computers in the future.
 Last year, when Mr. Lee left Microsoft, it sued Google and Mr. Lee. Microsoft claimed, under a Washington state law, that Mr. Lee violated a noncompete clause in his employment contract and misused inside information in going to work for Google. The suit was settled last December. 
 ''What does it say about a company when it sues when someone leaves?'' Mr. Tedlow asked. ''It makes Microsoft sound like a prison.'' 
 In business, forever tends to last about five years, a decade or two at most. So Sears prospered for a time and celebrated its success by building the Sears Tower in Chicago in the 1970's. Yet even from a height of 110 stories, Sears failed to see Wal-Mart coming. Wal-Mart brought the next revolution in retailing with its shrewd use of computer technology to track buying trends and orchestrate suppliers to become a hyper-efficient, low-cost merchant.
 The auto industry presents a sobering history of past-success syndrome. The Model T, introduced by Henry Ford in 1908, famously made the automobile affordable, helped along by his pioneering assembly-line production, which started in 1913. Ford's laserlike focus on efficiency drove the cost of a Model T from $850 when it was introduced down to $275 by the early 1920's.
 But cost and efficiency was all he focused on. The design was not updated, the color selection remained black and only black. Eventually, the single-mindedness caught up with the company. In 1925, the Ford share of the American market had fallen to 45 percent, from 57 percent two years earlier. By then, Alfred P. Sloan Jr., the managerial maestro of Detroit, was president of General Motors and its sales were surging.
 ''Henry Ford was so in love with his brilliant idea that he refused to change,'' said John Steele Gordon, a historian and author of ''The Business of America'' (Walker, 2001).
 General Motors was well on its way to becoming the world's largest carmaker. Yet as early as the 1950's, the Japanese challenge to Detroit's auto supremacy was quietly getting under way. The architect of the Japanese ascent was a production engineer, Taiichi Ohno, who worked at Toyota. In 1950, Toyota manufactured 13,000 cars, barely a day's production for G.M. 
 Mr. Ohno had to devise an efficient way to manufacture a variety of cars in small production runs. He turned that adversity into an advantage, using rapid tooling changes, constant quality improvements and just-in-time parts delivery to steadily improve the cars.
 Once again, the corporate giant was complacent, and late to see a fundamental shift in its industry.
 ''G.M. did not take Toyota and the Japanese seriously until the 1980's,'' said Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Sloan School of Management of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and author of ''The Japanese Automobile Industry'' (Harvard University Press, 1986). ''By then it was really too late.''
 History, then, suggests that past success is often an anchor holding a company back, and that Microsoft is at risk from the Google challenge. ''The wind is really behind Google, and Microsoft's main tool for navigating the future is the rear view mirror,'' said Paul Saffo, a director of the Institute for the Future, a forecasting consultancy in Silicon Valley.
 Microsoft bristles at being cast as a laggard. In a meeting last week with online advertisers and reporters, Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman, portrayed his company as a force for healthy competition in Internet search. ''We will keep them honest,'' Mr. Gates said of Google. And he vowed to catch up. ''I think this is a rare case where we are being underestimated,'' he said. Microsoft certainly has plenty of money to finance any competitive foray, with $35 billion in cash, while Google has about $8 billion. 
 Indeed, the incumbent-challenger narrative -- which portrays the incumbent as an endangered species -- may not apply this time. Microsoft has adapted nimbly to big challenges before.
 Apple introduced point-and-click graphical computing with the Macintosh in 1984, but Microsoft caught up and became dominant on the desktop with Windows.
 In the mid-1990's, Netscape Communications posed a threat because the Internet browser might undermine the importance of Windows. Microsoft came up with its own browser and rebuffed that challenge, partly with tactics that violated antitrust laws, a federal appeals court ruled. 
 ''Microsoft has responded every time in the past,'' said Mr. Cusumano, who is also the author of two books on Microsoft.
 Now comes Google. It is offering or developing as free Web-based services e-mail, word processing and other programs that could replace Microsoft desktop programs and eat into Microsoft's lucrative software business. But that is by no means certain. 
 Google is cagey about its strategy. When Netscape was flying high, some of its executives talked of making Microsoft irrelevant -- a strategic blunder, according to Silicon Valley lore. 
 Google's chief executive, Eric E. Schmidt, is a veteran of past battles with Microsoft, and he has no intention of making the same misstep. He speaks mainly of Google's limitless potential and ambitions, embellished by intriguing remarks like the one recently that Google is ''building the systems and infrastructure of a global $100 billion company,'' many times its current yearly revenue. Some clues about Google's plans could emerge today, when its executives hold an annual media day at its Silicon Valley headquarters. Google now makes virtually all its money by selling advertisements linked to its enormously popular Internet search service. Microsoft and Yahoo are desperately trying to close the gap with Google, the Internet search and ad sales titan.
 If Google stumbles, it will be seen as the company unable to move beyond a single stellar success.
 Since the future is so often the pattern of the past with some twist, what is the expert view? ''I'm a historian,'' said Mr. Tedlow of Harvard. ''Ask me in 10 years and I'll tell you why what happened was inevitable.''

HEADLINE: Rise in Demand Pressures Wholesalers

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Inventories at wholesalers rose less than forecast in March as suppliers struggled to keep pace with a surge in demand, a government report showed yesterday.
 In addition to the 0.2 percent rise in the value of stockpiles, the Commerce Department reported a 0.7 percent jump in wholesale sales. Inventories rose 0.9 percent in February. 
The amount of goods on hand relative to sales matched the lowest on record, and economists suggested that production gains and inventory restocking would help power the economy this quarter.
 ''Sales are so strong that inventories just cannot keep pace,'' said John Herrmann, director of economic commentary at Cantor Fitzgerald. ''This a great report for economic growth, but it's also an inflationary report.''
 Inventories of durable goods, which include cars and computers, increased 0.2 percent at wholesalers in March, after rising 0.6 percent the previous month. 
 Sales of such goods rose 0.3 percent in March, led by greater demand for metals and computer equipment, compared with a 0.2 percent gain in February.
 Wholesale sales were also bolstered by an increase in the value of petroleum shipments. Nondurable goods sales rose 1.1 percent in March, the most since September, the report showed. Petroleum sales rose 3.9 percent, after falling 0.9 percent in February.
 Wholesalers had enough supply on hand to last 1.16 months at March's sales pace, matching the ratio in January and October as the lowest ever, compared with 1.17 months in February. The drop in the ratio suggests that wholesalers will have to pay more for the goods they stock, Mr. Herrmann said.
 Economists had forecast a 0.5 percent rise in inventories for March after an initially reported 0.8 percent gain in February, according to a Bloomberg News survey. Estimates ranged from gains of 0.2 percent to 0.8 percent.

HEADLINE: Little by Little, an Overnight Success

BYLINE: By LISA CHAMBERLAIN

 BODY:
As in a wilderness area damaged by fire, the recovery in Lower Manhattan since Sept. 11, 2001, started small and grew imperceptibly until, seemingly overnight, it is starting to burst into bloom. 
 In part, the recovery seems linked to the diversification of Lower Manhattan commercial tenants. The market has been dominated by large financial-related firms, but in the last year or more there has been an influx of smaller nonprofit organizations, design and creative industries, media companies and law firms. Some have been drawn in part by rents that are lower than those in Midtown.
 With that groundswell under way, there was a jump in the first quarter of 2006 in the leasing of larger spaces, and in some Class A buildings surrounding the World Trade Center site, rents have increased by 15 percent. 
 All of this has taken place despite the uncertainty at ground zero and the struggle to lease the newly opened 7 World Trade Center, the first new building to go up at the 16-acre site that was devastated nearly five years ago. 
 Just north of ground zero in TriBeCa is 32 Avenue of the Americas, between Walker and Lispenard Streets. It is a historically significant Art Deco building that was built in 1932 by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, and its revival might serve as a microcosm of Lower Manhattan's comeback story.
 Shortly after Sept. 11 and through the economic downturn that followed, 32 Avenue of the Americas was nearly 25 percent vacant. A major tenant, the telecommunications company Global Crossing, declared bankruptcy in 2002, and a handful of other smaller tenants went out of business or left downtown. 
 Starting about a year ago, however, leasing activity at the building increased sharply, and the site is now almost totally leased. New tenants, many coming from Midtown, include the Rai Corporation, an Italian broadcasting company; Gazes L.L.C., a small bankruptcy law firm; and Cambridge University Press, which will move in later this year. 
 Light Reading, another new tenant, is an example of a different driving force in Lower Manhattan's vibrancy. The company, an online publisher, was already downtown but had outgrown its old space.
 ''I've been saying for a year now that the fundamentals in Lower Manhattan are strong,'' said William C. Rudin, president of the Rudin Management Company, which purchased 32 Avenue of the Americas in late 1999. ''What goes on at the World Trade Center is important, but life goes on around it.''
 The diversification of Lower Manhattan has played a critical role in its resurgence. Financial industries once represented 75 percent of commercial tenants downtown. That has dropped below 50 percent, according to Jones Lang LaSalle, a global real estate investment and management company. 
 ''The conversion of older office buildings to apartments and condos and the increasing diversity of tenants have driven vacancies down,'' said John Wheeler, managing director of Jones Lang LaSalle. ''It's a very healthy marketplace.''
 The Alliance for Downtown New York reports that the total number of businesses in Lower Manhattan increased by nearly 6 percent in 2005 from 2003, while more than two-thirds of signed leases at the end of 2005 were for 20,000 square feet or less.
 In 2005 and the first quarter of this year, relocations from Midtown accounted for 459,445 square feet of space, while total moves into the area totaled 875,952 square feet. 
 Rai, which had been in Midtown for 37 years, moved to 32 Avenue of the Americas to take advantage of lower rents, sweeping views and the fact that the area is becoming a round-the-clock neighborhood. 
 ''We are a news broadcasting company, so people are working nights and weekends,'' said Guido Corso, president of Rai. ''Midtown at night is a ghost town. This has become a 24-hour environment.'' 
 Indeed, Lower Manhattan is the fastest-growing residential neighborhood in New York City, and many of the people moving in also make decisions about company locations.
 Ian J. Gazes and his legal and life partner, Serge D. Krawiecki, moved their law office from Midtown at the same time they were also purchasing a condo three blocks away, where they live with their daughter, Julia Krawiecki Gazes. 
 ''Out this window, I have a great view of where we don't want to be,'' Mr. Gazes said as he pointed north to Midtown. ''And out of this window, I have a great view of the Hudson River, looking toward our condo. We love being able to walk to work and have our daughter close by.'' 
 The first tenant to sign a lease at the 7 World Trade Center was the New York Academy of Sciences, a nonprofit organization, whose president, Ellis Rubinstein, moved from the Upper East Side to a condo downtown. 
 Other new downtown nonprofit tenants include the International Center for Transitional Justice, which took 19,000 square feet, and the American Red Cross, which leased 34,000 square feet, both at 5 Hanover Square. At 52 Broadway, Vocational Foundation Inc. leased 17,000 square feet, and the Y.W.C.A. took 22,000 square feet. 
 Publishing and media companies with new leases include Bowne & Company at 55 Water Street, William H. Sadlier Inc. at 14 Wall Street and Lifestyle Media Inc. at 110 William Street.
 Education, legal and government agencies are leasing considerable space in buildings like 29 Broadway, which had a 35 percent vacancy rate in 2004 but is now 100 percent occupied. Similarly, 32, 39 and 45 Broadway all had vacancy rates above 20 percent in 2004 and are now 98 percent leased. 
 ''When you get a lot of smaller businesses, you get more diversification and more job growth,'' said Eric J. Deutsch, president of the Downtown Alliance. ''People are voting with their feet, coming from Midtown, and we think that's part of what's pushing up the rents downtown.''
 Indeed, rather than a trickledown effect, demand for smaller spaces is helping to push prices up at the top. Brookfield Properties, which manages 10 million square feet of space around the World Trade Center site, recently increased rent at the World Financial Center by $4 a square foot, about 15 percent. 
 ''At the beginning of the year, from a leasing standpoint we didn't know what was going to happen,'' said Richard B. Clark, chief executive of Brookfield Properties. ''We had 900,000 square feet in play. We were a little worried, but we've since leased 650,000 square feet, which is considerable activity.'' 
 While downtown real estate brokers and property owners are singing the praises of diversification, the financial sector has not become totally dormant. Morgan Stanley and American Express both renewed and expanded their downtown space in 2005.
 The finance, insurance and real estate industries are still the largest categories of tenants downtown. Overall absorption in Lower Manhattan was more than a million square feet in 2005, the first year since 2000 that a surplus of space has shrunk, as new leases exceeded space newly put on the market. In the first quarter of 2006, 950,000 square feet of space has already been leased. Not included in that figure is the recent announcement by the Aon Corporation, an insurance brokerage, of a deal to sublease 200,000 square feet from Wachovia at 199 Water Street. For the first time since Sept. 11, all of Aon's employees will be downtown. 
 Robert Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association of New York and New Jersey, an independent metropolitan research and advocacy agency, attributes the overall health of Lower Manhattan to three things: the price advantage compared with Midtown, the influx of smaller businesses and the resurgence of residential life in Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, whose residents have an easier commute to downtown than Midtown.
 ''Lower Manhattan is an astounding story,'' Mr. Yaro said. ''It's a more interesting place now than it's been since Manhattan was founded.''

HEADLINE: A Scion of Spice Cheers Each Morsel of Good News

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: New Orleans 

 BODY:
LUNCHTIME on Friday on Bourbon Street. A raucous weekly ritual is under way beneath the antique rotary ceiling fans in the downstairs dining room at Galatoire's, the beloved watering hole of generations of New Orleans movers and shakers.
 The dinner-jacketed waiters, some almost as old as the restaurant itself, which was founded in 1905, scuttle across the black-and-white tile floor bearing thick crockery plates of shrimp remoulade, crab meat maison and snapper amandine.
 From time to time they stop to trade gossip about politics (and, these days, about Hurricane Katrina) with the regulars, who will not be returning to work on this or any other Friday afternoon. They sing ''Happy Birthday,'' always off-key, to celebratory groups (one of which, on this day, comprises women wearing blinking green plastic stars on cords around their necks and men wearing silly beanies with propellers mounted on top). 
 All the while the alcohol flows: Pernod-haunted Sazerac cocktails; mostly white wine, most of that Burgundy; and cups of cafe brulot spiked with brandy and Curacao. 
 At one of the better tables (there are no really bad ones) sits Paul McIlhenny, the beefy, gregarious, 62-year-old president of the McIlhenny Company, which makes Tabasco sauce, Louisiana's most famous food product. This year he also reigns as Rex, King of Carnival, the last in a series of monarchs who have presided over Mardi Gras since 1872. Although he carries no scepter, you cannot miss his royal status; his wife, Judy, is wearing a big gold pin that spells out ''R-E-X,'' with a crown on top and three tiny gold peppers and a diamond half-hidden in its upper reaches.
 With them -- lucky us! -- are me and my wife, Betsey. If anybody is qualified to talk about New Orleans, its food and its restaurants, to say nothing of Katrina (and the storm that followed, Rita), it is Paul McIlhenny. We were there to soak up some of his wisdom. And his wit.
 No other place has a more devoted tub-thumper than Mr. McIlhenny, and he was eager to emphasize the good news, eight months after Katrina struck: the vast majority of restaurants serving again, and excellent new ones, like Cochon and the Longbranch, opening so soon after the disaster, miraculously enough; local shrimpers and other fishermen again delivering prime goods; his daughter and her friends pitching in to clear debris from the streets.
 ''It takes stamina and courage to face devastation like this every day and keep going, and we've seen a lot of that here,'' he said. ''We're still a little bit bleary-eyed, but human resourcefulness is remarkable. We're moving ahead at a nice pace.''
 Some pommes souffles with bearnaise sauce put us in a festive mood.
 John Fontenot, Mr. McIlhenny's regular waiter, a droll, mustachioed Cajun from Ville Platte, La., near Opelousas, dropped off an order of oysters en brochette, Mr. McIlhenny's favorite, and some plump, deep-fried soft-shell crabs that might have leapt from the Gulf of Mexico into the hot fat and then onto the plate. The two of them began exchanging the latest jokes featuring Boudreaux and Thibodeaux, two amiable but dim-witted Cajuns -- a vein of humor they have been mining for decades.
 A trencherman of the first order, and (like me) a sloppy eater, Mr. McIlhenny spilled one delicious morsel after another down his front. He sounded happy as a clam, or maybe an oyster, when he told me, ''If you can wear the same shirt at lunch and dinner, you're a better man than I.''
 Everything seemed as before, but of course it isn't. Only the unquenchable spirit of the people involved is unchanged. David Gooch, one of the owners of Galatoire's, confided that he had been unable to find a new pastry chef to replace one who left the city (no great loss, if truth be told; desserts are the restaurant's biggest weakness).
 Mr. Fontenot told us that he was living in a Federal Emergency Management Agency trailer because the three houses he owns in Chalmette, in St. Bernard Parish, took on 10 feet of water and remained uninhabitable.
 ''We're the luckiest people in the world,'' said the ever-chipper waiter, nudging Mr. McIlhenny. ''We've both got good jobs, and plenty of good food to eat.''
 Maybe so, but there are disturbing realities that Mr. McIlhenny, at least, is ready to acknowledge. Some major restaurants remain shut, including Commander's Palace, the crown jewel of the Brennan family's empire; Emeril's Delmonico, one of Emeril Lagasse's three New Orleans operations; Gautreau's, the cradle of several of the city's best young chefs; and Mosca's, the venerable roadhouse on Highway 90, with its garlicky baked oysters. (Happily for everyone, Mary Jo Mosca said the family hopes to reopen by next week, after completely rebuilding the kitchen. She added: ''We are elated. I never thought we'd see the day.'') 
 More modest establishments have suffered as well. Jacques-Imo's erstwhile fried-chicken wizard, Austin Leslie, died in Katrina's aftermath. In the hard-hit Treme neighborhood, Dooky Chase's and Willie Mae's Scotch House, perhaps the city's leading African-American-owned cafes, guardians of the cherished Creole soul food tradition, have been unable to reopen. And out near the end of the St. Charles Avenue streetcar line (also inoperative), the Tara-like Camellia Grill, where generations of excited debutantes ate hamburgers when the last notes of the last quadrille had died away, might have cooked its last patty.
 ''Some of these guys will be back,'' Mr. McIlhenny said after a slow, thoughtful sip of Meursault. ''Some won't. And meantime, a lot of places, including Antoine's, are just limping along with shorter menus, limited seating or curtailed staffs. I think it may well take us 25 years before our economy gets back to where it used to be.''
 The labor shortage is so severe, he added, that the Loews hotel here cannot find room cleaners, even at $15 an hour with benefits. ''Now hiring'' signs hang in windows everywhere. Many restaurant employees once lived in the Lower Ninth Ward, where powerful floods reduced frame houses to kindling and scattered the workers to the winds. With no place to live, with health care scarce and with schools problematic, many have chosen to stay away.
 Tourists are New Orleans's best hope, and they are gradually filtering back. Though scaled down, both Mardi Gras, for which Mr. McIlhenny ordered church bells sounded to mark the hour the hurricane struck, and the more recent Jazz and Heritage Festival drew big crowds. 
 They might have been bigger if the city could have handled them. At the moment, only half of the 38,000 hotel rooms in the metropolitan area are open, with the Hyatt and other convention standbys shuttered. Airline seats are in short supply as well. Only 99 flights a day currently serve echoing Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, as against 166 a day before Katrina, then Rita, mauled the area.
 Mr. McIlhenny and Tabasco suffered less than most. The factory of his friend and competitor Al Baumer Jr., who makes Crystal Hot Sauce, was all but destroyed in the storms, he said. The McIlhenny Company, headquartered in Avery Island, in the heart of Cajun country, emerged with its buildings intact; it sits atop a salt dome, about 160 feet above sea level. Katrina flooded out eight employees from the New Orleans sales office and Rita displaced 35 from the general offices in Avery Island.
 ''Nobody escaped completely unscathed,'' Mr. McIlhenny said.
 Still, New Orleans survives, and these days it serves its oysters Rockefeller and its bananas Foster, its beignets and its gumbo, with smiling, heartfelt thanks for your visit. 
 Its best chefs, like Ken Smith of Upperline and John Besh of August, have regained their creative stride. Mr. Besh, who won a regional James Beard award this week, is regaling his customers with fresh delights like a salad of heirloom beets, crab meat and quail eggs; ravishing deep-fried soft-shell shrimp; and several preparations of the plump, succulent strawberries from the town of Ponchatoula, La. 
 In this lush if tempest-tossed part of the world, so blessed in some ways, so cursed in others, the berries hit their sweet, scarlet peak in April.

HEADLINE: 2 Top Officers Are Criticized For '04 Arrests

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

 BODY:
The city agency investigating the police response to protests at the 2004 Republican National Convention has sharply criticized the performance of two deputy chiefs, saying that they yelled incomprehensible orders to marchers, resulting in many unnecessary arrests.
 The agency, the Civilian Complaint Review Board, outlined its findings in a two-page letter sent yesterday to Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly. The board plans to distribute the letter today at its monthly meeting.
In the letter, the board described the tangle of events at two demonstrations in Manhattan on Aug. 31, 2004, at which it said marchers were given little chance to obey the deputy chiefs' orders to disperse, and wound up being arrested. 
 The board found that protesters got penned in on the sidewalks with no easy way to leave during a march on Fulton Street. Later, at a march near Herald Square, the police orders to ''clear the streets,'' created confusion. In both cases, the letter said, the fact that the chiefs did not use bullhorns left some police officers unaware of their orders and raised the possibility that marchers who were arrested would have obeyed had they heard them.
 While not directly addressing the question of whether the chiefs had addressed the crowds properly, Commissioner Kelly defended the department's actions during the convention, pointing out that the police are not obligated to give warnings before making arrests. ''And the implication that the N.Y.P.D. failed during the R.N.C.,'' he said, ''turns truth on its head.''
 ''The policing of the R.N.C. was one of the Police Department's finest hours,'' Mr. Kelly continued. ''It protected the city against a potential terrorist attack while accommodating massive, peaceful protest. The Aug. 31 arrests cited by the C.C.R.B. came on the day a minority vowed to shut the convention down.''
 Neither of the deputy chiefs was named in the letter, though the police and people familiar with the proceedings identified them as Stephen Paragallo and Terrence Monahan. The board said it could not substantiate a more serious claim that Chief Monanan had ordered improper arrests on Fulton Street. In March, the board charged Chief Paragallo with abuse of authority for ordering the arrest of a 56-year-old Brooklyn woman near Herald Square, where at least 15 people were arrested.
 The board said the Police Department should review the training it gives officers charged with policing public events that could attract protesters.
 ''The board believes that if the deputy chiefs had employed different tactics, the Police Department may possibly have avoided arresting a large number of individuals,'' it said in the letter, signed by Hector Gonzalez, its chairman, and Florence L. Finkle, its executive director.
 The board's recommendations cap its formal evaluation of 63 complaints stemming from the Republican National Convention, at least three of them against chiefs who were at the scene and came into contact with the public.
 Of the 63 cases, only 3 were substantiated, a point Commissioner Kelly stressed last night. In the others, the board found no misconduct in 32, 18 were dropped, 7 were stymied because the officers could not be identified, 2 were listed as miscellaneous because the officers left the department before the investigation could be completed, and 1 was mediated.
 The Police Department is not obligated to follow the board's recommendations. The board, established in 1993, can make recommendations, but Commissioner Kelly has the final say. A majority of the members are appointed by the mayor and the commissioner. The board said it had reviewed video of both marches and mass arrests.
 Chief Monahan ordered the arrests of 227 people participating in the large march on Fulton Street on Aug. 31, 2004. In October 2004, the Manhattan district attorney's office announced that it would not prosecute cases against them.
 Christopher Dunn, the associate legal director for the New York Civil Liberties Union, said the group has filed two federal lawsuits against the city and Mr. Kelly, challenging the mass arrests of protesters at Fulton Street, as well as the arrests of nearly 400 people at a march later that day on East 16th Street. 
 In the second case, prosecutors have not dismissed any criminal charges against marchers. The board's letter to Mr. Kelly yesterday echoed complaints voiced by demonstrators in the aftermath of the convention, Mr. Dunn said. ''From the start, the mass arrests of protesters at the convention have been tainted by complaints that people were not given clear orders to disperse, were trying to cooperate with the police and were acting lawfully,'' he said. ''This report from the C.C.R.B., which is an official city agency, now shows that those complaints were entirely valid.''
 The same issue -- ambiguous instructions given by senior police commanders at public demonstrations -- has been cited in a federal lawsuit against the city and several police officials. The suit was brought by Daniel M. Perez, a civil rights lawyer, on behalf of 16 protesters who attended a march in the city on Feb. 3, 2002, for the World Economic Forum.
 ''This is a systemic problem that the Police Department is incapable of dispersing groups of demonstrators without either surrounding them with nets or scooters or riot-clad police officers, and arresting all of them,'' said Mr. Perez, who is a partner in the firm Kuby & Perez.

HEADLINE: Educator From Penn Will Lead Columbia's Teachers College

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
The trustees of Teachers College at Columbia University voted yesterday to appoint Susan H. Fuhrman, dean of the School of Education at the University of Pennsylvania, to be the next president of the college, Columbia officials said. 
 Dr. Fuhrman is scheduled to start at Columbia on Aug. 1, succeeding Arthur E. Levine, the college's president of the past 12 years, who announced in December that he would leave in the summer to lead the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation in Princeton, N.J.
Dr. Fuhrman, from New York City, is a graduate of its public schools, including Hunter College High School in 1961. She received her doctorate in political economy from Teachers College in 1977 and has worked as a member of the college's faculty and as a social studies teacher at a Chicago area public school.
 Her reputation in academic research is built upon her work in the so-called school standards movement, which calls for the setting of achievement goals for students and emphasizes accountability for schools. In the 1980's, Dr. Fuhrman was a pioneering analyst and champion of these ideas, then relatively new and now the backbone of national education law, with its reliance on standardized tests.
 Dr. Fuhrman has written or edited several books on reform and accountability in education. She is the founding leader of the Consortium for Policy Research in Education, a joint venture among five universities that evaluates state and local school reforms.
 In a telephone interview, Dr. Fuhrman said that she intended to bring some of the center's work on school reform and management to Teachers College, and that she hoped to expand the college's involvement with New York's public school system. The college already has a significant role, training thousands of city teachers in the literacy curriculum used in the schools, and sending 90 percent of its students to assist in city classrooms.
 ''I'd like my legacy to be that Teachers College continues to realize its legacy, to be the great education school not only through its research and contributions to knowledge to help us understand and improve American education,'' Dr. Fuhrman said, ''but also to directly put those ideas to work.''
 Dr. Fuhrman and her husband, a physician, live in Westfield, N.J. They have three grown sons and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: A Young Work in Progress Shattered on a Road in Iraq

BYLINE: By Samuel G. Freedman. 
E-mail: sgfreedman@nytimes.com

DATELINE: SOUTH GATE, Calif. 

 BODY:
AS the seniors of South Gate High marched across the stage on commencement night in June 2003, a column of gravity and obedience in alphabetical order, Geovani Padilla took off his mortarboard and crimson stole. Then he wrapped the strip of fabric around his forehead in samurai style. After receiving his diploma, he dropped to his knees, thrust his fists in the air and bathed in a moment of cheering recognition.
 With more than 5,000 students on its rolls and nearly 50 in many classes, South Gate High was a hard place to stand out as an individual. Geovani hovered in the middle ranges, neither the academic star bound for Stanford or Berkeley nor the incipient gangster on a trajectory toward prison. Nothing had mattered more to him than answering to his own muse.
In the audience that evening sat the few people who truly understood Geovani -- his friends Paul Canales and Nairoby Alvarez; his teachers Santiago Rodriguez and Michael Kinne. They had always savored the way Geovani wore a black leather trench coat to school even in the blowtorch Santa Ana winds, and how he turned a dog's leash into a looping watch chain worthy of a zoot-suited sharpie. They knew of his passion for the books of Albert Camus, Herman Hesse and Ken Kesey, a passion belied by his indifference to grades and homework. 
 Now, nearly three years later, the formal version of Geovani's graduation portrait, mortarboard atop head and stole draped over shoulders, hangs in the central office of South Gate High. He came by this distinction in the grimmest way, killed last month by a roadside bomb while serving as a Navy hospitalman in Iraq. He was 20 years old and, the last his friends had heard, reading ''The Divine Comedy.''
 IT is a terrible and obvious truth of war that the young fight and die -- the average age of the American fatalities in Iraq is 26 1/2 -- and so these losses echo in a particular way through the high schools the victims so recently left. In grief and commemoration, their survivors often reach for a certain vocabulary, phrases like ''honor roll,'' ''dean's list'' and ''role model,'' as if the demise of a B-minus student should somehow harrow everyone less.
 Geovani Padilla, though, lived and died as a reminder that being in high school means yearning and searching, trying to assemble a self. Geovani was a work in progress, one that can never be completed. All the sundered strands of possibility are what his friends and mentors from South Gate mourn.
 On its surface, Geovani's life had followed a familiar itinerary in the Latino neighborhoods of Southern California. He was born in Guadalajara and crossed the border with his family illegally. The Padillas moved first into the Mexican enclave of Boyle Heights in Los Angeles, and a decade later to a peach stucco bungalow in the factory town of South Gate, paid for with his father's wages for repairing cars.
 Early on, though, Geovani had known the influence of uncles and aunts who were painters, sculptors, musicians. Sometimes he spent four or five hours after his elementary-school day in the local library, exploring the shelves. By the time he was in junior high and his questions had outstripped his parents' modest educations, they bought him a set of encyclopedias on layaway.
 Maybe because he was the new kid at South Gate High, still missing his friends back in Boyle Heights, he started keeping a journal in the spring of his sophomore year.
 ''I need to express my thoughts in a safe way,'' he wrote. ''This will be my sanctuary and my personal keeper of secrets.'' With the poignant self-importance of a precocious teen, he took on the nom be plume of Mephisto, fallen angel.
 He put drawings, poems and memories into the pages. He recounted the struggles his parents had paying their bills. He confessed the unrequited crush he had on Nairoby. With a young man's sense of immortality, or perhaps a prescient fatalism, he expressed a fearlessness of death. He shared little of this with his teachers, for whom he was a vexation, an obviously gifted pupil coasting to B's and C's.
 Then, in his junior year, Geovani met Michael Kinne and Santiago Rodriguez, two young teachers consigned to a trailer classroom that dealt with South Gate High's overflow.
 The son of immigrant farmworkers in the San Joaquin Valley, a picker himself until age 14, Mr. Rodriguez recognized in Geovani a similar desire ''to transcend all economic and cultural barriers.'' The child of a single mother in a military town on the edge of the Mojave Desert, Mr. Kinne traced his own emancipation to studies at the University of California in Santa Cruz, that capital of iconoclasm.
 WHATEVER these teachers assigned in their literature courses, Geovani devoured -- ''Song of Solomon,'' ''Fahrenheit 451,'' ''Oedipus Rex,'' ''The Catcher in The Rye.'' The morning after Mr. Kinne had distributed copies of ''The Stranger'' by Camus, Geovani came to class having read it and saying: ''That was good. Do you have anything else like it?'' So Mr. Kinne gave him Jean-Paul Sartre's essay ''Existentialism Is a Humanism.''
 At lunchtime and after school, Geovani went to see the teachers in their trailer, offering up his own analogies between classical works and popular culture. 
 Plato's allegory of the cave reminded him of the Jim Carrey film ''The Truman Show''; he contrasted the dystopia of ''Lord of the Flies'' to the sunny version of shipwreck in ''Gilligan's Island.'' And Jake Gyllenhaal's role as a troubled teenager in ''Donnie Darko,'' he wanted Mr. Kinne and Mr. Rodriguez to realize, was very, very existential.
 So, a month after graduation, both teachers were shocked to hear that their protege had enlisted in the Navy. When Mr. Kinne asked why, Geovani talked about using military service to speed up his path to American citizenship and get scholarship money for college. In the meantime, the Navy would let him see the world. He wrote in his journal about wanting to touch the stones of ancient Rome.
 In Geovani's last letter to his friend Nairoby , he described the sight of a gaggle of Iraqi girls walking to school amid the ''rubble of shot down buildings, trash that has been spilled, dirty and stray dogs, wrecked and burned cars, blood stains, bullet holes.'' He also had sent her a typewritten ''Declaration of Intent,'' in which he admitted, ''I have the darkest feeling I won't be coming back.''

HEADLINE: When the Professor Is a Tough Grader, and Your Dad

BYLINE: By P. G. SITTENFELD

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J., May 9 

 BODY:
When Carolina Danspeckgruber, a sophomore at Princeton University, signed up for a course on international diplomacy, she was not worried about handling the class's heavy workload. But she was a little worried about dealing with the professor -- her father. 
 Never mind that her father, Wolfgang, an expert on international relations, has a reputation as a tough grader. 
 Her fear was this: ''He would bring up PowerPoint presentations on his personal computer, and I could see files of family photo albums across the top of the screen.'' She added, ''I was always afraid that if he hit the wrong button, a baby picture of me would pop up for the whole lecture hall to see.''
 Princeton, like many universities and colleges across the country, admits some children of faculty members, who go through the usual admissions process. Many institutions offer incentives for faculty children to attend -- a break on tuition, as at Princeton, or even free tuition.
 For many students, in search of their own identity, being on the same campus as a parent may be as much togetherness as they can stand. But others get even closer by seeking out a course taught by their parent. 
 It was ''a chance to see my dad in a different light,'' said Mykel Kulkarni, a Princeton freshman who took electrical engineering last semester from his father, Sanjeev. 
 Still, some students see potential pitfalls of taking a parent's course. Grant Bermann, a Princeton freshman whose mother, Sandra Bermann, is chairwoman of the comparative literature department, said he would not take her seminar.
 ''I wouldn't want classmates to feel uncomfortable or think I was enjoying certain perks,'' he explained. 
 But he added that he did not think he would have any advantages in her class. ''If anything, I think my mom might be biased in that she would grade me harder than normal students,'' he said.
 Other students say being in a parent's class is almost an extension of home. 
 At Northwestern University, Kirby Hall, a junior, is taking a seminar taught by her mother, Sunny Langton, a professor in the School of Music. Ms. Hall, who is studying opera performance, said that ''as a performer, it's great studying with my mother.'' She explained: ''There's no inhibition. It's a really safe environment.''
 Still, she said she had sacrificed privacy to be her mother's student.
 ''We were sitting in my mom's opera repertoire seminar, and one of my friends mentioned a party she'd had,'' Ms. Hall explained. ''I was like 'Yeah, that was a pretty wild time,' at which point my mom turned around and gave me an 'Ahem!' ''Going into the semester, the Danspeckgrubers said they did not know what to expect. 
 ''When Carolina told me she wanted to take my class, I felt mixed,'' Professor Danspeckgruber said. ''On the one hand, I was very delighted, and on the other hand, I thought: 'Oh my God! How am I going to do this?' And it wasn't just Carolina; she came with 15 of her friends.''
 Ms. Danspeckgruber said she took her father's class in part because he wanted her to, and in part because of her interest in the subject.
 Ronald G. Ehrenberg, director of the Cornell Higher Education Research Institute, which studies economics and management in universities, said he thought faculty members rarely taught their own children.
 ''The question,'' he said, ''is what happens when you have to grade your child's work? Most places don't have official policies, because grading is a faculty prerogative, but there's a real potential for conflict of interest. If you're giving exams, you can foist the grading onto someone else, but if you're dealing with papers, it becomes much more difficult.''
 Princeton does not have a policy on faculty members' instructing family members, said Cass Cliatt, a university spokeswoman. Each department has ''discretion to deal with situations in which a perceived conflict of interest may arise,'' she said.
 A graduate student graded Ms. Danspeckgruber's work, and she earned an A.
 ''I definitely worked harder in my dad's class than in the other course I was taking,'' she said.
 Professor Danspeckgruber said, ''Having a child take your course is a real risk.'' He explained: ''At the end of the semester, Carolina said she thought it was a really great class. But had she felt another way, it would have cut deep.''

HEADLINE: Clemens Just Can't Win In This Rivalry

BYLINE: By Selena Roberts. 
E-mail: selenasports@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE retirement plan for Roger Clemens is always written on an Etch-a-Sketch, with a shake-and-erase option to indulge his vacillating heart, with knobs for adjusting his indecisive mind.
 But just where -- if anywhere -- will the lumberjack of baseball legends alight?
 In Houston, Clemens could hop in his Hummer for a quick commute home to his castle-ette decorated with Cy Young awards, antler horns and flat screens, filled with creature comforts and his sons, the ''K'' boys -- Koby, Kory, Kody and Kasey. 
 Who's your strikeout Daddy? Every team covets Clemens. He could select sanity and remain in Houston, sharing clubhouse hunting tips and nutrition shakes with his buddy, Andy Pettitte, in an extension of their Fred Flintstone-Barney Rubble relationship.
 Or he could choose New York over Boston -- or vice versa -- in a move that would plunge an already unhinged rivalry into a Defcon 5 lunacy. 
 Both rivals have remained at a respectful distance to give Clemens room to think before acting on his June deadline. But after the Yankees' meltdown last night in front of the Red Sox, after a bewildered Randy Johnson lost his groove yet again, George Steinbrenner may intensify his courtship of the Rocket.
 Was that the Yankees offering Kody a minor league contract before the child's nap time at his elementary school? Was that the Red Sox countering with a spa day for the Rocket's wife?
 Whether Clemens picks Boston over New York -- or vice versa -- he cannot win. And this has nothing to do with the wrath of a rival scorned. Clemens would find himself as another superstar squandered amid the obsession the Yankees and Red Sox have with each other's rosters. 
 This is the manifestation of a rivalry that has left each team farther from a championship and in the rear mirror of the only team that matters: the Chicago White Sox. 
 Year after year, in their efforts to outwit and outmaneuver each other -- whether in pursuit of Jose Contreras or Carl Pavano or in the rush to score a gotcha with Alex Rodriguez or even Doug Mirabelli -- the Red Sox and Yankees have outsmarted themselves, as much as they may protest.
 ''The reality is, I'm not focused on them and I don't think they are focused on us,'' said Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman. ''But perception-wise, it plays that way.''
 Perceptions are often rooted in the truth. And the Yankees and Red Sox have nasty turf-battle scars as proof. ''Contreras, I'll say, got out of hand,'' Cashman said. 
 But even the smallest of moves by one rival can induce interference by the other, underscoring the potential of distraction via rival fixation. 
 ''I would not run and hide on the Mirabelli case,'' Cashman said. ''I just tried to make Boston come up with an honest day's pay for him.''
 Neither organization is known for its economy of moves. The two play the hokeypokey -- signing a left-hander in, sending a right-hander out -- to keep up with their strategy of spite.
 Johnson was nabbed to bedevil the Red Sox last year, while Josh Beckett was acquired to flummox the Yankees this year. Right now, Johnson is the one confused. ''I don't have any answers,'' he said last night.
 The Red Sox and Yankees expand and contract their star galaxies at the first sign of impatience with their saviors. Which team benefits from the switcheroo fallout? Maybe it's the White Sox.
 Unwittingly, the Yankees have outfitted the White Sox pitching rotation. At last glance, two Yankee castaways -- Contreras (5-0) and Javier Vazquez (4-1) -- have finessed and muscled opponents into chalk dust.
 True, Contreras went on the disabled list yesterday, but he has been untouchable in Chicago after life as an enigma in New York. And yet, cautionary tales of roster impulsiveness by our ancient rivals have not been slowed by the lessons of the White Sox.
 ''I've always thought too much was made out of this series,'' said Johnny Damon, a Yankee now and a Red Sox then, adding, ''We are chasing wins to have a chance to chase the White Sox.''
 The White Sox have only improved on their World Series-winning team. They have sharpened their edge by gaining Jim Thome and Vazquez, by forgoing the kind of loopy moves and counterpunches borne from the Red Sox-Yankees rivalry.
 The White Sox operate on personnel strategies, not personal vendettas, happy to allow the Red Sox and Yankees to sabotage each other. Last night, the Yankee conga line of superstars that was gathered to obstruct the Red Sox self-destructed instead. 
 A-Rod was devoured by simple grounders. Johnson was haunted by control issues. And no one beyond Jason Giambi could decode Beckett. But as it goes with these rivals, one team's schadenfreude often expires upon the first pitch a day later. 
 The Red Sox and the Yankees don't trump each other. They cancel out one another. So why would Clemens choose to be squandered? Wistfulness may outweigh logic.
 In Boston, Clemens could complete sentimental symmetry in front of a Green Monster that stood like a prom-picture backdrop for his first major league dates. In New York, he could revisit the Yankees' Monument Park, tying up the ends of his Hall of Fame legacy in the company of the same Babe Ruth plaque he once reverently rubbed like a genie bottle before his starts.
 Or Clemens could choose Houston: comfortable, familiar, sane.

HEADLINE: World Briefing Asia: India And China Drive Up Emissions Rates 

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER (NYT)

 BODY:
India's greenhouse gas emissions grew by 57 percent over the past decade, while China's increased by a third, according to the World Bank's annual Little Green Data Book. Rich countries still produce most emissions, with the United States contributing a quarter of the world's total. They also consume 11 times more energy per person than poor countries. But emissions from the rapidly growing economies of Asia are likely to continue to rise and contribute to climate change, the bank predicted. CELIA W. DUGGER (NYT)

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Fiscal Policy

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''The Pretenders'' (editorial, May 9): You appear to have missed the message. Fair tax rates, especially on capital formation, give people a reason to work harder and invest more efficiently, generating more jobs and more revenue to the federal government. With tax revenues surging to record levels, the proof is in the pudding. 
 The Republican pro-growth tax policies enacted in 2003 have triggered two and a half years of unprecedented job creation and economic growth and tax revenue increases. We should extend these gains, not end them.
The issue of the deficit is primarily one of spending in entitlement accounts and of course paying the cost of the war and Katrina. You should focus on the looming crisis that will be brought on by the retirement of the baby boom generation. 
 This demographic shift will result in an explosion in the cost of entitlements, which will crush our children's chances of continuing to enjoy robust economic growth and prosperity. This should be the primary issue of fiscal policy relative to controlling the long-term deficit.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Sees Big Voting Bloc Flocking to Drug Program

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and MARJORIE CONNELLY

DATELINE: SUN CITY CENTER, Fla., May 9 

 BODY:
A few months ago, President Bush's prescription drug plan seemed to be another White House initiative going wrong. The people it was intended to help complained that the plan was too complicated. Conservatives complained that it was a giant giveaway.
 This week, Mr. Bush is storming through this state, rich with older residents, as the main salesman for a plan that aides say is now emerging as a surprise plus for Republicans in a rocky election season. 
Rather than angering a crucial bloc, aides say, the plan gives older voters, who go to the polls more reliably than younger ones, something that always endears politicians to constituents -- money in the pocket.
 ''I think it's going to be value added as we go forward,'' Dan Bartlett, the White House counselor, said at the end of a presidential event here encouraging people to sign up for the program before the deadline on Monday. Asked whether Republicans should promote the plan as they campaign this summer, Mr. Bartlett said, ''They'd be smart to.''
 The calculation, accurate or not, represents a marked shift in thinking on the plan, which emerged as a potential hurdle for Republicans as people voiced growing frustration about complicated enrollment. 
 Democrats say Republicans are fooling themselves if they now believe that the plan will help them in November, saying people continue to complain about it, especially about the deadline. White House officials point to anecdotal evidence that the program is growing in popularity as people pass through the enrollment difficulties and into the savings the different subplans offer.
 The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll seems to support their argument that opinion is turning. Many respondents who said they had signed up said their expenses for prescription drugs decreased -- 42 percent, against 19 percent who said they were paying more. 
 Twice as many older people said the program would reduce costs as voiced that expectation in December, 40 percent now compared with 20 percent then, according to the poll. 
 The nationwide telephone poll was conducted May 4-8 with 1,241 adults, including 500 respondents 65 and older. The margin of sampling error for those respondents is plus or minus 4 percentage points.
 Opinion is shifting after a concerted effort by the White House and other Republicans to embrace and promote the program.
 But the poll shows that serious problems remain. Three-quarters of those 65 and older interviewed said it was difficult or somewhat difficult to understand. And 81 percent of those 65 and older said the deadline should be extended. 
 At a meeting at a center for the elderly here where Mr. Bush took questions from the audience, Janet Wilson, 79, asked him to extend the deadline, citing problems in the sign-up system.
 ''I would beg -- not for myself -- because there were logjams,'' Ms. Wilson said. ''They were shuffling the phone calls directly to Medicare.'' 
 Mr. Bush replied: ''Deadlines are important. Deadlines help people understand there's finality, and people need to get after it, you know?'' 
 Another woman in the mostly friendly audience offered an upbeat opinion, telling the president, ''I'm saving some $140 a month.''
 Representative Rahm Emanuel, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, acknowledged that such sentiment was growing. 
 But, Mr. Emanuel said, ''It's up to 40 percent, but that's still a net negative.'' 
 Pat Toomey, president of the Club for Growth, an economically conservative group, said that whatever gains the program might give to Republicans from older voters would be negated, at best, by losses among the conservatives who make up the core Republican vote in nonpresidential elections.
 ''I'm very skeptical that this will be a net positive,'' Mr. Toomey said. ''I think to hold onto the majorities, Republicans have to do something to demonstrate a renewed commitment to limited government, and touting the prescription drug plan is not going to do that.''
 But Mr. Bush is planning to keep doing just that, starting with another event promoting the benefit on Wednesday in Orlando.

HEADLINE: U.S. Won't Press China Over Yuan 

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10 

 BODY:
The Bush administration said on Wednesday that although it was ''extremely dissatisfied'' with China's refusal to allow its currency to fluctuate more freely, it would not cite China as a currency manipulator and provoke a confrontation over the issue.
 The administration's announcement, made by Treasury Secretary John W. Snow in compliance with a 1988 law requiring semiannual appraisals of exchange rate issues, was attacked by an array of critics who say that China engages in unfair trade practices by keeping the value of its currency artificially low. 
Among the critics were Republican and Democratic senators, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and various manufacturing trade associations. All said the administration seemed reluctant to take on an issue that had become a major focus of debate in this election year.
 Mr. Snow said that despite dissatisfaction with the Chinese record on the issue, the administration had little latitude because China had made at least a small amount of progress on letting its currency, the yuan, float in open markets in the last year.
 He said the law required that China be found to have the intention of manipulating its currency to encourage exports and protect the value of its dollar assets. But he added that the record showed that China was trying to cooperate with the United States and had allowed the value of its currency to appreciate. 
 Critics of China's currency policy say that by holding down the yuan's value, China is deliberately pursuing a policy that makes its exports more competitive on global markets and contributes to its huge trade imbalance with the United States.
 ''The test in the '88 act ultimately comes down to intent,'' said Mr. Snow, adding that only last month the Chinese leader, Hu Jintao, pledged at his White House visit to ''increase the flexibility of the exchange rate'' and expand imports and market access for foreign investments.
 ''China has indicated the intent to address imbalances,'' Mr. Snow said.
 Critics in Congress argue, on the other hand, that although China's progress in currency flexibility has been so small as to have negligible impact. The value of the yuan has risen about 3 percent against the dollar in the last year or so, Mr. Snow said.
 The administration's approach appeared to be a mixture of a tight reading of the law mixed with a sense of tactics, namely that a confrontation with China might backfire, especially at a time when the administration is unhappy with Beijing on a range of other issues.
 Other matters of contention with China include American criticism of its suppression of dissent, its military buildup, its failure to crack down on piracy of videos and high technology property, and its unwillingness to join the United States in a tough policy toward North Korea and Iran over their nuclear programs.
 American officials say they have had to balance toughness on these issues with flexibility and caution, because of China's leverage, including the hundreds of billions of dollars of United States debt that China holds.
 Many economic specialists say China has indeed been manipulating its currency to gain an advantage on trade and investment. But the debate over what to do about it is lively. 
 Senators Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, have been demanding that China be pressed harder on currency, and they have a bill calling for tariffs Chinese exports if the country refuses. Both denounced Mr. Snow's decision on Wednesday.
 The administration adamantly opposes their bill, but many experts say the administration also finds it useful to cite the bill as a reason China must act.
 ''Frankly the administration likes us playing our role so it can play the other role,'' Mr. Schumer said, adding that the administration seemed more interested in working with China on other issues and not letting the currency and trade issues undermine the chances of cooperation on matters including Iran and North Korea.
 ''I think they put economic issues at a much lower priority than geopolitical issues,'' he said of the administration. ''Most Americans would not have the same priorities.''
 Criticism of the administration also came from two prominent Republican senators, Olympia J. Snowe of Maine and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, who is chairman of the Finance Committee. 
 ''China just isn't living up to its obligations as a mature economy that's benefiting greatly from open international trade,'' said Mr. Grassley, whose committee has jurisdiction over the issue. ''The country has made some reforms, but it isn't even letting those reforms work freely.''
 Mr. Grassley called for scrapping the 1988 law under which Mr. Snow issued his report on Wednesday, saying that even if the Treasury secretary had found China to be a currency ''manipulator,'' the law called for intense talks with the Chinese and nothing else. 
 ''The next step would've been to talk more,'' Mr. Grassley said, ''and we're already talking.''
 A senior Treasury official, briefing reporters after Mr. Snow's announcement, said he agreed that the 1988 law might no longer be the right instrument to deal with currency imbalances, but he declined to endorse Mr. Grassley's proposal for a new law that would overhaul supervision of the currency issues.
 For example, the word ''manipulator'' was not defined in any economic textbook he has read, the official said, gesturing to his book shelf. He briefed under ground rules requiring that he be anonymous in order to keep the focus on Mr. Snow's words.
 He said that the administration instead should work more intensively with the International Monetary Fund to deal with currency problems with different countries, since the I.M.F. could serve as a more trusted and objective interlocutor.
 Treasury officials said that with Mr. Snow's finding, the issue would probably continue to grow in importance. 
 They said they worried that Congress might be tempted to erect import barriers, but that since the economy has been growing the impulse for protectionism might diminish.

HEADLINE: Europe No Longer Shuns Part-Time and Temporary Jobs 

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: PARIS, May 10 

 BODY:
European labor markets are encrusted and sclerotic, right? Tell that to Jean-Pierre Lemonnier.
 Mr. Lemonnier is out in front on a seismic shift in the way Europeans work, one that is provoking the rapid decline of the traditional full-time job. Long taboo in the mind-sets of European labor unions and governments, part-time work and temporary jobs are becoming by far the richest source of new employment across Europe. ''There's a need for flexibility,'' said Mr. Lemonnier, 47, the president of Manpower France, the temporary staffing company. ''Firing, on economic grounds, in a company with more than nine people, is extremely complicated. So temporary work is the simplest solution for the companies.''
 Europe's unemployment rate is still has about twice that in the United States. Yet, in the last five years employment growth for both part- and full-time jobs has been faster in the 12 nations that use the common currency, the euro, than in the United States, where the labor market stagnated and even briefly contracted in 2001 and 2002. 
 In the years 2000 to 2003, employment increased cumulatively by about 3.5 percent in the euro area, while quarterly employment growth in the United States was on average close to zero and fell cumulatively by almost 1 percent. Since 2004, employment growth has picked up considerably in the United States but has slowed slightly in the euro area.
 Some say the more buoyant European job growth is partly a result of strong employment gains in some countries that have offset lags elsewhere. ''If you take the whole of Europe, '' said Alexander Spermann, a labor market expert at the Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim, Germany, ''it's the old Europe that has a problem: Germany, Italy, France.'' Countries like Denmark, the Netherlands and Britain had greater success in job creation, he said.
 But a closer look at the numbers suggests that what has chiefly lifted job growth is the explosion of part-time and temporary work.
 ''There has been expansion, in any case, but not in the kind of jobs that count as full-time regular jobs,'' said Martin Werding, an employment expert at the IFO Institute for Economic Research in Munich said. ''On that side there's been a regular decline.'' Government make-work programs in Germany, introduced over the last two years to subsidize part-time and temporary jobs, largely failed to dent the jobless statistics, he said.
 Manpower, the world's biggest temporary staffing company, operates more than 1,130 agencies in France that place about two million people a year. Last year, revenue there was 4.5 billion euros ($5.4 billion), more than in the United States.
 Like its competitors, including Adecco of Switzerland and Randstad of the Netherlands, Manpower is watching its market grow. Mr. Lemonnier says that if major economies like France and the Netherlands grow by 2 percent this year, the market for temporary workers could grow by 5 percent.
 The proportion of part-time workers in the United States has been steady at about 13 percent for more than a decade, according to data compiled by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. The number of Europe's temporary workers -- people who may work a full week but can move from company to company -- is soaring. In the decade from 1990 to 2000, Manpower tripled its business, Mr. Lemonnier said.
 In France, Germany and Italy more than 12 percent of people working have temporary contracts. In Spain, the figure is more than 30 percent, and in the Netherlands 15 percent. Indeed, the percentage of Spanish workers in temporary and part-time jobs is so high that the government in Madrid proposed this week a new bill to cut the number of employees on temporary contracts. Legislation to become law in July should allow hundreds of thousands to upgrade to permanent contracts by giving companies incentives.
 The large shift from a dozen years ago is not only in numbers but also in labor attitudes. For years, Europe prided itself on enforcing rigid job-protection laws, making it difficult for companies to hire and fire workers the way American companies could. Temporary job agencies, like Manpower, were belittled in France, where temporary work is still scorned as ''precarious work''; in some countries, it was illegal. 
 Of course, the fast rate of job growth in the last five years is largely a result of dismal rates in the preceding years and pent-up appetite for hiring. Business leaders say the biggest obstacle to improving joblessness is the rigid workplace rules, which make it almost impossible to lay off permanent workers when business drops. In France, for instance, a company seeking to lay off workers has to make a case that would stand up in court that a business downturn directly made the jobs unnecessary. 
 Even then, they must pay the laid-off workers large packages of benefits. In many cases, companies opt to give workers early retirement rather than seek to lay them off. Students recently went on strike in Paris to protest government efforts to introduce more flexible hiring rules for first-time employment.
 ''It's a way for French business to counterbalance the rigidity of the French labor market,'' said Henri Lachmann, chairman of the Schneider electrical goods group, who is part of a business working group seeking to find ways to combat youth unemployment. 
 Without a radical loosening of hiring rules, major change in France is unlikely before the next national elections in May 2007, he said, adding, ''One day or other it has to occur.'' Asked how many temporary workers Schneider employed, he replied: ''Too many. It's a way to manage flexibly. It's a reply to French legal rigidity.''
 As they retire, many older workers have seen their jobs go from permanent employment to temporary work as their businesses cut expenses by scaling back permanent jobs to a small core. Typical of this was haute couture, a major industry in France but a seasonal one.
 ''In the beginning, it was all permanent employees,'' said Annie Coudret, a pattern cutter who has worked in haute couture dressmaking, for Chanel, Rochas and Lanvin, among others, for 23 years, and in recent years has had to temp. ''Now, however, all the work is done with much temporary help and very few permanent employees.''
 Outside of France, the Netherlands has drawn widespread attention in recent years as a model for promoting workplace flexibility, including the expansion of part-time employment.
 The Dutch government and the unions have encouraged part-time labor, with benefits comparable to those of full-time workers, and the proportion has jumped to almost 36 percent from 28 percent a decade earlier. The large majority of the part-time workers are women.
 The Netherlands now has one of Europe's lowest unemployment rates, about 4.5 percent. Part-time workers also make up more than one-fifth the total work force in Germany, Britain, Ireland, Spain and Norway. In France, temporary workers typically receive pay and benefits comparable to those of full-time workers, but they do not have the job security. Indeed, because of a ''precarious employment'' bonus, their total package is worth about 110 percent that of ordinary employees. Part-time workers, in contrast, tend to be paid less and receive fewer benefits.
 Marie Malherbe is someone who appreciates the benefits. Ms. Malherbe, 60, migrated to France from her native Greece when she was 21, and has been working in haute couture dressmaking almost ever since, for big names like Ungaro and Chanel. When Ungaro offered her a permanent job a few years back, she turned it down. 
 Permanent employees, she said, lose their edge. ''It becomes a daily habit,'' she said. As for temping, she said, ''In any case, if you're qualified, and have given proof that you are, if the employer is content and has confidence in you, it's really a good thing.''
 Still, the downside of this reshuffling of the labor market is the creation of a two-tier economy with older workers who have in effect lifetime jobs and younger workers on an employment carousel who move to new jobs at least once a year, like it or not.
 Raymond Torres, a top labor economist at the O.E.C.D., said the only real solution to the problem of youth joblessness in the European countries was to begin loosening the entire straitjacket of employment regulations. 
 ''The best way would be to reform the permanent labor contract,'' he said. Despite the loosening of temporary work restrictions, rigid job-protection laws for those with permanent jobs makes job hunting nearly impossible for those who have lost a job or are entering the job market for the first time.
 ''The more rigid the requirements are for a permanent contract, the more employers tend to recruit temporary workers,'' he said. ''It's not just a social issue, it's a waste of human capital, a waste of productivity, and it divides the labor market.''

PERSON: A. M. Rosenthal

HEADLINE: A. M. Rosenthal Is Dead at 84; Innovative Editor of The Times

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
A. M. Rosenthal, a Pulitzer Prize-winning foreign correspondent who became the executive editor of The New York Times and led the paper's global news operations through 17 years of record growth, modernization and major journalistic change, died yesterday in Manhattan. He was 84.
 His death, at Mount Sinai Medical Center, came two weeks after he suffered a stroke, his son Andrew said. Mr. Rosenthal lived in Manhattan.
 From ink-stained days as a campus correspondent at City College through exotic years as a reporter in the capitals and byways of Europe, Asia and Africa, Mr. Rosenthal climbed on rungs of talent, drive and ambition to the highest echelons of The Times and American journalism.
 Brilliant, passionate, abrasive, a man of dark moods and mercurial temperament, he could coolly evaluate world developments one minute and humble a subordinate for an error in the next. He spent almost all of his 60-year career with The Times -- he often called it his life -- but it was a career in three parts: reporter, editor and columnist. 
 As a reporter and correspondent for 19 years, he covered New York City, the United Nations, India, Poland, Japan and other regions of the world, winning acclaim for his prolific, stylish writing and a Pulitzer Prize. The Pulitzer was for international reporting in 1960, for what the Communist regime in Poland, which had expelled him the previous year, called probing too deeply.
 Then, returning to New York in 1963, he became an editor. Over the next 23 years, he served successively as metropolitan editor, assistant managing editor, managing editor and executive editor, enlarging his realms of authority by driving his staffs relentlessly, pursuing the news aggressively and outmaneuvering rivals for the executive suite.
 After being named managing editor in 1969, Mr. Rosenthal was briefly outranked by James B. Reston, the executive editor. But Mr. Reston soon accepted a vice presidency, Mr. Rosenthal assumed command of news operations, and the executive editorship was dropped until 1977, when Mr. Rosenthal took the title. 
 At the helm of a staff of highly regarded editors and writers that included many young stars he had recruited, Mr. Rosenthal directed coverage of the major news stories of the era -- the war in Vietnam, the Pentagon Papers, the Watergate scandal and successive crises in the Middle East.
 Publication of the Pentagon Papers in 1971 was a historic achievement for The Times. The papers, a 7,000-page secret government history of the Vietnam War, showed that every administration since World War II had enlarged America's involvement while hiding the true dimensions of the conflict. But publishing the classified documents was risky: Would there be fines or jail terms? Would readers consider it treasonous? Would it lead to financial ruin for the paper?
 The Nixon administration tried to suppress publication, and the case led to a landmark Supreme Court decision upholding the primacy of the press over government attempts to impose ''prior restraint'' on what may be printed. Major roles were played by Times staff members, among them Neil Sheehan, the correspondent who had uncovered the papers. But it was Mr. Rosenthal as editor, arguing strenuously for publication, and Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the publisher, who made the crucial decisions.
 Despite the crisis atmosphere, there were some light moments. In an oft-told tale, Mr. Sulzberger recalled that when he told Mr. Rosenthal he wanted to read the Pentagon documents before deciding whether to publish them, Mr. Rosenthal, with barely concealed glee, wheeled a grocery cart containing the papers into the publisher's office. 
 After 17 years as a principal architect of the modern New York Times, Mr. Rosenthal stepped down as the top editor in 1986 as he neared his job's mandatory retirement age of 65. Mr. Sulzberger said at the time that Mr. Rosenthal's ''record of performance as executive editor of The Times will last as a monument to one of the titans of American journalism.'' 
 He then began the last phase of his Times career, nearly 13 years as the author of a twice-weekly column, ''On My Mind,'' for the Op-Ed page. His first column, on Jan. 6, 1987, and his last, on Nov. 5, 1999, carried the same headline, which he wrote: ''Please Read This Column.''
 As that injunction implied, the columns reflected his passions and what he saw as a personal relationship with readers. He addressed a range of foreign and domestic topics with a generally conservative point of view. But there were recurring themes -- his support for Israel and its security, his outrage over human rights violations in China and elsewhere, his commitment to political and religious freedoms around the world, and his disgust at failures in America's war on drugs.
 It was an assignment he relished, and he surrendered it reluctantly. He said in an interview with The Washington Post that Arthur Sulzberger Jr., by then the publisher of The Times, had told him ''it was time.''
 ''What that means, I don't know,'' he said, adding, ''I didn't expect it at all.'' 
 He left, but he did not retire. ''I've seen happier days,'' he said, cleaning out his office, adding, ''I want to remain a columnist.'' In February 2000, he began an untitled weekly column for The Daily News that reflected his increasingly conservative convictions and continued until 2004.

Under the Microscope
 Perhaps more than those of any editor in modern times, Mr. Rosenthal's life and career were chronicled closely, and his personal traits and private and professional conduct were dissected and analyzed with fascination in gossip and press columns, in magazines and books, and in the newsrooms and bars where those who had worked for or against him told their tales of admiration and woe.
 The extraordinary interest was rooted only partly in the methods, achievements and faults of a powerful figure in journalism; it came, too, from the man himself: a table-pounding, globe-trotting adventurer who shattered the stereotype of the genteel Times editor with his gut fighter's instincts and his legendary bouts of anger.
 Canadian-born, reared in poverty in the Bronx, he had a childhood scarred by the deaths of his father and four of his five sisters, and by a disease that crippled his legs for a year, forced him to drop out of high school and left him a teenage charity patient. Friends later called it a hard beginning for a life of struggle.
 A gravel-voiced, jowly man with a tight smile, a shock of black hair parted vaguely on the left and judgmental gray-green eyes behind horn-rimmed glasses, he was regarded by colleagues as complex, often contradictory. Not least, he saw himself as the guardian of tradition at The Times; but he presided over more changes than any editor in the paper's history.
 He often spoke of keeping the paper ''straight,'' and was tigerish in defense of high standards of reporting and editing, which called for fairness, objectivity and good taste in news columns free of editorial comment, causes, political agendas, innuendo and unattributed pejorative quotations.
 As managing editor from 1969 to 1977 and as executive editor until 1986, he guided The Times through a remarkable transformation that brightened its sober pages, expanded news coverage, introduced new production technology, launched a national edition, won new advertisers and tens of thousands of new readers, and raised the paper's sagging fortunes to unparalleled profitability.

Time for Change
 By the end of the 1960's, The Times, despite a distinguished journalistic history, had a clouded future. Its reporting and writing were widely regarded as thorough but ponderous. Revenues were declining, profits were marginal, circulation was stagnant, and some studies said The Times might be doomed in the age of television to join a dozen New York newspapers in the elephant graveyard.
 Mr. Rosenthal's objective, often stated in memos to the staff and in public comments, was a delicate one: to forge dramatic changes in The Times, to erase a stodgy image with a new look and to improve readability and profitability -- all this while maintaining the essential character of the newspaper.
 Many innovations during Mr. Rosenthal's tenure are familiar components of today's Times. He expanded the weekday paper from two to four parts, including separate metropolitan and business news sections, and inaugurated new feature sections for weekdays: SportsMonday, Science Times on Tuesdays, the Living section on Wednesdays, the Home section on Thursdays and Weekend on Fridays.
 Critics said the feature sections undercut The Times's reputation for serious reporting, and some called articles on gourmet cooking and penthouse deck furniture elitist in an age of homelessness and poverty. But defenders said the sections usurped no space from regular news and brightened the paper's tone. The innovations, highly popular with readers and advertisers, were copied by many newspapers across the country.
 Mr. Rosenthal also redesigned most of the Sunday feature sections; started suburban weeklies for New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island and Westchester County; and began a series of Sunday magazine supplements that focused on business, travel, home entertainment, leisure activities, education, fashion, health and other subjects. 
 The Sunday innovations drew a similarly split critical reaction -- defended as stylish and colorful, disparaged as distractions from important news. But most were also popular with readers and advertisers, and the supplements became sources of large advertising income.
 In 1980, Mr. Rosenthal also began a national edition of The Times, an abridged version of the regular newspaper that was distributed originally in Chicago and other Midwest cities and has since extended its reach nationwide. The national edition's pages today are beamed by satellite from New York to plants across the country, where they are printed for same-day regional distribution.
 Expanding general news coverage, Mr. Rosenthal enlarged the foreign and national news staffs and the Washington bureau, and pressed local reporting out into the suburbs of New York. Winning Pulitzer Prizes, sometimes two or three at a time, became annual events for the staff under the Rosenthal stewardship; The Times and its staff members won 24 Pulitzers during his years as editor.

Ad and Circulation Growth
 While many newspapers were struggling to redefine themselves and stay alive, The Times prospered under the presiding team of Mr. Sulzberger and Mr. Rosenthal. Lines of advertising rose to 118 million in 1986 from 87 million in 1969. Circulation increases in the same period were more modest -- up 80,000 daily to one million, and up 112,000 on Sundays to 1.6 million -- but most of the gains were made among higher-income readers, enabling The Times to raise its advertising rates and its profitability.
 Revenues of The New York Times Company soared nearly sevenfold, to $1.6 billion in 1986 from $238 million in 1969, while net income in the same period rose to $132 million from $14 million.
 As executive editor, Mr. Rosenthal, assisted by top lieutenants, including the managing editor Seymour Topping and the deputy managing editor Arthur Gelb, who was Mr. Rosenthal's closest friend and confidant, decided which articles would appear on Page 1 and what emphasis each would be given. His decisions thus helped shape the perceptions not only of millions of readers but also of government and corporate policy makers and news editors across the country.
 Mr. Rosenthal came to be regarded in government, in business, in the arts and in professional journalistic circles as the most influential newspaper editor in the nation, perhaps the world, with only Benjamin C. Bradlee, his counterpart at The Washington Post, as a possible rival.
 Behind the scenes, Mr. Rosenthal consolidated his authority over The Times's sprawling news and feature operations, ending the relative independence of the Sunday sections and of the paper's Washington bureau. He eventually assumed responsibility for all material published in the daily and Sunday Times -- everything but editorials, Op-Ed articles and advertising.
 Throughout Mr. Rosenthal's years as editor, press critics chronicled his rising fortune and the growing success of The Times. But they also described Mr. Rosenthal personally and as an administrator in generally unflattering terms and characterized his staff as rife with grumbling and low morale.
 Wielding enormous power to hire, reward and transfer subordinates, he personally approved all news staff promotions, raises and major assignments, shaping the pyramid of personnel under him and approving all major appointments to local news beats and to national and foreign bureaus. In the process, he made and broke the careers and dreams of scores of reporters and editors. Among those whose careers flourished under Mr. Rosenthal were two future executive editors of The Times, Joseph Lelyveld and Bill Keller, who now holds the title, and Anna Quindlen, the author and former Times columnist. In a newsroom atmosphere suffused with Mr. Rosenthal's tempestuous personality, there were stormy outbursts in which subordinates were berated for errors, reassigned for failing to meet the editor's expectations or sidetracked to lesser jobs for what he regarded as disloyalty to The Times. Others, meanwhile, won promotions, raises and access to his inner circle.
 Supporters of Mr. Rosenthal said his news and staff decisions were always journalistically defensible. His defenders insisted that his standards were necessarily high and that many staff members who objected to his style or opposed his decisions had themselves failed to measure up.

A Stormy Wake
 His critics, however, said that it was loyalty to the editor, not to The Times, that counted, and that many of Mr. Rosenthal's decisions to shuffle assignments or break careers were made in fits of anger. They also blamed what they called his combative and imperious style for many resignations, including those of some highly regarded reporters and editors, from a staff that in former days had rarely lost members except to retirement or death.
 Max Frankel, who initially lost out to Mr. Rosenthal in the competition to become executive editor but who later succeeded him in that post, assessed his predecessor in a memoir, ''The Times of My Life and My Life with The Times,'' published in 1999, five years after his own retirement. One chapter was titled ''Not-Abe,'' a reference to Mr. Frankel's belief that one of his tasks as executive editor was to set a more collegial tone in the news department.
 ''Abe Rosenthal left the newsroom with a reputation for brilliant, instinctive news judgment coupled with an intimidating, self-centered management style,'' he wrote. ''Most of his values were admirable, and many of his tactics were therefore forgivable.'' But Mr. Frankel added: ''His innermost judgments of people depended not just on their value to The Times but on their regard for him and his ideas.''
 The book began a public feud. Outraged by his successor's evaluation, Mr. Rosenthal, in interviews, belittled Mr. Frankel's tenure, and in an article in Vanity Fair ridiculed his observations and even his professionalism.
 Friends said that Mr. Rosenthal had often wondered aloud at the enmity he aroused and that he sometimes expressed hope that his detractors would someday see his objectives and the best interests of The Times as synonymous.
 On the day his last ''On My Mind'' column appeared, The Times, in a rare gesture, devoted an editorial to Mr. Rosenthal's achievements. ''His strong, individualistic views and his bedrock journalistic convictions have informed his work as a reporter, editor and columnist,'' it said. ''And his commitment to journalism as an essential element in a democratic society will abide as part of the living heritage of the newspaper he loved and served for more than 55 years.''
 At a White House ceremony on July 9, 2002, President Bush awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award, to Mr. Rosenthal and 11 others, including Nelson R. Mandela, Nancy Reagan, baseball's Hank Aaron, the tenor Placido Domingo and Katharine Graham, the late chairwoman of The Washington Post.

Son of a Trapper
 Abraham Michael Rosenthal was born on May 2, 1922, in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, the son of Harry and Sarah Dickstein Rosenthal, both natives of Byelorussia. His father, born Harry Shipiatsky, was a farmer who migrated to Canada in the 1890's, changed his name to Rosenthal and later became a fur trapper and trader in the Hudson Bay area.
 The Rosenthals had six children, five of them girls. Abraham was the youngest. When he was a boy, the family moved to the Bronx, where Harry Rosenthal became a house painter and Abraham attended school.
 In the 1930's, a series of tragedies enveloped the family. Abraham's father died of injuries suffered in a fall from a scaffold; one of his sisters died of pneumonia; a second died of cancer that had been misdiagnosed; a third died after giving birth to a child, and a fourth died of cancer.
 As a teenager, Abraham developed osteomyelitis, a bone-marrow disease, in his legs. It left him in acute pain, able to walk only with a cane or crutches. Because of the family's poverty, he received inadequate medical treatment; one operation was carried out in the wrong place on his legs, and while encased in a cast from neck to feet he was told he might never walk again.
 He was forced to drop out of DeWitt Clinton High School for a year. His family, meantime, appealed to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, and he was accepted as a charity patient. There he underwent a series of operations and eventually recovered almost completely, though he experienced pain in his legs for the rest of his life.
 Finishing high school, he enrolled at City College, joined the staff of the school newspaper and discovered that he liked, and was good at, reporting. In 1943, he became the campus correspondent for The Times. He wrote about campus life and, as did many others who became Times reporters, covered Sunday church sermons and wrote occasional brief commentaries, ''Topics of The Times,'' for the editorial page. He was diligent and eager, and editors soon eyed him as a promising young reporter.
 In February 1944, at a time when many staff members had gone to war, Mr. Rosenthal was hired as a staff reporter. Though he had only a few credits to go for a degree, the 21-year-old cub quit City College to devote all his energies to his new job. (Four years later, after he had established himself as one of the city's best reporters, City College awarded him a bachelor's degree. In 1951, he cleared up another long-pending formality, becoming a United States citizen.)
 After two years of local reporting that included several exclusive stories on Andrei A. Gromyko, the Soviet ambassador to the United States, Mr. Rosenthal was assigned to cover the United Nations.
 His byline began to appear regularly on the front page over articles about global tensions, economic and health problems, Security Council walkouts and figures ranging from world leaders to the men who shined their shoes.

Reporting on the World
 In 1954, he was assigned to New Delhi and for the next four years covered the tangled affairs and kaleidoscopic cultures of the Indian subcontinent. He reveled in its exotic diversity and developed a deep emotional attachment to India and its people.
 Mr. Rosenthal quickly established himself as an outstanding foreign correspondent. He was perceptive and aggressive, sensitive to the nuances of people and politics, fascinated with culture, art, history. He could write against a deadline with grace and a distinctive style, and he did not rely excessively on the American Embassy.
 Instead, he traveled almost constantly to cities and villages all over India. He made forays into Pakistan, Ceylon, Nepal and Kashmir. Once he traveled 1,500 miles into the Hindu Kush for the dateline, ''AT THE KHYBER PASS.'' His reporting from India was recognized in awards from the Overseas Press Club and Columbia University.
 In 1958, Mr. Rosenthal was transferred to Warsaw and covered Poland and other nations of Eastern Europe for two years. Writing articles that the censored Polish press could not print, he portrayed a nation whose political, economic, artistic and cultural life had been choked by Communist controls.
 He disclosed a food shortage that necessitated shipments of Soviet meat to Warsaw; wrote of Polish admiration for Western literature, films and art; and described Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev's chilly reception by the people of Warsaw and, a week later, a tumultuous greeting for Vice President Richard M. Nixon.
 Mr. Rosenthal's writing style was disarmingly personal: it was as if he had written a letter home to a friend. An article for The New York Times Magazine, based on a visit to the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz, was typical.
 ''And so,'' he wrote, ''there is no news to report from Auschwitz. There is merely the compulsion to write something about it, a compulsion that grows out of a restless feeling that to have visited Auschwitz and then turned away without having said or written anything would be a most grievous act of discourtesy to those who died there.''
 The 1959 dispatch that led to Mr. Rosenthal's expulsion called the Polish leader, Wladyslaw Gomulka, ''moody and irascible,'' adding: ''He is said to have a feeling of having been let down -- by intellectuals and economists he never had any sympathy for anyway, by workers he accuses of squeezing overtime out of a normal day's work, by suspicious peasants who turn their backs on the government's plans, orders and pleas.''
 His expulsion order charged: ''You have written very deeply and in detail about the internal situation, party and leadership matters. The Polish government cannot tolerate such probing reporting.'' Those phrases were cited by the Pulitzer committee the following spring when Mr. Rosenthal was awarded the prize for international reporting.
 After a brief tour in which he was based in Geneva and covered assignments in Europe and Africa, Mr. Rosenthal was sent to Japan for two years. He relished the assignment. Again, he wrote of people and politics, traveling frequently through the Japanese islands and to Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan, New Guinea, Okinawa and other destinations.

Ascending in New York
 In 1963, Mr. Rosenthal was persuaded by his mentor and friend, The Times's managing editor Turner Catledge, to give up the correspondent's life to become an editor.
 His first assignment was command of a large, tradition-bound city news staff, not with the usual title of ''city editor,'' but as ''metropolitan editor,'' reflecting new authority that he had demanded over a previously independent cultural news staff and a mandate for change throughout the newsroom.
 He soon transformed the staff. Ignoring seniority that had long determined which reporters got the day's top news assignments, he began favoring the best writers, regardless of age; he changed beat assignments that had stood for years; he began emphasizing investigative journalism and sent reporters out to capture the flavor, complexity and conflict of neighborhoods.
 He encouraged his staff to abandon the stiff prose and lockstep ideas that had long characterized local news in The Times, and invited articles written with imagination, humor and literary flair. He assigned pieces on interracial marriage and other topics atypical for The Times. And he assigned far more work than had been customary. While his moves upset many staff members, they also won praise from readers and his superiors and awards for the staff.
 One article assigned by Mr. Rosenthal, focusing on New Yorkers' fear of involvement in crime, recounted the murder of Kitty Genovese, a Queens woman whose screams were ignored by 38 neighbors while her killer stalked and attacked her repeatedly on a street for 35 minutes. The article shocked New York, and Mr. Rosenthal later wrote a short book on the episode, ''Thirty-Eight Witnesses.''
 Propelled by his performance as metropolitan editor, Mr. Rosenthal was named assistant managing editor in 1966 and associate managing editor in 1968. Later, as managing editor and executive editor, he often traveled abroad to meet correspondents and foreign dignitaries, sometimes wrote reflective magazine articles and spoke publicly on freedom of the press and other matters.
 Mr. Rosenthal and his first wife, Ann Marie Burke, who married in 1949, had three sons, Jonathan, of Clifton, Va., Daniel, of Milford, N.J., and Andrew, of Montclair, N.J., who is the deputy editorial page editor of The Times. The couple were divorced in 1986.
 In addition to his first wife and sons, Mr. Rosenthal is survived by his second wife, Shirley Lord, whom he married in 1987, and by a sister, Rose Newman of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
 A funeral will be held at 10:30 a.m. Sunday at Central Synagogue, at Lexington Avenue and 55th Street in Manhattan. 
 Mr. Rosenthal's final column for The Times was a summation of his life and his career in journalism. ''As a columnist,'' he wrote, ''I discovered that there were passions in me I had not been aware of, lying under the smatterings of knowledge about everything that I had to collect as executive editor -- including hockey and debentures, for heaven's sake.''
 Returning to those passions, chief among them human rights, he closed by saying that he could not promise to right all wrongs. 
 ''But,'' he wrote, ''I can say that I will keep trying and that I thank God for (a) making me an American citizen, (b) giving me that college-boy job on The Times, and (c) handing me the opportunity to make other columnists kick themselves when they see what I am writing, in this fresh start of my life.''

Iraq Plans to Unify Security In Baghdad to Curtail Chaos
Senior Iraqi leaders are preparing a major restructuring of Baghdad's security brigades that would place all policemen and paramilitary soldiers under a single commander and in one uniform, in hopes of curtailing the sectarian chaos that is ravaging the city. The reorganization also calls for a reduction of American troops in the city itself. A1

HEADLINE: As Gazans Wait for Aid, Their Situation Is Dire

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: GAZA, May 4 

 BODY:
In the gold souk of Kisariya, the oldest part of Gaza City, named after Caesar, the market goes only one way these days. ''Everyone is selling -- no one is buying,'' said Rafiq Ayyad, 65, a jeweler and dealer here for 40 years. ''I've rarely seen it so bad.''
 Imad and Sanaa al-Kassar, 23 and 21, were married nine months ago. With Sanaa 6 months pregnant, they came to sell the gold jewelry he gave her for the wedding. ''We need the money for the baby,'' she said. Imad, an employee of the bankrupt and isolated Palestinian Authority, has not been paid in two months.
 Zahiya Abu Watfa, 70, was selling an exquisite bracelet of gold coins that she had owned since 1956. She needs the money for food and to help her children. 
 Jewelry, like land, is a traditional investment here, one of the last possessions to be sold. But conditions are getting dire for many, with 35 percent of the Gaza Strip's 1.4 million people dependent on salaries from the Palestinian Authority. Credit is exhausted and the economy is slowing down. 
 Tension is palpable between armed groups of supporters of Hamas, which runs the new government, and Fatah, the faction of the longtime leaders, who lost power in elections in January.
 Gazans are wary, watchful and increasingly angry at their plight. For now they are angry at the United States for withholding financial support over the Hamas victory. But their anger may also turn against Hamas, whose refusal to recognize Israel has isolated its government, some Fatah leaders warn. 
 [Already there have been clashes, which worsened Monday, when three Palestinians died in Fatah-Hamas fighting near Khan Yunis in the south, and continued Tuesday, when 12 Palestinians were wounded, including five schoolchildren and four Fatah members.]
 After Hamas took over the Palestinian Authority, Israel stopped transferring $50 million a month in tax and customs revenues, and the United States and European Union cut most of their aid, including budget support, since Hamas is listed as a terrorist group by the United States, the European Union and Israel.
 ''The Palestinians are furious with the United States, which presses democracy and then punishes us for our free vote,'' said Ahmed Yousef, a political adviser to Prime Minister Ismail Haniya, a Hamas leader. 
 ''It took the Islamists more than two decades to decide to participate in democratic voting,'' Mr. Yousef said. ''For us it's a big step in the right direction. But this is selective democracy -- not what the people decide, but whether their decision fits America or not.''
 [On Tuesday in New York, the United States and the European Union agreed to create a temporary mechanism, which would bypass the Palestinian Authority, to provide medical and other aid, plus some European money for salaries. But the monthly salary bill is $120 million, and while March salaries may be paid, there is little for April, let alone May. The entire European Union yearly aid for the Palestinians would cover about 10 percent of the annual salary bill.]
 Mr. Yousef echoed Mr. Haniya's conviction that the Palestinians would stand by Hamas, preserve their dignity and live, if necessary, ''on olives and zatar,'' a local spice of sumac and sesame.
 But Talal Okal, a political scientist at Al Azhar University here, is not so sure how long Palestinians will remain steadfast. ''When a father cannot feed his family, he may ask himself whether he should starve for the dignity of Hamas,'' Mr. Okal said. ''The dignity of the family may be more important than the dignity of Hamas. Gaza is very fragile right now.''
 America's policy, Mr. Okal said, ''is morally ambiguous, trying to push Hamas'' to change ''by creating what could be a human catastrophe.''
 Still, he said, it may work. ''Hamas will remain in the government and have to change its political program or leave the government, which I believe it will not do,'' he said. ''Hamas in government is the beginning of a bigger Islamic project in the region, and Hamas believes that the United States doesn't mind experimenting a little if Hamas can become a more moderate model for the region.''
 The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, who also leads Fatah, is trying to be a bridge between Hamas and the world, and between Hamas and Fatah. 
 But he is also being pressed by Muhammad Dahlan, the local Fatah leader here, who also controls the Preventive Security police here, to confront Hamas, say Palestinians and Western diplomats. Mr. Dahlan did not respond to requests for an interview. At the same time, Mr. Abbas recently warned Mr. Haniya publicly that the president had the power to dismiss the government.
 But Hamas is also at work, organizing pro-government rallies. More important, the Hamas interior minister, Said Sayam, has moved to restore law and order. Supposedly to support the discredited police, he created a force consisting of Palestinian militant groups that attack Israel. They include many members of Hamas's own armed wing and are led by Jamal Abu Samhadana, leader of the Popular Resistance Committees.
 Israel condemned the new group, and Mr. Abbas ordered it disbanded, but his order was, as so often, ignored. The group will include some 3,500 ''volunteers'' in police uniforms with special armbands, said the Interior Ministry spokesman, Khaled Abu Hilal. 
 ''They are the elite of the Palestinian resistance against Israel, and they have moral authority,'' Mr. Abu Hilal said. ''Abu Samhadana is the right man for the job, no matter what Israel says. We can't wait months to end this incredible chaos. Those few months would be enough to destroy our government.'' 
 Hamas, he said, is also talking to the chiefs of Gaza's powerful clans, to get them to renounce violence.
 ''The big problem is the provoked chaos from the corrupted elements of Fatah,'' Mr. Abu Hilal added, leaving no doubt that he meant those around Mr. Dahlan. ''They have nothing left except to send a message to the world that your siege of Hamas is successful, so tighten it, to ensure that all channels of aid and support go to them.''
 Dr. Eyad Sarraj, a respected Gazan adviser to all sides, has encouraged Hamas leaders to at least recognize the idea of a permanent Israel. ''But for Hamas this is metaphysics, not politics -- it's ideology, that all of Palestine is Islamic land,'' he said. But like Mr. Okal, Dr. Sarraj also contends that having won the prize of the authority, Hamas intends to keep it. ''They won't leave power without a war,'' he said.
 In the gold souk, Mr. Ayyad, the jeweler, showed what he had bought from impoverished customers in a day: a mound of gold rings, earrings, necklaces and a 1907 American gold $10 coin. He picked out a beautiful bracelet of woven gold, with a snake's head and tail. 
 ''It's 21 karat, from Cairo,'' he said. ''But now no one will buy it, so I have to break it,'' he added, crushing the gold snake in his sinewy hands.

HEADLINE: Tax Benefits To the Rich And Patient 

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
As what may be the last major tax-cut bill from the Bush administration nears final approval in Congress, studies show that most of the benefits will flow to high-income Americans.
 The Tax Policy Center, a nonprofit venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, two policy and research groups in Washington, estimated yesterday that 80 percent of the tax savings would flow to the top 10 percent of taxpayers and that almost a fifth of the benefits will go to the top one-tenth of 1 percent.
The official estimate of the bill's cost, on Monday, was $69 billion. But this assumed that the tax breaks would be in place for only a year or two. If they were to continue for the next decade -- which President Bush and his Republican supporters want -- the cost would be more than 15 times as great, estimates by the Congressional Budget Office, an arm of Congress, showed. 
 The single most costly provision would protect more than 15 million taxpayers from losing part of these tax cuts to the alternative minimum tax. 
 The bill, approved by the House last night and coming up for a vote in the Senate today, would restore an exemption from the A.M.T. only for this year, at a cost of $31 billion. Most of the beneficiaries are likely to be married couples with children who own their homes and make $75,000 to $500,000 a year. 
 Continuing this provision, known as the ''A.M.T. patch,'' for nine more years would increase the cost to the Treasury to more than $1 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
 The other major provisions in the bill primarily benefit Americans with much larger incomes and a small number of multinational companies.
 One provision would expand eligibility for Roth IRA investment accounts to anyone, regardless of income. It would also allow taxpayers to roll any money in traditional retirement vehicles into Roth IRA's, where all the gains are tax-free. 
 This provision is treated in the legislation as a revenue-raiser because in the first two years, a large number of people are expected to roll over their traditional retirement plans and pay taxes on the gains. But once the investments have been moved into the Roths, they will never again generate taxes.
 For each $1 the government will collect in the short run, it will lose $1.60 or more, said Leonard Burman, co-director of the Tax Policy Center. Mr. Burman added that his estimate ''doesn't include all the aspects'' of the conversion and is therefore low. 
 Another provision in the bill would extend to 2010 the 15 percent tax rate on most dividends and capital gains, a benefit heavily favoring those who make $1 million or more a year, according to the Tax Policy Center. The Joint Committee on Taxation, which makes the official tax estimates, has said this provision will save investors almost $51 billion through 2010.
 Big beneficiaries of a third provision in the bill include Citicorp and General Electric, though they are not named in the bill. The provision, aimed at corporations that earn profits overseas through their financing arms, would save them $4.8 billion in taxes through 2008.
 House Republicans are eager to show that they have not weakened in their promises to lower taxes, especially, they say, on middle-class families with children and on investors.
 The possibility that the Democrats might regain control of the House or the Senate in the November elections has added to pressure on the tax-cutters. Democrats have indicated that they will ratchet back tax breaks for the richest Americans, but have not laid out a comprehensive philosophy on taxes. 
 Short-term tax cuts often end up being extended because an expired tax break can be seen as a tax increase. 
 Therefore, tax experts question the joint tax committee's official estimate of the cost of the bill at almost $70 billion. 
 That includes the $31 billion for the A.M.T. patch. But the figure is for 2006 only. 
 If the provision is maintained for 10 years and indexed for inflation, the cost in lost revenue is $691 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. If the other tax cuts are made permanent, that would increase the cost of the patch to $1.05 trillion, the budget office estimated, or 34 times the official estimate by the joint tax committee.
 The provision extending the reduced 15 percent tax rate for long-term capital gains and most dividends would save investors almost $51 billion, but that assumes that the reduced rates will continue only through 2010. If the provisions are continued through 2015, the cost would at least double.
 The Roth IRA provision allowing anyone to do tax-free investing is officially estimated to generate $6.4 billion in additional taxes even though, by definition, tax-free investment gains mean zero income to the government. 
 Current law limits Roths to married couples who make less than $160,000 and single people making less than $110,000. President Bush has said he believes that most investment income should be free of tax, the concept embedded in his statements that a dollar should be taxed only once.
 Mr. Burman noted that anyone, under current law, may create an individual retirement account with after-tax funds and defer taxes on investment gains until the money is withdrawn. He predicted that after-tax IRA's, which few Americans now have, will become widespread among the wealthy if the provision becomes law.
 A married couple 50 or older could contribute $50,000 in total to after-tax IRA accounts this year through 2010, then convert them to tax-free Roth IRA's. Mr. Burman predicted that this strategy would be heavily marketed by investment houses, in part because there are no mandatory withdrawals from Roths, while they are required for conventional IRA's once the owner is 70 1/2.


CORRECTION-DATE: May 13, 2006

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Thursday about the implications of tax legislation that passed Congress this week referred imprecisely to those who can create Roth IRA accounts, from which gains are tax-free. People of any income would be allowed to roll traditional retirement accounts -- on which taxes are deferred until withdrawal -- into Roths, but not allowed to contribute directly.

HEADLINE: Don't Worry, Be Happy

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Can you spare a moment for the nation's sole remaining optimist?
 The Times/CBS News Poll that was reported yesterday revealed that Americans are more pessimistic about the country's direction than at almost any time in the past 23 years. George Bush's approval numbers are so low that he's now only five points more popular than John Kerry and three points more popular than Al Gore.
 But from where I sit as president of the Prozac Would Be Redundant Society, all the negativity is a few months out of date. 
 First, look at some fundamentals. The International Monetary Fund predicts that the world economy will grow at 4.9 percent, which would be the second-fastest annual rate in three decades. Free institutions spread more quickly last year than in any year since 1972, when Freedom House began measuring these things. According to the Human Security Report, the number of wars with at least 1,000 deaths in battle has dropped by 80 percent since 1992. Air pollution levels are plummeting; over the last three years we've had the lowest level of ozone smog violations on record. 
 The reason people are down is not because their own lives are awful -- it's because they're suffering a crisis of authority. They no longer have confidence in the institutions that are supposed to maintain order in their lives, whether the topic's terrorism, gas prices or federal spending. 
 But even here, the latest news is good. Look around at all the green shoots of political renewal. 
 Not long ago, the temper-tantrum left seemed to be on the verge of capturing the Democratic Party, but now the Clintonite centrists are reasserting their intellectual, financial and political supremacy.
 Last month, Hillary Clinton gave a proto-campaign speech in Chicago, laying out an economic agenda that Kevin Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute called remarkably centrist. Clinton called for a return to ''pay as you go'' budget rules. Congress couldn't raise spending or cut taxes unless it filled the hole in the budget right away, the only effective way to restore fiscal balance.
 Robert Rubin and others have begun the Hamilton Project, which is churning out policy ideas that defy easy categorization and serve as a blueprint for an innovative, moderate administration. The Democratic agenda will be fleshed out by the free-trade progressive Gene Sperling, and by Rahm Emanuel and Bruce Reed, whose coming book will push ideas on how to increase savings and such. 
 On the Republican side, meanwhile, most of the news in the next 18 months will be made by John McCain, Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani. This is a party in the midst of fundamental change. Some of the professional conservative groups that claim they have veto power over who runs the party are about to be exposed. 
 The intra-Republican debate is less well developed than the Democratic debate because until a few months ago, conservatives passively awaited leadership from the White House. But that has changed, too, and the signs of rethinking are everywhere.
 Yesterday in the House, Mark Kirk and other Republicans unveiled a ''suburban agenda'' to help suburban families, not K Street lobbyists. On the Cato Institute's Web site, there is a roiling debate about fundamentals led by David Frum and Bruce Bartlett. These free marketeers acknowledge that in an aging society it's going to be hard to cut the size of government, so they ask, What do we do now? In The Weekly Standard, Irwin Stelzer wonders if it may be time to cut the payroll tax and raise the top rates, to shift the burden away from those who bear the brunt of trade and immigration. 
 In short, the smartest people in both parties have shifted attention from the past to the future, and a sense of flexibility and promise is in the air.
 There's been an even bigger shift in attitudes about how politics should be done. The Stalinist on-message style is passe. The rising young politicians like Barack Obama and Lindsey Graham never talk in that predictable party-hack way. Mark Warner and Romney are building their campaigns around their ability to find common ground with political opponents. 
 The pseudopopulist renegades who rail against the establishment are being eclipsed by the canny establishmentarians. They're the ones who know how to use the levers of government to get things done. 
 Remember, my downcast fellow citizens, nothing stays the same. Spring brings rebirth, and the dewy green faeries of sanity are flittering down the think tank corridors and o'er the politicians' up-turned brows.

HEADLINE: Tax Cuts for a Favored Few

 BODY:
A puzzling aspect of Congress's latest tax-cut package is why its overwhelmingly Republican supporters believe that its passage will be a big win for them and their party. There's nothing in it for most Americans, and yet all Americans will pay its cost: $69 billion over the near term. That price tag will be reflected in incessant budget deficits, which will further impair the government's ability to meet Americans' needs, and force the government to borrow more, mostly from abroad, to plug the budget gap. 
 The bill, which was passed yesterday by the House and is expected to clear the Senate as early as today, has two main provisions. The first, and dearest to the hearts of President Bush and his allies in Congress, is an extension of the temporary low tax rates on investment income. The top 10 percent of income earners will get almost all of the benefits, and everyone else will get crumbs.
 To justify the giveaway, President Bush and Congressional Republicans insist that tax cuts for investors benefit everyone -- and pay for themselves -- by stimulating economic growth. That assertion is seriously delusional. Economic theory suggests that a fraction of the tax cuts' cost could, perhaps, be offset by higher growth, all other things being equal. But when a nation must borrow to pay for tax breaks, as is the case in the United States today, any ability of tax cuts for investors to spur growth is severely diminished. 
 The second major provision will provide temporary relief for taxpayers who have been scorched of late by the alternative minimum tax.
 Unlike investors' tax cuts, relief from the alternative tax is needed. But the short-term fix obscures a much bigger problem that is of Congress's own making. 
 The alternative tax has been unfairly afflicting taxpayers who are nowhere near the multimillionaire level, which it's supposed to target. Why? In part, the problem stems from the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003. The tax code is wired to detect when a filer's tax bill is very low relative to income, and to use the alternative tax to raise the tax bill. So the more that tax cuts reduce a filer's liability, the greater the chances that the alternative tax will kick in. 
 Lawmakers refuse to fix the problem once and for all because as long as the alternative tax lingers on the books, official budget estimates include huge amounts of revenue that it's supposed to raise. Of course, those outsized sums will never actually materialize because Congress keeps passing stopgap relief measures. But the revenue is counted anyway, allowing the administration and Congress to project far smaller budget deficits than will actually be the case. 
 After five years of duplicitous fiscal policy, Americans are catching on. And Republicans who see tax cuts as an automatic vote-getter may be in for a rude shock. Some two-thirds of Americans now say that the president's priorities, which clearly include ever more tax cuts, do not reflect their own.

HEADLINE: PUTIN URGES PLAN TO REVERSE SLIDE IN THE BIRTHRATE 

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 10 

 BODY:
President Vladimir V. Putin directed Parliament on Wednesday to adopt a 10-year program to stop the sharp decline in Russia's population, principally by offering financial incentives and subsidies to encourage women to have children.
 Mr. Putin's instructions, issued to a compliant Parliament that follows his orders almost without fail, formed the center of his annual address and signaled a new Kremlin determination to confront a problem that demographers have warned endangers the future of the Russian state.
 Russia's population, now about 143 million, has been falling since the collapse of the Soviet Union, trimmed by emigration, rising death rates and declining birthrates. Both the government and demographers predict more downward pressure, including H.I.V. infections, that could shrink the population below 100 million by 2050.
 Mr. Putin has raised the issue in the past, but never with such a clear set of instructions aimed at increasing the low birthrate, or at such length in a prominent speech. Among his proposals were one-time cash grants to mothers upon the birth of a second child, extended maternity leave benefits and a graduating scale of cash and day-care subsidies as a woman has more children. ''The situation is critical in that sphere,'' he said. 
 Mr. Putin also responded acidly to the Bush administration's recent criticism of the Kremlin for its turn away from democracy at home and its efforts to counter democratic movements in neighboring countries, citing what he called a double standard in American foreign policy. 
 Speaking not long after President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney had publicly met and complimented the records of two other autocratic presidents in former Soviet states -- Mr. Bush met Ilham H. Aliyev of Azerbaijan and Mr. Cheney met Nursultan A. Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan -- Mr. Putin suggested that Washington abandoned its public principles on democracy and human rights as it saw fit. Both Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have large reserves of gas and oil, and a growing ability to transfer them to the West. 
 ''Where is all that pathos of the need to fight for human rights and democracy,'' Mr. Putin asked, ''when it concerns the needs to realize their own interests?'' 
 He quickly shifted his tone, however, and veered away from the suspicious or angry screeds now common in statements by several prominent Russian officials, which have raised warnings of a deepening chill in relations with the United States. 
 ''Realizing the gravity of the problem, we should not repeat the Soviet Union's mistakes, the mistakes of the cold war years, neither in the political sphere nor in the defense strategy,'' Mr. Putin said, according to the translation provided by Federal News Service, a private transcription agency. 
 Mr. Putin addressed several other themes, including the need to improve education, revitalize old industries and incubate new economic sectors, and he spent considerable time addressing plans to upgrade military and security services.
 But the most detailed of his plans were directed at the decline in population. 
 His attention to this issue brought a rare moment of levity when Mr. Putin said, ''Now, the main thing, what we see as the main thing----'' and he was interrupted by a call from the floor. 
 ''Love!'' the voice said.
 ''Right,'' Mr. Putin answered. ''The Defense Ministry knows what the main thing is. Really, I am going to speak about love, women, children'' -- there was applause from the assembled officials -- ''family, and Russia's most acute problem today: demography.''
 The subject, however, was not light. Mr. Putin then warned that Russia's population had been declining by almost 700,000 people a year, and that the state must stop this fall. The shrinking birthrate could undermine the economy and tax the pension system, among other effects. 
 A number of other countries facing declining birthrates have offered similar incentives. Australia offers a $4,000 bonus for every baby, and recently proposed to pay all child care costs for women who want to work. Many European countries, including France, Italy and Poland, have offered some combination of bonuses and monthly payments to families.
 Some Japanese localities, facing near catastrophic population loss, are offering rich incentives. Yamatsuri, a town of 7,000 just north of Tokyo, offers parents $4,600 for the birth of a child and $460 a year for 10 years. Singapore has a particularly lavish plan: $3,000 for the first child, $9,000 in cash and savings for the second; and up to $18,000 each for the third and fourth. 
 Russia has good reason to emulate them, for the underlying data are grim. In 2004, for every 16 Russians who died, only 10.4 babies were born. And the average age of death for a Russian man was 58.9 years, far below other industrial nations and roughly two decades behind the life expectancy for an American male.
 Birthrates have also plummeted, falling from an average of 2.63 children per woman in 1958 and 1959, to 1.89 children in 1990 and to 1.34 children in 2004. These numbers are backed up by the sights on the streets of Russia's major cities, where families with more than a single child are a rare sight.
 Much of the fall in the birthrate is caused by economic concerns: low wages, shortages of decent housing and worries over finding a job and keeping it in a volatile economy, and with laws that provide little job security.
 Russian and international scholars and demographers have warned of the perils for years. 
 One alarming report, ''Russia's Health and Demographic Crises,'' by Dr. Murray Feshbach, was published in 2003.
 The crisis, he wrote, is a result of ''a constellation of occurrences that include not only infectious disease, but alcoholism, drug abuse, suicide, trauma injuries, astounding levels of cardiovascular disease, male/female estrangement and loss of family cohesion, declining physiological fertility, ugly environmental pollution and micronutrient starvation.''
 Since that report, several others have addressed the effects of rising rates of H.I.V. infection and limited efforts by the Russian government to thwart its spread. 
 By projections often cited in health conferences here, between 5 and 10 percent of the population could be infected by H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, within 15 years -- not as high a rate as in countries with the worst epidemics, but astounding for a nation that had tiny rates of infection when the Soviet Union disintegrated.
 In his speech, Mr. Putin moved quickly past the issues of adult health and did not mention H.I.V. at all.
 Instead, he took up the cause of large families, which was once also championed by Soviet leaders. He called for a wide range of subsidies and financial incentives, some to be paid by the government and others by employers. These include increasing government subsidies for children up to 18 months to about $53 a month for a first child and about $107 for a second child. Mothers currently receive about $25 a month for a child up to 18 months old.
 Mr. Putin also proposed maternity leaves as long as 18 months that would pay a mother at least 40 percent of her salary, and compensation for some of the cost of day care: 20 percent of the cost for a first child, 50 percent for a second child and 70 percent for a third. 
 For mothers who choose not to return to work, he proposed a one-time subsidy of about $8,900 upon the birth of a second child -- a large sum here. He suggested subsidies for adoptive parents as well, and investments in prenatal care, maternity hospitals and kindergartens. 
 Mr. Putin told the legislators to work on the details of these programs, and to have them ready to take effect in 2007. 
 State television swiftly threw its coverage behind the Kremlin. ''Putin is setting strategic goals for the country's development on which the necessary financial resources will now be allocated,'' Vyacheslav Nikonov, president of the Politika Foundation, a consultancy with close connections to the Kremlin, said on the First Channel.

HEADLINE: Fed Raises Rates Again but Clouds Next Move

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates again on Wednesday, its 16th increase in two years, and gave itself room to raise them again in June.
 As expected, the central bank nudged up the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks another quarter-point, to 5 percent.
 But the Fed also damped hopes of some investors that it might stop or at least pause before raising rates again. In its statement, the Fed asserted that ''some further policy firming may yet be needed,'' a signal that policy makers are leaning toward at least one more increase. But it also took care to keep its options open. 
 While investors expected the rate increase, the Fed statement seemed to worry them. The Dow Jones industrial average had moved higher in afternoon trading but fell after the announcement and ended about where it began. [Page C11.]
 Wednesday's statement illustrated the uncertainty that confronts the Fed and its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, as policy makers prepare to shift gears to a more neutral stance after two years of raising rates. 
 In many ways, the statement did little to clarify the muddy picture that policy makers have conveyed in the last month. 
 The central bank's priority on Wednesday seemed to be to make sure that it did not limit its options. It asserted that future decisions would be shaped more than ever by economic data rather than by a preordained strategy.
 ''The extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information,'' the central bank said.
 Two weeks ago, Mr. Bernanke told House lawmakers that the Fed might take a pause while it took time to assess the economy's direction. But on Wednesday, the Fed made no reference to pauses and gave a clear reference to the likelihood of another rate increase. 
 At the same time, the central bank suggested that it was not overly alarmed about the prospects of higher inflation and that it still expected the economy to cool to a ''more sustainable pace'' from the torrid growth rates of earlier this year.
 Some analysts said Mr. Bernanke was sending a tougher message about the need to head off potential inflation. The Fed's statement, which is supposed to convey the views of the entire Federal Open Market Committee, did not repeat Mr. Bernanke's suggestion last month to lawmakers that the Fed might pause in its rate increases.
 ''They're effectively saying that their bias is to raise rates at the next meeting,'' said Anton Pil, head of fixed income investments at J. P. Morgan Asset and Wealth Management. 
 Other analysts noted that policy makers expressed little concern about recent data that signaled higher inflation. Consumer prices increased 3.4 percent in the 12 months ended in March. The Fed's preferred measure of ''core'' inflation, which excludes the volatile prices of food and energy, has risen 2 percent in the last year -- at the top of Mr. Bernanke's comfort zone for price increases.
 Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics, a research firm, said the Fed might still refrain from raising rates at its next meeting, set for June 28 and 29, because it would probably have more data by then that show a sharp slowing in the economy.
 ''I am very sure that the incoming data, particularly consumer confidence numbers, are going to tank,'' Mr. Shepherdson said. 
 In their statement on Wednesday, Fed policy makers noted that economic growth has been very strong so far this year. But they repeated their view that growth, which rose to an annual rate of 4.8 percent in the first three months of this year, would moderate as a result of a cooler housing market and the lagging effects of higher interest rates and energy prices.
 ''As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appears to have had only a modest effect on core inflation,'' the Federal Reserve said. Continued growth in productivity has helped restrain costs, it continued. Inflation expectations ''remain contained.'' 
 Mr. Bernanke helped set off a sell-off in the bond markets last month after his remarks to lawmakers about a pause. 
 But last week, a financial reporter for CNBC, Maria Bartiromo, said Mr. Bernanke had told her at a banquet in Washington that the markets had misunderstood his intentions. Fed officials never confirmed Mr. Bernanke's comments, but many analysts concluded that he wanted to reassert his toughness against inflation.
 Bond investors showed greater anxiety about inflation after Mr. Bernanke suggested a pause. Prices of inflation-protected Treasury bonds jumped, often an indicator of increased worry about inflation.
 Andrew Tilton, an economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote Wednesday in a research note that the Fed was still likely to take a breather at its next meeting but wanted to convey its vigilance.
 ''This was a relatively subtle way of reminding the markets that the Fed is on the case,'' Mr. Tilton wrote, ''without unduly alarmist language about the inflation outlook.''

House Backs Tax Cuts 

The House passed a $69 billion bill to extend President Bush's tax cuts for investors for two years.

HEADLINE: The Start-Up as the First Step Up 

BYLINE: By PAUL WISENTHAL

 BODY:
At age 7, Jabious Williams recalls, he walked a mile to a self-serve Exxon station where he offered to pump gas for tips. Working after school and on weekends, he said, he typically earned $30 to $50 a day to help support his single-parent family.
 He and his brother, Anthony, grew up in Anacostia, a neighborhood in southeast Washington, plagued by gang violence. Homeless for a time, they lived with their mother in their aunt's two-bedroom apartment.
Four years ago, the Williams brothers founded SAJA Originals, a hip-hop fashion line specializing in custom-made T-shirts. The brothers said they could not have done it on their own and they credited a program sponsored by the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship called Adopt-a-Class. It provided them with a teacher and two mentors. 
 The number of people under age 18 living in poverty has reached almost 12 million, according to the Census Bureau, and 700,000 join their ranks every year. ''The dropout epidemic disproportionately affects young people who are low-income, minority, urban, single-parent children attending large public high schools in the inner city,'' according to a recent study financed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 
 The Williams brothers sought out school-based entrepreneurship programs to help support themselves, buy school supplies and to contribute financially to their family.
 Increasing numbers of successful entrepreneurs are mentoring low-income young people, offering financial support and contributing their skills in inner-city schools.
 ''There is a growing body of research that indicates that youth entrepreneurship pays dividends in college preparation and self-esteem,'' said Andrew B. Hahn, professor at Brandeis University and an expert on entrepreneurship for underprivileged youth. ''These programs wake up young people to new dreams and new options for their lives.''
 Jabious, now 19, said fashion was a natural choice for he and his brother. ''We were always interested in fashion and wanted to have our own clothing line,'' he said ''We asked this guy from church to design five shirts. We paid him $100, but soon after realized we could not make a profit.''
 Anthony, now 18, recalled that he and Jabious began by drawing cartoons on T-shirts and wearing their creations to school. The designs were unique and abstract, with positive messages like ''Dream Big'' and ''Shoot for Your Goals.''
 ''Jabious prays before designing every shirt,'' Anthony said. ''His creativity comes straight from his heart.'' 
 Soon, their eye-catching products became must-have items at Suitland High School in Suitland, Md. With some of their earnings, they gave their mother, Angela Stoudimire, $5,000 toward a down payment on their first home, in a better neighborhood, Hickory Place, in Suitland.
 The National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship provides more than 300 schools around the country with training seminars and a school-accredited start-up package for teaching young people basic business principles. 
 ''Low-income youth have special skills in entrepreneurship, and learning to run their own business helps them stay engaged with their school,'' said Steve Mariotti, the foundation's founder. 
 Financed in part by Pequot Capital, a hedge fund, and philanthropic groups including the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, the Goldman Sachs Foundation and the Atlantic Philanthropies, the organization has graduated more than 120,000 students from its entrepreneurship program over the last 19 years.
 Adopt-a-Class uses its curriculum and connects inner-city students with successful entrepreneurs for personal mentoring. Patricia Alper, its founder, and Philip McNeill, a mentor, taught the Williams brothers how to spot marketing opportunities, manage cash flow and inventory, and exploit marketing and sales. The brothers call their mentors twice a week for marketing strategies or financial advice.
 To date, Adopt-a-Class has 22 entrepreneurs mentoring students. Each must donate $10,000 a semester and spend at least two hours a month for five months either in an entrepreneurship classroom or working one-on-one with the fledgling business owners. 
 Mr. McNeill, one of the first mentors to sign on, draws from his own experience. His father died when he was 6 years old, and at 21, he was co-manager of the family grain elevator business and farm operations in Thomas, Okla. Currently, a managing partner in SPP Mezzanine Funding, Mr. McNeill works with students from Suitland High School. The best part of being a mentor, he said, is watching the students gain the self-confidence and poise to run their own business.
 Across the nation, there has been increasing interest among young people in running their own businesses. ''The nation's youth are looking at entrepreneurship as a major alternative career as they are being shut out of a shrinking job market in inner cities,'' said Carl J. Schramm, president and chief executive of the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. 
 Marie Harrison, 15, lives in a violence-ridden section of the Mission District of San Francisco where she struggles to get by as she cares for her 71-year-old grandmother, Maria, who recently suffered a stroke. Marie monitors her grandmother's blood pressure and helps prepares her food. She also helps raise her 12-year-old sister, Megan, as well as attend Immaculate Conception Academy.
 Marie has lived with her grandmother, who is her legal guardian, on the same block since she was just over a year old. ''The area where I live isn't safe. There's lots of drug and gang violence,'' she said. Last July, her cousin David was hit by a stray bullet.
 Every Saturday, she said, she looks forward to attending a sewing and fashion program sponsored by the Turning Heads Project, which helps poor young people in San Francisco become more economically self-sufficient. ''Marie gained a lot of self-confidence and new skills attending our sewing and fashion programs and learning entrepreneurship,'' said Jane Segal, her mentor and director for special projects.
 Marie said, ''We make pillows, skirts and purses in class.'' Piecing together fabrics donated by the Turning Heads Project, Marie fashioned her own prom dress. ''One of my high school friends bought one of my creations for $40,'' Marie said in a telephone interview. ''I'm saving the money for college. One day I would like to become a designer and own my own business.''
 One of her Turning Heads classmates, Patrice Moananu, 15, also lives with her grandmother, as well as five sisters in public housing in the Potrero Hill area of San Francisco. ''I work as a youth intern at my school almost every day to help with the family finances,'' Patrice said. ''I've attended the Turning Heads fashion and sewing program for about a year, where I learned about starting my own business. At first I wasn't good at sewing, but the class has given me a new skill and new self-confidence.''
 With her father in jail and her mother absent, Patrice attends school at the International Studies Academy. ''Turning Heads gives me a safe place to be on the weekends to stay out of trouble while making money,'' said Patrice, who is in the 10th grade. ''I would like to own my own travel business, or perhaps work in the fashion industry.'' 
 Sophie Aissen, 32, teaches Marie, Patrice and other Turning Heads students. Two years ago, she started SadieAndMitzi.com, a small online fashion business manufacturing pillows and clothing. She also works as a part-time bookkeeper. ''I want my students to understand that it's not easy running your own business on a day-to-day basis. Their high hopes must also be coupled with hard work.''
 The Williams brothers are branching out to other school locations in Upper Marlborough, Md., and the Washington metropolitan area. ''We are interviewing students to join our business team and market our products at different school sites,'' Anthony said.
 What is more, Jabious now mentors 20 other students in the program once a week at Roosevelt High School in the area. ''It is important,'' he said, ''to give back to our community for the financial blessings we've received.''

HEADLINE: Right for the Wrong Reasons: Why Galbraith Never Got the Prize 

BYLINE: By Robert H. Frank. 
Robert H. Frank, an economist at the Johnson School of Management at Cornell University, is the co-author, with Ben S. Bernanke, of ''Principles of Economics.'' E-mail: rhf3@cornell.edu

 BODY:
THE Nobel award in economics is not given posthumously. So John Kenneth Galbraith, who died last month at 97, will never receive one. Yet Mr. Galbraith was the most widely read economist of the 20th century and was also considered one of the most influential. 
 There are, of course, many distinguished economists who never receive a Nobel. But the list of winners also includes some whose work has had little lasting impact. So, why did the Nobel committee pass on each of its 36 opportunities to select Mr. Galbraith? 
In ''The Affluent Society,'' published in 1958, Mr. Galbraith argued that Americans would lead longer, more fulfilling lives if they spent less on private luxuries and more on their external environments. As he memorably put it: ''The family which takes its mauve and cerise, air-conditioned, power-steered, and power-braked automobile out for a tour passes through cities that are badly paved, made hideous by litter, blighted buildings, billboards, and posts for wires that should long since have been put underground.''
 The standards that define luxury consumption have escalated considerably since he wrote those words. Yet with 40,000-square-foot mansions going up all around us even as our government tells us we cannot afford to inspect most of the cargo containers that enter our ports, his assessment still resonates. Why, then, wasn't his work more warmly received by his fellow economists? 
 A succinct answer was offered by Milton Friedman, himself one of the first Nobel laureates in economics and both a longtime friend and passionate intellectual adversary of Mr. Galbraith. Interviewed just after Mr. Galbraith's death, he characterized Mr. Galbraith's work as ''not so much economics as it is sociology.'' 
 Although many economists shared Mr. Galbraith's skepticism about prevailing spending patterns, they were also skeptical of his explanation of the imbalance. According to standard economic models, consumers survey available goods, then select those that best suit their preferences. But in Mr. Galbraith's account, the arrow traveled in reverse: firms first decide which goods are most convenient to produce, and then employ marketing wizardry to persuade consumers to buy them. 
 Most economists readily conceded that firms would gladly exploit consumers in this fashion if they could, yet most also doubted that firms had the power to do so in the long run. Mr. Galbraith's account, they felt, gave short shrift to the inventiveness of greedy rival capitalists. 
 His critics argued, for example, that if consumers were paying high prices for goods of little intrinsic value, there would be ''cash on the table'' -- the economist's metaphor for unexploited profit opportunities. Rivals could thus earn easy money by offering slightly cheaper and better products, in the process luring exploited customers away. After all, the same marketing prowess that enabled Mr. Galbraith's firms to bamboozle consumers should also enable rivals to attract consumers to better options. 
 Mr. Galbraith's critics had a point. Indeed, his explanation for society's spending imbalance suffered from the same deficiency that has plagued arguments of social critics on the left since Karl Marx. Because it implied that greedy capitalists were leaving cash on the table, most economists couldn't accept it. To this day, however, many remain equally skeptical of Milton Friedman's competing claim that unbridled market forces ensure optimal allocation of society's resources. 
 Mr. Galbraith studied at the University of California, Berkeley in the 1930's. Had he received his training decades later, he would have been better equipped to come up with explanations that might have satisfied his critics. For instance, modern game theory, a staple of current economics programs, shows why bad allocations often occur even in highly competitive markets in which consumers and firms are doing the best they can individually. 
 The most compelling examples of such inefficiencies entail applications of the familiar stadium metaphor, in which all stand to get a better view, only to discover that none see better than if all had remained seated. Thus, Mr. Galbraith might have argued, consumers buy more luxurious cars in the rational expectation that the cars will deliver more than enough extra satisfaction to justify the cost, only to discover that when others follow suit, the effect is merely to redefine what counts as luxury.
 In response, Mr. Galbraith's critics might have asked, ''Why don't consumers just buy cheaper cars and vote for higher taxes necessary to finance better schools and a cleaner, safer environment?'' After all, sophisticated consumers should realize that since everyone else would also be paying higher taxes, the cheaper cars they would be constrained to buy in the high-tax climate would prove just as satisfying as the earlier, more expensive, ones. 
 Psychologists sometimes describe economists who pose such questions as having ''high I.Q. but no clue.'' One of the most well-documented findings in behavioral economics, a new field at the intersection of psychology and economics, is that consumers are often not nearly as sophisticated as traditional economic models assume. Had Mr. Galbraith studied behavioral economics, he might have poked fun at his critics for suggesting that normal people give even fleeting thought to how their own frames of reference might be shifted by others' spending. 
 Mr. Galbraith's arguments may have failed to win the approval of free market economists. Yet, unlike many of his critics, he recognized a bad allocation of resources when he saw one. Nobel prizes are sometimes awarded to scholars who are wrong for the right reasons, but almost never to those who are right for the wrong reasons.

HEADLINE: Hints of More Rate Increases Take a Toll

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street ended an uneasy session mostly lower yesterday after the Federal Reserve suggested that it might not be through raising interest rates, if necessary, to fight inflation caused by soaring energy and commodities prices. 
 The Fed's decision to increase its short-term lending rate to 5 percent was widely anticipated. But investors were rattled by the central bank's accompanying statement, which said that more rate increases could be necessary to contain inflation. The Fed indicated it would be closely watching economic data to determine its next step.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.88 points, or 0.02 percent, to 11,642.65. The Dow's record close of 11,722.98 was reached Jan. 14, 2000.
 Broader stock indicators declined. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 2.29, or 0.17 percent, to 1,322.85, and the Nasdaq composite index sank 17.51, or 0.75 percent, to 2,320.74.
 The dollar fell against most major currencies after the Bush administration said it would not label China a currency manipulator. Gold again exceeded a 25-year high of $700 an ounce, as it did on Tuesday. 
 Crude oil futures rebounded as worries about overseas supply cutoffs countered a weekly government report showing increased oil and gasoline reserves and greater refinery output. A barrel of light crude gained $1.44, to $72.13, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Cisco Systems posted a slight drop in quarterly profit but still managed to top Wall Street estimates. But the company's conservative outlook was a disappointment to investors, and the stock fell 93 cents, to $20.75.
 Walt Disney said its earnings grew 12 percent last quarter, helped by strong television ratings and increased theme park attendance. The shares rose 53 cents, to $30.11.
 Shares of Federated Department Stores dropped 97 cents, to $77.98, after it posted a slight loss for the first quarter and also forecast that future quarterly results would be below analyst targets. 
 Whirlpool lost 92 cents, to $92.17; it said it was closing three plants and cutting 4,500 jobs after its acquisition of Maytag.
 Declining issues led advancers by about 9 to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange, where preliminary consolidated volume of 2.35 billion shares topped the 2.26 billion that changed hands Tuesday.
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was unchanged yesterday from the day before, with the yield remaining at 5.12 percent.

HEADLINE: Text of the Fed's Statement On Interest Rate Increase

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after its monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates a quarter-point: 
 The Federal Open Market Committee today decided to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5 percent.
Economic growth has been quite strong so far this year. The committee sees growth as likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices.
 As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appears to have had only a modest effect on core inflation, ongoing productivity gains have helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check, and inflation expectations remain contained. Still, possible increases in resource utilization, in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities, have the potential to add to inflation pressures.
 The committee judges that some further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risks but emphasizes that the extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information. In any event, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to support the attainment of its objectives.
 Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Susan S. Bies; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Jeffrey M. Lacker; Mark W. Olson; Sandra Pianalto; Kevin M. Warsh; and Janet L. Yellen.
 In a related action, the board of governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate to 6.00 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco.

HEADLINE: Belatedly, Stardom Finds a 20th-Century Master

BYLINE: By MARIANNE ROHRLICH

DATELINE: Cleveland Heights, Ohio 

 BODY:
HE designed a punch bowl that sold at Sotheby's in 2004 for $254,400, and a metal lawn chair that became a 20th-century icon. He changed the economics of the trucking industry by moving the engine under the cab, eliminating the nose and creating a larger payload. And he redesigned the pedal car so that it could be stamped out cheaply, inspiring some to call him the Henry Ford of children's toys.
 Viktor Schreckengost may be the most prolific designer you've never heard of. 
But that is about to change. The Viktor Schreckengost Foundation, created by his family in 2003 to save and promote his work, has organized exhibitions at 130 sites across the country between now and August. The New-York Historical Society is displaying the $254,400 bowl, from the Jazz Bowl series, through June 26. 
 These events mark a milestone: Mr. Schreckengost, who has lived and worked out of the same large stucco house here since 1951, will turn 100 on June 26. In his decades of work for companies that made toys, dinnerware and commercial equipment, Mr. Schreckengost never tried to claim the spotlight of a star. Instead, he practiced an unpretentious Midwestern approach to design, pragmatic yet ambitious. 
 ''He is a product of Cleveland,'' said Derek Ostergaard, a design historian who grew up there, not far from soaring wall reliefs that Mr. Schreckengost created for the zoo. ''He was part of my life and I never knew it.'' 
 Mr. Schreckengost brought innovative and affordable products to millions of Americans and taught hundreds of young designers in the industrial design department that he founded in 1931 at the Cleveland Institute of Art, the first such program in the country. ''Vik was my model,'' said Joseph Oros, one of his students in the late 30's and the head of the team that designed the 1964 Ford Mustang. ''He taught me to look at a product and see how it could be improved. It has to beautiful and affordable.''
 Giuseppe Delena, a top designer at Ford Motor Company, said, ''He taught us that design is not only about how a product looks; it must make an emotional connection with the customer.''
 One day in April, Mr. Schreckengost sat in his sunny dining room, doing a crossword puzzle (without reading glasses) and sipping black coffee from his Free Form cup, designed with three legs to prevent tipping.
 Dressed casually in a cardigan, he looked two decades younger than someone in his 100th year. Picking up his cup with a smile, he pointed out that it was the Primitive pattern, adding, ''I made it for men.''
 As he looked back on a career that has spanned Deco to late-60's modern, Mr. Schreckengost seemed unimpressed by the prospect of belated stardom. 
 David R. McFadden, the chief curator of the Museum of Arts and Design in New York, contrasted Mr. Schreckengost's personal and professional style with the self-promotion of some well-known product designers. Today, ''design has become performance art,'' he said dryly. 
 When Mr. Schreckengost graduated from the Cleveland Institute of Art in 1929, New York was home to famous industrial designers like Raymond Loewy. ''We're now discovering regional designers who didn't get publicity or seek the same kind of name recognition the big city designers looked for,'' said George H. Marcus, a professor of design at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of ''Masters of Modern Design'' (Monacelli, 2005). 
 Mr. Schreckengost trained as an artist and a ceramicist at the Art Institute and in Vienna, and was therefore able to ''bridge the worlds of art, design and craft more than other industrial designers'' of the time, Mr. Marcus said. One of his earliest and most famous pieces was the ceramic Jazz Bowl, a punch bowl with a New York theme, ordered by Eleanor Roosevelt. He remembers struggling to get the price of some versions of the bowl down from the then-exorbitant sum of $50 to $25, to make it available to more people. 
 As an independent industrial designer, Mr. Schreckengost worked for dozens of companies and holds more than 100 patents. He ''made innovation available to everybody,'' said John Nottingham, a Cleveland designer and a former student of Mr. Schreckengost's. 
 His most significant legacy, though, is the influence he has had on several generations of designers. He retired from teaching three years ago and now serves as a mentor at the institute, where a group of students is working with him on a reissue of the Jazz Bowl. (It will be sold in a limited edition by the Schreckengost Foundation.)
 His house remains one of the best showcases of his inventions, his artwork and his commitment to early modernism. His original pedal car is parked near a Noguchi coffee table and a chest of drawers by Gilbert Rohde for Herman Miller. Batik fabrics, which Mr. Schreckengost made as a student, are used as throws on club chairs in the library, which is also furnished with plywood chairs by Charles Eames.
 His second wife, Gene, 70, a retired pediatrician (who jokes that she now practices geriatrics), shares his taste: their bedroom is furnished simply, with a bed dressed in white and one of his watercolors. 
 A third-floor studio, where Mr. Schreckengost has worked for decades, has stacks of the watercolors he used to create dinnerware patterns. Among the patterns are the Manhattan Flower Shop, for American Limoges, which is so quintessentially of its time that a miniature tea set is now made with the pattern for Molly, the 1940's-era American Girl doll.
 Mr. Schreckengost's dinnerware, now collectible, was at one time sold at stores like Sears, Roebuck, where products -- not their designers -- were promoted. ''Just as Martha Stewart gave easy access to good taste and design,'' Mr. Ostergaard said, ''so too did Schreckengost -- but without a name.''

HEADLINE: Cost and Safety Put Memorial's Striking Vision at Risk

BYLINE: By David W. Dunlap. 
E-mail: dunlap@nytimes.com

 BODY:
EVEN as they contemplate a radical revision of the ground zero memorial in the interests of economy, security and politics, officials promise fidelity to what they call the ''Arad-Walker vision,'' the architectural concept by Michael Arad and Peter Walker that won a juried worldwide competition.
 It is telling that they use the word ''vision,'' not ''design.'' 
That gives Gov. George E. Pataki, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation a lot of rhetorical maneuvering room.
 But how many revisions can the memorial sustain before that vision is diluted? Or lost?
 Significant features of Mr. Arad's competition entry were underground galleries, screened by waterfalls, surrounding pools within the voids marking the footprints of the twin towers. Victims' names were to be inscribed on low parapets. Visitors would be able to look up from the names, through a curtain of water, across an expanse of almost an acre.
 ''The sheer size of each space,'' Mr. Arad wrote, ''and the length of the ribbon of names circling each pool, serve to physically underscore the enormity of the destruction.'' (The impressiveness of the dimensions were strongly suggested by a full-scale mock-up of the waterfall and gallery, pictured above, that was constructed last year near Toronto.)
 If -- as seems increasingly likely -- the underground galleries are eliminated and the commemorative parapets are moved to plaza level, the ''Arad-Walker vision'' will certainly have been modified. Whether it will have been compromised is open to debate.
 The architects cannot say what they think publicly under their contract with the development corporation. But it is widely understood that Mr. Arad was already unhappy with the decision to eliminate two of the four ramps he originally proposed.
 Monica Iken, a memorial foundation board member and the founder of September's Mission, which supports development of a memorial park, said the loss of the underground galleries would be damaging.
 ''If you get rid of that, you will lose the experience of what the memorial is,'' said Ms. Iken, whose husband, Michael Iken, died in the attack.
 ''There is a meaning behind the descent,'' she said. ''You become immersed in that space and you enter a place of peacefulness, reverence, reflection and honor. And you become part of that experience. And you forget about everything outside.''
 Mary Fetchet, founding director of Voices of Sept. 11, a family group, and the mother of Bradley James Fetchet, who died on 9/11, said the original design ''recreated the pilgrimage that people took to the site.''
 ''It can't be done at street level, where you have the hustle and bustle of the city,'' she said.
 Many people do not share this view. A group called Take Back the Memorial, which has been highly critical of the planning process, asks visitors to its Web site, ''Where should the ground zero 9/11 memorial be built?'' As of yesterday, 2,773 respondents said ''aboveground'' and 552 respondents said ''below ground.''
 A recently disclosed memo from James K. Kallstrom, Governor Pataki's senior adviser for counterterrorism, called on the architects to ''significantly reduce the opportunity for a satchel charge explosive or airborne contaminant dissemination device to be cast, or a suicide attempt to be made into the void.''
 It stands to reason that if visitors were not standing around the bottom of the voids because there were no galleries to stand in, their attractiveness as targets would diminish.
 That is one reason that Thomas H. Roger, a foundation board member, said eliminating the underground galleries was worth a close look. His daughter, Jean Roger, was a flight attendant on the jet that crashed into the north tower. ''If you're talking about a briefcase bomb or nerve gas that someone is going to toss into the reflecting pool,'' he said, ''you have a situation where you're putting people in harm's way.''
 It was not the galleries but the broader notion of the voids that attracted the jury, said Paula Grant Berry, a former juror who is now a foundation board member. Her husband, David S. Berry, worked in the south tower. ''We were looking for the seed of an idea,'' she recalled. ''We liked that seed.''
 PERHAPS the voids now define a design line that cannot be crossed.
 The current cost estimate for the memorial and memorial museum is $672 million, out of a total cost of $973 million to build the memorial setting, including mechanical areas, utilities, roadways and other underground structures. State and city officials have set a budgetary target of $500 million for the memorial. ''This happens to designers every day,'' said Michael Van Valkenburgh, a former juror and a landscape architect. ''We're not exactly asking them to do this on a shoestring.''
 Referring to the memorial architects, he added: ''It's first up to Michael, then up to Pete and Michael, to answer the question of whether the vision has been compromised. Making iterative changes doesn't necessarily water down a vision. Other people imposing changes does.''

HEADLINE: Rensselaer to Build and House $100 Million Supercomputer

BYLINE: By ANAHAD O'CONNOR

 BODY:
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute announced yesterday that it was combining forces with New York State and I.B.M. to build a $100 million supercomputer that will be among the 10 most powerful in the world. 
 The computer, a type of I.B.M. system known as Blue Gene, will be on Rensselaer's campus in Troy, N.Y., and will have the power to perform more than 70 trillion calculations per second. It will mainly be used to help researchers make smaller, faster semiconductor devices and for nanotechnology research.
Under a plan announced at a news conference yesterday, Shirley Ann Jackson, the president of Rensselaer, said the institute, the state and I.B.M. would each invest about $33 million in the project over the next five years. The supercomputer is expected to be up and running by the end of the year, and will be named the Computational Center for Nanotechnology Innovations. 
 When completed, it will be the most powerful supercomputer at any university in the world, Ms. Jackson said. 
 ''This will be a hub that brings together university and industry researchers and allows them to build simulations of new nanotechnology-based products,'' she said. ''It will reduce both the time and cost associated with designing and manufacturing nanoscale devices and systems.''
 State Senator Joseph L. Bruno, who was also at the news conference, said the $100 million initiative would provide an economic boost to the region by attracting businesses and creating high-paying jobs. The initiative is a boon to Troy, a working-class town in upstate New York ringed by broken-down factories and housing projects from the 1950's. 
 The center, which will be based largely at the Rensselaer Technology Park, near the institute, is expected to create 300 to 500 high-technology jobs, Mr. Bruno said. 
 ''The bottom line to everything that's going on here is job creation, job retention and the expansion of our economy,'' Mr. Bruno said.
 Supercomputers are typically enormous, requiring centers the size of several basketball courts to house their specialized nodes and processors. The computer at Rensselaer, however, will be housed in a comparatively small building, about 20,000 square feet, and will be easy to power and cool, said John Buscemi, an I.B.M. spokesman.
 If it were running today, it would be the world's fourth-most powerful supercomputer, behind a group that includes two other Blue Gene systems. No. 1 on that list is the Blue Gene/L at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, which has a peak performance of 367 teraflops -- 367 trillion calculations per second. 
 The supercomputer at Rensselaer will have a peak performance of roughly 70 teraflops. To put that in perspective, it will be able to accomplish in a single second what a person with a calculator would need nearly 60 million years to perform, Mr. Buscemi said.

HEADLINE: From Albany, A Move to Cut Gasoline Taxes

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 10 

 BODY:
With New York State's gasoline taxes the highest in the nation, legislative leaders agreed on Wednesday to cut 4 to 9 cents a gallon from the tax, even as the oil industry says there is no guarantee the savings will actually reach the public. 
 The agreement comes as lawmakers across the nation are brimming with proposals to offer relief at the pump, though a recent proposal by Republicans in Washington to offer drivers $100 rebate checks was abandoned after being ridiculed as a political ploy. The New York Legislature is expected to approve the bill next week and send it to Gov. George E. Pataki, whose aides are reviewing the legislation. 
Federal, state and local taxes add an average of 67.9 cents to the price of a gallon of gas in New York State. New Jersey, by comparison, has taxes of just 32.9 cents a gallon. And gas taxes in New York have been rising alongside gas prices because state law requires that part of the taxes increase proportionally to the underlying price of gas.
 But should the measure win final approval, even the oil industry acknowledges that there is no guarantee that the savings will get passed on to consumers. 
 One reason is that gas taxes, for the most part, are levied when oil companies import fuel into the state and not directly at the pump. Though tax cuts at the wholesale level are passed down to retailers, small cuts would not necessarily show up in prices set by gas stations since variations of a few cents among stations are common. 
 ''I'm not sure consumers would see it,'' said Rayola Dougher, the manager of energy market issues for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry trade group. ''They might see something, but I'd be astonished if they saw 8 cents across the board.''
 New York's move is among a variety of measures being looked at nationwide as gasoline prices have topped $3 a gallon in many areas and the summer driving season nears. Last week, for instance, Gov. Mike Easley of North Carolina called for freezing his state's gas taxes.
 Proceeds from New York's gas tax are distributed to state and local governments. The legislative plan would effectively cap a state sales tax component of the tax at 8 cents per gallon, 4 cents less than the current tax. 
 It would also give counties the authority to take a similar step and save up to another 5 1/2 cents at current prices, which would reduce their local revenue. If all of the counties opted in, it would cost the state and localities about $450 million annually -- and it would mean the state would no longer profit from the increasing price of gas.
 ''State and local governments should not reap a revenue windfall from high gas prices,'' said Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, a Republican. 
 Theoretically, a driver filling up a Toyota Camry could save 74 cents in state taxes and as much as $1.76 over all in counties with the highest taxes, if they choose to opt in. But in reality, while a steep cut in gas taxes would almost surely be felt, modest cuts could be lost in the distribution chain from the oil companies to the gas stations, several oil industry officials said. And that could leave at least some of the tax relief in the hands of the big oil companies that have been reporting record profits.
 Legislative leaders said their bill would require that gas stations pass savings along to customers, and said that the State Department of Taxation and Finance, and the Consumer Protection Board, would be charged with assuring that the modest savings be passed to consumers through audits of gas station records. They said that gas stations did not do so would be fined $5,000 per incident. 
 Asked how they would guarantee such modest savings would reach consumers, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, the state's top Democrat, said, ''Guarantee is a hard thing to do,'' adding, ''You've got to look at market forces, you've got to look at pricing patterns.''
 Other legislators were skeptical.
 ''Are you going to have a thousand new Tax and Finance workers running to gas stations all over the state and comparing notes? I don't think so,'' said Senator Liz Krueger, a Manhattan Democrat.
 In an interview from a stop on the New York State Thruway on Wednesday, Ms. Krueger said a gallon of regular was selling there for $3.29. ''I empathize with the desire of government to try to be doing something, and it's not that I have opposition to this, it's that this isn't addressing the real problem,'' she said, adding that the nation should move towards tougher fuel economy regulations. 
 The gas tax cut was part of legislation that included other more modest energy proposals, including granting New York City the authority that other localities already have to reduce or eliminate the 4 percent local sales taxes on home heating fuels, a plan the Bloomberg administration has not signed on to. The legislation would also provide tax credits to people using biodiesel for home heating and credits of up to $500 for people who buy energy efficient heating systems.
 The Legislature also backed a plan already being carried out by Mr. Pataki to make alternative fuels like ethanol and biodiesel available on the New York State Thruway. 
 Peter Constantakes, a Pataki spokesman, focused on the alternative fuel measures in a statement. ''While we need to review the specifics of this legislation, the Legislature's proposal appears to contain elements that recognize the need to develop new sources of renewable energy,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Leader of Post-9/11 Revival Says He Will Step Down

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
John C. Whitehead, the former investment banker who has presided over the city's effort to rebuild downtown after the attack on the World Trade Center, is stepping down at the end of this month after more than four years as chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation.
 Mr. Whitehead said yesterday that he planned to make the announcement this morning at the 54th board meeting of the corporation, which has been instrumental in luring companies back downtown, expanding residential communities in the district and developing a master plan for rebuilding at ground zero. 
But Mr. Whitehead's latest job also may have required more fortitude and than his career on Wall Street, or his time as a diplomat. 
 He has had to wring money out of governments and juggle the often sharply competing interests of local residents, business leaders, cultural groups, the city, two states, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the families of 9/11 victims. His decision comes a month after the city, the state and the Port Authority finally put together a financial plan to build four towers at the site. 
 ''It's an emotionally charged site with a great deal of political and private interests,'' said Gov. George E. Pataki, who appointed Mr. Whitehead three months after the attack. ''But he always kept his eye on the public interest, and we can thank him for a job incredibly well done.''
 Mr. Whitehead, who turned 84 last month, will continue to serve on the board of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation, but he will turn over the chairmanship to Thomas S. Johnson, chairman of the executive committee. Mr. Johnson, the former chief executive of GreenPoint Financial, lost a son at the trade center.
 Mr. Whitehead's goal of building a monument that would rival the Lincoln, Jefferson or Vietnam Memorials is proving difficult. The foundation is currently trying to rein in costs, with estimates as high as $1 billion, without fundamentally changing the design. He said he was optimistic that construction will begin by Sept. 11. 
 ''This is the toughest leadership job I've ever had,'' he said yesterday. ''We've accomplished a lot. Lower Manhattan is a very different animal today than even before 9/11. I wish there weren't as many problems right now. But I'm 84, and I need to be relieved.''
 Mr. Whitehead, an avuncular man with a head of white hair, has led a storied life. A World War II Navy veteran, he rose to co-chairman at Goldman Sachs in a 37-year career. 
 He was deputy secretary of state in the Reagan administration, and a New York Times profile at the time said he ''startled a number of aides by his preferences for straight talk and crisp decisions.''
 Mr. Whitehead, who brought his own press agent to the development corporation with him, could be somewhat imperial. But he quickly established that he took the independence of the development corporation seriously, sometimes to the chagrin of the Pataki administration. 
 Three months after the attack on the trade center, Congress agreed to provide New York with $8.2 billion in emergency aid for downtown, including $2 billion for the new development corporation. State officials, who had expected the money to go to the Empire State Development Corporation, were dumbfounded. Still, he did not always have the full authority to make things happen.
 ''When New York City was experiencing some of the toughest times in its history, John Whitehead stepped up to the challenge and played an integral role in downtown's resurgence and revitalization,'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday. ''The city is grateful for the wisdom, experience and sensitivity he has provided, and we are committed to honoring his efforts by completing the plans he helped to create.''

HEADLINE: Housing Costs Change List Of Top Areas For Poverty

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 10 

 BODY:
A new report that adjusts the poverty line to reflect housing costs says New York, California and Washington, D.C., have the highest percentage of residents living in poverty, surpassing traditionally impoverished regions like the Deep South. 
 The report, to be released Thursday by the Public Policy Institute of California, took into account the high rents and utility rates in major cities like Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco and adjusted the national poverty line, about $19,000 for a family of four, accordingly. The results showed all three regions with significantly higher poverty rates than the Census Bureau reported in the fall.
Washington, ranked fifth poorest by the government, vaulted into the top spot, according to the report, with 21 percent of residents in poverty. New York, 12th by government standards, was second in the study, with 16.3 percent below the poverty line, while California went from 15th to third, at 15.7 percent. 
 Nationwide, 12.7 percent of Americans, or 37 million, lived below the poverty line in 2004, according to the Census Bureau.
 The author of the study, Deborah Reed, said it ''changes our perception of poverty mainly affecting the Southern states to something that affects high population states,'' where housing costs can consume a majority of income. 
 ''The biggest difference between California and New York and the rest of the United States is a high cost of living,'' said Ms. Reed, an economist with the policy institute. ''If you live in Mississippi and pay $6,000 for rent and you're at the poverty threshold, you have $13,000 left for everything else. But if you're in San Francisco and pay $21,000, you have nothing to pay for child care, preschool, books, etc.'' 
 The study also suggests that differences between federal poverty rates and adjusted rates could hurt large states like New York and California, which depend on such estimates to determine federal aid for programs like Head Start and food stamps.
 Ms. Reed said the study used fair-market rent statistics from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Some poverty thresholds were higher than the national rate, some lower. 
 Although the inclusion of California, the most populous state, with one of the biggest economies in the world, and New York, the financial capital, might surprise some people, other poverty experts said the poverty line could be statistically manipulated to prove a number of points. 
 ''People are always trying to put things in, on the left and the right,'' said Douglas J. Besharov, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organization in Washington. ''It's a shell game of trying to change attitudes.'' 
 Mr. Besharov said he was not shocked that states with large urban areas could have more people below the poverty line than less developed areas. 
 ''There's no question that it costs more to rent the same number of square feet in California than in Iowa,'' said Mr. Besharov, who had not read the institute's report. ''But the big question is, Do those higher costs result in a palpably lower standard of living? I don't know.'' 
 The Census Bureau does take into account housing costs when formulating alternate definitions of the poverty line, but does not break down those estimates by state, Ms. Reed said. A call to the bureau and an e-mail request for comment were not returned.

HEADLINE: Drug-Testing Loophole May Not Be Worth It

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
WHAT did Congress know and when did Congress know it? All right, that might not be the place to start. Those questions are relevant, but only if you are aware of the provision in the steroid-testing program that allows the union to terminate it and revert to the status quo ante. That's lawyer talk for what existed before.
 The Associated Press disclosed the existence of the provision, which links the testing program to the collective-bargaining agreement. The overall labor agreement expires Dec. 19. The provision says that if no new labor agreement is reached by Aug. 1, the union has until Aug. 15 to tell the owners it will terminate the testing agreement Dec. 19. 
Even though both sides understand the provision, what it means and what will probably result from it, the provision will most likely be a hot topic of conversation at the negotiating session that is scheduled for today. Yes, lawyers for the owners and the players have begun talks in their attempt to work out a new labor contract.
 They also met Tuesday, which means they will have met twice in three days. That kind of schedule can only be classified as post-preliminary. The two sides had previously acknowledged meeting, but they said the sessions were preliminary.
 Neither side has presented a proposal. But they are talking, discussing issues and facts. The lead negotiators -- Rob Manfred for the owners, Donald Fehr for the players -- declined to discuss the talks yesterday. 
 They declined to comment, too, on the possibility that Tuesday's talks became testy during a discussion of baseball economics. Major League Baseball is flourishing economically, and the union may have some thoughts about some of the elements of the economic system, like revenue sharing and debt service.
 Some players from the Boston Red Sox attended Tuesday's session and planned to attend today's, demonstrating that there is something other than the Yankees in their lives. 
 Beginning the talks this early doesn't guarantee an early agreement, but it's better than not talking at all. In 2002, the owners and the players actually negotiated a new agreement without a work stoppage. It was a stunning development, a unique achievement in 30 years of baseball labor negotiations.
 A desire to achieve a new agreement early was one of the reasons the union wanted the termination provision in the steroid-testing plan. If Commissioner Bud Selig thought there was a chance the union would invoke the provision, he might push his negotiators to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. That would probably mean not taking a hard-line stance on some of the issues. 
 But would the union actually consider invoking the provision? No one from the union or among the owners suggests it could happen. Why would the union take that step?
 Union officials reluctantly agreed last November to a more stringent testing program. The suspensions for positive tests were increased to 50 games, 100 games and life from the original 10 days, 30 days and a season. Why did the union agree to reopen the basic agreement a second time, when the first time had already been unprecedented?
 The answer is Congressional pressure. Selig knew the two-ton elephant was in the room and was certain the union did not want to prompt Congress to pass a steroid act itself. If the union wasn't going to defy Congress last year, it won't act defiantly this year.
 Ah yes, Congress. What a bunch of disingenuous politicians they are. 
 After The Associated Press contacted the office of Representative Tom Davis, chairman of the House Committee on Government Reform, for comment on the link provision, Davis wrote a letter to Selig and Fehr.
 ''As part of the Committee's ongoing review,'' Davis, a Republican from Virginia, wrote, ''I have identified a section of the new program that raises Congressional concern.'' 
 Citing the provision, he asked both men to assure him in writing that the provision ''does not leave open the possibility, under any circumstances, that the 2007 season will be played subject to the 2005 drug testing policy.''
 It would seem that Davis had just learned of the provision. But he and other critical Congressmen had received copies of the 33-page agreement months ago and had been briefed on it by Manfred and Michael Weiner, the union's general counsel.
 Robert White, Davis's communications director, acknowledged that Davis had the agreement and had received it ''a while ago.'' Why, then, didn't Davis know about the link provision?
 ''It's just something that didn't catch our attention at first,'' White said. ''It was just a matter that this one little provision didn't get any attention at first, and upon closer look we had some questions. We wanted reassurance that this wasn't going to be used as an escape clause to return to a weaker drug policy. We don't expect that it will be used for that purpose.''
 But it's nice to know that Congress knows about it now.

HEADLINE: All the President's Books 

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
In recent months a floodlet of books has been published about President Bush, his administration and the war in Iraq. They range widely in perspective: there are books by reporters, by administration insiders and by counterterrorism and economic experts; books with conservative, liberal and nonpartisan points of view; books that offer a wide-angle window on the administration; and books that zero in on particular aspects of the war in Iraq.
 Yet taken together with earlier volumes, these books create a cumulative and, in many respects, surprisingly coherent portrait of the Bush White House and its management style. Authors as disparate as the Reagan administration economist Bruce Bartlett, the New Yorker investigative reporter Seymour M. Hersh, the Weekly Standard editor Fred Barnes and the New York Times reporter James Risen point to ways in which this administration has discarded past precedent, and illuminate its penchant for circumventing traditional processes of policy development and policy review. 
It's a tropism, an instinctive reflex that informs the Bush White House's decision-making process, as well as its strategic and tactical thinking, a tropism that has played a major role in this increasingly embattled administration's approach to a host of issues from the war in Iraq to Social Security reform to the government's policy on torture. Many books about the Bush administration and the war in Iraq -- including ''The Assassins' Gate'' by the New Yorker writer George Packer; ''The Next Attack'' by Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon, former National Security Council staffers under Bill Clinton; and ''Squandered Victory'' by Larry Diamond, a former senior adviser to the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad -- also underscore related predispositions on the part of this White House: an appetite for big, visionary ideas, imposed from the top down; an eagerness to centralize decision making in the executive branch; and a tendency to shrug off the advice of experts, be they military experts, intelligence experts or economic experts.
 In retrospect, these patterns underlie recent complaints from more than half a dozen retired generals that civilian policymakers at the Pentagon ignored the advice of military officers, and new charges by two C.I.A. veterans that the Bush administration selectively ignored crucial intelligence assessments about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. 
 The administration's proclivity for broad-stroke, out-of-channels, even improvisatory policymaking is partly a function of the personalities of key administration figures beginning with Mr. Bush, a self-proclaimed gut player who prizes ''the vision thing'' over detailed analysis and continuing debate. And it's partly a reflection of an ideological outlook: a determination, in the wake of 9/11, to amp up presidential power, which many conservatives believe was diminished after Watergate; and a relativistic view of experts as bean counters beholden to the liberal establishment and status quo, a perspective linked with this White House's inclination to characterize everyone from reporters to members of the uniformed military to global-warming scientists as agenda-driven interest groups. 

Inflexibility or Fresh Approach?
 While critics of the president see his certainty as a sign of inflexibility, intellectual isolation and a reluctance to make course corrections, Bush boosters -- who are fond of describing him as proactive, imaginative and unflinching -- see his willingness to defy conventional wisdom as an asset. For them the administration's impatience with traditional policymaking channels means fresh approaches to old problems and a healthy disdain for plodding bureaucracy, and it also synchronizes with the ''Persona'' of the president, outlined by Karl Rove in a campaign brief: a ''Strong Leader'' with a penchant for ''Bold Action'' and ''Big Ideas.'' 
 In ''The Right Man,'' Mr. Bush's former speechwriter David Frum boasts that the president's post-9/11 decisions ''discarded thirty-five years of American policy in the Middle East and repudiated the foreign policies of at least six of the previous seven U.S. presidents.'' And in ''Rebel-in-Chief,'' his recent paean to the president, Fred Barnes describes Mr. Bush as an innovative leader who ''operates in Washington like the head of a small occupying army of insurgents,'' a visionary who finds it ''easy to overturn major policies with scarcely a second thought.'' 
 Mr. Barnes (who interviewed Mr. Bush, as well as other principals in the administration for his book) writes that the president was audacious in his decision ''to sideline the national security policy of containment'' that had been in place since World War II and bold in his willingness ''to defy the foreign policy establishment and old allies,'' even though he acknowledges that Mr. Bush ''wasn't well versed'' on the subject of the Middle East when he came into office and ''had run for president almost solely on domestic issues.'' On Social Security, Mr. Barnes says, the president ambitiously chose ''the extreme option, the most controversial and least likely to pass.''
 For critics of Mr. Bush, his willingness to toss out precedent and boldly go where few have gone before smacks of arrogance and hubris, and indicates a disregard for both history and long-term consequences. As Francis Fukuyama, the apostate neoconservative, writes in his new book ''America at the Crossroads,'' great leadership may involve ''putting aside self-doubt'' and ''bucking conventional wisdom,'' but ''bad leadership can also flow from these same characteristics: steely determination can become stubbornness; the willingness to flout conventional wisdom can amount to a lack of common sense.''
 Mr. Barnes may regard the president's aversion to managing ''a problem or a dispute or a broken relationship'' as an indication that he is firmly focused on the big picture, but the former counter-terrorism czar Richard A. Clarke, writing in ''Against All Enemies,'' argues that Mr. Bush looks for ''the simple solution, the bumper sticker description of the problem.'' Issues like terrorism and Iraq require substantive analysis, Mr. Clarke goes on, but ''Bush and his inner circle had no real interest in complicated analyses; on the issues that they cared about, they already knew the answers.'' 
 Supporters of Mr. Bush regard his go-it-alone management style, like his administration's unilateralism in foreign policy, as a sign of strength. Mr. Bush ''has used his presidential speeches to advance policies far beyond where his aides expected him to go,'' Mr. Barnes writes. ''Rather than reflect policy, his speeches dictate policy.'' Of Mr. Bush's second inaugural address in which he enunciated a goal of ending tyranny around the world, Mr. Barnes says he teased Condoleezza Rice: '' 'You're not going to believe what I say,' he told her. 'I hope I get to see it before you give it,' Rice responded. What she and other senior Bush advisers later saw was a near-final draft to which only minor changes could be made. The thrust of the speech -- the new direction, the policy declaration -- had been set.'' 

Sidestepping Usual Channels
 The fallout of the Bush administration's penchant for out-of-channels policymaking would be felt most acutely in the build-up to the war in Iraq. James Risen -- the New York Times reporter who won a Pulitzer Prize with Eric Lichtblau for exposing the government's secret domestic wiretapping program -- observes in his new book ''State of War'' that ''the national security bureaucracy is maddeningly slow,'' but its checks and balances provide an important ''moderating influence.'' The president and his principals ''held almost constant, crisis-atmosphere meetings, making decisions on the fly,'' after 9/11, Mr. Risen writes. ''Instead of proposals gradually rising up through the normal layers of the government, they were introduced and imposed from above. Debate was short-circuited.'' 
 The usual channels for intelligence assessment were sidestepped too, contributing to incorrect prewar assertions that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. In ''Chain of Command,'' a book based on his groundbreaking New Yorker reporting, Seymour M. Hersh notes that an intelligence operation was set up at the Pentagon as a kind of alternative to the C.I.A. It was created, he writes, to find evidence of what Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz and his boss, Donald Rumsfeld already ''believed to be true -- that Saddam Hussein had close ties to Al Qaeda, and that Iraq had an enormous arsenal of chemical, biological, and possibly even nuclear weapons.'' Much of what the Pentagon unit reviewed was raw data, unvetted by intelligence professionals; it was cherry-picked for its usefulness in supporting the hawks' idees fixes about Iraq, says Mr. Hersh, and then stovepiped ''directly to the Vice President's office, and then on to the President.'' 
 Several books on the Iraq war also argue that because of Vice President Dick Cheney's enormous power, because of infighting between the Defense and State Departments, and because of the reluctance of the former national security adviser, Ms. Rice, to knock heads, the role of the National Security Council -- which is supposed to advise the president and forge interagency consensus -- was diminished in the days before the war.
 In ''The Next Attack,'' Mr. Benjamin and Mr. Simon write that essential decision making and planning did not take place in what Larry Wilkerson, then Secretary of State Colin Powell's chief of staff, calls ''the statutory process of the NSC but in the parallel process run by Cheney,'' who had assembled his own national security staff of 14 and who maintained direct ties to his old friend Mr. Rumsfeld at the Pentagon. 

For War, a 'Decision Happened'
 According to books published so far, even the ultimate decision to go to war against Iraq -- a war that has already resulted in, as of Tuesday, 2,416 (and counting) United States military deaths, and an estimated more than 35,000 Iraqi deaths (according to Iraq Body Count, an independent media-monitoring group) -- seems to have been somewhat ad hoc. In ''The Assassins' Gate,'' Mr. Packer quotes Richard Haass, the former director of policy planning in the State Department, saying that a real weighing of pros and cons about the war never took place: ''It was an accretion, a tipping point,'' Mr. Haass says. ''A decision was not made -- a decision happened, and you can't say when or how.''
 Bob Woodward writes in ''Plan of Attack'' that ''other than Rice, Bush said he didn't need to ask the principals whether they thought he should go to war'': ''He knew what Cheney thought, and he decided not to ask Powell or Rumsfeld'' because he says he ''could tell what they thought.'' Mr. Woodward, who has a third book on the Bush administration in the works, also suggests that simple momentum -- including a build-up of troops in the region -- became a factor in the president's decision to go to war. 
 Preparations for the occupation, by all accounts, were even more disorganized. ''Planning efforts were undertaken in several different parts of the bureaucracy with little or no coordination,'' Steven Simon and Daniel Benjamin write in ''The Next Attack,'' adding that many officials were ''working 'out of channels,' issuing directives without ever having their plans scrubbed in the kind of tedious, iterative process that the government typically uses to make sure it is ready for any contingency.'' 
 To make matters worse, arguments that dissented from the rosy postwar story lines envisioned by administration hard-liners tended to be shrugged off. Francis Fukuyama contends that neoconservative policymakers, who felt they had been looked down upon by the foreign policy establishment for years, were ''excessively distrustful of anyone who did not share their views.'' 
 ''Bureaucratic tribalism exists in all administrations, but it rose to poisonous levels in Bush's first term,'' Mr. Fukuyama writes. ''Team loyalty trumped open-minded discussion, and was directly responsible for the administration's failure to plan adequately for the period after the end of active combat.'' 
 Even though the State Department had led postwar efforts in Afghanistan and the Balkans, the Pentagon was initially given authority for the administration and rebuilding of Iraq. Because of ideological and turf battles, the State Department's Future of Iraq Project -- which, Larry Diamond says addressed ''key problems that would confront the postwar order in Iraq'' -- was largely ignored. 

Ignoring Expert Advice
 Virtually every book about the war in Iraq -- whether by a reporter, or a military, intelligence or Coalition Provisional Authority insider -- is replete with examples in which expert advice was ignored or rebuffed by the administration. In ''The Assassins' Gate,'' Mr. Packer reminds us that before the invasion, the Army chief of staff, Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that postwar Iraq would require ''something on the order of several hundred thousand soldiers'' and was shot down a few days later by Mr. Wolfowitz, who declared his estimate ''wildly off the mark.'' 
 Mr. Packer also reports that Gen. Anthony C. Zinni -- who as the former commander in chief of United States Central Command had prepared a contingency plan for Iraq should Saddam Hussein ever fall -- learned that his plan had been dismissed at the Pentagon as ''too negative.'' And Mr. Bush's economic adviser Lawrence Lindsay, who predicted that the war could cost as much as $200 billion (some current estimates are already running as high as a trillion dollars) was, in Mr. Packer's words, ''quickly reprimanded and eventually fired.'' 
 The Rand Corporation, the Army War College, the United States Institute of Peace, and the Institute for National Strategic Studies of the National Defense University also produced reports, Mr. Packer notes, that ''were striking for their unanimity of opinion'': ''Security and reconstruction in postwar Iraq would require large numbers of troops for an extended period, and international cooperation would be essential.'' These troops would be needed to seal the country's borders, secure armament caches, contain local militias and restore a sense of law and order. Last month, Colin Powell gave an interview in which he said that he too had recommended before the war that a higher number of troops be sent to Iraq.
 These warnings were not heeded by the administration, writes Mr. Diamond, because those numbers did not fit in with its willfully optimistic assumptions that ''American troops would be welcomed as liberators by an Iraqi population joyous at their deliverance from the clutches of Saddam's regime, that resistance would be limited, and that the Iraqi state would remain intact.'' Nor did they fit in with Mr. Rumsfeld's determination to transform the military and to conduct the war with a lighter, faster force. 
 Mr. Diamond, a leading American scholar on democracy and democratic movements, went to Baghdad as an adviser to the Coalition Provisional Authority at the behest of Ms. Rice, his old Stanford University colleague. He came away convinced that postwar problems in Iraq -- an increasingly virulent insurgency, the creation of a new breeding ground for terrorists, and metastasizing ethnic and religious tensions -- were the result of a series of missteps and misjudgments made by the Pentagon and Bush White House. 
 Upon his return to the United States in 2004, Mr. Diamond says he wrote Ms. Rice a long memo, recommending that America ''disavow any long-term military aspiration in Iraq,'' establish a target date for the withdrawal of our forces, respond to concerns about Iraqi detainees and send ''significantly more troops and equipment.'' He says he never heard back from her. 

Bremer and the Administration
 L. Paul Bremer III, America's former proconsul in Iraq, was similarly stonewalled by the administration on the question of troop levels. In his recent memoir, ''My Year in Iraq'' (written with Malcolm McConnell), he says that before leaving for Iraq in May 2003, he sent Mr. Rumsfeld a copy of the Rand report estimating that 500,000 troops would be needed to stabilize postwar Iraq (more than three times the number of troops then deployed); he says he never heard back from the defense secretary.
 A year later Mr. Bremer sent Mr. Rumsfeld a message saying that ''the deterioration of the security situation since April had made it clear, to me at least, that we were trying to cover too many fronts with too few resources'' and recommended that the Pentagon consider the deployment of ''one or two additional divisions for up to a year.'' Once again, he says, he never heard back from the defense secretary. 
 Mr. Bremer says of his own controversial May 2003 announcement formally dissolving the Iraqi army (a move that critics say has contributed to the security vacuum and put several hundred thousand armed Iraqis on the street with no jobs and no salaries), that the decision was made in consultation with Mr. Wolfowitz and Under Secretary of Defense Douglas Feith, and authorized by Mr. Rumsfeld.
 But as the authors of ''Cobra II,'' Gen. Bernard E. Trainor and the New York Times military correspondent Michael R. Gordon, recount, this decision ''blindsided'' commanders on the ground in Iraq and officials back home in Washington. They write that Lt. Gen. David McKiernan and Lt. Gen. John Abizaid considered ''the decision an abrupt and unwelcome departure from their previous planning''; Peter Pace, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ''said later that the Joint Chiefs were not consulted about the decision'' and Colin Powell ''did not know about it in advance.'' 

Beyond Iraq
 Questions about the administration's management style and its attitude toward experts have hardly been confined to the subject of Iraq, but have been raised by reporters and former insiders in a wide array of areas. In ''Impostor,'' the conservative economist Bruce Bartlett argues that the failure of the current White House ''to chart or articulate a consistent economic policy'' stems in large measure from ''Bush's disinterest in serious policy analysis'' and the marginalization of people with genuine expertise. He writes that former Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and his successor John W. Snow were treated as ''little more than errand boys,'' and that the ''main job'' of R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers ''was not to devise economic policies, but only to offer support for those Bush had already decided upon.''
 They are observations echoed by Mr. O'Neill and John DiIulio, the former head of Bush's faith-based initiative, who are quoted at length in Ron Suskind's book ''The Price of Loyalty'' and who both complain about the lack of a policy apparatus in the Bush administration and the subordination of policy to political considerations.
 During eight months at the White House, Mr. DiIulio says he heard ''not three meaningful, substantive policy discussions,'' and he marveled at the ''lack of even basic policy knowledge, and the only casual interest in knowing more'' on the part of the West Wing staff. 
 Mr. O'Neill, who fought a losing battle against more tax cuts before he was forced out as treasury secretary, describes to Mr. Suskind a profoundly dysfunctional White House, in which meetings often felt scripted around pre-determined outcomes, personal fealty to the president trumped the spirit of honest inquiry and cabinet secretaries were frequently overruled or not consulted about important decisions on their turf. Mr. O'Neill suggests that politics, rather than sound policy judgments were at work in the president's decision to impose tariffs on imported steel and his flip-flops on the environment. And like Richard A. Clarke, he says Iraq was on the administration's agenda long before 9/11.
 Bill Minutaglio's book on Attorney General (and former White House counsel) Alberto R. Gonzales, due out this summer, also cites a number of potentially momentous cases in which the administration appears to have made end runs around traditional policy channels. In galleys to ''The President's Counselor,'' Mr. Minutaglio reports that on the explosive subject of how to prosecute captured terrorists, a task force of lawyers and criminal prosecutors from the Justice Department, the State Department, the Office of Legal Counsel and the military was put together after 9/11, but was soon disbanded, as Mr. Gonzales and his legal team grew impatient with Department of Justice talk about criminal trials.
 The White House counsel's office ''with the help of hardliners from the Office of Legal Counsel,'' Mr. Minutaglio writes, took ''charge of any planning for the prosecution of foreign prisoners captured during the new war on terror'' and by November ''had formulated a proposal that would pave the way for the most aggressive military tribunals since World War II -- ones that would suspend the kinds of rights normally afforded Americans in the U.S. judicial system.'' 
 These formulations, Mr. Minutaglio goes on, ''were crafted and designed in remarkable isolation -- in secret and divorced from Condoleezza Rice and influential members of the State Department.'' 

Power and the Executive Branch
 Other maneuvers by the White House in the legal arena have provoked controversy as well. In December, New York Times reporters James Risen and Eric Lichtblau revealed that after 9/11, Mr. Bush secretly authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on Americans in search of evidence of terrorist activity, without the court-approved warrants ordinarily required for domestic spying. And last month The Boston Globe reported that Mr. Bush has issued more than 750 ''presidential signing statements'' since taking office, asserting that he has the right to set aside any statute passed by Congress when it conflicts with his interpretation of the Constitution. 
 Such moves by the Bush White House underscore the point made by many books about this administration's proclivity for remaking (some would say, subverting) Washington's traditional policymaking machinery, a tendency indicative, say some critics, of its alarming efforts to widely expand the power of the executive branch. Although Bush believers like Fred Barnes and the former press secretary Ari Fleischer (''Taking Heat'') often depict those critics as members of a vast left-wing conspiracy, readers of the many books about the Bush White House will notice that an author's view of the administration's out-of-channels policymaking is not necessarily determined by right/left, red-state/blue-state sympathies; nor is it determined by whether an author supported the original decision to go to war against Iraq. 
 Bruce Bartlett, the author of ''Impostor,'' a scorching deconstruction of the Bush administration's economic policies, writes as an ardent Reaganite; and George Packer, the author of one of the most devastating accounts of Mr. Bush's prosecution of the war in Iraq, writes as an ''ambivalently prowar liberal'' who had wanted to see Saddam Hussein, ''a homicidal dictator removed from power before he committed mass murder again.''
 In some corners there has also been a growing emphasis not on the Bush administration's ideology, but on its practical ability to govern effectively. The historian Douglas Brinkley, writing about Hurricane Katrina in his new book, ''The Great Deluge,'' repeatedly uses the word ''incompetence'' to describe the response of President Bush and his administration to the disaster on the Gulf Coast, the same term used by conservatives like Max Boot and William Kristol to describe the administration's handling of Iraq and other issues, and by retired General Zinni and retired Maj. Gen. Paul D. Eaton to describe Defense Secretary Rumsfeld's direction of the war.
 With a growing chorus of such criticisms, combined with plummeting poll numbers, the White House may be forced to rethink the efficacy, if not the philosophical implications, of its modus operandi. The administration's growing problems suggest that Mr. Bush might have done well to put aside his yearning, as Fred Barnes notes, to be an ''event-making leader'' who ''by himself, changes the course of history'' and focused instead on a task Mr. Barnes says is not even on the president's radar: ''being an 'eventful leader' who merely handles the tribulations of his era skillfully.''

HEADLINE: House Votes to Extend Investor Tax Cuts for 2 Years

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10 

 BODY:
The House on Wednesday passed a $69 billion bill to extend President Bush's tax cuts for investors for two more years, giving the White House a welcome victory on Capitol Hill at a time when its agenda is largely stalled. 
 The vote, 244 to 185, sends the bill to the Senate. Final passage is expected there on Thursday, clearing the way for the bill to be signed into law by Mr. Bush.
The bill would extend tax cuts on dividends and capital gains -- the centerpiece of Mr. Bush's 2003 tax-cutting package -- for another two years. It would also temporarily block a big jump in the alternative minimum tax. Passing the bill was a high priority for Mr. Bush, though the measure fell short of the president's original goal of making permanent all of his major tax cuts from 2001 and 2003.
 Mr. Bush praised the vote as ''an important step to continue to help hard-working Americans and to keep our economy strong and growing.'' He urged the Senate to approve the measure quickly so he could sign it into law.
 The House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, in a news conference with Treasury Secretary John W. Snow before the vote, called it ''a day of celebration for the American people.''
 But Democrats were not celebrating. They complained that the tax cuts for investors, which reduced the tax rate on dividends and capital gains to 15 percent, would give tax relief only to the wealthiest. Several cited a recent study that found the average tax savings among those earning $10,000 to $20,000 a year would be $2, while the average savings for those earning more than $1 million would be $42,000.
 Representative Alcee L. Hastings, Democrat of Florida, spoke bitterly in opposition to the bill. ''Now millionaires have the right to have all the money they can,'' Mr. Hastings said, his voice shaking. ''But if you ask them, I believe that they want to share with the poor. I don't think that they want to see people pushed out into the streets.''
 The bill passed largely along party lines, with just 2 Republicans -- Representatives Sherwood Boehlert of New York and Jim Leach of Iowa -- voting against it and 15 Democrats voting in favor. The measure was the product of months of negotiation between the House and Senate, which until Tuesday had been unable to agree on which tax cuts to include in a budget reconciliation bill.
 Such reconciliation bills can be considered under Senate rules that bar the parliamentary tactic known as the filibuster; the tax measure can thus pass with a simple majority vote. On Wednesday, Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said Democrats had tried, but failed, to persuade the Senate parliamentarian that the bill violated those rules and should thus be subject to the filibuster's 60-vote threshold.

 BODY:

SENATE APPROVES TAX BILL -- The Senate voted 54 to 44 to pass $70 billion in tax cuts, most of which will flow to the nation's wealthiest taxpayers. The action ensured that virtually all of President Bush's tax cuts will be locked in place until after the next presidential election. [Page A1.] 


STOCKS FALL -- Stock prices fell sharply as investors worried that rising oil prices would quicken the pace of inflation and force policy makers to raise interest rates further. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.3 percent, to 1,305.92. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 1.2 percent, to 11,500.73, and the Nasdaq fell 2 percent, to 2,272.70. [C1.]

MARKET REVIVAL IN CHINA -- After sinking to an eight-year low last year and being declared all but dead, the Chinese stock market has recently soared to a level more than 50 percent higher from a year ago. [C9.]

WAL-MART SUPPLIER CONTROVERSY -- Wal-Mart, having helped start an advocacy group that trumpets the company's contributions to America, is quietly helping that organization recruit Wal-Mart's suppliers to join the public relations offensive -- a move that some vendors say puts improper pressure on them. [C1.]

ORGANIC FOOD AND WAL-MART -- Starting this summer, there will be a lot more organic food on supermarket shelves, and it should cost a lot less. The reason is that Wal-Mart wants to sell more organic food -- and because of its size and clout, Wal-Mart usually gets what it wants. [A1]

INHALER SHORTAGE -- A federally mandated shift to a more ozone-friendly version of hand-held inhalers for asthma attacks is creating spot shortages of the devices. [C1.]

MERGER RESISTANCE IN EUROPE -- Few business executives are as determined to forge a single European market as Alessandro Profumo, the Italian banker who took over HVB, the German bank. For other European chief executives eager to expand across borders, Mr. Profumo's experience shows that building a pan-European enterprise requires luck, stamina, and a thick skin. [C1.]

NEW TWIST IN TRADING CASE -- Federal prosecutors arrested Jason C. Smith and charged him with leaking secret information from grand jury proceedings to David Pajcin and Eugene Plotkin, two men previously accused of running an insider-trading ring that reaped $6.7 million in illegal profits in 2004 and 2005. [C1.]

WARNING ON PAXIL -- GlaxoSmithKline has sent letters to doctors warning that its antidepressant drug Paxil appears to increase the risk of suicide attempts in young adults. [A26.]

SUIT OVER AIDS DRUG -- Two patients' rights groups in India sued to stop Gilead Sciences, a California biopharmaceutical company, from patenting the AIDS drug Viread, which is available in India in a generic form. If the drug is patented, it will become too expensive for patients in developing countries, the groups argue. [A4.]

BLACKBERRY IN CHINA -- Research In Motion said it would introduce its BlackBerry wireless service in China. But the announcement prompted questions about how the service would fit into the Chinese government's program of communications surveillance and censorship. [C3.]

HEALTH BILL FAILS -- A small-business health insurance bill collapsed in the Senate as critics contended that the bill would strip away years of consumer protections. [A23.]

PAY-FOR-PLAY SETTLEMENT -- The Universal Music Group has agreed to pay $12 million to settle accusations that executives paid radio programmers to play songs. [C3.]

HEADLINE: Shift to Ozone-Friendly Inhaler Is Leading to Shortages and Rising Prices

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
An environmental effort to protect the earth's ozone layer could mean disruptions for the nation's millions of asthma patients. 
 A federally mandated shift to a more ozone-friendly version of the hand-held inhalers used to quell asthma attacks is creating spot shortages of the devices, because production of the older versions has declined even before producers of the new inhalers ramp up fully. The shift is also giving a few drug makers the rare chance to introduce brand-name medicine into a market long dominated by low-cost generics.
The drug at issue is albuterol, the leading prescription treatment used to open constricted airways during an asthma attack. Because the new inhalers are covered by patents, they are commanding high prices -- $30 to $60 each, including the drug inside, compared with as little as $5 to $25 for the older generic versions. 
 By the end of 2008, which is the federal deadline for phasing out albuterol inhalers that use an ozone-depleting propellant gas, the nation's annual cost for these inhalers could be $1 billion higher than now. The main beneficiaries would be Schering-Plough, GlaxoSmithKline and other drug makers whose asthma inhalers are protected by patents that in some cases extend to 2017. 
 For people with drug insurance, price increases may be less a concern than occasional spot shortages of the devices. In early March the Food and Drug Administration issued an alert about temporary shortages, although an agency official said more recently that supplies appeared to be ''certainly adequate or nearly adequate.'' 
 But some patients like Ross Berry have occasionally had to scrounge. ''At Target here you couldn't get it for weeks,'' said Mr. Berry, 42, a disabled veteran in Reston, Va., who is covered by health insurance. ''Safeway didn't have it. Finally I found a Giant that had it. It got a little bit scary.'' 
 For people with no insurance, high prices might be the big concern. Although asthma can affect people from all economic strata, it is a disease disproportionately found among low-income people. Federal officials estimate that the new policy could mean an additional $95 a year for each of the 1.25 million asthma patients without health insurance. 
 On the playground of an elementary school in a Hispanic neighborhood of Los Angeles recently, mothers brought their children for checkups at the Breathmobile, a free clinic on wheels. None of the women were yet aware of the inhaler transition, but when told that prices of the devices might double, some immediately recognized it as a potential burden. 
 ''I guess we have to do our best to buy it even if we have to pay cash,'' said Jenny Diaz, a nurse's assistant. She said she had been paying about $20 each for inhalers for her 9-year-old son and her husband because, while she is covered by the state's Medicaid program, she has a high deductible. She said her husband, a pizza deliveryman, needed a new inhaler every two to three months and her son less frequently. 
 About 6.4 percent of children with family income below the poverty level had at least one asthma attack a year, compared with 5.4 percent of all children, according to a federal survey a few years ago. Asthma prevalence is particularly high among blacks. Experts say this could be because people with lower incomes might be exposed to dirtier air and to agents like dust mites and cockroaches that could set off asthma attacks. 
 The devices at issue let patients dispense a mist of albuterol to open constricted airways during an attack. A single inhaler generally provides 200 puffs of medicine, and people may use anywhere from 1 to 12 a year, according to doctors. In most cases consumers buy a new inhaler each time, rather than buying a drug refill for an existing inhaler.
 The products being phased out use chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's, to propel a mist of medicine. CFC use is being ended in accordance with the Montreal Protocol, a 1987 global treaty intended to save the stratosphere's ozone layer, which protects the earth from some of the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays.
 CFC has already been phased out of heavy-use applications like refrigeration and air-conditioning. Inhalers, which once accounted for less than 1 percent of CFC use, are now the major remaining application. But with alternatives available, the F.D.A. decided last year that the CFC inhalers were no longer essential and outlawed their sale after Dec. 31, 2008. 
 Schering-Plough and GlaxoSmithKline, which had developed the new type of inhalers and were keen to sell more of them, urged the F.D.A. to set the deadline at the end of 2005. But the F.D.A. chose the later date to ensure that there would be an adequate supply of inhalers using the new propellant, called hydrofluoroalkane, or HFA, before the older devices were outlawed. 
 The agency did express concern about the impact on the uninsured, saying that higher prices might have some adverse effects on public health by deterring use of albuterol. But the agency said it could not quantify that effect. 
 There was little resistance to the change when the F.D.A. held a public advisory committee meeting on the issue in 2004. GlaxoSmithKline and Schering-Plough said then that their patient-assistance programs for low-income people would help provide the drug to those who could not afford it. Glaxo also promised to provide two million free samples a year, something it says it still intended to do after the CFC inhalers were gone. 
 Asthma patient groups generally supported a more rapid changeover to help the environment. So did some medical societies, which saw the transition as an opportunity to reduce use of albuterol, which merely quells an asthma attack, in favor of drugs like inhaled steroids that can prevent attacks in the first place. 
 ''In many ways, treating asthma as a rescue situation is dangerous and is sort of putting a Band-Aid on the situation,'' said Dr. Julian L. Allen, chief of pulmonary medicine at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. 
 Debra Mendelsohn of Claremont, Calif., who has two asthmatic children, said she favored protecting the ozone layer. Ms. Mendelsohn, who described herself as belonging to the upper-middle class, said the transition would perhaps mean a few extra dollars a month in insurance co-payments.
 ''For me that's a small price to pay for a clean environment and for clear lungs,'' she said. 
 But Mr. Berry, the asthma patient in Virginia, said that the small amount of CFC used by inhalers meant the changeover was ''just straining at gnats and, in so doing, is causing a tremendous burden on people.'' 
 The prime reason for the shortage during the transition is that Ivax, which supplied about 30 percent of the generic CFC inhalers, has cut back production. The company says it will no longer sell the product after July 1, because the European Union will not allow it to obtain more CFC for its factory in Ireland, where the inhalers are made. 
 ''We will simply run out of gas, quite literally,'' said George Barrett, the head of North American operations for Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, which recently acquired Ivax.
 Makers of the HFA inhalers, which so far represent only a few percentage points of the market, have been hesitant to increase production. The makers fear they will not be able to sell the new products because generics will remain available for three more years. 
 Schering-Plough is the largest supplier of generic CFC inhalers, which it sells under the Warrick brand. It is also poised to be the major supplier of the new HFA inhalers, which it sells under the Proventil name; they are manufactured by 3M. 
 Julie Lux, a spokeswoman, said Schering-Plough was producing CFC inhalers at maximum capacity while 3M was increasing output of HFA inhalers. Last November, to prevent hoarding, the company began allocating generic inhalers to wholesalers. 
 GlaxoSmithKline, which stopped making a CFC product a few years ago, voluntarily suspended production of its Ventolin-HFA devices last May to refine its manufacturing process and to add a dose counter to the inhalers, a spokeswoman said. Shipments are expected to resume in mid-June.
 Armstrong Pharmaceuticals, which is the No. 3 supplier of generic inhalers after Warrick and Ivax, said it had excess capacity and would increase production. Armstrong is a unit of Amphastar Pharmaceuticals.
 Some health care providers are taking steps to cope with a shortage, or an anticipated one. Kaiser Permanente, the big health maintenance organization, said it was providing only one inhaler at a time to each patient. 
 The supply pressures have resulted in some price increases even for the older inhalers, although they remain far cheaper than the newer ones. The Web retailer Drugstore.com recently raised its price for orders of three or more generic inhalers to $8.99 a device from $6.66. 
 With more than $1 billion a year in potential extra revenue at stake, inhaler makers might seem to have an incentive in calling attention to a shortage to speed the transition. 
 Sepracor, for example, said in an earnings conference call with analysts in late April that the shortage of CFC's provided a big opportunity for its asthma drug, Xopenex. 
 The company says that Xopenex, available in an HFA inhaler since December, is an improved, safer version of albuterol -- although The Medical Letter, published by a nonprofit organization that reviews clinical data, recently concluded ''there is no convincing evidence'' that Xopenex ''offers any advantage'' over albuterol. 
 Xopenex is even more expensive than the new albuterol inhalers. A single Xopenex device sells for about $49 on Drugstore.com, compared with about $39 for an HFA albuterol inhaler. 
 The Zeno Group, a public relations firm hired by Sepracor, has been trying to get reporters to write about the inhaler supply situation, offering to set up interviews with doctors and patient groups. It distributed a news release from the Allergy and Asthma Network Mothers of Asthmatics, a patient group, urging people with asthma to consider switching to HFA inhalers now, to avoid being caught short as the supply of CFC devices diminishes. The press release mentioned Xopenex as the newest HFA inhaler on the market, though it also mentioned other brands. 
 Nancy Sander, an asthma patient who also has children with the condition, is founder and president of the nonprofit mothers group. She said that she wrote the press release herself and that Zeno helped distribute it only because her group did not have the money to do it alone. 
 Ms. Sander has reported owning $25,000 to $50,000 of Sepracor stock in her retirement account. But she said that did not influence her belief that asthma patients should start trying to find the best new alternative that works for them. ''For patients to make the transition now is incredibly important,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Inflation Stirs Worry On Wall St.

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS and VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Stock prices fell sharply and broadly yesterday as investors worried that rising oil prices would quicken the pace of inflation and force policy makers to raise interest rates further.
 The abrupt drop, which was the largest since January, came after several days of modest but steady increases in the Dow Jones industrial average, which as recently as Wednesday was within 80 points of its record high. It also came a day after the Federal Reserve indicated that it was ambiguous about whether it would raise rates later this year.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.3 percent yesterday, to 1,305.92, with all but 59 of the stocks in the index losing ground. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 1.2 percent, to 11,500.73, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 2 percent, to 2,272.70. 
 Though consumer prices excluding energy and food have risen only modestly thus far, investors and policy makers are increasingly concerned that higher gasoline and commodity prices coupled with faster economic growth will drive up inflation in the coming months.
 In March, one measure of inflation favored by the Fed -- prices for personal spending excluding food and energy -- rose at an annual rate of 2 percent, the upper end of a range the Fed considers healthy, from 1.8 percent in February.
 The price of gold, which has soared this year and is considered a safe haven during periods of rising inflation, rose 2.2 percent yesterday, to $721.50 an ounce.
 ''Inflation is creeping into the mind-set here in a bigger and bigger way,'' said Jim Paulsen, the chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.
 The inflationary threat in higher energy prices was heightened as crude oil climbed for a third day. The June contract rose 1.6 percent, to $73.32 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Nationally, retail gasoline prices averaged $2.88 a gallon yesterday, up from $2.69 a month ago, according to AAA.
 Mr. Paulsen said the signs of inflation coupled with a weaker dollar, which has fallen 8.3 percent against the euro so far this year, have introduced a new element of pessimism to the market.
 ''What's going on with gold and oil is enough to create fears,'' he said, ''but when you add it all up, you get nervous.''
 One analyst attributed investors' jitteriness to the open-ended nature of the statement the Fed issued on Wednesday after it raised short-term interest rates a quarter-point, to 5 percent, its 16th consecutive increase over two years. Policy makers indicated that they might still need to raise rates further, but emphasized that their decision would depend on future economic data.
 ''We've started this process of hiking rates, and I think the market would love to see it over with,'' said Chip Dickson, the chief United States strategist at Lehman Brothers. ''And it's not, so there's a frustration.''
 Under Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, Wall Street became accustomed to parsing concise statements and divining, with a fair degree of certainty, policy makers' intentions. Since Ben S. Bernanke took over in February, the Fed has begun issuing longer statements that provide more context for its decisions and its thinking but also leave more room for interpretation.
 Government bonds also fell yesterday; the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.15 percent yesterday from 5.12 percent on Wednesday.
 The slide in stocks was led by the insurance giant American International Group, which fell $3.39, or 5.1 percent, to $63.15, after reporting disappointing first-quarter earnings after the market closed on Wednesday. 
 Shares of General Motors fell after a Wall Street analyst said he expected the company's unabated loss of market share in the United States would complicate its efforts for recovery this year. Shares of G.M. dropped 78 cents, to $25.81 yesterday. 
 Still, some analysts suggested that the strong economy and growing corporate profits would ensure that yesterday's fall would prove to be a blip in an otherwise rising market. So far this year, the Dow is up 7.3 percent, the S.& P. 500 has risen 4.6 percent and the Nasdaq is up 3 percent.
 ''One of the major elements in this whole bull run has been climbing this wall of worry,'' Mr. Paulsen of Wells Capital said. ''The undertow of growth is pretty good, and I don't think we've done much to slow it down.''

HEADLINE: Higher Learning In France Clings To Its Old Ways

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

DATELINE: NANTERRE, France 

 BODY:
There are 32,000 students at the Nanterre campus of the University of Paris, but no student center, no bookstore, no student-run newspaper, no freshman orientation, no corporate recruiting system.
 The 480,000-volume central library is open only 10 hours a day, closed on Sundays and holidays. Only 30 of the library's 100 computers have Internet access.
The campus cafeterias close after lunch. Professors often do not have office hours; many have no office. Some classrooms are so overcrowded that at exam time many students have to find seats elsewhere. By late afternoon every day the campus is largely empty.
 Sandwiched between a prison and an unemployment office just outside Paris, the university here is neither the best nor the worst place to study in this fairly wealthy country. Rather, it reflects the crisis of France's archaic state-owned university system: overcrowded, underfinanced, disorganized and resistant to the changes demanded by the outside world. 
 ''In the United States, your university system is one of the drivers of American prosperity,'' said Claude Allegre, a former education minister who tried without success to reform French universities. ''But here, we simply don't invest enough. Universities are poor. They're not a priority either for the state or the private sector. If we don't reverse this trend, we will kill the new generation.''
 It was student discontent on campuses across France that fired up the recent protests against a law that would have made it easier for employers to dismiss young workers. College students were driven by fear that their education was worth little and that after graduation they would not find jobs. 
 The protests closed or disrupted a majority of France's universities for weeks, labor unions declared solidarity and eventually the government was forced to withdraw the law.
 ''Universities are factories,'' said Christine le Forestier, 24, a 2005 graduate of Nanterre with a master's degree who has not found a stable job. ''They are machines to turn out thousands and thousands of students who have learned all about theory but nothing practical. A diploma is worth nothing in the real world.'' 
 The problems stem in part from the student revolts of May 1968, which grew out of an unexceptional event at Nanterre the year before. One March evening, male students protesting the sexual segregation of the dormitories occupied the women's dormitory and were evicted by the police.
 A year later, Nanterre students protesting the war in Vietnam occupied the administration building, the first such action by students at a French university. The student revolt spread, turning into a mass movement aimed at transforming the authoritarian, elitist French system of governance. Ultimately 10 million workers left their jobs in a strike that came close to forcing de Gaulle from power.
 One result was that the country's university system guaranteed a free -- or almost free -- college education to every high school graduate who passed the baccalaureat exam. University enrollment soared. The value of a bachelor's degree plummeted.
 But the state failed to invest much in buildings, facilities and professors' salaries to make the system work. Today the French government allocates about $8,500 a year to each university student, about 40 percent less than what it invests in each high school student.
 Most students are required to attend the universities closest to their high schools. Although certain universities excel in specific fields of study, the course offerings in, say, history or literature are generally the same throughout the country.
 Compounding the problem, France is caught between its official promotion of the republican notion of equality and its commitment to the nurturing of an elite cadre of future leaders and entrepreneurs.
 Only 4 percent of French students make it into the most competitive French universities -- the public ''grandes ecoles.'' But the grandes ecoles, along with a swath of semiprivate preparatory schools, absorb 30 percent of the public budget. 
 They are well-organized, well-equipped, overwhelmingly white and upper middle class, and infused with the certainty that their graduates will take the best jobs in government and the private sector. Students are even paid to attend. 
 The practice in the United States of private endowments providing a large chunk of college budgets is seen as strange in France. Tuition is about $250 a year, hardly a sufficient source of income for colleges.
 But asking the French to pay more of their way in college seems out of the question. When the government proposed a reform in 2003 to streamline curriculums and budgets by allowing each university more flexibility and independence, students and professors rebelled.
 They saw the initiative as a step toward privatization of higher education that they feared would lead to higher fees and threaten the universal right of high school graduates to a college education. The government backed down.
 At Nanterre, Alexandre Frydlender, 19, a second-year student in law and history, complained about the lack of courses in English for students of international law. But asked whether he would be willing to pay a higher fee for better services, he replied: ''The university is a public service. The state must pay.''
 A poster that hangs throughout the campus halls echoed that sentiment: ''To study is a right, not a privilege.''
 Professors lack the standing and the salaries of the private sector. A starting instructor can earn less than $20,000 a year; the most senior professor in France earns about $75,000 a year. Research among the faculty is not a priority.
 Because students generally are required to attend the university closest to home, most do not live on campus. 
 At Nanterre, for example, there are only 1,050 dormitory rooms and a long waiting list. The amenities are few. Twenty-two students share three toilets, three showers and a small kitchen furnished with only a sink and a few electric burners.
 ''There's no place where students can hang out, no place to play cards or to watch a movie,'' said Jean Giraud, 20, a second-year law student who lives in one of the dorms. ''People come for class and then go home.''
 While students are ready to protest against something they dislike, there is little sense of belonging or pride in one's surroundings. During the recent protests over the contested labor law, that attitude of alienation contributed to the destruction of property, even computers and books, at some universities.
 The protests also were the latest warning to the French government and private corporations that the university system needs fixing. Officials, entrepreneurs, professors and students alike agree that too many students are stuck in majors like sociology or psychology that make it difficult to move into a different career in a stratified society like France, given the country's troubled economy.
 The fear of joblessness has led many young people in different directions. Students who have the money are increasingly turning to foreign universities or private specialized schools in France, especially for graduate school. And more young people are seeking a security-for-life job with a government agency.
 In a speech at the Sorbonne in late April after the labor law was rescinded, Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin pledged ''a new pact between the university and the French people.''
 Mr. de Villepin, a graduate of the Ecole Nationale d'Administration, the grandest of the grandes ecoles, promised more money and more flexibility, saying that as in the United States, a student with a master'sdegree in philosophy should be able to become a financial analyst. 
 When a student asked him to explain how he proposed to do that, Mr. de Villepin had no concrete answer. Instead he talked about the ''happiness of the dog that leaves its kennel.''
 But flexibility is not at all the tradition in France, where students are put on fixed career tracks at an early age.
 ''We are caught in a world of limits where there's no such thing as the self-made man,'' said Claire de la Vigne, a graduate of Nanterre who is now doing graduate work at the much more prestigious Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris. ''We are never taught the idea of the American dream, where everything is possible. Our guide is fear.''

HEADLINE: Merger-Hungry Italian Banker Wants Europe to Take Fences Down 

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: MILAN, May 11 

 BODY:
Few business executives are as determined to forge a single European market as Alessandro Profumo, the ambitious Italian banker who last year took over Germany's second-largest bank, HVB. Yet as he reflects on the cross-border foray of his bank, UniCredit Group, Mr. Profumo admits to being tripped up by age-old cultural differences.
 ''Italians are warm and more emotional; Germans are more rational,'' he said in an interview at UniCredit's headquarters here.
The cultural divide between Milan and Munich made the merger harder than Mr. Profumo expected, with several German bankers quitting over what they called the authoritarian style of the Italians. 
 Such bickering will not distract Mr. Profumo from his larger ambitions: he wants to build a European Citigroup -- a financial empire that can run with the giants of the United States and, someday, those who may dominate in China. Europe, he said, cannot create these heavyweights without more mergers.
 But for other European chief executives eager to expand across their borders, Mr. Profumo's hard experience shows that building a pan-European enterprise requires luck, stamina, and a thick skin.
 ''Today, I would say there is resistance everywhere,'' he said. ''This is one of the major potential issues for the future of each of the countries. We have to create a single market or we cannot compete.''
 The resurgence of protectionism in Europe has been most pronounced in the energy sector, where France and Spain are scrambling to thwart foreign takeovers of formerly state-owned utilities. But banking has not been immune to Europe's latest outbreak of economic nationalism.
 The trouble is every country wants its banks to be the acquirers; few are willing to be acquired. Poland fiercely opposed UniCredit's plans to combine its Polish bank with a rival bank in Warsaw owned by HVB. The Polish government finally relented, but only under legal threat by the European Union and after Mr. Profumo pledged to sell 200 branches of the other bank.
 At the same time that UniCredit was proposing its acquisition of the Munich-based HVB, Italy's central bank was trying to block a takeover of one of its banks by ABN Amro of the Netherlands. The central bank governor, Antonio Fazio, has since resigned and that deal went ahead.
 ''I was embarrassed,'' Mr. Profumo said of the episode, noting that Mr. Fazio had backed UniCredit's foreign expansion.
 The contradictions do not end there. Italy's outgoing government noisily protested efforts by the French government to fend off a rumored takeover bid for the French utility giant, Suez, by Enel of Italy.
 Yet when an Italian toll road operator recently proposed to accept a takeover bid by its Spanish counterpart, Italy's incoming prime minister, Romano Prodi -- a committed European who once headed the European Commission -- declared that he wanted to take a closer look at the deal.
 ''I am one of the few people who is saying this is a good deal,'' said Mr. Profumo, whose bank has an indirect stake in the toll road operator, Autostrade, and whose bankers helped arrange the merger.
 A 49-year-old former McKinsey & Company consultant, Mr. Profumo joined the bank in 1994, when it was still known as Credito Italiano. Over the next decade, he turned it into a domestic force, acquiring a string of smaller Italian banks and building a franchise in Central Europe.
 ''Credito Italiano was a typical Italian nationalized bank before privatization, with lots of bureaucracy and poor disclosure,'' said John Raymond, a banking analyst at CreditSights, an equity research firm in London. ''They changed very impressively and very quickly.''
 Last June, Mr. Profumo made his boldest move yet, acquiring HVB, a Bavarian bank formally known as Hypovereinsbank, for 15.4 billion euros ($19.7 billion). With HVB, UniCredit gained control of Bank Austria, which has an even stronger presence in Central and Eastern Europe.
 To the surprise of analysts, the German government said little about the takeover, though officials had expressed misgivings the previous year about a rumored acquisition of Deutsche Bank by Citigroup.
 Analysts partly credit Mr. Profumo's forthright style. ''Profumo comes across as an open guy,'' Mr. Raymond said. ''He's not one of these old-generation Italian bankers, nodding but not saying much.''
 While UniCredit is still a middleweight compared with Citigroup, which has $1.5 trillion in assets, or British goliaths like HSBC, it is a powerhouse on the Continent. With total assets of 780 billion euros ($997 billion), it is seventh in the European monetary union. And investors are giving it a market capitalization of 66 billion euros ($84 billion), ranking it third after Banco Santander of Spain and ING of the Netherlands. 
 With 28 million customers and 7,000 branches in 19 countries, UniCredit is a player from Italy to Turkey. It owns the largest bank in Austria and the second largest, by sales, in Italy and Germany.
 But it is in the new Europe where the HVB merger created a titan. The combined company owns the largest banks in Poland, Bulgaria, and Croatia, and has a top-five position in nine Central and Eastern European countries. Its presence extends to Ukraine, Russia and the Baltic states.
 Most of these countries are growing faster than Western Europe, and their citizens are becoming richer as their economies converge with those in the West. Banks in Central Europe were already selling for high prices. But Mr. Profumo, analysts said, was able to expand his franchise for a relative bargain, since HVB's value was depressed by its shaky loans in Germany.
 In effect, Central and Eastern Europe give UniCredit a hedge against weakness in its two crucial Western markets, particularly Italy, which has recently had the most troubled economy in Europe.
 Despite the fractious integration of HVB, it has proved to be solid performer, thanks to a better-than-expected recovery in Germany. Though analysts still wonder about skeletons in HVB's closet, Mr. Profumo said the bank would not surprise analysts with more bad loans.
 ''We were also quite lucky because no one at the time thought Germany would take off so rapidly,'' he said.
 On Thursday, UniCredit reported net income of 1.37 billion euros ($1.75 billion) in the first quarter, a 20.3 percent increase over the quarter last year. Sales rose 15 percent, to 5.95 billion euros ($7.6 billion). Much of that increase was driven by HVB's net profit, which nearly doubled.
 Mr. Profumo said that UniCredit would even be open to expanding its position in Germany by buying other banks. That is an ironic turn of events, given that a year ago, some analysts predicted he would sell off HVB's German operations and keep only its Eastern European properties.
 Beyond Germany, Mr. Profumo conceded, UniCredit's options are more limited. Buying big banks in France or Spain would be difficult, he said, given the current protectionist climate. And UniCredit's dominant position in Central Europe gives it little room for further acquisitions.
 Mr. Profumo's experience in Poland is a cautionary tale. UniCredit has been in the country since 1999, and he expected little resistance to his plans to merge its bank, Pekao, with one owned by HVB.
 But the dispute quickly took on an anti-foreign tinge. Many Poles have been smarting since last year when commentators in Western Europe warned that ''Polish plumbers'' and low-cost laborers from the East would exploit a borderless Europe to take jobs from Westerners.
 Only after the European Union threatened to file a lawsuit against Poland did the government back down. Under a dealstruck by Mr. Profumo and the Polish prime minister, UniCredit will sell 200 of the 480 branches of the HVB-owned bank in an international auction.
 As a hardened veteran of Europe's culture clashes, Mr. Profumo is not about to rush to judgment.
 ''Remember what was said about Polish plumbers,'' he said. ''I think you can understand the reaction of the Polish government. Each of us has to make an effort to understand the other.''

HEADLINE: SENATE APPROVES 2-YEAR EXTENSION OF BUSH TAX CUTS

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11 

 BODY:
The Senate voted 54 to 44 on Thursday to pass almost $70 billion in tax cuts, mostly for the nation's wealthiest taxpayers. The action ensures that virtually all of President Bush's tax cuts will be locked in place until after the next presidential election.
 The measure, which the House passed Wednesday, would extend Mr. Bush's tax cuts on stock dividends and capital gains by two years, until 2010, and shield about 15 million taxpayers for one year from an increase in the alternative minimum tax. 
 The vote, largely along party lines, was a significant victory for Mr. Bush and beleaguered Republican leaders, who had viewed the tax cuts on stock market profits as a defining party issue and had credited them with jump-starting economic growth and reducing unemployment over the last three years.
 ''We're finally here; we have a deal,'' Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, declared with evident relief on the Senate floor. ''More importantly, the American taxpayer has a deal. A deal that is long overdue.''
 But even as Senate Republicans celebrated, they failed to reach agreement with House Republicans on scores of other tax breaks, including deductions for college tuition and a savings credit for low-income people that expired last year.
 Democrats charged that the tax bill focused almost entirely on cuts for wealthy investors and that it allowed programs intended for ordinary citizens to languish. 
 ''There is little in this bill to be proud of,'' said Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana. ''Working people have been left behind.'' 
 House Republicans, meanwhile, remained in disarray over a budget plan for next year. After promising earlier Thursday to vote on the plan, which by law was to have been passed on April 15, House leaders postponed the vote after failing to come to an agreement with Republican moderates who said they wanted $3 billion more for health and education.
 Even if House Republicans pass a budget plan this month, it would have little practical impact because it would probably not be reconciled with a very different plan passed by the Senate.
 The tax bill, which President Bush is expected to sign as quickly as possible, could set the stage for budgetary heartburn in the years ahead. 
 Virtually all of President Bush's tax cuts in addition to those passed Thursday -- rate reductions for individuals, a bigger child tax credit, the elimination of estate taxes and the tax cuts for stock dividends -- will also expire simultaneously at the end of 2010.
 Renewing all those tax cuts again in 2010 would cost hundreds of billions of dollars a year, posing excruciating budget choices for the next president as the nation's baby boomers become eligible for billions of dollars in Medicare and Social Security benefits.
 In addition, lawmakers merely postponed dealing with huge problems surrounding the alternative minimum tax, a parallel tax that was originally aimed at millionaires but is not adjusted for inflation and is rapidly engulfing more middle-class families. The vote only prevents expansion of the tax this year. 
 Preventing an expansion of the alternative tax in 2007 would cost more than $40 billion, and the costs increase each year after that. A permanent solution, most experts say, would require an overhaul of the tax code, but neither Mr. Bush nor Congressional leaders want to touch the issue this year.
 The overwhelming share of the tax cuts the Senate voted to extend will flow to the wealthiest taxpayers. People earning $1 million a year would save about $42,700, and reap about 22 percent of the total tax cut, according to the Tax Policy Center, a research group in Washington. People earning $40,000 to $50,000 a year would save about $47 and receive less than 1 percent of the benefits.
 Democrats charged that the measure not only favored the rich but also failed to extend middle-income tax breaks, among them a deduction for college tuition payments, that expired at the end of last year.
 Republicans promised that those and at least $20 billion worth of other expiring tax cuts would be renewed in a second bill.
 But after more than a week of negotiations behind closed doors, House and Senate Republicans had not reached agreement on the second bill and refused to disclose any specific provisions. 
 ''Can I tell members exactly how these issues will come out?'' asked Mr. Grassley, the Senate Finance Committee chairman. ''The answer is no. What I can tell members is that we had a good preliminary negotiation.''
 The struggle to extend Mr. Bush's tax cuts reflects the broader difficulties of Republican leaders. Rebellious fiscal conservatives in the House are pushing for deeper cuts in spending, including on programs like Medicaid. But Republican moderates, particularly in Northeastern states that lean Democratic, are pushing in the opposite direction.
 Given the budget pressures, Republicans have been torn for months over what tax cuts they truly wanted to extend within a $70 billion ''reconciliation'' bill that could pass the Senate with a simple majority of 51 votes rather than the 60 votes needed to prevent a filibuster.
 Mr. Grassley said his top priority was to prevent an expansion of the alternative minimum tax in 2006. 
 President Bush and House Republicans placed top priority on a two-year extension of tax cuts for stock dividends and capital gains. Those cuts do not expire until the end of 2008, but the administration wanted to lock them in place.
 House and Senate leaders also wanted to extend more than $30 billion worth of other tax breaks that expired at the end of last year. Those included a lucrative provision for small businesses, a longstanding tax credit for research and development expenses, tax deductions for college tuition payments and a tax cut for banks and insurance companies with foreign subsidiaries.

HEADLINE: The Windsurf's Up On the Columbia River

BYLINE: By LINDA BAKER

 BODY:
WHEN Bob Florek, a Portland, Ore., cardiologist and an avid windsurfer, was looking for a second home in the Columbia Gorge, he decided on White Salmon, Wash., a sleepy logging town perched on a bluff just across the Columbia River from Hood River, Ore. 
 Mr. Florek, 54, had started his search in Hood River, which is acknowledged to be among the top windsurfing spots in the United States. But in 2003, he bought a three-bedroom log-cabin house on 10 acres in White Salmon with views of Mount Hood, the Hood River Valley and the Columbia River as it snakes west through the rock formations of the gorge.
 ''Hood River is a cute little town,'' Mr. Florek said, ''but the setting is more beautiful on the Washington side. The bluff has one of the prettiest views in North America.'' Although Mr. Florek declined to reveal the amount he paid for the property, local real estate agents said that houses on the bluff were selling for about $1 million. 
 Built during the apple boom of the late 19th century, White Salmon is often overlooked in favor of bigger -- and hipper -- Hood River. 
 But even as Hood River itself shifts from windsurfers' paradise to sophisticated urban retreat, a growing number of second-home buyers and retirees are moving to the quieter Washington side. They come in search of an outdoor lifestyle and the economic incentives of Washington, which does not have a state income tax. 
 About 30 percent of the total 2,400 residents of White Salmon are part-timers, said Carl E. McNew, managing broker with Windermere Glenn Taylor Real Estate in the neighboring rivertown of Bingen. ''People go to Hood River,'' he said, ''then open their eyes to the tax advantages and superior recreation over here.'' 
 Situated in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, White Salmon is about an hour's drive from Portland. In addition to mountain biking, windsurfing, hiking and skiing, the area offers a spate of new businesses and amenities.
 And some of the Northwest's oldest petroglyphs, the work of the Yakama Indian Nation, are in Horsethief Lake State Park, some 15 miles away.
 Now, a fledgling arts council is encouraging development of a gallery district on Jewett Boulevard, White Salmon's three-block main street, with more than a dozen glassmakers, painters and artisans ensconced in downtown galleries and studios. 
 Outside town, the region's famous apple and pear orchards are being converted into vineyards, bringing wine bars and restaurants along with them. 
 The SDS Lumber Company sprawls on the Port of Klickitat below White Salmon and is still the area's largest employer. But the mill now has two high-tech neighbors: Innovative Composite Engineering, an industrial design and manufacturing concern, and the Insitu Group, a global aeronautics company. 
 ''White Salmon used to be a two-class town,'' said Mayor Roger Holen, ''timber barons on the bluff and the logging work force below.'' Today, Mr. Holen said, the area may have the largest per capita number of engineers and art galleries in the country. 

The Scene
 Twelve years ago, David Brook, an emergency-room director in Seattle, bought a 1,700-square-foot two-bedroom home in White Salmon for $153,000. The house, now worth about $300,000, didn't appreciate until a couple of years ago, he said. 
 Of the 20 windsurfing sites along the Washington side, Mr. Brook favors Spring Creek Hatchery State Park, a spot that attracts families who arrive in recreational vehicles at 6 a.m. to nab parking spaces. 
 Mr. Brook's daughters, Carly, 13, and Abby, 8, like to ride their bikes to the Creamery, an ice cream and sandwich shop on Jewett Boulevard. In the summer, the girls take swimming lessons at the local outdoor pool and sell cherry plums and lavender from their garden at a farmers' market. 
 ''There's no hustle and bustle,'' Mr. Brook said. ''The kids are free to explore on their own.'' 
 On a Monday afternoon last month, Jewett Boulevard was almost deserted except for a ribbon-cutting at the Peggy Ohlson Arts Studio, the 15th gallery to open in the tiny business district. Next door, a family shopped at La Playita Tienda, a grocery, while a spandex-clad cyclist sped up the hill in the direction of Mount Adams, some 25 miles from White Salmon. 
 Other new galleries include the White Salmon Glassworks, which offers classes and public demonstrations. The Hatchery Studio Arts Building, a former chainsaw-supply warehouse, is home to six artisans and artists, including Craig Wilson of the White Salmon Guitar Company and Eric Lindsay, a collage artist and sculptor. 
 ''We want to shepherd development so it doesn't take on a random theme,'' said John Mayo, himself a sculptor and the president of the White Salmon Arts Council, who renovated the hatchery building last year. More than 150 artists live on the Washington side of the Columbia River, he said, and ''we're trying to bring the content downtown.'' 
 ''The universal phenomenon,'' said Mr. Holen, the mayor, ''is the people who are moving here don't want to just sit and gaze at Mount Hood. They come to be active.'' 

The Pros
 White Salmon's 640-foot elevation and sunny, south-facing slope give it an edge over Hood River, said John Howell, a former corporate executive in El Dorado, Calif., who bought a 1,300-square-foot second home in town for $200,000 last summer. 
 Several new establishments have raised the level of dining and shopping on the Washington side. The recently remodeled White Salmon Thriftway now carries organic milk and produce. Viento, a new bistro in Bingen, opened last spring and features locally raised hormone-free beef, chicken and lamb. ''It's one of our favorites,'' said Mr. Florek, the cardiologist from Portland. The tasting room for Syncline Wine Cellars, a local winery, is next door. 
 Mr. Florek said that one of the best mountain-bike trails in the gorge is just behind Skyline Hospital in White Salmon. 

The Cons
 Despite the new amenities, the pace of development is not always satisfying. ''White Salmon could benefit from a nice, high-end restaurant,'' Mr. Florek said. 
 Tensions occasionally flare among White Salmon's established rural population and the urban newcomers, residents said. A debate continues over whether to close a longtime shooting range near the popular Jewett Creek hiking trail -- so far the old-timers have succeeded in keeping it open. ''There are some cultural issues around change,'' Mr. Mayo said. 

The Real Estate Market
 Topographical limitations and the designation as a national scenic area restrict development in White Salmon, said Bob Blades of Pacific Rim Brokers. ''We don't have large subdivisions,'' he said, ''which is great, but it's also frustrating.'' 
 Housing prices increased 30 percent in White Salmon last year, Mr. Blades said. Although there is still some property in the $200,000 range, a 1,500-square-foot house with limited views runs about $300,000. 
 Five years ago, a bluff home cost about $350,000, Mr. McNew said. Today, even a bluff house in need of repair starts at $1 million. ''White Salmon bluff property is the most scarce and valuable commodity in the gorge,'' he said. 
 Construction is to begin in July on an upscale town-house community, Salmon Run. Its 43 residences are expected to sell for about $500,000 each. Residents of a trailer park near the Hatchery Studio Arts Building were recently handed eviction notices to make room for White Salmon's first cottage-style development, which is scheduled to break ground in 2007. 
 Mr. Florek, who said he stays in White Salmon almost every weekend, used to postpone a trip there until he and his wife had time off together. ''Now I'm so addicted, I even go alone,'' he said. ''There's no TV, no computer. It's heavenly quiet.''

 CORRECTION:
The Havens column on May 12 about second homes in White Salmon, Wash., gave an incorrect figure provided by a local real estate broker on the number of part-time residents. According to City Hall officials, it is 5 to 10 percent, based on the number of homes whose utilities are turned off in winter, not 30 percent.

HEADLINE: April Sales Didn't Meet Expectations 

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11 

 BODY:
April retail sales were weaker than expected as high gasoline prices discouraged shoppers, the government reported yesterday, supporting views that the Federal Reserve may pause its campaign to raise interest rates in June. 
 Commerce Department data showed that sales at United States retail stores rose a smaller-than-expected 0.5 percent in April and were spared an even weaker performance by strong gasoline sales.
Gasoline station sales jumped 4.6 percent, their largest increase since September 2005, as higher energy prices inflated the cost at the pump. But retail sales excluding gasoline edged up just 0.1 percent after rising 0.7 percent in March.
 ''If you are looking for the Fed to hold, these data are supportive of that,'' said Keith Hembre, chief economist at FAF Advisors in Minneapolis.
 The Fed on Wednesday lifted short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, to 5 percent, but left the door open to a pause in its nearly two-year campaign to increase rates.
 Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of United States economic activity and analysts worry that higher energy prices, which act like a tax on households, are affecting consumption. 
 Separate data from the Commerce Department showed that business inventories rose a larger-than-expected 0.7 percent in March as automotive and building material inventories climbed. Wall Street had forecast a smaller rise in inventories at retailers.
 In another report, the Labor Department said that first-time claims for state unemployment insurance benefits dipped to 324,000 last week from an upwardly revised 325,000 the previous week.
 Excluding claims related to the government shutdown in Puerto Rico, initial claims would have been closer to 300,000, a Labor Department analyst said.

HEADLINE: After Almost 50 Years, New Harlem Piers Are Rising 

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 BODY:
Maritta Dunn remembers, as a child in the 1950's, walking with her family to the Harlem Piers to watch ferries travel across the Hudson to Palisades Amusement Park. Although her family was not allowed into the amusement park because they were black, they liked to go to the piers to watch people board the boats.
 The Harlem Piers, once a bustling transportation center and recreation attraction at the western end of 125th Street, were demolished nearly 50 years ago. But after years of plans to revitalize the area, construction is under way on a new set of piers on the Harlem waterfront scheduled to be completed next spring. 
For Ms. Dunn, restoring the piers has been a lifelong campaign. 
 ''I've been waiting 45 years for this to happen and I wasn't going to die without seeing this through,'' said Ms. Dunn, the former chairwoman of the local community board and one of the project's chief advocates. 
 The $18.7 million publicly financed project calls for two piers to be built on the Hudson River between St. Clair Place and West 135th Street. One will be used as a dock for excursion boats and water taxis, while the second will be reserved for recreation, like sunbathing, and for fishing.
 In time, regular ferry service, a kayak launching area and a small restaurant may be added, officials said.
 Until construction started late last year, much of the area near the piers was a city-owned parking lot for several years, though it remained popular with fishermen.
 Eliminating the parking lot, said Adrian Benepe, the city's parks commissioner, will allow the bicycle and pedestrian paths to link the Harlem waterfront with other riverside parkland. ''It's a huge deal,'' Mr. Benepe said. ''This is the big missing link in the Hudson River greenway on the West Side of Manhattan.''
 The other gaps in the greenway are between 135th and 145th Streets, where a bike and pedestrian path will be completed by the end of May, and between 83rd and 91st Streets, where work on a bike and pedestrian path is scheduled to start this fall and be finished in 2008.
 The lack of convenient access to the waterfront has been a sore point in Harlem since sections of what remained of the piers collapsed into the river in the 1960's and 70's. But even without serviceable piers, the area -- still called the Harlem Piers by some residents -- remained a local attraction. During the 70's, the Apollo Theater held summer concerts on the waterfront. And as the meatpacking plants that once dominated the neighborhood began to relocate to Hunts Point in the Bronx, developers proposed an entertainment pier for the area called Pier 1, though it was never built.
 Other plans also came and went: a marina; a sports pier similar to Chelsea Piers; a series of floating piers that could be used by sailboats; luxury housing; a floating theater on a barge; a bald eagle sanctuary; a floating parking lot; and a 35-story hotel that would have included a museum of Harlem history, a concert band shell and a dinner theater operated by Sylvia's Restaurant.
 ''It wasn't easy because it's not that big a property and everybody had different ideas,'' said Representative Charles B. Rangel, whose district includes the area.
 The community rejected various plans, in part out of fear that waterfront access would be limited to those who could afford the attractions. 
 ''We didn't want to make this something for the haves, and the have-nots would have no access,'' Ms. Dunn said.
 So along with West Harlem Environmental Action, a private, nonprofit group, the local community board in 1999 proposed a waterfront park open to everyone, including fishermen, who have dropped their lines in the area for decades.
 The city's Economic Development Corporation agreed to use the community plan as the basis for redevelopment, and more ambitious and expensive ideas were scrapped. Financing was provided by the city and state governments and federal empowerment zone money.
 After making its way through the legislative approval process, however, the project was delayed for about a year by the Army Corps of Engineers out of concern that the new piers would disrupt fish spawning and migration routes. As a compromise, 50 ''reef domes'' -- concrete structures five feet in diameter and four feet high with holes cut out to allow fish to swim in and out -- will be placed at the bottom of the river near the piers. 
 Jordi Reyes-Montblanc, the chairman of Community Board 9, the local board, said the completion could not happen soon enough.
 ''It's been a long, long struggle,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Developer Defends Atlantic Yards, Saying Towers Won't Corrupt the Feel of Brooklyn 

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
From across the room, the new plastic-and-wood model of Brooklyn's proposed Atlantic Yards project -- revealed by the developer Forest City Ratner at a news conference yesterday -- looked a lot like the old one sitting a few feet away: a 22-acre swath of glass, brick and metal towers that would loom over the surrounding neighborhoods and alter the borough's otherwise sparse skyline. 
 But in an hourlong presentation of the project's latest design, Frank Gehry, the project's architect, and Laurie Olin, its landscape designer, emphasized details that they said would harmonize the planned arena and commercial and residential buildings with the neighborhoods they would border. 
They described shorter and thinner buildings on Dean Street, where the project abuts a mostly low-rise neighborhood; extensive use of glass walls at street level; and what Mr. Olin described as ''the biggest stoop in Brooklyn,'' a sort of public porch planned for the southeast corner of Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues. 
 ''It still feels like Brooklyn,'' said Mr. Olin. 
 But their presentation also made clear that the developer and its opponents still have vastly different visions of what, exactly, Brooklyn should feel like, at least in this corner of the borough, where the downtown commercial district shades into a quiet neighborhood of brownstones to the southeast.
 ''They should've been picketing Henry Ford,'' Mr. Gehry said yesterday, dismissing critics who have questioned the pace and scale of development in the borough. ''There is progress everywhere. There is constant change. The issue is how to manage it.''
 Opponents of the project have criticized the density of Mr. Gehry's designs, among other issues, and the government's possible condemnation of property to make room for them. They have backed alternative plans for the site, including proposals by rival developers that would include mostly low-rise buildings and not require eminent domain. (Forest City Ratner is the development partner of The New York Times Company in building its new Midtown headquarters, a project that itself involved government condemnation of private property.)
 Daniel Goldstein, a spokesman for Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn, said the new design ''puts a Gehry sheen on top of repudiated 1960's-style urban renewal.''
 He continued, ''It's still way too big, and does not change the fact of 16 skyscrapers slammed on top of and next to low-rise, historic neighborhoods.''
 Mr. Goldstein also criticized Mr. Gehry for declining to meet with area residents. The project ''remains an urban planning disaster,'' he said, because ''Mr. Gehry and Mr. Ratner continue to ignore the community.''
 Yesterday's orchestrated presentation -- Junior's, the famed Brooklyn cheesecake place, catered breakfast -- came amid a contentious period in the two-and-a-half-year struggle over the Atlantic Yards. 
 The developer's decision last month to pare back the project's size by about 5 percent has done little to mollify its most astringent critics. And in the next few months, the Empire State Development Corporation, the state agency sponsoring the project, is expected to release a draft study of its potential environmental impacts that will almost certainly be the subject of legal action.
 The Council of Brooklyn Neighborhoods, an association of about 40 Brooklyn community groups, announced yesterday that it had hired Phillips Preiss Shapiro Associates, a real estate planning firm, to review the draft study. 
 Earlier this week, Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn announced the formation of an advisory board to help with fund-raising, outreach and education. The board includes celebrities who live near the proposed site -- such as the novelists Jonathan Lethem and Jhumpa Lahiri and the actors Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams -- as well as preservationists, activists and politicians.
 Yesterday's presentation is unlikely to temper the passions that have rallied them against Forest City Ratner. Though Mr. Gehry had previously suggested the project would be scaled back significantly, he was more elusive yesterday, saying that he had been ''paring back'' the design. ''It is a process,'' he added.
 Mr. Olin dismissed criticism from some community leaders and outside architects that the project's roughly seven acres of open space were too isolated from surrounding streets to be welcoming to residents.
 ''I don't think one has to worry about trying to draw people into open space in New York City,'' he said. ''If there's open space that isn't closed or fenced in, people find it.''
 Much of yesterday's discussion focused on the project's 18,000-seat basketball arena, designed after a lengthy survey of arenas around the country. It is designed to ''create intimacy'' in an otherwise vast space, Mr. Gehry said, with tiers of seating structured so that ''the people in the cheap seats are no longer second-class citizens.'' 
 Mr. Gehry spoke in sweeping language of his efforts to create ''different levels of iconicity,'' varying the buildings' degree of unconventionality to create a skyline that would fit into the area. A few buildings would still be adorned with Mr. Gehry's trademark undulating panels, including the project's tallest, dubbed ''Miss Brooklyn,'' which he described as a bride with flowing veils.
 On the Dean Street side of the project, spaces between buildings have also been widened significantly from some early renderings to create better lines of sight from one side of the project to the other.''We didn't take this lightly,'' Mr. Gehry said. ''We spent an enormous amount of time studying Brooklyn.''

HEADLINE: Finding the Cream Of the Coffee

BYLINE: By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT

 BODY:
The smell of fresh coffee, much too strong to just be one pot, strikes your nose right after exiting the elevator. In a room in the canyons of Lower Manhattan, a handful of New York Board of Trade certified coffee graders are vetting the newest shipment of coffee that came to port just a few days earlier.
 Terry Sullivan, a certified grader, sits at a round cupping table that rotates with the push of his hand. As each cup of coffee passes his nose, he takes a spoon from the bottom to the top of the cup. This brings out the aroma. Dedicating a few seconds to each cup, he samples the entire table from his seat. 
''We are looking for only the bad and the ugly,'' he said.
 Wall Street is home to some of the world's biggest markets for stocks and commodities. It is also home to a market that allows many members of the coffee industry to hedge and speculate on coffee using options and futures for a little more than three hours each day. 
 In a small pit in the middle of the floor of the New York Board of Trade, traders, using the raucous open-outcry system of bidding, buy and sell contracts that each cover 37,500 pounds of Arabica coffee.
 The Board of Trade, made famous by the 1983 film ''Trading Places,'' also trades contracts on cocoa, sugar, cotton and ethanol. Coffee is the exchange's second-most-traded commodity, behind sugar, trading on average 25,330 contracts a day. That comes to notional value of $1.02 billion of coffee traded every day. 
 In some respects, the exchange has changed little since it began trading coffee in 1882. The coffee is tasted to ensure that it is of a consistent, good quality. With coffee grown all around the world and variations in quality, the exchange employs 44 experts-- roasters, traders and brokers like Mr. Sullivan -- to evaluate what will be traded on the exchange whenever new shipments come in. About a fourth of the coffee that the Board of Trade testers sample does not meet the exchange's standards and is rejected.
 In other ways, however, coffee is like other commodities in that it has attracted a rash of speculative investors in recent years, attracted by the volatility in commodities prices. 
 ''When the stock market got flat and interest rates began to fall and we got a smattering of inflation, at that point people started to invest heavily in commodities and the real aggressive nature took off through commodity funds and hedge funds in 2004,'' said Frederick W. Schoenhut, the chairman of the Board of Trade and a coffee trader himself.
 ''That is where we attribute most of growth to commodity and hedge funds. I wouldn't say they are driving, they just buy and sell, they participate in the market as they see fit.''
 In the last three years, coffee trading volume has increased 20 percent each year, he said. 
 Lately, coffee prices have been falling, with the July contact settling yesterday at $1.04 a pound, down from $1.29 in January. 
 ''The money in the market used to be controlled by people on the coffee side,'' said Steve Colten, a coffee merchant. ''In the past, the market used to be very cyclical and based on the whims of the coffee industry. It is now at the whims of the fund managers.''
 Mr. Schoenhut said that although commodity index funds, speculators and other investors were heavily involved, the weather in Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer, still had a large impact on the market.
 ''It will be difficult to project any price movement until we are through the Brazilian winter, '' he said.
 Unlike some other commodities markets, there is still a visceral connection between coffee and the contracts that are traded. After the coffee arrives in port, it is held in exchange-certified warehouses in New Jersey and New York, and samples are sent from there to be tested. 
 Indeed, the tasting and grading of coffee is seen as the regulation that keeps the market going. Grading enables the coffee brokers and merchants to access the quality of coffee they have purchased or are considering buying.
 At Mr. Colten's firm, a unit of ECOM, Atlantic USA, sample beans from all over the world are shipped in every day. Two trained coffee technicians prepare hundreds of cups on its trading floor. Traders on the floor ''cup'' or sample the product. They try to identify different attributes in the coffee to meet the needs of their clients, who might be small roasters of niche coffee or large companies like Starbucks or Folgers. Each has a different type of coffee preference -- some bolder, sweeter or creamier than others.
 The coffee industry is dominated by families like the Coltens. He and his father, Justin, have more than 100 years of coffee tasting and trading experience. 
 Both Coltens are Board of Trade certified coffee graders -- a highly sought credential. To be considered, an applicant must be recommended by members already certified by the board, have five years of experience in coffee tasting, and pass a comprehensive coffee exam that is given once every two years. Only 10 percent of the people who take the test pass.
 The Coltens take coffee grading so seriously that they always use the same silver spoon. 
 Justin Colten has had his spoon for 50 years. Steve was given his spoon in the will of Justin's coffee mentor when he died in 1987. 
 ''Your cupping spoon becomes part of you,'' Steve Colten said. ''Like in any craft, like a glove for a baseball player, this is the tool of your craft.''


CORRECTION-DATE: May 16, 2006

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on the Street Scene page of Business Day on Friday about coffee trading at the New York Board of Trade referred incorrectly in some copies to the coffee grader who in 1987 inherited the ''cupping spoon'' he uses for tasting. It was Steve Colten (who inherited the spoon from his father's mentor), not his father, Justin.

To the Editor:
 It doesn't take elaborate polls to gauge the performance of the Bush administration and President Bush's ratings; just take a stroll around the corner on Main Street and see for yourself how the poll ratings work.
Common folks sweating it out to make ends meet; unaffordable gasoline prices; unaffordable health care; concerns about open-ended war in Iraq; the rising cost of living; the evaporating promise of Social Security; and inequity in the income tax structure -- all this adds up to a pathetic mark sheet for the Bush administration's overall job performance.

HEADLINE: Jump in Exports Widens China's Global Surplus 

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, May 12 

 BODY:
Chinese exports climbed steeply in April while growth in China's imports faltered, producing an unexpectedly wide trade surplus that is likely to further upset China's critics in the United States, Europe and Japan.
 China's announcement on Friday of a $10.46 billion trade surplus for last month came just two days after the Treasury Department in Washington decided not to accuse China of manipulating its currency to gain a trade advantage. But that conciliatory gesture by the United States has not been matched by the Chinese.
While the Chinese foreign ministry welcomed the Treasury Department's decision on Thursday, the Chinese central bank has allowed the currency to weaken gradually against the dollar for the last two days despite urgings from trading partners to let the currency appreciate. 
 April is usually a slow month for Chinese exports because factories have not yet stepped up the manufacture of toys, clothing and other products that will end up as presents under Christmas trees in the West. The last time China ran a monthly trade deficit was in April 2004, when it posted a deficit of $2.25 billion. 
 Rising exports last month show that global demand for Chinese goods is stronger than most experts had expected, said Qu Hongbin, an HSBC economist who specializes in China.
 ''The Chinese trade surplus is not going to narrow significantly in the short term,'' he predicted.
 Chinese exporters, a powerful interest group, strongly oppose faster appreciation of the yuan. Sherman Wang, the general manager of the Hangzhou Kailai Neckwear and Apparel Company, said that the company had barely been able to raise prices for the garments that it exports.
 ''Our customers are long-term customers, so we still have not encountered cases where the customers stop trading with us,'' he said. ''However, if we raise our prices further, even our old customers may not be able to take it.''
 But the brisk pace of China's economic expansion may be starting to take a toll in terms of inflation, as companies bid up workers' wages and landlords are able to raise rents. The consumer price index was 1.2 percent higher last month than a year earlier, the government also announced on Friday, accelerating from inflation of eight-tenths of a percent recorded in March.
 Prices are rising despite considerable political pressure on electric and water utilities to avoid price increases, and despite government caps on gasoline and diesel prices that have kept fuel prices at a little over $2 a gallon, well below world levels. ''The real inflation pressure is greater than the headline C.P.I.,'' said Ma Jun, an economist with Deutsche Bank. 
 In the United States, the Commerce Department said Friday that the overall American trade deficit had narrowed slightly, to $62 billion, in March from $65.64 billion in February. The bilateral deficit with China also narrowed in March, to $12.90 billion from $13.87 billion in the previous month.
 The United States is a month later than China in releasing trade figures because American officials wait until they have detailed information available on trade by country and by product. Each month, China quickly releases its overall exports, imports and trade balance and its trade statistics for a handful of products, as it did on Friday, but does not provide full details by country and product until weeks later. By holding down the value of the currency, known as the yuan, China makes its exports more competitive in overseas markets. But to prevent the yuan from rising, China's central bank buys more than $10 billion a month of foreign currency from the country's companies and individuals, giving them yuan instead.
 The People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, has steadfastly maintained that the country's trade surplus is a result of broad structural economic forces, and not a result of its decision to peg its currency to the dollar at a level that makes Chinese wages and other costs seem cheap by international standards. 
 Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the central bank, has contended that China's high savings rate means that China inevitably produces considerably more goods than it consumes, shipping the difference overseas.
 The urban household savings rate in China approaches 50 percent, compared with near zero for American families.
 Economists had expected China's surplus to increase modestly from the $4.59 billion recorded in April 2005. They had expected a small increase partly because China's imports were weak in April last year, so experts anticipated they would jump this year.
 But imports were up only 15.5 percent from a year earlier, despite a 78 percent increase in the value of aircraft imports. Boeing data shows that the company delivered a 747-400 jumbo freighter and a 737-800 passenger jet to China last month, while delivering a 777-300 and a 757-200 in April of last year.
 The yuan dipped to 8.0063 to the dollar on Friday afternoon, from 8.0039 on Thursday in trading in Shanghai. Foreign banks are now allowed to trade the currency, but the People's Bank of China plays a large role in the market as well as regulating the size of daily moves.
 China revalued the yuan by 2.1 percent last July 21, and has allowed it to rise by only another 1.2 percent against the dollar since then. This has meant that the Chinese currency has actually been falling lately against the euro, the Japanese yen, the Korean won and other currencies that have been climbing recently against the dollar.

HEADLINE: Vet Bills and the Priceless Pet: What's a Practical Owner to Do?

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN

 BODY:
When Henry the cat began dragging his legs, his owner, Carol Kalinoski, suspected her 15-year-old pet's problem might be more serious than old age and arthritis.
 Steroids weren't helping, so her veterinarian suggested that they do a magnetic resonance imaging exam on his lower spine. The cost was $1,200. Ms. Kalinoski paid. The vet didn't learn enough from that and he advised Ms. Kalinoski of Alexandria, Va., to get a second M.R.I. at the nearby imaging center run by Iams, the pet food unit of Procter & Gamble. Imaging the entire spine would cost another $1,200, and Ms. Kalinoski paid again.
The veterinarian spotted a tumor. Ms. Kalinoski was given a number of choices, including putting Henry to sleep or surgery that would cost $3,200. 
 What would you have done? Paid the money even though the cat was old and the surgery had only a 50 percent chance of success, or said, ''It's a cat,'' and asked the vet to euthanize him, or wished you had bought pet insurance 10 years ago? 
 Ms. Kalinoski, a consultant and regulatory lawyer, chose surgery. ''He was so close to being put down,'' she acknowledged. 
 Making a choice between expensive health care for a pet or ending the life of that animal companion is never easy. Wallace Sife, who as founder of the Association for Pet Loss and Bereavement has counseled hundreds of guilt-racked pet owners, said, ''There is no right answer.'' 
 Mr. Sife, a Brooklyn psychologist, has also counseled people who have gone deeply into debt to care for a pet and he has concluded, ''It is purely a subjective gut call, but there is nothing wrong in thinking about the money.''
 There is no hard and fast advice on what to do when a pet needs expensive care. It doesn't appear, however, that pet insurance is the financial cure, though it may end up making the emotional decision a little easier. 
 Veterinary care is not a trivial expense. Americans will spend about $9.4 billion this year on the health of their pets, according to the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association. Those bills are rising about 9 percent a year, almost three times the rate of inflation. 
 While pet health care costs aren't as high as those for humans, bills can add up. Ten days of dialysis treatment can reach $12,000 and cancer treatment is as much as $40,000.
 Those are unusual circumstances and most people figure they will never have to pay that much. Pet owners, though, often underestimate what they spend on their animals. James F. Wilson, a veterinarian based in Yardley, Pa., who often testifies in court on the value of an animal, said research completed this year puts the average lifetime cost of a medium-size dog at $10,400. A small dog will cost slightly less and a large one slightly more. Caring for a cat will cost an average of about $10,600. 
 Dr. Wilson took his calculations a step further. He found that among people who have a strong bond with their pet -- did you know 5.8 million pet owners celebrate their pets' birthdays? -- the expenses more than double. For instance, he found dog owners spend more on treats than on food. He said that the cost of caring for a medium-size dog can go as high as $100,000 for those who make man's best friend their best friend. 
 He estimated that almost 40 percent of the cost of raising a medium-size dog went to health care. The percentage was slightly higher for big dogs; for a small dog, the health care costs were 33 percent. Health care costs for a cat approach a quarter of total expenses. ''The amazing thing is that not one of the people had a clue that this is what they are spending,'' Dr. Wilson said of the pet owners in his informal survey. 
 This, he said, is evidence that owners need to insure their pets. ''Stop thinking of it as a $500 dog, but as a $50,000 investment,'' he said.
 But most pets are not investments. In purely economic terms, a pet is usually not worth thousands of dollars unless it is a rare show animal used in a lucrative breeding program or a highly trained working dog, like one, for instance, that assists the blind or the deaf. All the kibble, toys and vaccinations are not investments. They are what businesspeople call sunk costs. Whatever decision you face is made independently of what you have already spent.
 Is pet insurance any more defensible as a money saver? Probably not. A policy on a 2-year-old cat offered by VPI Pet Insurance, the nation's largest provider, carried a premium of $28.75 a month, or $345 a year. 
 If the cat lives 18 years (not uncommon), 16 years of payments would add up to $5,136, or just about equal to what Dr. Wilson estimated as the high end of out-of-pocket health care costs for a cat. 
 There are other costs with the insurance, like a co-pay of $50 for every office visit. Statistics show that the average cat makes 2.3 visits to the vet a year, so add in $115 a year, or $1,840, over the cat's lifespan. VPI estimates that its standard policy. covers 40 percent to 80 percent of the cost of a procedure -- $94 for treatment of a urinary tract infection, for example, $165 to treat for multiple lacerations and $840 for a pacemaker.
 Though pet insurance is more popular in parts of Europe, Americans may have figured out it isn't worth the expense. VPI, which has Procter & Gamble as an investor, has been selling pet policies since 1982; with 369,000 active policies, it says it has about 80 percent of the market. (The other two insurance providers are Petcare and Petshealth.) That's less than 1 percent of the 90.5 million cats and 73.9 million dogs owned by Americans. 
 Don't turn to veterinarians for an easy answer. ''Our profession is split on the issue,'' said Robert Mason, a Kokomo, Ind., veterinarian. Dr. Mason's own view is that insurance allows vets to charge more. ''If you don't care what I can charge you, I can charge you more.'' 
 Dr. Wilson characterizes it differently. ''The wonderful part about pet insurance,'' he said, ''is that I get to practice medicine.'' 
 He said pet owners have the wrong attitude about health insurance. ''The biggest problem today is that they want to see a return on investment. That's not why you buy car insurance, hoping to have an accident,'' Dr. Wilson said. ''They don't see it as peace of mind.''
 At the risk of inspiring a lot of angry letters, it has to be said: It's only a cat. Or a dog. (A personal note: I dote on our two cats, Laksa and Mole. And I experienced the untimely loss of a pet when my mother accidentally drove over the family dog.) 
 You buy insurance for your home or car because the cost of replacing a house or defending yourself against a lawsuit filed by someone you hit could crush your finances. ''It would be unusual for you to have a pet health problem that would financially devastate you,'' Dr. Mason said. Indeed, if you are facing that choice, the unfortunate but wisest course may be euthanasia. 
 Dr. Mason also said, ''I've put very few dogs asleep because of the expense.'' 
 David T. Roen, a Clarkson, Wash., veterinarian, said: ''If you are a good pet owner, nobody cares more about this animal than you do. So no matter what you do, it will be the right thing.'' And if you replace it with a stray or abandoned animal, you are doing a good deed, several vets noted. 
 There may be another reason to buy pet insurance. ''It is an easier decision if you make it with your heart and not your pocketbook,'' said VPI's spokesman, Brian Iannessa. ''It makes pet owners feel better.''
 And there you have it. The pet insurance is really human emotion insurance. It is there to protect you from choosing what Mr. Iannessa called ''economic euthanasia.'' 
 But what does Ms. Kalinoski, Henry's owner, think of spending $5,600? ''Would I do it again?'' she asked. ''Yes.''
 Within weeks of his surgery, Henry was jumping off the furniture. She said, ''You wouldn't have thought he was 15 years old.''

HEADLINE: Israel Dreams Big, As in Big League

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
PEOPLE go to Israel for different reasons. Some go to see historic sites, some go for religious reasons, some go to visit their children and grandchildren. Larry Baras goes to Israel to build a professional baseball league.
 Baras, founder and operator of a specialty baking company in Boston, is going to Israel next Thursday for the next step in getting his league ready for what he plans to be its debut next year.
''Hopefully I'm going to select some of the venues,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''As soon as I get some of the venues in place, we'll go after sponsorships and start selling tickets.'' 
 The man has an ambitious plan, considering that baseball and Israel usually are not mentioned in the same sentence. But interest in the sport has been growing, and the country has an amateur baseball league and three softball leagues as well as youth leagues.
 Given that Israel has no baseball stadiums, Baras's project, especially its estimated time of arrival, may be unrealistic, but a former major league general manager likes the idea so much that he has joined as director of player development.
 ''I met with Larry and was really impressed with his enthusiasm,'' Dan Duquette, former general manager of the Boston Red Sox, said yesterday. ''The program and the objectives of the league really excited me.''
 Commissioner Bud Selig is also enthusiastic about the idea. ''I am 100 percent not only supportive,'' he said, ''but I have been trying to figure out ways to make it happen. It's a subject very near and dear to my heart.''
 Duquette, who has created a youth sports academy in the Berkshires in Massachusetts, recalled that when he worked for the Montreal Expos, the owner, Charles Bronfman, talked about ''bringing baseball to Israel.''
 By establishing the league, Baras has another goal: getting Israel into the next World Baseball Classic in 2009.
 ''We would recruit some Jewish-American major leaguers and minor leaguers,'' Baras said. He noted that Mike Piazza played for Italy in this year's inaugural classic and said, ''They did it with a bit of a stretch. We don't have that stretch. We have the law of return.''
 Under that concept, any Jew is eligible to become a citizen of Israel. That means an Israeli team could include Kevin Youkilis, Gabe Kapler and Adam Stern of Boston, David Newhan of Baltimore, Shawn Green of Arizona, Brad Ausmus of Houston, Mike Lieberthal of Philadelphia, Jason Marquis of St. Louis, Scott Schoeneweis of Toronto, John Grabow of Pittsburgh and Scott Feldman of Texas.
 But first the Israel Baseball League has to come into existence. To achieve that goal, Baras has recruited some impressive non-playing talent. 
 Besides Duquette, he has Daniel Kurtzer, former United States ambassador to Israel, who is set to be the league's commissioner. As advisers, he has Andrew Zimbalist, the Smith College economist, and Marvin Goldklang, a limited partner in the Yankees and owner of five minor league teams.
 ''It's a project that is so intriguing to me I have to be involved,'' Goldklang said. ''Whether we can make it happen for 2007 remains to be seen.''
 In his visit next week, Baras will study soccer stadiums in Israel with the thought of converting them for baseball use for what he expects to be a season of about 48 games with six teams, 20 players to a team.
 ''From what I have been told,'' Baras said, ''there are some soccer stadiums that seat between 3,000 and 5,000, which is what we're looking for. We're not going to start with Jerusalem and Tel Aviv because they don't have the facilities we're looking for.''
 Rather, he said, he will look at towns like Bet Shemesh, which is between those two major cities.
 ''A lot of Americans live there,'' Baras said. ''They have 200-plus kids playing baseball there, and they have a soccer stadium. It's near the main highway, and the train from Jerusalem stops near the stadium, I am told.''
 Israel may be the land of milk and honey, but it's not a land of baseball players. Where will Baras find them? He plans to model the league on the Italian league, where, he said, 60 percent of the players are from the United States. 
 Baras, 54, said he would advertise for players in baseball publications and seek minor league players, former players and undrafted college players. Israel has a thriving basketball league populated by many foreign players.
 The long-range plan, though, is to grow their own players. Duquette's goal, Baras said, ''is to develop players so that by the start of Year 6 at least a quarter of the players will be native Israelis.''
 Duquette said they will develop players at an academy they will build in Israel. Their timing is good. Israel has just established a sports ministry, and its head has said there will be a new emphasis on sports in the country, especially on sports other than soccer and basketball.
 In trying to attract an audience, the Israeli league will also follow the model of the Italian league. There, Baras said, ''a lot of the entertainment value transcends the game itself'' with pre- and post-game and between-innings entertainment.
 ''It will be a family-oriented fun venue,'' he said. ''Israeli spectator sports have a male-dominated audience. You seldom see women and children.''
 Baras, an orthodox Jew, said he came up with the idea for the league last summer. 
 ''My first thought was what can I do to help Israel,'' he related. ''I had reached the stage of my life where I wanted to do something. Being passionate about both Israel and baseball and having familiarity with minor league baseball, specifically unaffiliated baseball, I said, 'Why can't we do that over there?'
 ''Not only was I met with some skepticism, but I was skeptical,'' he added. ''But as time went on, I realized it could be done.''
 Now he just has to do it.

HEADLINE: Gas Prices and Rate Worries Rattle Consumer Confidence 

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Several months of rising gasoline prices appear to be deflating some of the enthusiasm American consumers exhibited at the start of the year.
 Warmer weather, higher wages and brisk hiring bolstered spirits and spending through the first few months of the year, but that upbeat mood appears to have been clouded lately by a combination of rising gasoline prices, a cooling housing market and higher interest rates, economic reports yesterday suggested.
''It's pretty clear that people have been really rattled by'' high gasoline prices, said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics. ''The big question is, How much of an impact has it had on spending?'' 
 The answer to that question is not obvious. Nor is it clear that the economy will suffer from a slowdown in spending, as long as it remains relatively modest. Indeed, it could be a benefit. That is because the Federal Reserve is counting on the recent economic boom to cool off enough that it can take a breather in its two-year campaign of raising interest rates to keep inflation in check. 
 For now, the signals are mixed. Yesterday, the University of Michigan's consumer confidence index fell to its lowest level since gasoline prices soared after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita struck the Gulf Coast last summer. It was the second straight monthly drop for the index.
 At the same time, another report, from the Commerce Department, said the nation's trade deficit narrowed in March as the country spent less on petroleum imports and exported more raw materials and industrial equipment.
 Despite the signs of more modest growth, continued fears of inflation sent stocks and bonds broadly lower for the second consecutive day: The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 14.68 points, or 1.12 percent, to 1,291.24, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.19 percent today from 5.15 percent late Thursday evening.
 Gasoline prices have topped $3 a gallon in many parts of the country after a resurgence that has pushed oil prices past $70 a barrel, partly on concerns that any disruption to a tight market could create a supply shortage. Such concerns have been fueled in part by the diplomatic standoff with Iran over its nuclear program and supply disruptions in Nigeria, where an oil pipeline explosion killed up to 200 people yesterday.
 But economists note that for all the worries over gasoline, expressions of lower consumer confidence often do not translate into weaker overall spending. That may be particularly true when incomes are rising and jobs are plentiful, as they appear to be today. 
 Consumers are finding creative ways to cope with higher gasoline costs. Ross Edwards, a corporate project manager from Pittsburgh, said his family's gasoline cost has doubled in the last year, prompting his wife, Toni, and him to take a chartered company bus to New York this weekend, instead of driving. The couple also found other ways to cut spending while in the city.
 ''We're not eating at the expensive restaurants anymore,'' he said. ''It's more Red Lobsters, Friday's and Olive Gardens. We're staying away from the restaurants with white tablecloths.''
 There are other signs that higher fuel prices are starting to alter behavior. In a report also released Friday, the International Energy Agency said rising energy prices appear to have damped demand for oil globally.
 The agency, which advises its 26-member countries on energy policy, lowered its forecast for growth in global oil demand to 1.25 million barrels a day from an earlier forecast of 1.47 million. The change was largely based on lower oil demand in the United States and warmer weather in developed countries.
 The price for petroleum imports to the United States jumped 11.5 percent in April, according to a Labor Department report. Prices for all imports increased by 2.1 percent and were flat for nonpetroleum imports.
 ''There is some change in demand because of price,'' said John Felmy, chief economist at the American Petroleum Institute, ''but it's still relatively modest.''
 The revised I.E.A. forecast sent crude oil prices down $1.28, or 1.8 percent, to $72.04 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 As for the overall trade picture, the United States imported $62 billion more than it exported in March, a 5.5 percent decline from the February deficit of $65.6 billion. It was the lowest trade gap since August but was still considerably bigger than the $53.7 billion gap in March 2005. Analysts had expected the deficit to balloon to $67 billion, according to a survey by Bloomberg News.
 Imports of petroleum-based products fell 8.3 percent, to $22.5 billion, in March, while exports of those products rose 46 percent, to $964 million. The drop in imports could reflect a brief but sharp decline in the price of oil futures contracts in February, said Ashraf Laidi, chief currency analyst at the MG Financial Group. 
 ''I don't think we should take any comfort considering the pricing developments, which were positive then but deteriorated thereafter,'' he said.
 Investors are wary about reports on the wholesale and consumer prices that will be released next week, fearing they may point to higher inflation.
 By this time in a Fed tightening cycle, ''usually the market goes down because investors worry the Fed has gone too far,'' said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor's Equity Research. ''In this case, the market is worrying that the Fed may have to go even further and throw us even closer to a dramatic slowdown.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 119.74 points, or 1 percent, to 11,380.99, after dropping 141.92 points on Thursday. It was the first time since June 2005 that the Dow, which was just 80 points away from its record high earlier in the week, has fallen more than 100 points for each of two consecutive days.
 The dollar also fell to its lowest level in a year against the euro and British pound yesterday and lost less ground against the Japanese yen.
 The politically sensitive trade gap with China widened 13 percent, to $15.6 billion. While imports from China rose 15 percent, exports to the country also jumped 21 percent in March. China reported that its trade surplus with the rest of the world widened to $10.5 billion in April.

HEADLINE: Inflation Fear Takes Shares Down Again

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks endured a second day of steep losses yesterday as the dollar weakened and bond prices fell after data showing higher import prices fueled the market's inflation worries. The major indexes declined sharply for the week.
 A rebound in prices for imported goods further rattled investors already worried about interest rates. Although import prices were flat excluding oil, that did little to soothe concerns about energy costs lifting prices elsewhere.
 Plunging consumer confidence also reinforced beliefs that high gasoline prices at the pumps could choke consumer spending. Wall Street, meanwhile, weighed the importance of an unexpected decline in the trade deficit and cooling oil prices. 
 Yesterday's decline in equity markets built on steep losses the previous day, when surging commodities prices compounded anxiety that the Federal Reserve could continue its two-year streak of interest rate increases. And next week's reports on wholesale and consumer prices could prove troublesome for the inflation picture.
 ''With commodities prices reaching new highs, people are saying maybe global growth is stronger than anticipated,'' said Brian Gendreau, investment strategist for ING Investment Management. The Dow lost 119.74 points, or 1.04 percent, to 11,380.99. The Dow sank 142 points in Thursday's session, its biggest single-day drop since falling 213 points on Jan. 19.
 Broader stock indicators also retreated. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 14.68 points, or 1.12 percent, to 1,291.24, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 28.92 points, or 1.27 percent, to 2,243.78.
 Lowered forecasts for global oil demand from the International Energy Agency eased pressure on the energy market. A barrel of light crude oil lost $1.28, to $72.04, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 The major indexes closed substantially lower for the week, with troubling outlooks from Dell and Cisco Systems propelling the decline of the Nasdaq. For the week, the Dow skidded 1.7 percent and the S.& P. 500 slumped 2.61 percent. The Nasdaq plunged 4.22 percent, erasing much of its gains so far this year.
 Volatile trading is expected to continue next week as investors draw clues about the economy and inflation from data on home building and overall prices.
 In economic news, the Labor Department said prices for goods shipped to the United States swelled 2.1 percent last month after declining 0.2 percent the previous month, but import prices without energy were unchanged. Export prices rose 0.6 after gaining 0.2 percent in March.
 The Commerce Department said the trade deficit narrowed by $3.6 billion, to $62 billion; economists had predicted a $1.4 billion increase.
 The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index for May plummeted 8.4 points, to 79. Economists were looking for the index to drop just 1.4 points, to 86.
 Expedia plunged $5.15, or 26 percent, to $14.51, after its first-quarter profit declined and fell far short of Wall Street expectations. Expedia said higher costs outpaced a modest jump in revenue.
 The electronics retailer Best Buy is paying $180 million to acquire a majority stake in Jiangsu Five Star Appliance, an appliance and electronics seller in China. Best Buy tumbled $1.22, to $52.60.
 General Motors was one of a few gainers among the Dow Jones industrials, adding 28 cents, to $26.09, after KeyBanc Capital Markets upgraded G.M. to a buy on the opinion that negotiations with its union would be successful.
 Bonds continued sliding. The 10-year Treasury note fell 18/32, to 99 15/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.19 percent, from 5.15 percent late Thursday. The interest rate worries also weighed on the dollar, which fell further against the yen. Gold prices pulled back from fresh 25-year highs.

HEADLINE: A Revolution That Came In a Box

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
I DON'T know how I missed this, but a few weeks ago there was a big gala at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History, complete with black tie, fancy hors d'oeuvres, a keynote address by Senator Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii and entertainment by the Capitol Steps. And why not? The 400 or so people in the room had a lot to celebrate. It was the 50th anniversary of the shipping container.
 Don't laugh. If Texas Instruments threw an anniversary party for the microchip, if General Electric feted the invention of the light bulb, if CBS held a gala for the birth of television -- you'd understand completely, right? All of these inventions have been undeniably important, even world-changing. They deserve celebration. And so does the shipping container.
''What is it about the container that is so important?'' asks Marc Levinson, an economist and former Newsweek writer who has just published a smart, engaging book on the subject, titled, ''The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger.'' 
 ''Surely not the thing itself,'' he continues. ''A soulless aluminum or steel box held together with welds and rivets, with a wooden floor and two enormous doors at one end: the standard container has all the romance of a tin can.'' When we see one today, as the freight end of a big truck, or a boxcar on a railroad, or stacked across huge ships that can carry thousands at a time, we barely stop to think about it. It's just part of the white noise of American commerce.
 But Mr. Levinson makes a persuasive case that the container has been woefully underappreciated. Though he doesn't phrase it quite like this, the story he tells is that of a classic disruptive technology: the world worked in one fashion before the container came onto the scene, and in a completely different fashion after it took hold. 
 The simple thing the container did was significantly lower the cost of shipping goods from one place to another. But in the process it also changed the mechanics of shipping, the logistics, the speed, and the capital structure. It created winners and losers. Shipping companies that bet on containers won, and those that resisted were washed away. Cities like Los Angeles and Hong Kong, which spent billions of dollars building ports that could handle container traffic, became central to the world's economy. Other ports that were once critically important withered away. In ports all over the world, strong-backed longshoremen gave way to computers and mechanization. 
 Before the container, Mr. Levinson writes: ''It was not routine for shoppers to find Brazilian shoes and Mexican vacuum cleaners in stores in the middle of Kansas. Japanese families did not eat beef from cattle in Wyoming, and French clothing designers did not have their exclusive apparel cut and sewn in Turkey and Vietnam.'' 
 Which is to say: the line from ''containerization'' to globalization is a straight one. Whether you think that is good or bad, of course, depends on whether you view the world through the lens of the longshoreman or the companies that have used containerization to create a less expensive, more efficient world marketplace.
 MR. LEVINSON is not the only recent author of a book about containerization. The 50th anniversary appears to have ignited quite the little flurry. Arthur Donovan, a maritime historian, and Joseph Bonney, the editor in chief at the Journal of Commerce, have written ''The Box That Changed the World,'' an industry-subsidized, lavishly illustrated coffee table book (assuming your definition of lavish includes color pictures of ports, ships and containers). And Brian J. Cudahy is the author of ''Box Boats: How Container Ships Changed the World,'' which is a different slice of the same pie. All three books, though, tell essentially the same story starting in the same place: April 26, 1956, the day an aging tanker ship called the Ideal-X set sail from Newark to Houston carrying 58 aluminum containers. Once the ship arrived in Houston, the containers were lifted out by a specially built crane and placed onto 58 trucks, which took them to their final destination.
 It sounds so obvious now -- how else would you ship goods from one place to another? -- but what happened that day was revolutionary. Remember ''On The Waterfront,'' the Marlon Brando film about the rough life of dock workers? That's how a port used to operate before the container: hundreds of longshoremen would load and unload packages and boxes from ships -- and then reload the packages onto trucks. It was cumbersome, time-consuming and expensive. According to Mr. Levinson, before the era of the container, shipping could add as much as 25 percent to the cost of certain commodities, and ''ocean freight costs alone accounted for 12 percent of the value of U.S. exports.'' With that much sand in the wheels, a truly global economy just wasn't possible.
 The man who sent the Ideal-X from Newark to Houston was Malcom P. McLean, and one of the points Mr. Levinson makes about him is that he was new to the shipping business. Mr. McLean was an ambitious, self-made, cost-obsessed, 43-year-old trucking magnate, who had become increasingly frustrated with the sheer inefficiency of moving goods from one place to another. ''Freight,'' he liked to say, ''is a cost added to the price of goods.'' 
 Mr. McLean understood that reducing freight costs meant getting ships in and out of ports in hours instead of days, moving goods out of ships and onto trains and trucks faster, cutting out labor costs, and integrating the various forms of transportation. Having exporters put their goods in a container, where they remained until they arrived at their final destination, accomplished all of that and more. 
 Journalists and academics often argue over whether people shape history or whether historical forces shape people. The story of the container gives plenty of ammunition to both. On the one hand, there is not much doubt that had Mr. McLean not sent the Ideal-X on its maiden container voyage, someone else would have done so eventually; the inefficiencies of transportation were crying out for reform and ingenuity.
 On the other hand, Mr. McLean spent most of his life (he died in 2001) dragging the rest of the transportation industry kicking and screaming into the container age. Containers were his obsession. The key moment came during the Vietnam War, when Mr. McLean proved to the United States military, which had become increasingly frustrated at the difficulty of shipping materiel to the war zone, that his way was the only possible solution. Once the armed forces became converts, there was no turning back.
 One thing I find appealing about the container story is how this overlooked revolution contains all the same lessons you will find in higher-profile case studies of the Internet or the personal computer. For instance: as containerization took hold, the first movers like Mr. McLean eventually gave way to bigger, stronger, better-capitalized companies, which now dominate the global shipping business. (Mr. McLean's company filed for bankruptcy in 1986, after he built some expensive, slow-moving ships at the exact wrong moment.) 
 There were huge battles over standards. If containers were going to be able to move easily from ships to trucks to trains, what size should they be? What kind of mechanism should be used to lock and unlock them into place?
 Regulation couldn't hold back the tide, as the new economics made it impossible for the government to continue setting freight rates and protect the shipping, trucking and railroad industries, as it had done for decades. Long-standing cartel arrangements were destroyed.
 There was also the eternal issue of labor versus automation. The longshoremen's unions, on both coasts, absolutely understood what containerization meant: fewer jobs for longshoremen. On the West Coast, the union tried to accommodate the container early on; on the East Coast, there was stiffer resistance. It didn't matter. On the East Coast, there are maybe 10 percent of the jobs there used to be. On the West Coast, the decline has been less dramatic, but that's mainly because West Coast ports have been the big winners in the age of containerization. 
 Toward the end of his book, Mr. Levinson makes what I think is a profound point. If the invention of the container -- and the larger changes that took place in moving goods from one place to another -- was all there was to this revolution, it would have been important, but it wouldn't have transformed the world economy. For globalization to truly take place, companies had to reinvent the way they did business to take full advantage of the container's possibilities.
 One of the first to do so was Toyota, which realized that if it managed its logistics shrewdly, it could save millions, if not billions, of dollars, by drastically reducing its inventories and adopting just-in-time manufacturing. In time, supply chain management became a pivotal skill for companies all over the world, and a pillar of global economy. This was never clearer than in the wake of 9/11, when customs inspectors began stepping up container inspections -- and ''auto plants in Michigan began shutting down within three days for lack of imported parts,'' Mr. Levinson writes.
 He adds, ''Low transport costs helped make it economically sensible for a factory in China to produce Barbie dolls with Japanese hair, Taiwanese plastics and American colorants, and ship them off to girls all over the world.'' 
 All because of the shipping container. Party on.

HEADLINE: Mexico Is Offering Bonds To Cover a Major Quake

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, May 12 

 BODY:
The Mexican government has tapped international markets to issue a special catastrophe bond to finance rescue and rebuilding in case of a disastrous earthquake, finance ministry officials said on Friday. 
 The $160 million bond is part of a larger $450 million insurance package over the next three years that will cost the Mexican government $26 million.
Mexico is considered more at risk for a strong earthquake than even California, and the memory of the 1985 earthquake is still vivid for many residents of Mexico City. The death toll in that disaster may have been as high as 20,000. 
 Despite the risks, the government has not bought insurance until now, said Jose Antonio Gonzalez Anaya, the finance ministry official who has spent three years trying to structure the deal. 
 Investors who buy the bonds are essentially betting that an earthquake will not hit Mexico in the next three years. 
 Swiss Re, the Zurich-based reinsurance group, issued the bonds, which pay 230 basis points over the Libor benchmark interest rate. 
 ''If there's no disaster in three years,'' the finance minister, Francisco Gil Diaz, said, ''the investors keep the premium and the interest'' and get back the bond.
 But if a quake hits, the government gets the full value of the bonds, and investors lose their money. 
 Catastrophe bonds were started in the 1990's, and have largely been issued by private companies to cover losses from natural disasters. Taiwan is the only other government that has issued such a bond against a quake, but it covers damages from losses. 
 In Mexico's case, the government collects the $450 million in the bonds and the insurance payout if a quake of 7.5 or 8 magnitude on the Richter scale hits specific regions, regardless of damage. Mr. Gonzalez Anaya said that meant the government would have money for rescue operations immediately after a disaster.
 Mexico has a special fund for natural disasters but the fund has only $80 million. 
 Last year, the Mexican government spent $1.2 billion to cover rescue and rebuilding operations after Hurricanes Stan and Wilma. Mr. Gonzalez Anaya hopes to issue a similar kind of catastrophe bond against hurricanes.

HEADLINE: Russia Decides It's Time To Try Modern Oil Drilling 

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 12 

 BODY:
With great effort and cost, a Russian drilling crew shipped a rig into an Arctic swamp far north of Moscow. They drilled for weeks through rock -- only to find more rock. After drilling eight dry holes in 2002, the crew gave up. 
 Going against the oilman's motto that the only geologist one can trust is ''Mr. Drill,'' a team of real geologists returned to the problem the next year. This time, equipped with 3-D imaging computers, they placed the rig with pinpoint accuracy over the Val Gamburtseva deposit. It is now producing volumes of oil.
With innovations from Web-camera monitoring of remote fields to the use of drill bits that can turn corners underground, Russia is gradually modernizing its energy machine. Oil field technology is a multibillion-dollar business here. And if Western companies have it, and Russians need it, technology could become crucial to unlocking the shackles of nationalist restrictions on Russian oil reserves, analysts say.
 The re-emergence of Russia as an oil-exporting powerhouse, a trend with wide implications for world energy prices -- Moscow's increased supplies largely fulfilled Chinese demand until last year -- was surely helped along by Western technology, both Russian and foreign oil executives say. 
 ''Our goal now is to adapt this technology to our fields,'' Sergei I. Kudryashov, a vice president for Rosneft, said at a recent presentation of the 3-D seismic imaging center in Moscow that helped develop the Val Gamburtseva field. 
 The modernization process was set back in 2004 by the partial nationalization of Yukos, Russia's largest private oil company that was a leader in bringing in international technology. Rosneft, the largest state-owned oil company, acquired those assets. 
 In a twist in the industry here, Rosneft is now also embracing foreign technology and inviting in Western advisers, crucial ingredients in Yukos's recipe for success. 
 On the management front, too, Rosneft has signaled it intends to modernize. Last autumn, the company tried to recruit Donald L. Evans, the former commerce secretary, as chairman; he turned down the offer. But in February, Rosneft hired Peter O'Brien, a former Morgan Stanley investment banker, as a chief financial adviser. 
 The need for technology upgrades is expected to be expensive for Russia. To increase output from the current 9 million barrels a day, to 10.5 million in 2030, Russia will need to invest $900 billion in oil field technology, according to Fatih Birol, the chief economist at the International Energy Agency in Paris. 
 For instance, at the Val Gamburtseva field, Rosneft's newest, about 30 percent of the equipment will be foreign-made, according to an estimate by the company.
 With the political currents seeming to flow against Americans and Europeans, and Rosneft suggesting it may pair up with the China National Petroleum Corporation as a strategic partner, some analysts say the prize contracts for these technology investments may fall to service companies like Halliburton, Schlumberger or Baker Hughes rather than a large oil company. 
 Oil services companies sell Western technologies for a fee, without demanding any ownership in the oil fields.
 Under this model, Russian state-owned or controlled companies could obtain the technology without taking the sensitive step of surrendering control over oil reserves to foreigners, a step they would have to take if they worked with a major oil company. 
 ''We see no difference between foreign companies getting license for fields, and foreign companies helping with the technology,'' Aleksei Kormshchikov, an oil and gas analyst at the UralSib brokerage firm in Moscow, said in a telephone interview. 
 If Russia puts the right incentives in place to attract investment, the rewards for energy-consuming countries are potentially great. In the last five years, 50 percent of the growth in world crude oil production has come from Russia. 
 Chris Weafer, chief analyst at Alfa Bank in Moscow, and a former adviser to OPEC, speculated that world oil prices could have spiked above $100 a barrel had Russia not raised its output sharply through these years to meet Chinese demand, before its output leveled off in 2005 after the Yukos assets were seized.
 Russia, the world's second-largest oil exporter, after Saudi Arabia, is also the world's largest natural gas exporter at a time when gas is on a path to catch up to coal, which is currently second in the ranking of most-used fossil fuel. 
 President Vladimir V. Putin has elevated energy to a central position in Russia's foreign policy, giving Moscow influence and respect in world affairs not seen since the demise of the Soviet Union, as consuming nations court the Kremlin for access to ever scarcer energy. 
 Still, oil field engineers and geologists say that extracting the oil that underpins so much of political and economic life in Russia is fraught with technical problems -- fields are remote, the climate is extremely frigid, geological structures are complex and machinery is tumbledown -- inherited from the Soviet Union. 
 All of this is precisely where Western technology has proved itself. 
 To increase production starting in 1999, Western companies and consultants applied the techniques of reversing declines at older reserves that have been producing for decades, methods from the 1980's and 1990's that were used at nearly depleted wells in West Texas that had peaked, or reached the maximum rate of production before going into decline. The technologies include hydrofracturing, or forcing steam into an oil well to create cracks in the surrounding rock and ease the crude oil flow toward the surface. The trick is to find wells where the cost of a few hundred thousand dollars is justified by the increase in production. 
 This technology, rarely used in Soviet times, became a mainstay at the older fields of TNK-BP, a BP joint venture begun in Russia in 2003. The company conducted 1,400 such operations last year, or 10 percent of all hydrofracturing done worldwide. 
 Also, Russia is relying on submersible pumps, or tiny electric pumps dropped into wells that push the oil up from below rather than pull from a bobbing pump at the surface. 
 Now, however, Russia must shift its focus from these technologies to developing new fields, Kris Sliger, executive vice president for strategy and new business development at TNK-BP, told a conference in Moscow in March. What could be wrung from the older fields has been tapped, he said. 
 To reach Russia's untapped oil, and maintain production growth and downward pressure on world prices, geologists will be venturing into more remote and improbable landscapes. 
 Russia will need offshore platforms that can operate in ice, undersea pipelines and 3-D seismic imaging with pinpoint accuracy. 
 Modern techniques like horizontal drilling will also come into play. 
 With their technology, Russians cannot drill long distances horizontally -- the drill bits are guided by sensors that navigate by subtle differences in earth's gravitational field -- something the domestic industry must rely upon foreign expertise to achieve. 
 This dynamic was seen in Exxon Mobil's Sakhalin I development on the island's northeast shelf. Exxon Neftegas, a local subsidiary, drilled wells 11 kilometers, or about seven miles, horizontally from the beach to deposits offshore in the Pacific Ocean. The well complex, which Exxon calls the most sophisticated land rig in the world, cost $4.5 billion and has an expected return of $40 billion over the life of the project. In at least one aspect, Exxon was low-tech: faced with threats to Steller's sea eagles, the company hired Russian ornithologists who devised the ''false perch program'' to draw the birds away from the rig. It helped win environmental approval while other multibillion-dollar Sakhalin projects were slowed by similar concerns. The false perches are made of sticks.

HEADLINE: Full Tanks and Empty Wallets Put Squeeze on Working Class

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

DATELINE: MIAMI BEACH, May 12 

 BODY:
Giving up the occasional rib-eye steak hasn't been the hardest part for Ana Lopez, although her husband is a red-meat man.
 More difficult are having to tell her 11-year-old son that he cannot go to the movies, and swearing off Sunday visits to her sister in Pembroke Pines or to her brother in Miami Lakes. These are the sacrifices required now that it costs $60 to fill her aging Toyota 4Runner.
Ms. Lopez, 48, who lives in the outlying suburb of West Kendall, must conserve every gallon possible for the 60-mile round trip to and from her job as the housekeeping manager at the Bentley Hotel in Miami Beach. ''There is not enough money to spend for gas,'' she said. ''You have to think about it: If I go to see my friend, I won't have enough gas to work tomorrow.'' 
 As many drivers struggle to cope with soaring fuel prices, working-class people like Ms. Lopez who commute long distances to their jobs are suffering the most. In many cases, they had moved far away from major metropolitan areas to be able to afford decent houses. Now, paradoxically, the cost of gas is making the distance prohibitively expensive.
 ''If you're poor, you're forced to make choices,'' said Stephen Cecchetti, a professor of economics at Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass. ''All of a sudden, when the price of something that you can't give up skyrockets, you still have to go from one place to another.'' 
 The increase in gas prices comes at a time when many Americans of modest means are already finding themselves squeezed by increased insurance costs, wages that have not kept pace with inflation, and the rising pressure of adjustable rate mortgages. The latest New York Times/CBS News poll showed that 63 percent of respondents had cut back on their driving because of the gas price increase, and 56 percent had cut back on other household spending. Nearly half said they expected to change their summer vacation plans as a result.
 Aline Lacombe, who travels from Palm Beach County to her job as a legal assistant at the Justice Department in downtown Miami, has stopped driving altogether. As a result, her commute now includes two train rides and a shuttle, and takes close to two hours each way, at least twice what it used to.
 ''It's a nightmare,'' said Ms. Lacombe, a 39-year-old mother of three children under 10. She is also losing sleep because of the longer commute: wake-up time is 5:20 a.m. now; it used to be 7. 
 For Ms. Lacombe, gasoline costs used to be about $100 a week, about 11 percent of her $45,000 annual salary; that figure is closer to $200 a week now.
 For Ms. Lopez, driving to and from work used to cost $30 a week; now it costs $80. With an annual income of $32,000, that means nearly 13 percent of her income goes for gas, instead of about 5 percent, as in the past. 
 Myah Christian, 18, drives her Honda Accord an hour and a half every day from her home near Miami Gardens to her job as a hostess at the DeLido Beach Club at the Ritz-Carlton here. She also commutes to Broward Community College in Fort Lauderdale, where she studies nursing. Though she lives at home with her mother, Ms. Christian wants to contribute to the household, and fuel prices are making that harder. ''You have to minimize what you usually spend, put aside gas money every week,'' she said.
 Christina Cordovez, 22, commutes across town to Carlos Albizu University, west of Miami International Airport, where she is studying psychology, and to her job as a bartender at the Doubletree Hotel here. She said her friends who drive eight-cylinder vehicles have it the worst. ''It's like having another home,'' she said. ''Mine is a four-cylinder, so I can deal with it.'' 
 Many workers with long commutes are trying to come up with alternatives. Dean Mitchell, 37, who works with Ms. Cordovez at the Doubletree, got rid of his car, but he lives close enough to walk to work and otherwise takes the bus now. ''I want to get an alternative-fuel car,'' he said. ''I'm not interested in paying for gas anymore.''
 ''I don't want to fund the Arabs,'' he added. ''I want to spend my money on ethanol.''
 Roberto Alviarez, 49, a bellman at the Bentley Hotel, has begun using his bicycle for errands near his home in Coral Gables. Mr. Alviarez said he was looking for an affordable place to live closer to work.
 ''I want to move someplace nice,'' he said.
 Some Floridians said they were considering moving to lower-cost areas.
 Ms. Lopez -- whose trip home to her West Kendall ranch-style house can take as long as two hours and 45 minutes -- has her eye on Dallas, where she heard that utilities are cheaper than they are here, where she pays a $350 water bill every three months. Her husband, Ubardo Rondon, has yet to agree to move, though he has a long commute, too. 
 Mr. Rondon, 52, works two room-service jobs every day -- one from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables and another from 3:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. at the Doubletree Hotel in Coconut Grove. In between, he rushes to pick up his son from school and drop him with the baby sitter. 
 Ms. Lopez could try to car-pool. But she values her autonomy. ''I don't want to depend on nobody,'' she said. ''I'm not that kind of person.'' So she continues to rise early and set out on her morning commute, taking the Don Shula Expressway to the Palmetto Expressway to the Dolphin Expressway. 
 She watches television now instead of going to the movies, and spends more time visiting friends within walking distance. She no longer contemplates luxuries like a manicure or a trip to the beauty salon. And Ms. Lopez looks for weekly specials at the supermarket. Salmon, her favorite fish, is $7 a pound these days. So she buys the tilapia for $2.99 instead.

HEADLINE: The Greening of Nuclear Power

 BODY:
Not so many years ago, nuclear energy was a hobgoblin to environmentalists, who feared the potential for catastrophic accidents and long-term radiation contamination. But this is a new era, dominated by fears of tight energy supplies and global warming. Suddenly nuclear power is looking better. 
 The nuclear industry recently trotted out two new leaders of its campaign to encourage the building of new reactors. They are Christie Whitman, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and Patrick Moore, a co-founder of Greenpeace. This campaign is the latest sign that nuclear power is getting a more welcome reception from some environmentalists who have moved on to bigger worries. 
True, most environmental organizations remain adamantly opposed to any expansion of nuclear power and instead look to conservation and renewable energy to get us out of the fossil fuel age. But when the ecologist James Lovelock -- creator of the Gaia hypothesis, which holds that Earth and all its organisms behave as if they were a single living system -- urges his colleagues to drop their ''wrongheaded opposition'' to nuclear energy, it is clear that fissures are developing. 
 There is good reason to give nuclear power a fresh look. It can diversify our sources of energy with a fuel -- uranium -- that is both abundant and inexpensive. More important, nuclear energy can replace fossil-fuel power plants for generating electricity, reducing the carbon dioxide emissions that contribute heavily to global warming. That could be important in large developing economies like China's and India's, which would otherwise rely heavily on burning large quantities of dirty coal and oil.
 But nuclear power should not be given a free pass in our frantic quest for energy and environmental security. Making any real dent in carbon emissions could require building many hundreds or even thousands of new nuclear plants around the world in coming decades, a hugely ambitious undertaking fraught with challenges. 
 As nuclear expertise and technologies spread around the world, so does the risk that they might be used to make bombs. Unfortunately, the Bush administration erred badly when it signed a nuclear pact with India that would undercut the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the cornerstone of international efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. That misguided deal needs to be repudiated by the Senate. We can only hope that it does not undercut a more promising administration plan to keep the most dangerous fuel-making technologies out of circulation by supplying developing nations with uranium and taking the spent fuel rods back. 
 There remains the unsolved problem of what to do with the radioactive waste generated by nuclear plants. Many people are unwilling to see a resurgence in nuclear power without some assurance that the spent fuel can be handled safely. The Energy Department's repeated setbacks in efforts to open an underground waste repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada do not inspire confidence, but there is no reason why the spent fuel rods can't be stored safely at surface sites for the next 50 to 100 years. 
 More problematic is the administration's long-term solution for waste disposal. It wants to recycle the spent fuel in a new generation of advanced reactors that would use technologies that don't yet exist, following a timetable that many experts think unrealistic. Its current approach is apt to be costly and would leave dangerous plutonium more accessible to terrorists.
 Nuclear power has a good safety record in this country, and its costs, despite the high initial expense of building the plants, are looking more reasonable now that fossil fuel prices are soaring. How much impact it could really have in slowing carbon emissions has yet to be spelled out, but there is no doubt that nuclear power could serve as a useful bridge to even greener sources of energy.

HEADLINE: Buyers Don't Let High Prices Get in the Way

BYLINE: By Mark A. Stein

 BODY:
KEEP spending. That message came through in several ways this week, in decisions by corporate boards to pursue mergers despite high valuations, in the determination of drivers to burn more gasoline regardless of near record prices, and in the assumption that consumers will gladly pay twice as much for the latest electronic playthings.
 Investors initially pushed the Dow Jones industrial average closer to its record high, set in 2000, but not by much. Other indexes were down slightly, or flat. For the week, the markets lost ground.

GILDED OPPORTUNITY -- Seeking a bigger presence in the biggest state, Wachovia agreed to buy the Golden West Financial Corporation, one of the biggest mortgage lenders in California, for about $26 billion. 
With the deal, Wachovia, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., and does most of its business along the East Coast and in the South, will become a major player on the West Coast, too.
 Wachovia -- the fourth-largest bank in the country, after Citigroup, Bank of America and J. P. Morgan Chase -- made a small move in California last September, when it agreed to buy Westcorp and its subsidiary WFS Financial. That gave Wachovia retail branches in the state and let it more than double the size of its auto lending business.
 Some investors and Wall Street analysts question the timing of Wachovia's increasing its exposure to mortgages. As interest rates have crept higher recently, mortgage applications have declined.

NOW WHAT? As expected, the Federal Reserve raised the short-term interest rate target by a quarter percentage point. But in explaining why, the Fed left many investors wondering what comes next.
 Investors had expected that the Fed, after raising its benchmark rate to 5 percent from 4.75, would signal a pause in the current cycle of tighter credit, which began in 2004. 
 But, in a statement, the Fed said ''further policy firming may yet be needed'' to curb inflation. It added that ''the extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information.''
 Some of that information will arrive next week, when the Labor Department updates the monthly Producer Price Index on Tuesday and the Consumer Price Index on Wednesday.

THE GAME GAME -- A year late and $100 short. That is how some analysts saw Sony's announcement that it would begin selling its next-generation video game console, PlayStation 3, on Nov. 17, for $499. A souped-up model with more memory will cost $599.
 They said the timing and price would put it at a disadvantage to Microsoft, which introduced its Xbox 360 console last year, charging $299 for a basic set and $399 for an upgraded model. Microsoft has already sold 10 million Xbox 360's.
 Even at the higher price, Sony will probably sell its new PlayStations at a loss, analysts said, because it comes with a high-definition DVD format called Blu-ray. Sony, however, is eager to take the loss -- which may be offset by license fees from game makers -- to establish Blu-ray as a popular high-definition DVD format. A rival, Toshiba, is preparing a different, competing format.
 PlayStation 3 consoles will sell out when introduced because the brand has a loyal following, analysts said. But they added that Sony may have to cut the price eventually to reach a broader audience.

STIFF FINE -- A federal judge fined Henry C. Yuen $22.3 million for having defrauded investors by inflating revenue figures at Gemstar-TV Guide International when he was its chief executive.
 The penalty includes ''disgorging,'' or repaying, $10.6 million in what the Securities and Exchange Commission said were ''ill-gotten gains.'' It defined them as performance bonuses and profits from stock sales.
 Part of the money will be used to reimburse investors in Gemstar, which publishes TV Guide and operates onscreen channel guides for cable companies. But Gemstar has estimated that the fraud cost its shareholders, including the News Corporation, Rupert Murdoch's media conglomerate, billions of dollars in lost market value and other expenses. 
 Mr. Yuen is also forbidden to serve as an officer or director of a publicly traded company.

LAB PARTNERS -- In a combination that would create one of the world's largest suppliers of laboratory instruments and supplies, Thermo Electron agreed to buy Fisher Scientific for $10.6 billion in stock.
 Thermo Electron, based in Waltham, Mass., sells mass spectrometers, centrifuges, incubators and other instruments and appliances. Fisher, based in Hampton, N.H., focuses on biochemicals and other supplies, as well as services like managing clinical trials.
 While Thermo Electron's sales were less than half those of Fisher, its chief executive, Marijn E. Dekkers, will run the combined company.

AWAITING APPEAL -- An Apple by any other name is unlikely to confuse consumers, a British judge ruled.
 Justice Edward Mann of the High Court said the apple logo that Apple Computer uses on its iTunes digital music store does not infringe on the rights of Apple Corps, a company that manages the Beatles' musical interests.
 More than a billion songs have been downloaded from iTunes, which charges 99 cents for each. The Web-based service accounts for at least 6 percent of overall music revenue, an industry group said.
 Apple Corps said it would appeal.

HEADLINE: Breaking Ranks Over Education, G.O.P. Lawmakers Deal a Setback to Governor Bush 

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

DATELINE: MIAMI, May 12 

 BODY:
Seven months before Gov. Jeb Bush leaves office, his chance of leaving a legacy on his signature issue of education has been significantly impaired by state legislators from his own Republican Party.
 Two of Mr. Bush's education priorities were voted down by the Legislature last week at the end of this year's session. The constitutional amendments would have reversed a State Supreme Court decision invalidating school vouchers and loosened strict limits on class size.
Six of the Senate's 26 Republicans joined Democrats in voting against the class-size initiative; four did the same against the voucher plan. 
 Politicians of both parties acknowledge that Mr. Bush's losses marked a change for a Republican-led Legislature that typically fell in line behind the two-term governor. 
 Newspapers have made much of these setbacks for Mr. Bush. The Orlando Sentinel called them ''the biggest defeats of his eight years in office.'' The Miami Herald said they were ''some of the most stinging defeats of his political career.'' The St. Petersburg Times said, ''Florida is entering a period of profound transition: the post-Jeb era.''
 Democrats are clearly enjoying the moment. ''The voucher thing -- it's his baby,'' State Representative Ron L. Greenstein, Democrat of Coconut Creek, said in an interview. ''It's a sour note to leave on.''
 Some suggest that Mr. Bush is paying the price for his status as a departing officeholder -- and maybe even for that of his brother President Bush. ''They're both lame ducks,'' said State Representative Dan Gelber, a Miami Democrat who is the incoming House minority leader. ''On the other hand, they are still the Republican family in the country. It's hard to deny the power of that family, certainly in the Republican Party and in the nation.''
 The two amendments were at the heart of Mr. Bush's efforts to reduce the influence of teachers' unions and to allow private schools to become a more accessible alternative to those run by the state. His office nonetheless continues to emphasize Mr. Bush's legislative victories, like the passage of his ''A++'' education plan that allows high school students to select majors and minors. 
 ''We have seen great accomplishments out of the session,'' said Alia Faraj, Mr. Bush's communications director. ''Economic development, tax cuts, hurricane preparedness -- it's been a banner year.''
 Mr. Bush's supporters play down the significance of the two legislative defeats, saying his education agenda has always been larger. ''His accomplishments in the education field have been historic,'' said Bob Martinez, whom Mr. Bush appointed to the State Board of Education. ''It doesn't get done overnight.''
 Class sizes in Florida were limited in 2002 by a ballot initiative that was approved by voters and supported by teachers' unions. The law calls for gradually cutting class sizes by 2010 to 18 students in kindergarten through third grade; 22 students in fourth grade through eighth grade, and 25 in high school.
 While running for re-election in 2002, Mr. Bush made the class size issue central to his platform, warning that it would cost billions of dollars to build schools and hire teachers to comply with the limits. 
 He has since tried repeatedly to offer enticements to eliminate the limits, tying the plan to teacher salary increases and to a requirement that school districts direct at least 65 percent of their money toward classroom spending. The amendment most recently defeated would have raised the class size limits by five students, among other changes.
 Mr. Bush's voucher proposal would have amended the State Constitution to allow public money to be used for scholarships to private schools, overturning a Florida Supreme Court ruling that declared them unconstitutional. 
 State Senator Dennis L. Jones, Republican of Seminole, was one of the Republicans who broke with his party on the issue. During the debate, he pointed out that voters have opposed vouchers in referendums in Colorado, the District of Columbia, Maryland, Michigan, Oregon and Washington State. ''Quit using public money to send our kids to private schools,'' Mr. Jones said, as reported by The Tallahassee Democrat.
 State Senator Evelyn J. Lynn, an Ormond Beach Republican and chairwoman of the Senate Education Committee, also joined Democrats in voting against the plan. Ms. Lynn said vouchers did not belong in the Constitution and called the plan an attack on the public school system. 
 State Senator J. Alex Villalobos, a Republican from Miami who opposed both amendments, was fired as majority leader by the Senate president, Tom Lee, Republican of Brandon. Mr. Villalobos said he chose to vote with his constituents and his principles. 
 ''I think what it signals is the senators aren't rubber stamps,'' he said. ''I voted with my district, which is overwhelmingly Republican. How the party line is 'stick it to South Florida schools' is beyond my imagination.''
 But others say the crossing of party lines signals a political shift to the middle as the state prepares to elect a new governor in November. 
 ''It's important on a lot of levels, showing there's a moderate center that held,'' said State Senator Rod Smith of Alachua, a Democratic candidate for governor. ''The Bush administration is hitting the shoreline. He's more popular than his policies.''
 One political pollster warned against making too much of a governor's last legislative hurrah. 
 ''He didn't have a great session, but I don't know how much that affects his popularity in the state,'' said the pollster, Brad Coker, the managing director of Mason-Dixon Polling and Research. ''The legislative stuff is really more insider baseball.''
 Mr. Coker said that compared with other two-term Florida governors in recent history, Mr. Bush falls squarely in the middle in terms of approval ratings, with 63 percent. Gov. Lawton Chiles had a 54 percent approval rating toward the end of the 1998 legislative session, and Gov. Bob Graham had 83 percent in July 1986. 
 ''Each of them faced rough last-term sessions,'' Mr. Coker said. ''When you have a two-term governor, I think people tend to evaluate over the full eight years of office. One bad session is not going to hurt you.''

HEADLINE: Bolivia and Venezuela Are Chided at European Gathering

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: VIENNA, May 12 

 BODY:
Trying to walk a diplomatic tightrope, several European and Latin American leaders criticized Bolivia and Venezuela on Friday for their hostile treatment of foreign investors. But the leaders also vigorously defended efforts to do business with the two countries.
 The leaders, who were attending a meeting on energy and trade, were careful not to speak directly of the Bolivian president, Evo Morales, and the Venezuelan leader, Hugo Chavez, who are attending the same conference. But behind their diplomacy, the officials made clear that they disagreed with the policy of nationalization and the opposition to free trade agreements that the Bolivian and Venezuelan leaders have promoted.
 President Vicente Fox of Mexico, a former Coca-Cola executive, delivered the most pointed critique of Bolivia and Venezuela, where nationalizations and populist oratory have proved wildly popular. In contrast, Mexico long ago embraced the North American Free Trade Agreement, linking it with the United States and Canada. 
 ''It's a false exit from poverty,'' Mr. Fox said of the Venezuelan model. ''That's what I think populism is. We need a policy for social development without lying to anyone.''
 The president of Peru, Alejandro Toledo, said populist appeals would be ''a great party overnight and end in a great headache and sorrow for everyone, including the poorest.''
 Mr. Chavez, a former army officer who has won acclaim by sniping at the United States, did not relent in Europe, and rejected criticism of the sort that Mr. Fox mounted. ''Now a new era has begun in Latin America,'' Mr. Chavez said on arriving at the meeting on Friday, according to Reuters. ''Some call it populism, trying to disfigure our beauty.''
 Venezuela is pressing to have its state-owned energy company take bigger shares in its ventures with European and American producers. Mr. Morales nationalized Bolivia's oil and gas resources on May 1, a move that affected British Gas, Repsol of Spain and Total of France.
 Mr. Morales, who kicked off the meeting with a pugnacious vow not to compensate foreign companies for Bolivia's nationalizations, chose a softer tone on Friday.
 After meeting with Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero of Spain, Mr. Morales gave the Spanish government a letter that promised ''genuine, lasting legal security'' for foreign companies once new energy contracts are negotiated. The countries will form a commission to discuss the nationalizations, which affect the heavy investments that Repsol has made in Bolivia.
 The summit meeting's final declaration gave a nod to ''the sovereign right of countries to manage and regulate their natural resources.''
 But President Jacques Chirac of France spoke up for stronger trade links and urged concessions by the Latin American countries so that the Doha trade talks under the World Trade Organization could succeed.
 ''Trade and investment growth must lie at the heart of the relationship between our two regions,'' Mr. Chirac said. He said European companies wanted to support Latin America ''based on the sovereign choices of each state and within a framework in which legal security and equity are fully ensured.''
 With one eye on nervous markets that this week pushed the price of oil back above $70 a barrel, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain emphasized that Bolivia's and Venezuela's actions ''matter enormously to all of us,'' given the voracious global appetite for energy.
 ''My only plea is that people exercise the power they've got in this regard responsibly for the whole of the international community,'' Mr. Blair said.
 The wrangle in Bolivia has drawn in Brazil, which is trying to manage a balancing act. Brazil has usually played a friendly leading role in commercial integration within South America, but now finds itself having to get tough with Mr. Morales on behalf of Petrobras, the Brazilian energy giant. Celso Amorim, the foreign minister of Brazil, professed ''indignation'' at accusations by Mr. Morales that Petrobras, a large investor in Bolivia, had acted illegally.

HEADLINE: Still Here? Rumors May Fly, But Treasury Chief Hangs On

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12 

 BODY:
Against all odds and punditry, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow keeps showing up for work. 
 He persists despite a stream of damning quotations attributed to unidentified White House officials, tepid votes of confidence from President Bush and countless predictions that had him out the door by spring. Of 2005.
 Mr. Snow was supposed to be among the first casualties of the White House shakeup under the new chief of staff, Joshua B. Bolten, administration insiders say. Last Friday, for instance, when the White House said the president would be making a personnel announcement, legions of Snow forecasters thought his day had finally come.
 Instead, Mr. Bush reported that Porter J. Goss, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, had resigned. Mr. Snow, a genial former railroad executive, survived. 
 While every presidency includes officials deemed on-the-outs, no other cabinet member in recent memory has endured so lasting a deathwatch as Mr. Snow. He has become a legendary spectacle in a capital kabuki: a president and his surrogates delivering indirect signals about an official's status while everyone else tries to decipher what they mean -- by parsing public statements, decoding anonymous ones and studying body language. 
 Washington has a peculiar fascination with important people perceived to be dangling past their expiration dates. Cruel and public vigils animate the Beltway bloviation circuit. 
 But Mr. Snow, who took office in February 2003, is an atypical case. He has committed no memorable gaffes, and his tenure has coincided with an improving economy. He has drawn few enemies and is hardly combative or outspoken, in contrast with previous on-the-outers like Vice President Spiro T. Agnew in the Nixon administration; John H. Sununu, White House chief of staff under the first President Bush; or Paul H. O'Neill, Mr. Snow's predecessor at the Treasury.
 Rather, Mr. Snow, who declined to be interviewed about his job status, is a courtly storyteller with an avuncular bearing who often punctuates sentences with a sudden grin, even if there is no apparent amusement in things like ''global imbalances'' or ''currency flexibility.'' 
 ''I don't know a single person who is mad at Secretary Snow,'' said Representative Tom Feeney, a Florida Republican who joined him in a conference call last week to discuss April employment numbers. ''There are tons of blogs about Bush and Cheney and Rumsfeld. But not Snow.'' 
 Mr. Feeney describes the secretary as a ''personable, likable guy'' who ''no one really thinks that much about.''
 That may help explain Mr. Snow's precarious circumstance. His failing appears to be as a cheerleader.
 ''This is an economy that by any statistical measure would be the envy of any administration of any party,'' said John J. Castellani, president of the Business Roundtable, who has known the secretary since Mr. Snow's days as chief executive of the CSX Corporation. ''Yet the public perception of the economy is a poor one.''
 Mr. Snow was brought in to be a safe team player, someone unlike Mr. O'Neill, who had a habit of speaking out of turn. But while he has proved to be loyal, his critics say he has also proved to be innocuous. 
 Previous treasury secretaries -- Robert E. Rubin under Bill Clinton, James A. Baker III under Ronald Reagan, for example -- commanded authority not just in the Treasury Building but also at the White House and in the financial markets. The big problems on the agenda offer a forceful economic policy maker a chance to leave behind a meaningful legacy. And some of this administration's successes -- low unemployment, a healthy stock market, tax cuts -- offer an opportunity to boast and sway opinion.
 Pat Toomey, president of the Club for Growth, a conservative economic advocacy group, said Mr. Snow deserved credit for trumpeting President Bush's tax-cutting, ''which has been the biggest cause of these good economic times.'' But Mr. Toomey added: ''You've got to make sure that the boss gets the credit for the economy. And Snow just hasn't done that.''
 Why is he still on the federal payroll? Largely because the White House has been unable to find a replacement, administration officials say. Mr. Snow has agreed to stay on in the meantime, befitting his good-soldier credentials. One Republican lobbyist with close ties to the White House and the Treasury Department said the secretary was told last fall that the administration expected to have a successor in place by January.
 Mr. Snow, a 66-year-old native of Toledo, Ohio, served in the Ford administration, did a stint as chief of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and worked as a lobbyist for a rail company that became part of CSX, the industry giant he later ran. He has a passion for pickup basketball and tennis. (A frequent partner is Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the Federal Reserve.)
 Friends say he is aware of the indignity of his circumstances. He has told associates that he finds it more annoying than humiliating. He mostly ignores the frequent queries about his job standing and has betrayed little pique in public. To others, though, the duration of his limbo has been striking. 
 ''I haven't seen it at this level in the past,'' Mr. Castellani said. ''I have always been perplexed as to why this has become such a story and why it seems to never end.''
 One reason is that administration officials have shown only the feeblest support for Mr. Snow. On the contrary, they have nourished doubt. In one example often cited, The Washington Post quoted a senior administration official as saying that Mr. Snow could ''stay as long as he wants, provided it's not very long.'' That was in November 2004. 
 When a reporter asked Mr. Bush last month whether Mr. Snow was ''expected to stay,'' the president responded with a particularly labored show of support. 
 ''I'm glad you brought him up,'' Mr. Bush said with a frozen-smiling Mr. Snow a few feet away in the White House Roosevelt Room. ''He has been a valuable member of my administration, and I trust his judgment and appreciate his service.'' This contrasted sharply with Mr. Bush's strenuous endorsement of Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld a few days later. 
 ''Forget being left to twist in the wind, Snow is on assisted living at this point,'' said Marshall Wittman, a senior fellow with the Democratic Leadership Council. Mr. Wittman said the secretary was a longtime tenant in ''the Bush facility for assisted care for soon-to-go cabinet members.''
 Tim Worstall, a freelance economics columnist, suggested on his blog as early as 2004 that Mr. Snow get his own reality television show: ''Survivor: The Cabinet Edition.'' 
 As Mr. Bush prepared to make his ''personnel announcement'' last Friday, Mr. Snow was busy acclaiming the ''pretty much unmitigated good news everywhere'' in April's employment data. He addressed reporters at the Treasury Department, surrounded by framed photos of Mr. Bush and him in presidential settings: in the Oval Office, at Mr. Bush's Texas ranch, walking toward Marine One. 
 Afterward, in the hallway, Mr. Snow took a reporter's question about the status of his own employment. 
 Was all the speculation about his departure creating a distraction? 
 ''I never comment on rumors,'' said Mr. Snow, who then pivoted and walked away.

HEADLINE: Literary New York

BYLINE: By STEVEN KURUTZ

 BODY:

WHY GO NOW -- New York has never lacked for colorful characters, evocative settings and random experiences, in sum, fiction's fodder. That's why, perhaps more than any other American city, New York has been a beacon to writers and a ready-made backdrop for novels. So much so that it's entirely possible to plan a vacation based solely around literary New York -- to eat at the same restaurants, stay in the same hotels, explore the same city as a beloved fictional character. (Try that in, say, Tulsa.) This journey may reveal a fresh glimpse of a city that is, tantalizingly, never fully knowable. As the novelist Paul Auster writes in ''The New York Trilogy:'' ''New York was an inexhaustible space, a labyrinth of endless steps, and no matter how far he walked, no matter how well he came to know its neighborhoods and streets, it always left him with the feeling of being lost.'' Here, Mr. Auster is setting down the thoughts of his protagonist, Quinn, a mystery writer. But both men know that New York is a place worth getting lost in any time of the year. 


WHERE TO STAY -- New York is an expensive town. But let's say you're traveling on a budget, or you're cheap, and you'd like a literary justification for booking into a hotel where Continental breakfast means walking to the corner deli. Try the Y.M.C.A. That's where P. B. Jones stays. He's the narrator of ''Answered Prayers,'' Truman Capote's dishy, thinly fictionalized tale about Manhattan's well heeled. The rooms aren't fancy, but they're clean and perfectly adequate at the Harlem Y (180 West 135th Street, 212-281-4100; starting at $50), the Vanderbilt (224 East 47th Street, 212-756-9600; starting at $80) and the West Side (5 West 63rd Street, 212-875-4273; starting at $72).
Two hotel options more in keeping with Mr. Capote's reputation for enjoying the good life are the Pierre (Fifth Avenue at 61st Street, 212-838-8000; starting at $570), whose well-appointed rooms and sweeping views serve as an upscale setting for a downward spiral in ''Some Hope,'' a druggy novel by the English writer Edward St. Aubyn, and the Hilton New York (1335 Avenue of the Americas, 212-586-7000; starting at $229), which appears in Laurent de Brunhoff's children's book ''Babar Comes to America.'' It's tough to beat the Hilton's Midtown location: Central Park and the Museum of Modern Art are both within walking distance, even by elephant standards. 
 One spot that boasts a rich literary and music history is the famed Hotel Chelsea (222 West 23rd Street, 212-243-3700; starting at $195; book at least three weeks in advance), which, believe it or not, was a home to writers long before Ethan Hawke moved in. Consider the past guest list: Mark Twain, Tennessee Williams, William S. Burroughs, Arthur Miller. Unfortunately, these writers made little mention of the Chelsea in their work, leaving Dee Dee Ramone's ''Chelsea Hotel Horror'' as the definitive novel about the hotel. People-watching in the lobby is highly recommended; Mr. Ramone's novel is optional.

WHERE TO EAT -- Most of New York's great restaurants have not been name checked in late-20th-century novels and short stories. Still, it's entirely possible to cull three square meals from fiction references. For breakfast or lunch try Morning Star (879 Ninth Avenue, 212-246-1593). The restaurant is on the edge of Hell's Kitchen, serves diner fare like omelets ($4.05) and hamburgers ($4.10) and, along with the Flame (893 Ninth Avenue, 212-765-7962), appears in Lawrence Block's ''All the Flowers Are Dying,'' a terse crime potboiler. Here's the narrator's equally terse review: ''They're both New York-style Greek coffee shops, and neither one's a candidate for the next edition of Zagat, but they're not terrible, and God knows they're handy.''
 The more adventurous should head to Chinatown for a meal at Oriental Garden (14 Elizabeth Street, 212-619-0085), a noted dim sum place that appears in Pete Hamill's novel ''Forever.'' The main character, a man granted eternal life as long as he never leaves Manhattan, orders ''separate mounds of cool shrimp and hot chicken.'' But he has several lifetimes to eat here. You're only in town for a few days so get the duck ($32). 
 If you're a few drinks into the evening and looking for a late-night meal, hit Odeon (145 West Broadway, 212-233-0507), the brasserie that doubled as an after-hours clubhouse for the young Turks in Jay McInerney's 1984 novel ''Bright Lights, Big City.'' Skinny ties and ''Bolivian marching powder'' may go in and out of fashion, but Odeon never has. It's a modern classic, and the rare hot spot that feels completely democratic. The menu is a little expensive (the steak frites will set you back $31; a hamburger, $15), but it's a small price to pay to feel the great big pulse of New York at night (kitchen closes at 2 a.m.). 

WHAT TO DO DURING THE DAY -- In 1952, the New Yorker writer Joseph Mitchell published ''Up in the Old Hotel,'' an article about the Fulton Fish Market and its colorful characters, like Louis Morino, a bandy-legged Italian immigrant who grew fig trees in his yard in Brooklyn and ran Sloppy Louie's, a seafood restaurant. Together, the men explored the boarded-up remains of the Fulton Ferry Hotel. A morning at the South Street Seaport Museum (12 Fulton Street, 212-748-8600) will educate you about the city's history as a port and offer a look at the waterfront that fascinated Mr. Mitchell, one of the city's great reporters. The museum features shipping and whaling artifacts, two boats in the harbor accessible to museumgoers, and, once a month, it gives a tour of the old hotel (reservations are strongly recommended).
 With the afternoon on your hands, take the subway to Brooklyn. The city's biggest borough in population looms large in the imaginations of writers. Start on Court Street, which runs through the Italian neighborhood of Carroll Gardens. Jonathan Lethem set his acclaimed novel ''Motherless Brooklyn'' in this milieu, describing Court Street as a place ''with pizzeria and butcher-shop bosses and unwritten rules everywhere.'' Upwardly mobile types fleeing Manhattan's high rents have partly remade the area, but old men still argue in Italian and play boccie in Carroll Park, and there's plenty of Brooklyn attitude -- and food -- in shops like G. Esposito & Sons Pork Store (357 Court Street, 718-875-6863) and Court Pastry (298 Court Street, 718-875- 4820), which attracts foodies all the way from the Bronx for the sfogliatelle. 
 Next stop: Coney Island, where parts of both ''Requiem for a Dream'' by Hubert Selby Jr. and Sol Yurick's ''The Warriors'' were set. Both novels spawned cult movies and portray Coney Island as a rotting urban jungle. But the area is on the comeback. The Village Voice holds a popular indie music festival there each summer (www.villagevoice.com/specials/siren) and kitschy, family-friendly places like the New York Aquarium (602 Surf Avenue, 718-265-3403) and Astroland Amusement Park (1000 Surf Avenue, 718-372-0275) only get better with age. Worth noting: it's considered a criminal act to leave Coney Island without eating one, two or three hot dogs at Nathan's Famous (1310 Surf Avenue, 718-946-2202). 
 All this literary-inspired sightseeing might work up an appetite of a different kind. If so, head back to Manhattan to the Strand Book Store (828 Broadway, 212-473-1452), which like the city itself is big and unruly and chaotic (the store's ''8 miles of books'' logo was recently lengthened to ''18''). If you want to be clever, you could find a copy of ''The Namesake'' by Jhumpa Lahiri and read about the Strand while inside the Strand; if not, just browse the miles of bargain books

WHAT TO DO AT NIGHT -- A high-minded, touristy sort of thing to do when you're in New York would be to attend a performance at the Metropolitan Opera at Lincoln Center, tickets for which can run more than $300 (30 Lincoln Center Plaza, 212-362-6000). A more creative -- and economic -- way to do this would be to follow the lead of the characters in ''The Extra Man'' by the comic novelist Jonathan Ames who second-act the show, waiting in the lobby and asking departing operagoers for their re-entry stubs.
 It's not often that you'll get a recommendation for the Y twice in one day, but the 92nd Street Y (1395 Lexington Avenue, 212-415-5500) is not your standard gym-and-pool community center. Founded in 1874 as the Young Men's Hebrew Association, it's one of the city's great cultural institutions and a frequent stop for authors. Norman Mailer has lectured there, so have Vladimir Nabokov, Kurt Vonnegut Jr., John Irving and one of the characters in Mr. Irving's ''A Widow for One Year.'' Check the Web site for a schedule of events (www.92y.org). 
 You can't have a literary tour without a stop at a bar. So pull up a stool at the White Horse Tavern (567 Hudson Street, 212-989-3956), where Dylan Thomas reportedly drank himself to death and where another well-known imbiber, Hunter S. Thompson, begins his novel ''The Rum Diary.'' Hang around and soak up the history (the bar dates from 1880). But go easy: with big hamburgers and slab-cut fries ($7.95) and mugs of beer ($5 and $6), the White Horse is the kind of place that encourages excess. 

WHERE TO SHOP -- The quintessential New York novel wouldn't be about ambition, or politics, or race relations. No, it would be about some frustrating triviality of urban life that burrs under your skin and festers. Like parking. Which is the central plot point of Calvin Trillin's ''Tepper Isn't Going Out,'' a novel about a man who becomes a celebrity as a result of his refusing to give up great parking spaces, one of them in front of Russ & Daughters (179 East Houston Street, 212-475-4880). Like Tepper, this fourth-generation, Jewish-centric food shop is a city landmark, the go-to place for lox and herring and pastries like babka and rugelach.
 For clothes, go no farther than Bergdorf Goodman (754 Fifth Avenue, 212-753-7300; the men's store is across the street), which is so renowned among the city's shopperati that it inspired a book, ''Bergdorf Blondes'' by the Vogue contributor Plum Sykes. 

YES, FREE -- In life, as in the Big Apple, some of the finest pleasures don't cost a cent. Like sunning oneself on the Great Meadow in Central Park. That's where Walker Percy's novel ''The Last Gentleman'' begins (Will Barrett, the gentleman in question, is bird-watching when he spots a beautiful woman and falls in love). On weekends, the meadow turns into South Beach, as sun-starved urbanites trade sand for grass. Go in an off-hour to stretch out comfortably in the city's biggest backyard.

 CORRECTION:
The Going To column on May 14 about literary New York misstated the setting of the novel ''Requiem for a Dream'' by Hubert Selby Jr. It is the Bronx, not Coney Island, which was the setting for the movie based on the book.

HEADLINE: Intelligent Design And Evolution

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 One has only to look at the acceptance of ''intelligent design'' by the president and high-ranking members of Congress to define a society that looks on evolution with open hostility or suspicion. 
 Creationists recognized years ago that very few students take college courses in biology, and most are exposed to a serious study of biology only in high school. Today most biology texts cover evolution, but in specific chapters that can be conveniently ignored by teachers under threat. Such books use several approaches (ecological or biochemical, for example) but not an evolutionary approach, which is sorely needed in this country.
Book companies claim that an evolutionary approach to teaching biology is economically unfeasible. Isn't it strange that creationists can pour millions into irrational books, theme parks and ''think'' tanks, but the science community will not finance a text that would help change attitudes toward evolution?

HEADLINE: Call Them 'Refugees,' if It Gets the Job Done 

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

DATELINE: Atlanta 

 BODY:
AFTER Hurricane Katrina, ''refugee'' became a dirty word. Its ''pejoration,'' as the linguists called it, was swift. Displaced Gulf Coast residents, and those who claimed to speak for them, said the word implied that New Orleanians were not Americans. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, Washington lawmakers, the N.A.A.C.P. and ultimately even President Bush objected to its use, and it quickly became incorrect. 
 But on a recent afternoon in Houston, Linda Jeffers, a tall New Orleanian in a broad-brimmed straw hat, told a roomful of evacuees that she wished she were a refugee. 
 The refugee, it seems, has it all over the evacuee. 
 ''They got clothing, they got furniture, they give them jobs,'' Ms. Jeffers said. ''Twenty-four hours after they get to these United States -- now you all pay taxes for this -- they give them a Social Security card, they give them Medicaid, and here we are, and nobody's saying nothing for us.''
 As a community organizer, she had become familiar enough with the social services network in Houston to believe that had she been a Hmong tribeswoman or a Sudanese villager, she would have been faring better. Her situation was, after all, not so different -- she had arrived with little or nothing, knowing no one, traumatized. She could not return home. Her stay was, if not permanent, indefinite.
 But the way she was treated was not the same. On arrival, refugees are given, for a specified time, housing, medical care, food, a caseworker's assistance; in short, the rudiments of a life. Half are employed within six months, says the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, part of the Department of Health and Human Services. 
 Evacuees, on the other hand, had to depend on last-minute Congressional measures to extend their unemployment aid or fend off bill collectors. They are at the mercy of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, a centralized bureaucracy with ever-mutating policies, reached through a toll-free ''helpline'' answered, each time, by a different stranger. 
 ''If I pick up a refugee today at the airport in Houston,'' said Bob Fleming, vice president for program services at Catholic Charities in Houston, ''there's really more certainty about what that refugee can expect from us, and will get from us, then there is for an evacuee from New Orleans.'' Mr. Fleming, whose group helps resettle 500 refugee families a year, is also a leader of the Industrial Areas Foundation, which wants to shift responsibility for evacuees from FEMA to the Department of Health and Human Services, the overseer of refugee resettlement.
 When it comes to disaster victims, FEMA's job is to provide for basic needs in the immediate aftermath of an emergency, and to give people longer-term housing, usually near their original communities, until they can return or rebuild. Its job is not to help people start over completely. It reimburses people for disaster-related medical expenses, for example, but does not provide health insurance. It provides crisis counseling, but not long-term mental health care. The agency's programs are not intended for permanent or indefinite relocation, especially not for people who are already poorer, sicker and less educated than the norm. 
 ''The message was not 'Build a new life,' the message was 'Wait for the next emergency decree,' '' said Ellen Beattie, regional director in Atlanta for the International Rescue Committee, a refugee resettlement agency that raised private money for resettlement services for evacuees. People like Ms. Beattie argue that the resettlement model is more flexible, and even more efficient, than FEMA's disaster aid system. The full costs of the FEMA system have yet to be calculated, so it cannot be compared to the cost of resettlement, which also varies widely depending on the city and the agency. But Ms. Beattie said the ''transaction costs'' of the FEMA system -- the time spent dealing with forms, phone calls and documentation -- were steep. 
 FEMA has not always been responsible for housing people after a disaster. After the California earthquake in 1994, the task was given to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which issued housing vouchers to evacuees. FEMA's latest move has been to dismantle similar voucher programs, set up by Houston and other cities, that promised evacuees 12 months of free housing and utilities. The agency explained that not all the voucher recipients were eligible for that kind of help but was unable to provide an estimate of the administrative cost of putting in place a new rental aid system for tens of thousands of families.
 The flexibility of the resettlement model appeals to Douglas Besharov, an expert on social welfare issues at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, but he cautions that such a plan should have a limited duration. ''I absolutely agree that you want a model that reflects the fact that many of these people will have a longer period of transition,'' he said, ''and hopefully it will be a transition to a better life.'' 
 In a grander sense, Mr. Besharov said, such a plan would be an improvement over traditional public assistance programs that tend to tie people to a specific place, like New Orleans, where economic and educational opportunities are not abundant. It might instead mimic poverty dispersal programs like Moving to Opportunity, first tried in Chicago, in which families were put in middle-class neighborhoods.
 ''If you think of public assistance as like a crutch, it's a crutch that poor people have that the middle class doesn't need,'' he said. ''So if you get evacuated because of a national disaster, you ought to be allowed to take your crutch with you.''
 The resettlement idea surfaced not long after Katrina, when people who work with refugees began to suggest that they might be equipped to handle the enormous tide of evacuees. But ''some decision made somewhere'' left everything in the hands of FEMA, said Mark Franken, the executive director of Migration and Refugee Services at the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. And now, he said, ''my impression is you've got some number of Katrina survivors there who have been all of these months subsidized by FEMA, but they haven't had anyone assigned to them to help them stabilize and become self-sufficient.''

HEADLINE: No Holds Barred 

 BODY:
Both sides in the labor battle at America's largest auto parts supplier, Delphi, are trying to ratchet up the pressure. Delphi's management asked a bankruptcy judge to throw out its labor agreements, which would let the company cut wages and benefits steeply. The United Automobile Workers leadership, meanwhile, has asked its 24,000 rank-and-file union members at Delphi to authorize a strike. 
 The country is used to confrontations between entrenched unions and struggling corporations in the Rust Belt, but this one is more significant than the usual fights over who will pay for health benefits and job security. The choices being forced on the Delphi workers are extreme, and the temptation for management to simply pack up and move overseas is powerful. This struggle exemplifies wrenching changes in our economy that everyone watches with concern and more than a little trepidation.
The problems at Delphi and its former corporate parent, General Motors, are not exceptional but are instead symptomatic of the challenges faced by a high-wage economy competing not only with drastically lower wages but also increasing productivity and quality overseas. These days, white-collar workers are no more immune to the offshoring of their jobs than their assembly-line counterparts. Even far from Michigan, this is everyone's problem.
 A negotiated settlement should be possible because G.M., Delphi and the U.A.W. all know that a strike would be the worst outcome, potentially crippling both of the businesses and costing workers and retirees more than the wage and benefit concessions they are being asked to accept.
 But Delphi management, led by the company's chief executive, Robert Miller, has spoken indecorously at times, antagonizing workers unnecessarily. Proud men and women, backed into a corner, may prefer to go down fighting in a strike to accepting an offer they deem humiliating, no matter what leadership tells them. Yet workers have proved themselves willing to join constructively with the auto companies when they know the businesses are in danger and the pain will be shared.
 There is still money to be made manufacturing cars and parts in America. One need look no further than the big investments Toyota and Hyundai are making here. We hope American business proves sharp enough to figure out how to do it too.

HEADLINE: Romania's Orphanages, Continued 

 BODY:
When Nicolae Ceausescu was Romania's dictator, he outlawed contraception, the better to build the nation. Thousands of unwanted children were left to die in horrific giant orphanages. Once Communism ended, Romania began to dismantle these orphanages. But many children continue to be placed in smaller but still hellish institutions. 
 According to a report released recently by Mental Disability Rights International, a group based in the United States, Romania is still warehousing disabled children. Those who are providing care, though dedicated, are overwhelmed. At an institution in Timisoara, one nurse and three other staff members were giving round-the-clock care to 65 children. The staff could only keep up with feeding the children and changing diapers. Children did not leave their cribs for years, and sometimes were tied down. They did not cry, because crying did not bring a response. Instead, they sat silently. Investigators also looked at several adult psychiatric facilities that housed children in unspeakable conditions, with teenagers confined to cribs and wearing diapers.
Incredibly, foreign donors like the United States Agency for International Development, and especially the European Union, helped build this system, providing the money for 200 small new orphanages after Communism fell. Romania should have been taking children out of institutions and placing them with adoptive or foster families, with services like special schools and therapy. Parents of disabled children should also have the services they need to be able to care for their children at home.
 Today, Romania acknowledges having 31,000 institutionalized children, and the real figure may be higher. A new law bans the placement of babies in institutions unless they are severely disabled. But children are classified as ''severely disabled'' when their problems are greater than social services can handle, even if their handicaps are minor. There are some good community programs, but they are small and limited.
 Romania's prime minister has announced the creation of a task force to evaluate institutions for disabled children. This must be only a first step; it is time for Romania to bury this relic of its Communist past once and for all.

HEADLINE: Is Now the Time for Optimism?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 David Brooks's Panglossian column ''Don't Worry, Be Happy'' (May 11) looks at the glass as being half full. Some of us see it as two-thirds empty and getting lower. 
 Mr. Brooks doesn't say that our economy is not the world economy and is not growing at 4.9 percent. He doesn't say that the United States must borrow $2 billion each day just to break even. He doesn't say that United States car manufacturers are about ready to go bankrupt, that three major airlines are already bankrupt and probably more to come.
Our economy is good for the wealthy, but the standard of living for the average American is the same as it was 30 years ago. There is no planning on how to handle our oil shortage and no light at the end of the tunnel in Iraq. I for one am not happy.

HEADLINE: Orlando on the Thames?

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

DATELINE: PRESTON 

 BODY:
THREE years after a relatively obscure developer proposed a $1.6 billion Disney-meets-Hollywood entertainment complex on the grounds of the former Norwich State Hospital here, the plan is still just a concept. 
 ''We haven't seen the economic viability, the financial viability or the specific content,'' said Robert Congdon, the town's first selectman, who sits on the advisory committee working with the New York development company, Utopia Studios.
Yet an agreement between the town and Utopia may provide a big enough safety net to persuade residents to take a leap of faith. On May 23, voters will decide whether to approve the agreement, which would authorize the town to purchase the hospital property from the state and sell it to Utopia, but under a stringent set of conditions intended to protect the town from financial risk.
 ''We're putting our money where our mouth is,'' said Joseph Gentile, Utopia's president and chief financial officer. 
 The vote could mark a critical turn for Preston, a rural town sandwiched between two casino complexes. While the town is now simply a pass-through for casino traffic, approval of the Utopia proposal could make it a destination in its own right, within sight of Mohegan Sun's towers and about seven miles from Foxwoods.
 The development agreement calls for more than 200,000 square feet of movie studio space; a year-round theme park; a nonresidential school for the performing arts; and at least 4,200 hotel rooms. The business plan submitted by the developer last year envisions Vegas-style wedding chapels, a water park with a ''Seven Seas'' theme, and four hotel towers connected by underground tunnels. 
 If completed as planned, the project would quintuple the town's tax base and, Utopia claims, bring 22,000 jobs, including construction workers, to a regional economy weakened by military contracting cutbacks and sluggish job growth. 
 Utopia was set up for this project, and its only shareholder is the actress Cathy Moriarty (''Raging Bull,'' ''Analyze That''), Mr. Gentile's wife. Neither has a background in theme park development. Mr. Gentile used to work in real estate for Fred Trump, Donald's father. 
 The project received a boost recently when the state passed a law granting production and wage tax credits against the corporation business tax for digital media and motion picture production companies working in Connecticut. 
 Though Mr. Gentile has not yet revealed detailed site plans, he has lined up a design team that includes the Jerde Partnership, a California-based architectural firm whose past projects include the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas and the Mall of America, and Bastien & Associates, a major designer of studios and sound stages. 
 As for financial backing, Utopia has a letter of interest from the investment house Bear Stearns and a letter of commitment for $87 million from Luxmac, a mortgage lender in Tarrytown, N.Y., for environmental cleanup and master planning costs. 
 Utopia had invested $3.7 million in research, design and development costs for the project as of March 31, the development agreement said. 
 The 419-acre state hospital grounds are in Preston's western corner directly off Interstate 395 on the Thames River. The location is ideal because of its proximity to the water and major highways, and its centrality in the densely populated Northeast, Mr. Gentile said. A third of the United States population is within a six-hour drive, he maintains, and two-thirds of Canada's population within a day.
 ''Fred Trump once gave me a piece of advice -- he said, 'The only thing better than dirt, Joseph, is dirt on water,' '' Mr. Gentile said. ''If he were around today, I would tell him: 'Boss, I found one better. I found dirt on water in between the two largest casinos in the world.' ''
 The state has given Preston a three-year option to purchase the state hospital land for $1 in return for assuming responsibility for environmental remediation. The estimated cost of cleaning up the hazards, which include asbestos, chlordane, an underground heating oil spill and an ash landfill, is $20 million to $40 million, Mr. Congdon said. Recent appraisals valued the property after cleanup at roughly $30 million.
 The development agreement before the voters transfers the cleanup responsibility to Utopia. It requires the company to escrow enough funds to pay for cleanup costs, as well as $13.3 million to cover four years of agreed tax payments to the town, before taking title to the site. 
 After the property conveyance, Utopia would have 18 months to complete environmental remediation. If the company failed to meet the deadline, the town could take back the property and complete the remediation using the escrowed funds. 
 Utopia may not begin construction until a master plan for the site has been approved and it has secured at least $900 million in financing. 
 The agreement impresses a former first selectman, Parke Spicer, as ''ironclad.''
 ''Joe might have thought people here were a step behind the modern world, but it's not true,'' Mr. Spicer said over coffee at his popular diner, Parke's Place. 
 While Mr. Spicer said he had not decided whether to vote for the agreement, he would like to see the state hospital grounds put to good use. The hospital's shutdown in 1996 was ''pretty devastating,'' he said. 
 Many of the Gothic-style brick buildings are crumbling, and ''people have gone in and cannibalized the interiors, taking out the marble and what have you,'' Mr. Spicer said. 
 The Rev. David Cannon, a retired Episcopal priest who is active in town affairs and a Parke's Place regular, expressed frustration with the state's failure to act on earlier proposals to consolidate community college facilities on the hospital site. 
 With some 20,000 cars a day already whizzing by his house, Mr. Cannon said he hoped to hear more details about the project's traffic impact during public presentations by the developer. ''At this point,'' he said, ''the agreement is a very good land deal for Preston. Conceptually, it's interesting.'' 
 Other residents have staked out clearer positions with lawn signs declaring themselves ''Preston Residents for Utopia,'' or, alternatively, ''Preston Residents for Preston.'' 
 Among the latter is Kelleigh Baretincic, who moved to Preston with her husband five years ago so they could raise their two children in a small-town environment. 
 ''I'm not willing to gamble our town on a man who has no previous experience in any of the elements of this project,'' Ms. Baretincic said.
 Organized labor, assured by Mr. Gentile that the project will be built by union workers, has lined up behind the pro-Utopia movement.
 Susan Sampson, a real estate agent and substitute teacher who sits on the committee Preston Residents for Utopia, called Mr. Gentile ''a good corporate citizen'' who will not only bring jobs to the community, but also ease the tax burden and clean up a polluted site. ''He's for real, you know,'' Ms. Sampson said.

HEADLINE: From Iran, With Something Less Than Love

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

 BODY:
PRESIDENT MAHMOUD AHMADINEJAD of Iran wrote a letter to President Bush last weekend -- the first formal letter from an Iranian leader to an American president since Iran's Islamic revolution of 1979. The letter has a familiar ring. In tone and structure, it is eerily reminiscent of a letter sent in January 1989 by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the father of Iran's revolution, to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the leader of a collapsing Soviet Union. 
 Certainly the historical context is different. Ayatollah Khomeini was convinced that Communism was dead and the only worthwhile system of government was one based on religious truth. He was advising the Soviet leader to study the Koran. Mr. Ahmadinejad, for his part, has set out to lecture Mr. Bush on the immorality of the war in Iraq, the confinement of prisoners at Guantanamo, the United States' support for Israel, and other aspects of American foreign policy that he doesn't like. 
And the letters differ in style. Ayatollah Khomeini, a revered clerical scholar, filled his letter with Koranic references and elaborate footnotes. Mr. Ahmadinejad, a mere layman, repeatedly invoked the name of Jesus Christ and the Old Testament prophets, alongside Koranic verses. But rather than footnotes, he filled his letter with taunts.
 Still, the letters share something basic -- a tone of pure effrontery. Both include heavy doses of lecturing and use religious knowledge with an air of moral superiority. The tone is highlighted by repeating the recipient's name again and again. 
 It's impossible to know whether Mr. Ahmadinejad's letter is an act of homage to the Iranian revolutionary leader, who died in June 1989, but it certainly is an imitation. 
 It is also an act of breathtaking audacity -- Mr. Ahmadinejad dares to cast himself as the great Islamic scholar's stand-in. And Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Ayatollah Khomeini's official successor as ''supreme leader'' of Iran, has let him do it. ELAINE SCIOLINO

 Both letters begin with an introduction and a theme, as if to say: Hello. I have something on my mind. :
Khomeini -- Your boldness and initiative in dealing with the realities of the world is quite likely to bring about changes that would result in upsetting the equations of power dominating the world. I have therefore found it necessary to bring certain matters to your attention. If you hope, at this juncture, to cut the economic Gordian knots of socialism and communism by appealing to the center of Western capitalism, you will, far from remedying any ill of your society, commit a mistake which those to come will have to erase. For, if Marxism has come to a deadlock in its social and economic policies, capitalism has also bogged down.
 Ahmadinejad -- For some time now I have been thinking, how one can justify the undeniable contradictions that exist in the international arena. Many questions remain unanswered. These have prompted me to discuss some of the contradictions and questions, in the hopes that it might bring about an opportunity to redress them. Can one be a follower of Jesus Christ (peace be upon him), the great Messenger of God, but at the same time, have countries attacked. At what price?
 I know your problem: You don't follow God's principles.
 Khomeini Mr. Gorbachev: Reality must be faced. The main problem confronting your country is not one of private ownership, freedom and economy; your problem is the absence of true faith in God.
 Ahmadinejad Mr. President: I fail to understand how such actions correspond to the values outlined in the beginning of this letter, i.e., the teachings of Jesus Christ (peace be upon him), human rights and liberal values.
 Let me give you a lesson in religion.
 Khomeini Mr. Gorbachev: I do not wish to entangle you in the twists and turns of philosophical arguments, particularly those of Islamic philosophy. I will content myself by presenting one or two simple, intuitive examples of which even politicians can avail themselves. Should Your Excellency desire further information on these matters, you may command those scholars of yours who are well versed in this field to study, in addition to the works of Western philosophers, the writings of Peripatetic philosophers, Farabi and Avicenna, peace be upon them.
 Ahmadinejad Mr. President: It is not my intention to distress anyone. If prophet Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Ishmael, Joseph or Jesus Christ (peace be upon him) were with us today, how would they have judged such behavior? Will we be given a role to play in the promised world, where justice will become universal and Jesus Christ (peace be upon him) will be present? Will they even accept us?
 All divine religions share and respect one word and that is monotheism or belief in a single God and no other in the world. The holy Koran stresses this common word. 
 Both close with a view of the future, but the thoughts are not the same. Ayatollah Khomeini seems to say: We can help you. Mr. Ahmadinejad seems to tell President Bush: Watch out. 
 Khomeini Mr. Gorbachev: Let me call on you to study Islam earnestly, not because Islam and the Muslims may need you but because Islam has exalted universal values which can bring comfort and salvation to all nations and remove the basic problems of mankind. A true understanding of Islam may forever release you from the problem of Afghanistan and other similar involvements. In conclusion, I declare outright that the Islamic Republic of Iran as the greatest and most powerful base of the Islamic world can easily fill the vacuum of religious faith in your society. In any case, our country, as in the past, honors good neighborhood and bilateral relations.
 Peace be upon those who follow the guidance. 
 Ahmadinejad Mr. President: Liberalism and Western-style democracy have not been able to help realize the ideals of humanity. Today these two concepts have failed. Those with insight can already hear the sounds of the shattering and fall of the ideology and thoughts of the liberal democratic systems. Whether we like it or not, the world is gravitating towards faith in the Almighty and justice and the will of God will prevail over all things.

HEADLINE: The Ben Stein Tax Plan

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''You're Rich? Terrific. Now Pay Up'' (Everybody's Business, May 7) in which Ben Stein said the rich should not complain about paying their share of taxes: 
I rarely find myself agreeing with Ben Stein, who usually focuses on singing the wonders of unfettered markets and on the horrors of government action. But this is precisely why his arguing that the swelling millionaire class are reaping their financial windfall at the expense of the poor -- including a generally low-income military charged with protecting and preserving the United States way of life -- is so important. 
 The problem of ridiculous inequality -- both within this generation and likely across generations due to war-fueled public debt -- is now finally becoming apparent to everyone. With hope, that will translate into a changed political landscape come November.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 When discussing Lee Raymond's $400 million retirement package, Ben Stein cavalierly dismisses the idea of Congress doing something about excessive executive pay. 
As long as management can use the shareholder's own money to defeat their proposals, boards can ignore proposals that pass, directors run unopposed and can be elected without a majority of votes, and institutions, such as mutual fund companies, that hold shares for others, can ignore their fiduciary responsibility and vote with management in order to retain lucrative contracts, the shareholders don't stand a chance. Congress needs to change the rules to address the imbalance of power between owners and managers that has resulted in runaway executive compensation.

 Ben Stein's realization that the rich should pay a larger share of society's costs is welcome news. (Better late than never, Mr. Stein.) It seems a shame that President Bush has not experienced a similar epiphany. The president and his majority seem bent on cutting taxes for the wealthy at the expense of the needy and working poor.

AS he puts the finishing touches on ''Superman Returns,'' the director Bryan Singer is thinking about bathrooms. 
 During a screening of one of the ''Lord of the Rings'' movies, Mr. Singer noticed how many kids in the audience made a mad dash for the bathrooms during bits of dialogue-heavy exposition. ''It was like a stampede,'' he said in recent phone interview. A little while later, during one of the movie's prolonged battle sequences, he noticed adults making a similar exodus. Mr. Singer predicts a similar shuffling when his ''Superman'' lands in theaters June 30.
 ''I'd like to think this movie is entirely universal,'' he said. ''But I know there will be bathroom moments for the kids and bathroom moments for adults.''
 Such is the strange dynamic faced by filmmakers during what has become the most demographically challenging part of the annual film calendar: those supposedly carefree months from early May to Labor Day. 
 At year's end sober-minded Oscar movies, the ''Capotes'' and ''Munichs,'' compete for grown-ups, while the likes of ''Chicken Little'' and ''Cheaper by the Dozen'' fight for the children. In the early months, once again, adult pictures like ''United 93'' coexist at the multiplex with youth fare like ''Hoot.'' But summer, when big studios place their heaviest bets, has become the preserve of films made for neither the old nor the young, but rather for the child in the adult and the adult in the child. That exercise is far more complex, in its way, than telling a love story about gay cowboys, or creating R-rated horror. It involves finding the peculiar spot at which couples on a date and parents who may seldom share a home-cooked meal with their children will converge, all of them, on a single experience.
 Within Hollywood, the current jargon says a summer blockbuster should play in ''all four quadrants'': that is, across the age spectrum. ''There's got to be something for everybody,'' explained Jeff Blake, vice chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, which famously managed that trick with its ''Spider-Man'' films.
 More striking, though, is the degree to which summer films like this year's ''X-Men 3'' or Mr. Singer's ''Superman Returns'' seem increasingly to define a new kind of cultural space, in which traditional notions about age mean little. 
 Such pictures appear to sit comfortably with an ascendancy of adults who act and think more like kids than conventional adults. These are the not-quite-grown-ups -- one could call them ''rejuveniles'' -- who delay marriage and parenthood, the better to maintain lives of fun and flexibility, who then bond and play with their own offspring in ways their parents would find ridiculous, and whose consumer choices have expanded the market for everything from micromini cars to gourmet cupcakes. 
 But the films work equally well with actual children who can't seem to ditch childish things fast enough. (Market researchers report that children who once identified themselves as children until the age of 12 are now advancing out of kiddie culture at 8 or 9.) 
 These groups increasingly meet, at least for two hours at a stretch, within the context of films like the 2004 summer hit ''Shrek 2,'' which worked both as a broad comedy about a flatulent ogre and a parable about the trouble relating to in-laws, or ''The Incredibles,'' which offered a midlife crisis story wrapped in a superhero adventure story. 
 ''Superheroes are now part of our adult psyches,'' said Don Payne, the screenwriter of the comedy ''My Super Ex-Girlfriend,'' a July release that attempts to marry the superhero genre with the romantic sensibility of late-70's Woody Allen. ''All of us have grown up and held onto our childhoods, even as we've twisted them into new adult contexts.''
 All of which has turned the production of summer movies into maddening demographic exercise, as filmmakers chase an audience that is in the process of redefining itself. The most successful examples -- ''Pirates of the Caribbean,'' ''Napoleon Dynamite'' or the movie that basically invented the form, ''Star Wars'' -- strike ''an exceedingly delicate balance,'' Mr. Singer said. Veer too far into potty humor or frenetic action, and you bore the adults; linger too long in character development or broad themes, and you alienate the children. 
 To play across the age divide, some filmmakers adopt the strategy perfected by the creators of the classic Warner Brothers cartoons, packing their pictures with in-jokes and asides they know will hit home with grown-ups even if they mystify kids. ''The 60's weren't good to you were they?'' an Army jeep asks a spaced-out Volkswagen in a preview for Pixar's ''Cars.''
 Others, however, reject that approach, like the director M. Night Shyamalan, who calls it ''bifurcation.'' Instead of tossing out lines that appeal to either one group or another, he seeks to inject deeply adult themes into stories that otherwise seem of interest only to children. Thus Mr. Shyamalan's ''Lady in the Water,'' set for release on July 21, and billed as ''a bedtime story,'' is being positioned as a sort of romper-room version of the dark, supernatural thrillers he is famous for.
 And while the movie is intended for children -- it grew out of stories Mr. Shyamalan told his own kids -- it's far deeper and more surreal than most such entertainment, he said. He admitted to worrying during production that it might be ''too whacked or scary,'' but said he decided to follow the example of children's authors like J. M. Barrie and Roald Dahl, whose greatest works willfully ran afoul of rules of propriety and age appropriateness.
 ''To me it was all about getting back to pure rebellion and free-spiritedness of childhood,'' the 35-year-old Mr. Shyamalan said, in true ''rejuvenile'' fashion. ''That's been incredibly freeing. Since I did this, I'm a completely different person.''
 In a similar vein ''The Ant Bully,'' set for release by Warner Brothers in early August, features a cast of insects voiced by Julia Roberts, Nicolas Cage and Meryl Streep in what the film's writer and director, John A. Davis, said could be read as a parable about world affairs and the use and abuse of power. ''I wanted this movie to echo our times,'' he said. ''It's good to push certain moral buttons, and if you can do that in an exciting story with great visuals, so much the better.''
 However thrilling their creative possibilities, though, at root such hybrids owe their prevalence to industry economics. Studio executives are well aware that the difference between a successful children's movie and a successful children's movie that adults also enjoy is the difference between a hit and a bonafide blockbuster. 
 Movies like the first ''Spider-Man'' may have appealed to kids primarily, but according to Sony exit polls, 52 percent of the audience was over 25. More generally, the highest grossing films of the modern era -- ''Star Wars,'' ''Shrek 2,'' ''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' -- is largely a catalog of kid-adult hybrids, notwithstanding the occasional success of a ''Titanic'' or ''ThePassion of the Christ'' (or the decision by Sony Pictures this year to buck the trend by releasing ''The Da Vinci Code'' as a summer film).
 ''That's what everyone is really aiming for,'' said Bonnie Arnold, producer of the new DreamWorks feature ''Over the Hedge,'' which mixes talking-animal high jinks with commentary on the politics of homeowner associations, the challenges of big-box shopping and lawn care. ''These movies have got to please their core kid audience, but they're really successful when they branch out beyond kids.''
 Even if the result is a weird kind of Peter Pan movie that never lets its audience entirely grow up and never lets children be entirely young, more than a few parents prize the new hybrid film as a chance to connect with their children. The parents of the mid-20th century might have been content to let their kids enjoy Hopalong Cassidy or Howdy Doody on their own, but today's parents expect to join the fun. ''There's nothing greater than being in the same theater as your kid and laughing at the same jokes,'' said Julia Pistor, mother of three and executive vice president of Nickelodeon Movies, which is releasing the Jack Black comedy ''Nacho Libre.''
 But parents with higher expectations aren't the only adults driving the change; Mr. Blake said that about 25 percent of the audience for any hit family movie is now made up of adults unaccompanied by children. The producer Suzanne Todd recalls scanning the audience at a showing of the recent Disney remake of ''The Shaggy Dog'' and noticing how many were adults with nary a child in sight. ''I can understand why,'' Ms. Todd said, especially in a ''cynical age where we've lost our moral ballast. Adults need entertainment that's fun, easy and offers 90 minutes off from real life.'' 
 For his part Barry Sonnenfeld, director of the family-friendly road movie ''RV,'' said the growing adult audience had shaken up previously stale genres, allowing for more complex characters and potentially objectionable material. ''It allows you to make movies that aren't so down the middle,'' he said. The father portrayed by Robin Williams in ''RV,'' for instance, is far more needy and self-involved than the typical Disney dad, while the movie's central set piece involves an explosive, 100-foot spout of fecal matter. (''And we still got our PG,'' Mr. Sonnenfeld said.) 
 Still, filmmakers agonize endlessly over the precise combination of kid and adult elements. Producers of ''Over the Hedge'' worried, for instance, about a character called Hammy, a hyperactive squirrel who, it was thought, might strike some adults as a too-vivid characterization of a toddler on a sugar rush. In screenings, however, the filmmakers were relieved to discover that Hammy tested well across the age spectrum. Ms. Hunt said, ''You have to ask yourself: 'Is this playing too young? Are we getting too sophisticated or clever for our own good?' ''
 Mr. Payne said he learned how to strike the right balance while writing for ''The Simpsons,'' the Fox series that has become a model mixture of broad-appeal comedy and transgressive adult humor. The trick, he said, is to bounce back quickly the moment you go to far in one direction. ''When you find yourself on a run about socialism,'' he said, ''you know that pretty quick you've got to light Homer's pants on fire.'' 
 Such divisions are increasingly irrelevant, however, since it's easier than ever to please younger and older moviegoers with exactly the same material, now that children are now more sophisticated and adults more childlike (and childish). It's now possible, Mr. Sonnenfeld said, to stay fixed on a sort of psychic middle ground. 
 ''You can now make a movie for 20-year-olds, and teenagers will come because it makes them feel older, and adults will come because it makes them feel younger,'' Mr. Sonnenfeld said. ''If you do it right, you catch everyone coming and going.''

HEADLINE: The Deciders

BYLINE: By John H. Summers. 
John H. Summers teaches intellectual history at Harvard. He is currently writing a biography of C. Wright Mills.

 BODY:
''The powers of ordinary men are circumscribed by the everyday worlds in which they live, yet even in these rounds of job, family and neighborhood they often seem driven by forces they can neither understand nor govern.''
The opening sentence of ''The Power Elite,'' by C. Wright Mills, seems unremarkable, even bland. But when the book was first published 50 years ago last month, it exploded into a culture riddled with existential anxiety and political fear. Mills -- a broad-shouldered, motorcycle-riding anarchist from Texas who taught sociology at Columbia -- argued that the ''sociological key'' to American uneasiness could be found not in the mysteries of the unconscious or in the battle against Communism, but in the over-organization of society. At the pinnacle of the government, the military and the corporations, a small group of men made the decisions that reverberated ''into each and every cranny'' of American life. ''Insofar as national events are decided,'' Mills wrote, ''the power elite are those who decide them.'' 
 His argument met with criticism from all sides. ''I look forward to the time when Mr. Mills hands back his prophet's robes and settles down to being a sociologist again,'' Arthur Schlesinger Jr. wrote in The New York Post. Adolf Berle, writing in the Book Review, said that while the book contained ''an uncomfortable degree of truth,'' Mills presented ''an angry cartoon, not a serious picture.'' Liberals could not believe a book about power in America said so little about the Supreme Court, while conservatives attacked it as leftist psychopathology (''sociological mumbo jumbo,'' Time said). The Soviets translated it in 1959, but decided it was pro-American. ''Although Mills expresses a skeptical and critical attitude toward bourgeois liberalism and its society of power,'' said the introduction to the Russian translation, ''his hopes and sympathies undoubtedly remain on its side.''
 Even so, ''The Power Elite'' found an eclectic audience at home and abroad. Fidel Castro and Che Guevara debated the book in the mountains of the Sierra Maestra. Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir published excerpts in their radical journal, Les Temps Modernes. In the United States, Mills received hundreds of letters from Protestant clergymen, professors and students, pacificists and soldiers. This note came from an Army private stationed in San Francisco: ''I genuinely appreciate reading in print ideas I have thought about some time ago. At that time, they seemed to me so different that I didn't tell anyone.'' In the aftermath of the global riots of 1968, the C.I.A. identified Mills as one of the most influential New Left intellectuals in the world, though he had been dead for six years.
 The historical value of ''The Power Elite'' seems assured. It was the first book to offer a serious model of power that accounted for the secretive agencies of national security. Mills saw the postideological ''postmodern epoch'' (as he would later call it) at its inception, and his book remains a founding text in the continuing demand for democratically responsible political leadership -- a demand echoed and amplified across the decades in books like Christopher Lasch's ''Revolt of the Elites'' (1995), Kevin Phillips's ''Wealth and Democracy'' (2002), Chalmers Johnson's ''Sorrows of Empire'' (2004) and Thomas Frank's ''What's the Matter With Kansas?'' (2004).
 Much of ''The Power Elite'' was a tough-talking polemic against the ''romantic pluralism'' embedded in the prevailing theory of American politics. The separation of powers in the Constitution, the story went, repelled the natural tendency of power to concentrate, while political parties and voluntary societies organized the clash of interests, laying the people's representatives open to the influence of public opinion. This ''theory of balance'' still applied to the ''middle levels of power,'' Mills wrote. But the society it envisioned had been eclipsed. 
 For the first time in history, he argued, the territories of the United States made up a self-conscious mass society. If the economy had once been a multitude of locally or regionally rooted, (more or less) equal units of production, it now answered to the needs of a few hundred corporations. If the government had once been a patchwork of states held together by Congress, it now answered to the initiatives of a strong executive. If the military had once been a militia system resistant to the discipline of permanent training, it now consumed half the national budget, and seated its admirals and generals in the biggest office building in the world. 
 The ''awesome means of power'' enthroned upon these monopolies of production, administration and violence included the power to prevent issues and ideas from reaching Congress in the first place. Most Americans still believed the ebb and flow of public opinion guided political affairs. ''But now we must recognize this description as a set of images out of a fairy tale,'' Mills wrote. ''They are not adequate even as an approximate model of how the American system of power works.'' 
 The small groups of men standing at the head of the three monopolies represented a new kind of elite, whose character and conduct mirrored the antidemocratic ethos of their institutions. The corporations recruited from the business schools, and conceived executive training programs that demanded strict conformity. The military selected generals and admirals from the service academies, and inculcated ''the caste feeling'' by segregating them from the associational life of the country. Less and less did local apprenticeships serve as a passport to the government's executive chambers. Of the appointees in the Eisenhower administration, Mills found that a record number had never stood for election at any level.
 Above the apparent balance of powers, Mills said, ''an intricate set of overlapping cliques'' shared in ''decisions having at least national consequences.'' Rather than operating in secret, the same kinds of men -- who traded opinions in the same churches, clubs and schools -- took turns in the same jobs. Mills pointed to the personnel traffic among the Pentagon, the White House and the corporations. The nation's three top policy positions -- secretary of state, treasury and defense -- were occupied by former corporate executives. The president was a general. 
 Mills could not answer many of the most important questions he raised. How did the power elite make its decisions? He did not know. Did its members cause their roles to be created, or step into roles already created? He could not say. Around what interests did they cohere? He asserted a ''coincidence of interest'' partially organized around ''a permanent war establishment,'' but he did little more than assert it. Most of the time, he said, the power elite did not cohere at all. ''This instituted elite is frequently in some tension: it comes together only on certain coinciding points and only on certain occasions of 'crisis.' '' Although he urged his readers to scrutinize the commanding power of decision, his book did not scrutinize any decisions.
 These ambiguities have kept ''The Power Elite'' vulnerable to the charge of conspiracy-mongering. In a recent essay in Playboy called ''Who Rules America?'' Arthur Schlesinger Jr. repeated his earlier skepticism about Mills's argument, calling it ''a sophisticated version of the American nightmare.'' Alan Wolfe, in a 2000 afterword, pointed out that while Mills got much about the self-enriching ways of the corporate elite right, his vision of complacent American capitalism did not anticipate the competitive dynamics of our global economy. And of late we have seen that ''occasions of crisis'' do not necessarily serve to unify the generals with the politicians.
 Yet ''The Power Elite'' abounds with questions that still trouble us today. Can a strong democracy coexist with the amoral ethos of corporate elites? And can public argument have democratic meaning in the age of national security? The trend in foreign affairs, Mills argued, was for a militarized executive branch to bypass the United Nations, while Congress was left with little more than the power to express ''general confidence, or the lack of it.'' Policy tended to be announced as doctrine, which was then sold to the public via the media. Career diplomats in the State Department believed they could not truthfully report intelligence. Meanwhile official secrecy steadily expanded its reach. ''For the first time in American history, men in authority are talking about an 'emergency' without a foreseeable end,'' Mills wrote in a sentence that remains as powerful and unsettling as it was 50 years ago. ''Such men as these are crackpot realists: in the name of realism they have constructed a paranoid reality all their own.''

HEADLINE: Stocks Slide, Ending Dow's Five-Week Advance 

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The broad stock market declined last week, pulling the Dow Jones industrial average down after five consecutive weeks of advances. 
 Worries that rising commodity prices might be setting off inflation throughout the economy weighed on the stock market.
The Labor Department said Friday that prices of imported goods rose 2.1 percent in April, compared with a decline of 0.2 percent in March. And a monthly University of Michigan survey found that consumer confidence in May decreased sharply. 
 On Tuesday, Federal Reserve policy makers raised short-term interest rates by another quarter percent, to 5 percent, and said further increases might be in store. 
 General Motors rose more than 12 percent for the week, the best performance among the Dow industrials.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 196.75 points, or 1.7 percent, to close at 11,380.99. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 34.52 points, or 2.6 percent, to close at 1,291.24. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 98.79 points, or 4.2 percent, to close at 2,243.78.
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 5.19 percent from 5.10 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: Can TV's and PC's Live Together Happily Ever After?

BYLINE: By RICHARD SIKLOS

 BODY:
HOLY Grails, swirling myths and big lies seem to be in the air these days -- and we're not just talking about a certain heavily publicized movie opening this week that is based on a certain megaselling novel. Rather, consider the much-ballyhooed convergence between television and personal computers (a k a the grail), which seems to edge ever closer with every week.
 Slowly but surely, it seems that TV programs and movies are finding their way onto the Internet through a growing array of distribution outlets.
 Just in the last few weeks, for example, Warner Brothers announced it would make hundreds of its hit films and shows available this summer for paid download via the file-sharing site BitTorrent; Fox Entertainment has joined the other major networks on iTunes with downloadable episodes of ''24'' and ''Prison Break''; TiVo announced a deal with the Web video outfit Brightcove that intends to give people with TiVo boxes access to Internet fare on their TV sets; and ABC and CBS have begun streaming replays of some of their most popular shows on their Web sites, offering a new advertising-supported way to tune in. 
 Even though no one seems to be making much money yet on these ventures and there are still chewy legal and rights issues to sort out, there is palpable excitement -- a sense that the TV and movie industries are going to head off the pirates and file-sharing teens by making their products widely available online in legal ways.
 In doing so, it seems the ultimate no-brainer that anyone with a fancy TV monitor and a broadband Internet connection will next be able to pluck their favorite TV programs and movies off the Web (and eventually choose to disconnect their cable or satellite provider, or, as I've written previously, at least force the cable operators to offer smaller and more appealing packages of channels).
 Now, this is the kind of convergence that people could really get behind -- it makes a whole lot more sense than some of the ''benefits'' promised earlier, like surfing Web sites on a 60-inch plasma screen or answering e-mail messages while sitting in the La-Z-Boy. All the elements are falling into place: sales of high-definition TV's that can also be used as computer monitors are soaring -- they are already in 19 percent of American homes -- and, according to the Consumer Electronics Association, sales of digital sets will surpass the sale of analog sets this year for the first time. Meanwhile, more than 40 percent of households in the United States have signed up for high-speed connections, and the number continues to rise.
 The consumer electronics industry and technology giants like Microsoft and Intel are working double-time to concoct the next generation of gadgets that will bridge the gap between computers and televisions. Some companies, among them Apple, Hewlett-Packard and Cisco Systems, already have products that make watching Web video on TV possible, though they are cumbersome to use. 
 Sharp announced last month that it would soon introduce an LCD-screen TV for the Japanese market that will let viewers watch high-definition television, use the remote control to surf the Internet, and store data and TV programs on a built-in hard drive. (One studio executive said he expected these machines would be the rage by this time next year, and that Apple is believed to have the most promising version in development.)
 But here is the swirling myth -- or is it The Big Lie? -- about convergence: It's not as close as all of that activity suggests. For various reasons, watching TV programs delivered by the Internet on regular TV looks like it will remain tantalizingly out of reach for all but the most enthusiastic gadget junkies for some time.
 The point of all these new video-content deals being struck by networks and studios is, of course, to avoid making the mistakes of the music industry, which focused too much on rear-guard actions like lawsuits and not enough on figuring out new ways to give the fans what they wanted.
 The music analogy only goes so far, however. The way music is promoted and sold and listened to bears scant resemblance to TV and video products. Ventures like the one announced by Warner and the big networks are not really an alternative way of receiving conventional TV, but rather an alternative to buying or renting DVD's coupled with an intriguing new market opportunity to reach viewers on their desktop or mobile devices.
 David G. Sanderson, who heads the media consulting practice at Bain & Company, offers four reasons most people won't be downloading their favorite shows onto their TV's any time soon: limitations in broadband infrastructure, the degree of readiness among electronics makers to provide a product with mass appeal, the behavior of consumers and the agenda of the players in the TV ecosystem.
 ''If you started from scratch, you'd do it differently,'' Mr. Sanderson said of the fitful process of making television shows available on the Internet. ''But we have an entrenched structure in how programming is brought to consumers.''
 Mr. Sanderson's first two points -- basically whether the Internet-based network and devices are ready for prime-time -- are where most of the action is and where things could change if businesses keep investing and innovating. Still, for now, there are logjams associated with delivering large quantities of video over the Web and the unresolved ''net neutrality'' debate over whether heavy users should pay more to telecommunications carriers for the large amount of bandwidth they use.
 His second two points -- about consumer behavior and the entrenched players -- are actually more complex. The consumer question boils down to whether enough people want to give up access to the dozens or hundreds of channels they pay for through their cable providers to buy programs over the Internet. And that is closely related to his point about the industry structure, which is a function of the willingness of cable networks to risk giving up their guaranteed monthly subscription fees in favor of a free-wheeling Internet alternative.
 ''The reality is that I don't think you're going to see the current cable offering -- hundreds of linear channels -- replicated on the Internet,'' Glenn A. Britt, the chief executive of Time Warner Cable, told me recently. ''One reason is the Internet isn't physically capable of handling that volume, but obviously, with a lot of money and time, that can be alleviated. But the second thing is that we actually provide a very important economic function in the TV distribution chain.''
 CABLE networks are not about to jeopardize the millions they receive from guaranteed subscription fees each month -- and it is probably no coincidence that the versions of TV programs sold through iTunes or Google Video are inferior in picture quality to what is offered by cable companies (while the growing popularity of high-definition TV shows that viewers want higher quality). Even Sharp's new Japanese TV, the Internet Aquos, only accesses online video material from a closed-circuit service, and displays it at inferior quality.
 Mr. Britt said his industry was not ignoring the enormous amount of effort being poured into providing alternative ways to get video material delivered to the TV set. But, as he put it, ''it's very complicated to set up unless you have a 13-year-old son.''
 Those seeking true convergence may have to keep the faith for a while yet. On the other hand, those seeking grails don't tend to give up easily.

 BODY:
In several dozen nondescript office buildings around the world, thousands of hourly workers bend over table-top scanners and haul dusty books into high-tech scanning booths. They are assembling the universal library page by page.
The dream is an old one: to have in one place all knowledge, past and present. All books, all documents, all conceptual works, in all languages. It is a familiar hope, in part because long ago we briefly built such a library. The great library at Alexandria, constructed around 300 B.C., was designed to hold all the scrolls circulating in the known world. At one time or another, the library held about half a million scrolls, estimated to have been between 30 and 70 percent of all books in existence then. But even before this great library was lost, the moment when all knowledge could be housed in a single building had passed. Since then, the constant expansion of information has overwhelmed our capacity to contain it. For 2,000 years, the universal library, together with other perennial longings like invisibility cloaks, antigravity shoes and paperless offices, has been a mythical dream that kept receding further into the infinite future. 
 Until now. When Google announced in December 2004 that it would digitally scan the books of five major research libraries to make their contents searchable, the promise of a universal library was resurrected. Indeed, the explosive rise of the Web, going from nothing to everything in one decade, has encouraged us to believe in the impossible again. Might the long-heralded great library of all knowledge really be within our grasp?
 Brewster Kahle, an archivist overseeing another scanning project, says that the universal library is now within reach. ''This is our chance to one-up the Greeks!'' he shouts. ''It is really possible with the technology of today, not tomorrow. We can provide all the works of humankind to all the people of the world. It will be an achievement remembered for all time, like putting a man on the moon.'' And unlike the libraries of old, which were restricted to the elite, this library would be truly democratic, offering every book to every person.
 But the technology that will bring us a planetary source of all written material will also, in the same gesture, transform the nature of what we now call the book and the libraries that hold them. The universal library and its ''books'' will be unlike any library or books we have known. Pushing us rapidly toward that Eden of everything, and away from the paradigm of the physical paper tome, is the hot technology of the search engine. 

1. Scanning the Library of Libraries
 Scanning technology has been around for decades, but digitized books didn't make much sense until recently, when search engines like Google, Yahoo, Ask and MSN came along. When millions of books have been scanned and their texts are made available in a single database, search technology will enable us to grab and read any book ever written. Ideally, in such a complete library we should also be able to read any article ever written in any newspaper, magazine or journal. And why stop there? The universal library should include a copy of every painting, photograph, film and piece of music produced by all artists, present and past. Still more, it should include all radio and television broadcasts. Commercials too. And how can we forget the Web? The grand library naturally needs a copy of the billions of dead Web pages no longer online and the tens of millions of blog posts now gone -- the ephemeral literature of our time. In short, the entire works of humankind, from the beginning of recorded history, in all languages, available to all people, all the time. 
 This is a very big library. But because of digital technology, you'll be able to reach inside it from almost any device that sports a screen. From the days of Sumerian clay tablets till now, humans have ''published'' at least 32 million books, 750 million articles and essays, 25 million songs, 500 million images, 500,000 movies, 3 million videos, TV shows and short films and 100 billion public Web pages. All this material is currently contained in all the libraries and archives of the world. When fully digitized, the whole lot could be compressed (at current technological rates) onto 50 petabyte hard disks. Today you need a building about the size of a small-town library to house 50 petabytes. With tomorrow's technology, it will all fit onto your iPod. When that happens, the library of all libraries will ride in your purse or wallet -- if it doesn't plug directly into your brain with thin white cords. Some people alive today are surely hoping that they die before such things happen, and others, mostly the young, want to know what's taking so long. (Could we get it up and running by next week? They have a history project due.)
 Technology accelerates the migration of all we know into the universal form of digital bits. Nikon will soon quit making film cameras for consumers, and Minolta already has: better think digital photos from now on. Nearly 100 percent of all contemporary recorded music has already been digitized, much of it by fans. About one-tenth of the 500,000 or so movies listed on the Internet Movie Database are now digitized on DVD. But because of copyright issues and the physical fact of the need to turn pages, the digitization of books has proceeded at a relative crawl. At most, one book in 20 has moved from analog to digital. So far, the universal library is a library without many books.
 But that is changing very fast. Corporations and libraries around the world are now scanning about a million books per year. Amazon has digitized several hundred thousand contemporary books. In the heart of Silicon Valley, Stanford University (one of the five libraries collaborating with Google) is scanning its eight-million-book collection using a state-of-the art robot from the Swiss company 4DigitalBooks. This machine, the size of a small S.U.V., automatically turns the pages of each book as it scans it, at the rate of 1,000 pages per hour. A human operator places a book in a flat carriage, and then pneumatic robot fingers flip the pages -- delicately enough to handle rare volumes -- under the scanning eyes of digital cameras. 
 Like many other functions in our global economy, however, the real work has been happening far away, while we sleep. We are outsourcing the scanning of the universal library. Superstar, an entrepreneurial company based in Beijing, has scanned every book from 900 university libraries in China. It has already digitized 1.3 million unique titles in Chinese, which it estimates is about half of all the books published in the Chinese language since 1949. It costs $30 to scan a book at Stanford but only $10 in China.
 Raj Reddy, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University, decided to move a fair-size English-language library to where the cheap subsidized scanners were. In 2004, he borrowed 30,000 volumes from the storage rooms of the Carnegie Mellon library and the Carnegie Library and packed them off to China in a single shipping container to be scanned by an assembly line of workers paid by the Chinese. His project, which he calls the Million Book Project, is churning out 100,000 pages per day at 20 scanning stations in India and China. Reddy hopes to reach a million digitized books in two years.
 The idea is to seed the bookless developing world with easily available texts. Superstar sells copies of books it scans back to the same university libraries it scans from. A university can expand a typical 60,000-volume library into a 1.3 million-volume one overnight. At about 50 cents per digital book acquired, it's a cheap way for a library to increase its collection. Bill McCoy, the general manager of Adobe's e-publishing business, says: ''Some of us have thousands of books at home, can walk to wonderful big-box bookstores and well-stocked libraries and can get Amazon.com to deliver next day. The most dramatic effect of digital libraries will be not on us, the well-booked, but on the billions of people worldwide who are underserved by ordinary paper books.'' It is these underbooked -- students in Mali, scientists in Kazakhstan, elderly people in Peru -- whose lives will be transformed when even the simplest unadorned version of the universal library is placed in their hands.

2. What Happens When Books Connect
 The least important, but most discussed, aspects of digital reading have been these contentious questions: Will we give up the highly evolved technology of ink on paper and instead read on cumbersome machines? Or will we keep reading our paperbacks on the beach? For now, the answer is yes to both. Yes, publishers have lost millions of dollars on the long-prophesied e-book revolution that never occurred, while the number of physical books sold in the world each year continues to grow. At the same time, there are already more than a half a billion PDF documents on the Web that people happily read on computers without printing them out, and still more people now spend hours watching movies on microscopic cellphone screens. The arsenal of our current display technology -- from handheld gizmos to large flat screens -- is already good enough to move books to their next stage of evolution: a full digital scan.
 Yet the common vision of the library's future (even the e-book future) assumes that books will remain isolated items, independent from one another, just as they are on shelves in your public library. There, each book is pretty much unaware of the ones next to it. When an author completes a work, it is fixed and finished. Its only movement comes when a reader picks it up to animate it with his or her imagination. In this vision, the main advantage of the coming digital library is portability -- the nifty translation of a book's full text into bits, which permits it to be read on a screen anywhere. But this vision misses the chief revolution birthed by scanning books: in the universal library, no book will be an island.
 Turning inked letters into electronic dots that can be read on a screen is simply the first essential step in creating this new library. The real magic will come in the second act, as each word in each book is cross-linked, clustered, cited, extracted, indexed, analyzed, annotated, remixed, reassembled and woven deeper into the culture than ever before. In the new world of books, every bit informs another; every page reads all the other pages.
 In recent years, hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic amateurs have written and cross-referenced an entire online encyclopedia called Wikipedia. Buoyed by this success, many nerds believe that a billion readers can reliably weave together the pages of old books, one hyperlink at a time. Those with a passion for a special subject, obscure author or favorite book will, over time, link up its important parts. Multiply that simple generous act by millions of readers, and the universal library can be integrated in full, by fans for fans. 
 In addition to a link, which explicitly connects one word or sentence or book to another, readers will also be able to add tags, a recent innovation on the Web but already a popular one. A tag is a public annotation, like a keyword or category name, that is hung on a file, page, picture or song, enabling anyone to search for that file. For instance, on the photo-sharing site Flickr, hundreds of viewers will ''tag'' a photo submitted by another user with their own simple classifications of what they think the picture is about: ''goat,'' ''Paris,'' ''goofy,'' ''beach party.'' Because tags are user-generated, when they move to the realm of books, they will be assigned faster, range wider and serve better than out-of-date schemes like the Dewey Decimal System, particularly in frontier or fringe areas like nanotechnology or body modification.
 The link and the tag may be two of the most important inventions of the last 50 years. They get their initial wave of power when we first code them into bits of text, but their real transformative energies fire up as ordinary users click on them in the course of everyday Web surfing, unaware that each humdrum click ''votes'' on a link, elevating its rank of relevance. You may think you are just browsing, casually inspecting this paragraph or that page, but in fact you are anonymously marking up the Web with bread crumbs of attention. These bits of interest are gathered and analyzed by search engines in order to strengthen the relationship between the end points of every link and the connections suggested by each tag. This is a type of intelligence common on the Web, but previously foreign to the world of books.
 Once a book has been integrated into the new expanded library by means of this linking, its text will no longer be separate from the text in other books. For instance, today a serious nonfiction book will usually have a bibliography and some kind of footnotes. When books are deeply linked, you'll be able to click on the title in any bibliography or any footnote and find the actual book referred to in the footnote. The books referenced in that book's bibliography will themselves be available, and so you can hop through the library in the same way we hop through Web links, traveling from footnote to footnote to footnote until you reach the bottom of things. 
 Next come the words. Just as a Web article on, say, aquariums, can have some of its words linked to definitions of fish terms, any and all words in a digitized book can be hyperlinked to other parts of other books. Books, including fiction, will become a web of names and a community of ideas.
 Search engines are transforming our culture because they harness the power of relationships, which is all links really are. There are about 100 billion Web pages, and each page holds, on average, 10 links. That's a trillion electrified connections coursing through the Web. This tangle of relationships is precisely what gives the Web its immense force. The static world of book knowledge is about to be transformed by the same elevation of relationships, as each page in a book discovers other pages and other books. Once text is digital, books seep out of their bindings and weave themselves together. The collective intelligence of a library allows us to see things we can't see in a single, isolated book. 
 When books are digitized, reading becomes a community activity. Bookmarks can be shared with fellow readers. Marginalia can be broadcast. Bibliographies swapped. You might get an alert that your friend Carl has annotated a favorite book of yours. A moment later, his links are yours. In a curious way, the universal library becomes one very, very, very large single text: the world's only book.

3. Books: The Liquid Version
 At the same time, once digitized, books can be unraveled into single pages or be reduced further, into snippets of a page. These snippets will be remixed into reordered books and virtual bookshelves. Just as the music audience now juggles and reorders songs into new albums (or ''playlists,'' as they are called in iTunes), the universal library will encourage the creation of virtual ''bookshelves'' -- a collection of texts, some as short as a paragraph, others as long as entire books, that form a library shelf's worth of specialized information. And as with music playlists, once created, these ''bookshelves'' will be published and swapped in the public commons. Indeed, some authors will begin to write books to be read as snippets or to be remixed as pages. The ability to purchase, read and manipulate individual pages or sections is surely what will drive reference books (cookbooks, how-to manuals, travel guides) in the future. You might concoct your own ''cookbook shelf'' of Cajun recipes compiled from many different sources; it would include Web pages, magazine clippings and entire Cajun cookbooks. Amazon currently offers you a chance to publish your own bookshelves (Amazon calls them ''listmanias'') as annotated lists of books you want to recommend on a particular esoteric subject. And readers are already using Google Book Search to round up minilibraries on a certain topic -- all books about Sweden, for instance, or books on clocks. Once snippets, articles and pages of books become ubiquitous, shuffle-able and transferable, users will earn prestige and perhaps income for curating an excellent collection.
 Libraries (as well as many individuals) aren't eager to relinquish ink-on-paper editions, because the printed book is by far the most durable and reliable backup technology we have. Printed books require no mediating device to read and thus are immune to technological obsolescence. Paper is also extremely stable, compared with, say, hard drives or even CD's. In this way, the stability and fixity of a bound book is a blessing. It sits there unchanging, true to its original creation. But it sits alone.
 So what happens when all the books in the world become a single liquid fabric of interconnected words and ideas? Four things: First, works on the margins of popularity will find a small audience larger than the near-zero audience they usually have now. Far out in the ''long tail'' of the distribution curve -- that extended place of low-to-no sales where most of the books in the world live -- digital interlinking will lift the readership of almost any title, no matter how esoteric. Second, the universal library will deepen our grasp of history, as every original document in the course of civilization is scanned and cross-linked. Third, the universal library of all books will cultivate a new sense of authority. If you can truly incorporate all texts -- past and present, multilingual -- on a particular subject, then you can have a clearer sense of what we as a civilization, a species, do know and don't know. The white spaces of our collective ignorance are highlighted, while the golden peaks of our knowledge are drawn with completeness. This degree of authority is only rarely achieved in scholarship today, but it will become routine. 
 Finally, the full, complete universal library of all works becomes more than just a better Ask Jeeves. Search on the Web becomes a new infrastructure for entirely new functions and services. Right now, if you mash up Google Maps and Monster.com, you get maps of where jobs are located by salary. In the same way, it is easy to see that in the great library, everything that has ever been written about, for example, Trafalgar Square in London could be present on that spot via a screen. In the same way, every object, event or location on earth would ''know'' everything that has ever been written about it in any book, in any language, at any time. From this deep structuring of knowledge comes a new culture of interaction and participation.
 The main drawback of this vision is a big one. So far, the universal library lacks books. Despite the best efforts of bloggers and the creators of the Wikipedia, most of the world's expertise still resides in books. And a universal library without the contents of books is no universal library at all. 
 There are dozens of excellent reasons that books should quickly be made part of the emerging Web. But so far they have not been, at least not in great numbers. And there is only one reason: the hegemony of the copy.

4. The Triumph of the Copy
 The desire of all creators is for their works to find their way into all minds. A text, a melody, a picture or a story succeeds best if it is connected to as many ideas and other works as possible. Ideally, over time a work becomes so entangled in a culture that it appears to be inseparable from it, in the way that the Bible, Shakespeare's plays, ''Cinderella'' and the Mona Lisa are inseparable from ours. This tendency for creative ideas to infiltrate other works is great news for culture. In fact, this commingling of creations is culture. 
 In preindustrial times, exact copies of a work were rare for a simple reason: it was much easier to make your own version of a creation than to duplicate someone else's exactly. The amount of energy and attention needed to copy a scroll exactly, word for word, or to replicate a painting stroke by stroke exceeded the cost of paraphrasing it in your own style. So most works were altered, and often improved, by the borrower before they were passed on. Fairy tales evolved mythic depth as many different authors worked on them and as they migrated from spoken tales to other media (theater, music, painting). This system worked well for audiences and performers, but the only way for most creators to earn a living from their works was through the support of patrons. 
 That ancient economics of creation was overturned at the dawn of the industrial age by the technologies of mass production. Suddenly, the cost of duplication was lower than the cost of appropriation. With the advent of the printing press, it was now cheaper to print thousands of exact copies of a manuscript than to alter one by hand. Copy makers could profit more than creators. This imbalance led to the technology of copyright, which established a new order. Copyright bestowed upon the creator of a work a temporary monopoly -- for 14 years, in the United States -- over any copies of the work. The idea was to encourage authors and artists to create yet more works that could be cheaply copied and thus fill the culture with public works. 
 Not coincidentally, public libraries first began to flourish with the advent of cheap copies. Before the industrial age, libraries were primarily the property of the wealthy elite. With mass production, every small town could afford to put duplicates of the greatest works of humanity on wooden shelves in the village square. Mass access to public-library books inspired scholarship, reviewing and education, activities exempted in part from the monopoly of copyright in the United States because they moved creative works toward the public commons sooner, weaving them into the fabric of common culture while still remaining under the author's copyright. These are now known as ''fair uses.''
 This wonderful balance was undone by good intentions. The first was a new copyright law passed by Congress in 1976. According to the new law, creators no longer had to register or renew copyright; the simple act of creating something bestowed it with instant and automatic rights. By default, each new work was born under private ownership rather than in the public commons. At first, this reversal seemed to serve the culture of creation well. All works that could be copied gained instant and deep ownership, and artists and authors were happy. But the 1976 law, and various revisions and extensions that followed it, made it extremely difficult to move a work into the public commons, where human creations naturally belong and were originally intended to reside. As more intellectual property became owned by corporations rather than by individuals, those corporations successfully lobbied Congress to keep extending the once-brief protection enabled by copyright in order to prevent works from returning to the public domain. With constant nudging, Congress moved the expiration date from 14 years to 28 to 42 and then to 56. 
 While corporations and legislators were moving the goal posts back, technology was accelerating forward. In Internet time, even 14 years is a long time for a monopoly; a monopoly that lasts a human lifetime is essentially an eternity. So when Congress voted in 1998 to extend copyright an additional 70 years beyond the life span of a creator -- to a point where it could not possibly serve its original purpose as an incentive to keep that creator working -- it was obvious to all that copyright now existed primarily to protect a threatened business model. And because Congress at the same time tacked a 20-year extension onto all existing copyrights, nothing -- no published creative works of any type -- will fall out of protection and return to the public domain until 2019. Almost everything created today will not return to the commons until the next century. Thus the stream of shared material that anyone can improve (think ''A Thousand and One Nights'' or ''Amazing Grace'' or ''Beauty and the Beast'') will largely dry up.
 In the world of books, the indefinite extension of copyright has had a perverse effect. It has created a vast collection of works that have been abandoned by publishers, a continent of books left permanently in the dark. In most cases, the original publisher simply doesn't find it profitable to keep these books in print. In other cases, the publishing company doesn't know whether it even owns the work, since author contracts in the past were not as explicit as they are now. The size of this abandoned library is shocking: about 75 percent of all books in the world's libraries are orphaned. Only about 15 percent of all books are in the public domain. A luckier 10 percent are still in print. The rest, the bulk of our universal library, is dark.

5. The Moral Imperative to Scan
 The 15 percent of the world's 32 million cataloged books that are in the public domain are freely available for anyone to borrow, imitate, publish or copy wholesale. Almost the entire current scanning effort by American libraries is aimed at this 15 percent. The Million Book Project mines this small sliver of the pie, as does Google. Because they are in the commons, no law hinders this 15 percent from being scanned and added to the universal library.
 The approximately 10 percent of all books actively in print will also be scanned before long. Amazon carries at least four million books, which includes multiple editions of the same title. Amazon is slowly scanning all of them. Recently, several big American publishers have declared themselves eager to move their entire backlist of books into the digital sphere. Many of them are working with Google in a partnership program in which Google scans their books, offers sample pages (controlled by the publisher) to readers and points readers to where they can buy the actual book. No one doubts electronic books will make money eventually. Simple commercial incentives guarantee that all in-print and backlisted books will before long be scanned into the great library. That's not the problem.
 The major problem for large publishers is that they are not certain what they actually own. If you would like to amuse yourself, pick an out-of-print book from the library and try to determine who owns its copyright. It's not easy. There is no list of copyrighted works. The Library of Congress does not have a catalog. The publishers don't have an exhaustive list, not even of their own imprints (though they say they are working on it). The older, the more obscure the work, the less likely a publisher will be able to tell you (that is, if the publisher still exists) whether the copyright has reverted to the author, whether the author is alive or dead, whether the copyright has been sold to another company, whether the publisher still owns the copyright or whether it plans to resurrect or scan it. Plan on having a lot of spare time and patience if you inquire. I recently spent two years trying to track down the copyright to a book that led me to Random House. Does the company own it? Can I reproduce it? Three years later, the company is still working on its answer. The prospect of tracking down the copyright -- with any certainty -- of the roughly 25 million orphaned books is simply ludicrous.
 Which leaves 75 percent of the known texts of humans in the dark. The legal limbo surrounding their status as copies prevents them from being digitized. No one argues that these are all masterpieces, but there is history and context enough in their pages to not let them disappear. And if they are not scanned, they in effect will disappear. But with copyright hyperextended beyond reason (the Supreme Court in 2003 declared the law dumb but not unconstitutional), none of this dark library will return to the public domain (and be cleared for scanning) until at least 2019. With no commercial incentive to entice uncertain publishers to pay for scanning these orphan works, they will vanish from view. According to Peter Brantley, director of technology for the California Digital Library, ''We have a moral imperative to reach out to our library shelves, grab the material that is orphaned and set it on top of scanners.''
 No one was able to unravel the Gordian knot of copydom until 2004, when Google came up with a clever solution. In addition to scanning the 15 percent out-of-copyright public-domain books with their library partners and the 10 percent in-print books with their publishing partners, Google executives declared that they would also scan the 75 percent out-of-print books that no one else would touch. They would scan the entire book, without resolving its legal status, which would allow the full text to be indexed on Google's internal computers and searched by anyone. But the company would show to readers only a few selected sentence-long snippets from the book at a time. Google's lawyers argued that the snippets the company was proposing were something like a quote or an excerpt in a review and thus should qualify as a ''fair use.''
 Google's plan was to scan the full text of every book in five major libraries: the more than 10 million titles held by Stanford, Harvard, Oxford, the University of Michigan and the New York Public Library. Every book would be indexed, but each would show up in search results in different ways. For out-of-copyright books, Google would show the whole book, page by page. For the in-print books, Google would work with publishers and let them decide what parts of their books would be shown and under what conditions. For the dark orphans, Google would show only limited snippets. And any copyright holder (author or corporation) who could establish ownership of a supposed orphan could ask Google to remove the snippets for any reason.
 At first glance, it seemed genius. By scanning all books (something only Google had the cash to do), the company would advance its mission to organize all knowledge. It would let books be searchable, and it could potentially sell ads on those searches, although it does not do that currently. In the same stroke, Google would rescue the lost and forgotten 75 percent of the library. For many authors, this all-out campaign was a salvation. Google became a discovery tool, if not a marketing program. While a few best-selling authors fear piracy, every author fears obscurity. Enabling their works to be found in the same universal search box as everything else in the world was good news for authors and good news for an industry that needed some. For authors with books in the publisher program and for authors of books abandoned by a publisher, Google unleashed a chance that more people would at least read, and perhaps buy, the creation they had sweated for years to complete.

6. The Case Against Google
 Some authors and many publishers found more evil than genius in Google's plan. Two points outraged them: the virtual copy of the book that sat on Google's indexing server and Google's assumption that it could scan first and ask questions later. On both counts the authors and publishers accused Google of blatant copyright infringement. When negotiations failed last fall, the Authors Guild and five big publishing companies sued Google. Their argument was simple: Why shouldn't Google share its ad revenue (if any) with the copyright owners? And why shouldn't Google have to ask permission from the legal copyright holder before scanning the work in any case? (I have divided loyalties in the case. The current publisher of my books is suing Google to protect my earnings as an author. At the same time, I earn income from Google Adsense ads placed on my blog.)
 One mark of the complexity of this issue is that the publishers suing were, and still are, committed partners in the Google Book Search Partner Program. They still want Google to index and search their in-print books, even when they are scanning the books themselves, because, they say, search is a discovery tool for readers. The ability to search the scans of all books is good for profits. 
 The argument about sharing revenue is not about the three or four million books that publishers care about and keep in print, because Google is sharing revenues for those books with publishers. (Google says publishers receive the ''majority share'' of the income from the small ads placed on partner-program pages.) The argument is about the 75 percent of books that have been abandoned by publishers as uneconomical. One curious fact, of course, is that publishers only care about these orphans now because Google has shifted the economic equation; because of Book Search, these dark books may now have some sparks in them, and the publishers don't want this potential revenue stream to slip away from them. They are now busy digging deep into their records to see what part of the darkness they can declare as their own.
 The second complaint against Google is more complex. Google argues that it is nearly impossible to track down copyright holders of orphan works, and so, it says, it must scan those books first and only afterward honor any legitimate requests to remove the scan. In this way, Google follows the protocol of the Internet. Google scans all Web pages; if it's on the Web, it's scanned. Web pages, by default, are born copyrighted. Google, therefore, regularly copies billions of copyrighted pages into its index for the public to search. But if you don't want Google to search your Web site, you can stick some code on your home page with a no-searching sign, and Google and every other search engine will stay out. A Web master thus can opt out of search. (Few do.) Google applies the same principle of opting-out to Book Search. It is up to you as an author to notify Google if you don't want the company to scan or search your copyrighted material. This might be a reasonable approach for Google to demand from an author or publisher if Google were the only search company around. But search technology is becoming a commodity, and if it turns out there is any money in it, it is not impossible to imagine a hundred mavericks scanning out-of-print books. Should you as a creator be obliged to find and notify each and every geek who scanned your work, if for some reason you did not want it indexed? What if you miss one?
 There is a technical solution to this problem: for the search companies to compile and maintain a common list of no-scan copyright holders. A publisher or author who doesn't want a work scanned notifies the keepers of the common list once, and anyone conducting scanning would have to remove material that was listed. Since Google, like all the other big search companies -- Microsoft, Amazon and Yahoo -- is foremost a technical-solution company, it favors this approach. But the battle never got that far.

7. When Business Models Collide
 In thinking about the arguments around search, I realized that there are many ways to conceive of this conflict. At first, I thought that this was a misunderstanding between people of the book, who favor solutions by laws, and people of the screen, who favor technology as a solution to all problems. Last November, the New York Public Library (one of the ''Google Five'') sponsored a debate between representatives of authors and publishers and supporters of Google. I was tickled to see that up on the stage, the defenders of the book were from the East Coast and the defenders of the screen were from the West Coast. But while it's true that there's a strand of cultural conflict here, I eventually settled on a different framework, one that I found more useful. This is a clash of business models. 
 Authors and publishers (including publishers of music and film) have relied for years on cheap mass-produced copies protected from counterfeits and pirates by a strong law based on the dominance of copies and on a public educated to respect the sanctity of a copy. This model has, in the last century or so, produced the greatest flowering of human achievement the world has ever seen, a magnificent golden age of creative works. Protected physical copies have enabled millions of people to earn a living directly from the sale of their art to the audience, without the weird dynamics of patronage. Not only did authors and artists benefit from this model, but the audience did, too. For the first time, billions of ordinary people were able to come in regular contact with a great work. In Mozart's day, few people ever heard one of his symphonies more than once. With the advent of cheap audio recordings, a barber in Java could listen to them all day long. 
 But a new regime of digital technology has now disrupted all business models based on mass-produced copies, including individual livelihoods of artists. The contours of the electronic economy are still emerging, but while they do, the wealth derived from the old business model is being spent to try to protect that old model, through legislation and enforcement. Laws based on the mass-produced copy artifact are being taken to the extreme, while desperate measures to outlaw new technologies in the marketplace ''for our protection'' are introduced in misguided righteousness. (This is to be expected. The fact is, entire industries and the fortunes of those working in them are threatened with demise. Newspapers and magazines, Hollywood, record labels, broadcasters and many hard-working and wonderful creative people in those fields have to change the model of how they earn money. Not all will make it.)
 The new model, of course, is based on the intangible assets of digital bits, where copies are no longer cheap but free. They freely flow everywhere. As computers retrieve images from the Web or display texts from a server, they make temporary internal copies of those works. In fact, every action you take on the Net or invoke on your computer requires a copy of something to be made. This peculiar superconductivity of copies spills out of the guts of computers into the culture of computers. Many methods have been employed to try to stop the indiscriminate spread of copies, including copy-protection schemes, hardware-crippling devices, education programs, even legislation, but all have proved ineffectual. The remedies are rejected by consumers and ignored by pirates. 
 As copies have been dethroned, the economic model built on them is collapsing. In a regime of superabundant free copies, copies lose value. They are no longer the basis of wealth. Now relationships, links, connection and sharing are. Value has shifted away from a copy toward the many ways to recall, annotate, personalize, edit, authenticate, display, mark, transfer and engage a work. Authors and artists can make (and have made) their livings selling aspects of their works other than inexpensive copies of them. They can sell performances, access to the creator, personalization, add-on information, the scarcity of attention (via ads), sponsorship, periodic subscriptions -- in short, all the many values that cannot be copied. The cheap copy becomes the ''discovery tool'' that markets these other intangible valuables. But selling things-that-cannot-be-copied is far from ideal for many creative people. The new model is rife with problems (or opportunities). For one thing, the laws governing creating and rewarding creators still revolve around the now-fragile model of valuable copies.

8. Search Changes Everything
 The search-engine companies, including Google, operate in the new regime. Search is a wholly new concept, not foreseen in version 1.0 of our intellectual-property law. In the words of a recent ruling by the United States District Court for Nevada, search has a ''transformative purpose,'' adding new social value to what it searches. What search uncovers is not just keywords but also the inherent value of connection. While almost every artist recognizes that the value of a creation ultimately rests in the value he or she personally gets from creating it (and for a few artists that value is sufficient), it is also true that the value of any work is increased the more it is shared. The technology of search maximizes the value of a creative work by allowing a billion new connections into it, often a billion new connections that were previously inconceivable. Things can be found by search only if they radiate potential connections. These potential relationships can be as simple as a title or as deep as hyperlinked footnotes that lead to active pages, which are also footnoted. It may be as straightforward as a song published intact or as complex as access to the individual instrument tracks -- or even individual notes.
 Search opens up creations. It promotes the civic nature of publishing. Having searchable works is good for culture. It is so good, in fact, that we can now state a new covenant: Copyrights must be counterbalanced by copyduties. In exchange for public protection of a work's copies (what we call copyright), a creator has an obligation to allow that work to be searched. No search, no copyright. As a song, movie, novel or poem is searched, the potential connections it radiates seep into society in a much deeper way than the simple publication of a duplicated copy ever could. 
 We see this effect most clearly in science. Science is on a long-term campaign to bring all knowledge in the world into one vast, interconnected, footnoted, peer-reviewed web of facts. Independent facts, even those that make sense in their own world, are of little value to science. (The pseudo- and parasciences are nothing less, in fact, than small pools of knowledge that are not connected to the large network of science.) In this way, every new observation or bit of data brought into the web of science enhances the value of all other data points. In science, there is a natural duty to make what is known searchable. No one argues that scientists should be paid when someone finds or duplicates their results. Instead, we have devised other ways to compensate them for their vital work. They are rewarded for the degree that their work is cited, shared, linked and connected in their publications, which they do not own. They are financed with extremely short-term (20-year) patent monopolies for their ideas, short enough to truly inspire them to invent more, sooner. To a large degree, they make their living by giving away copies of their intellectual property in one fashion or another.
 The legal clash between the book copy and the searchable Web promises to be a long one. Jane Friedman, the C.E.O. of HarperCollins, which is supporting the suit against Google (while remaining a publishing partner), declared, ''I don't expect this suit to be resolved in my lifetime.'' She's right. The courts may haggle forever as this complex issue works its way to the top. In the end, it won't matter; technology will resolve this discontinuity first. The Chinese scanning factories, which operate under their own, looser intellectual-property assumptions, will keep churning out digital books. And as scanning technology becomes faster, better and cheaper, fans may do what they did to music and simply digitize their own libraries.
 What is the technology telling us? That copies don't count any more. Copies of isolated books, bound between inert covers, soon won't mean much. Copies of their texts, however, will gain in meaning as they multiply by the millions and are flung around the world, indexed and copied again. What counts are the ways in which these common copies of a creative work can be linked, manipulated, annotated, tagged, highlighted, bookmarked, translated, enlivened by other media and sewn together into the universal library. Soon a book outside the library will be like a Web page outside the Web, gasping for air. Indeed, the only way for books to retain their waning authority in our culture is to wire their texts into the universal library.
 But the reign of livelihoods based on the copy is not over. In the next few years, lobbyists for book publishers, movie studios and record companies will exert every effort to mandate the extinction of the ''indiscriminate flow of copies,'' even if it means outlawing better hardware. Too many creative people depend on the business model revolving around copies for it to pass quietly. For their benefit, copyright law will not change suddenly. 
 But it will adapt eventually. The reign of the copy is no match for the bias of technology. All new works will be born digital, and they will flow into the universal library as you might add more words to a long story. The great continent of orphan works, the 25 million older books born analog and caught between the law and users, will be scanned. Whether this vast mountain of dark books is scanned by Google, the Library of Congress, the Chinese or by readers themselves, it will be scanned well before its legal status is resolved simply because technology makes it so easy to do and so valuable when done. In the clash between the conventions of the book and the protocols of the screen, the screen will prevail. On this screen, now visible to one billion people on earth, the technology of search will transform isolated books into the universal library of all human knowledge.

HEADLINE: Golfing and Gardening (and Working) in Retirement

BYLINE: By JULIE BICK

 BODY:
TURNING 65, collecting a gold watch and hitting the golf course may be the classic picture of retirement. 
 But another model seems to be gaining acceptance, particularly among people now at or approaching retirement age. Call it flex-retirement. It involves reduced, but continuing, work -- combined with a cultivation of leisure activities -- sometimes beginning well before 65, and extending long past it.
Kathy Swartout, of Olympia, Wash., 58, for example, retired last year from her job as program director at a community college, and spent eight months focused on yoga, sailing and gardening. Then, in January, she took a full-time job training Washington state government workers on changes to the state welfare program. 
 She enjoys working, with one major caveat that she believes many people her age share. ''We're tired of the nine-to-five grind,'' she said, ''and want to pursue other interests.'' 
 Her current contract ends in July, but Ms. Swartout -- a former family therapist and manager in a county-level mental health program for children -- says she expects to stay at her post three days a week. ''Working part time balances financial security with family and all the other fun things I want to do,'' she said.
 Ms. Swartout may be emblematic of a generational attitude. A 2002 AARP study showed that 71 percent of workers age 45 to 56 plan to work into their retirement years. Thirty-five percent of that group planned to work part time for interest or enjoyment, 11 percent expected to start their own businesses, 7 percent planned to retire from their current jobs, but work full time at something else, and 18 percent planned to work part time mainly for the income. 
 There are, of course, broad social and economic reasons for the emphasis on continuing work -- notably, the decline in availability of traditional pension plans and health benefits, and the need for older workers to provide for themselves over a lengthening lifespan. Older working people often speak of the intangible benefits of work, including the opportunity to learn something new, to feel valued and to socialize with others. 
 Many people under 65, who are financially able to do so, have found ways of cutting back their workloads. Dr. Pat Schoenfelder, 57, for example, a radiologist, stopped working full time three years ago. Since then, he and two partners of roughly the same age, have shared duties at North Country Regional Hospital in Bemidji, Minn., each working just 17 weeks a year, to cover the daily needs of the 110-bed hospital. 
 This arrangement has worked well so far, but Dr. Schoenfelder's partners are planning to reduce their hours further next year. He intends to increase his own office time temporarily, while he helps recruit and train younger doctors to take over the practice. 
 At some point, he plans to retire from radiology entirely and pursue interests in health care public policy. Might that involve another job? ''You never know,'' he said.
 Peter Cappelli, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who studies work force management, said the decline in company pension plans might keep people at work to build up their financial assets. But he expects many to avoid full-time work behind a desk in the main office. ''Baby boomers will use technology to make their workplace more flexible regarding schedules and working off-site -- just like they're doing today,'' he said. 
 Some retirees will dial their work back to sustain their current spending. ''They work just enough hours to pay the bills, so they don't have to touch their retirement funds,'' said Dr. Schoenfelder, who has observed that practice among some of his friends. Those reduced hours can leave more time for hobbies and travel. 
 Part-time retirement wasn't always common, of course. Sidney Goldman, 86, a retired businessman in Verona N.J., said people in his generation often faced a clear-cut decision: to work or not to work. He bought a pharmacy when he came home from World War II and went on to create products like candy laxatives and mosquito coils as a serial entrepreneur. ''In my generation, there were the people who retired and the people who kept working,'' he said. ''It was one or the other -- there was no part-time.'' 
 These days, though, in order to keep people on the job, some employers are beginning to accommodate the desire of some older workers for a flexible, phased-in retirement, said Sara E. Rix, senior policy adviser at AARP. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, from 2004 to 2014, the number of workers age 55 or older is expected to increase 49.1 percent, compared with an increase of 2.7 percent for workers under 55. The older group would then make up 21 percent of the labor force, up from 16 percent in 2004. 
 Some companies are already making efforts to keep their aging work forces content. Borders bookstores in the north have made it possible for some employees to work winters in Florida, for example. ''Our corporate attitude is, if we have a great employee and can accommodate a need they have, we want to do that,'' said Anne Roman, a Borders Group spokeswoman. The company's human resources department is considering a formal policy to allow such seasonal shifts, which now take place on a case-by-case basis. Home Depot started a partnership in 2004 with AARP to attract, hire and retain employees age 50 and older. This includes posting job application information on the AARP Web site and maintaining a booth at the annual AARP member meeting.
 Stanley Consultants, an engineering consulting firm in Muscatine, Iowa, offers customized phased-in retirement plans for employees and retirement planning workshops for employees and their spouses. 
 ''The engineering discipline is short of people at all levels in the U.S.,'' said Gregs G. Thomopulos, president and chief executive of Stanley Consultants. ''At the same time, our clients want the most experienced engineers to manage their multihundred-million-dollar construction projects.'' 
 Mr. Thomopulos, 63, who has been with the company 41 years, says he tries to keep his best engineers as long as possible. The company has no mandatory retirement age and nearly a third of all employees are over the age of 50. 
 Kirk Shore, one of the company's oldest workers at age 76, has been with Stanley Consultants since 1954. He retired officially in 2003, but now works six hours a day on projects of his choice. ''Retirement is nice, but I also like working with the same great people I've been with for 30 or 40 years,'' he said. Mr. Shore also enjoys being with younger employees, who, he said, are eager to learn from him.
 BUT corporate policies and programs designed to benefit older workers aren't widespread yet, Ms. Rix of AARP said. ''The data do indicate that workers would like less demanding work in retirement, but don't typically think their employers would allow it,'' she said.
 For people now approaching the traditional retirement age, Professor Cappelli said, it makes sense to discuss options with employers. ''Companies won't leap to make changes unless they have to,'' but with an aging work force, social pressures will surely mount. ''There are so many baby boomers,'' he said, ''that when they start to ask, companies will have to listen.''

HEADLINE: 'Temporary' Tax Cuts Have a Way of Becoming Permanent

BYLINE: By ANNA BERNASEK

 BODY:
THINGS that seem temporary can have a sneaky way of becoming permanent. Anyone who's ever bought a home knows how it works. At first there are dozens of fixes you plan to make -- that dreadful carpet, those dingy tiles in the bathroom, maybe even a silly door knob. Ten years later, you find yourself still staring at them.
 The same may turn out to be true for the Bush administration's tax policies. Passed between 2001 and 2004, the president's major tax policy initiatives were approved on a temporary basis. Of the many changes that were made law, almost every one came with an expiration date, also known as a sunset provision.
Many of the deadlines on these measures have already been extended, some as recently as this week. For others with deadlines later in the decade the lobbying is just getting underway. But as the budget turns a deeper shade of red, it's worth assessing those sunsets once again. They don't make a pretty picture. 
 Recall the basic tax policies of the Bush presidency: sweeping cuts to income and estate taxes, benefits for families and married couples and tax breaks for savers, investors and students. More than 20 major provisions were enacted, with seemingly countless detailed changes to the tax code. The laws phase in different tax rates at different times and end at various dates through 2010, resulting in a shifting kaleidoscope of tax calculations.
 So far, very few provisions have been allowed to expire. For instance, only one of the major provisions -- the additional depreciation allowance for business property -- has gone away. That was arguably the only provision that was really intended as a short-term fix, to bolster business investment. The others that neared expiration have been extended and now feature new sunset dates. Increased alternative minimum tax exemptions, for example, have been extended each year since 2004, and this week Congress voted to extend the provision again for another year. In addition, Congress also approved a two-year extension of some provisions dear to investors, like cuts in capital gain and dividend taxes, which had been due to expire at the end of 2008.
 Each year since 2001 Mr. Bush has proposed making his core tax policies permanent. The most significant items include repealing the estate tax and perpetuating the cuts in individual income, capital gains and dividend taxes. The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation recently calculated that it would cost $1.6 trillion from 2006 to 2016 to make the tax provisions permanent. And that's in addition to the $1.3 trillion cost of the 2001 tax package and $350 billion for the 2003 package, according to the committee. 
 All the temporary tax provisions are due to expire by the end of 2010. By then, there will be a new president in the White House and, in the view of many critics of the Bush administration, the fiscal situation will be so dire that Congress will have little choice but to let the tax cuts lapse.
 ''There's no way Congress will make these tax cuts permanent,'' said Laurence J. Kotlikoff, chairman of the economics department at Boston University and co-author of ''The Coming Generational Storm.'' ''Every year it doesn't happen it's less and less likely.''
 Leonard Burman, a tax expert at the Urban Institute, a research group based in Washington, agrees. ''By 2010, people are going to be disgusted and won't pass the tax cuts,'' he said.
 Congress's failure to address budget imbalances in recent years has already led to a significant fiscal reversal. In January 2001, the Congressional Budget Office predicted an accumulated surplus in the budget of $5.6 trillion for 2002 to 2011. Now it predicts a deficit of $2.7 trillion over the same period. And that's before any of the federal government's massive Social Security and Medicare obligations are taken into account. 
 Three economists, Alan J. Auerbach from the University of California, Berkeley, with William G. Gale and Peter R. Orszag from the Brookings Institution, have analyzed the latest budget trends and found that diminishing revenues are the main reason for the government's worsening fiscal position. They attributed 58 percent of the decline in official budget forecasts since 2001 to lower revenues mainly resulting from the tax cuts, and 42 percent to higher spending. At the same time, they note that declining revenues have accounted for most of the deterioration in the actual budget outcomes between 2000 and 2006 and revenues have recently been near historic lows as a share of gross domestic product. 
 Still, despite ample warning, lawmakers in Washington have shown barely a trace of fiscal restraint over the last several years and it may be dangerous to assume they will have a sudden change of heart. Politicians in both parties have voted to extend the tax provisions with full knowledge of the big costs to come. In part that's because Mr. Bush's tax policies appeal to a variety of constituents. Many of the incentives to save and invest, for instance, can benefit a majority of Americans, although the greatest benefits tend to be had by those at high income levels who have the most to gain from tax breaks.
 It's a similar situation with the individual income tax cuts. While the biggest cuts have gone to high-income earners, most working Americans have benefited to some degree. The Bush sunset provisions also set up a very powerful dynamic for making the tax changes permanent. Interest groups intensely focused on an individual policy item can run rings around a majority too passive to fight each small, isolated issue. Add to that the problems of perception. It can be politically difficult to take back something people have grown accustomed to.
 THEN there's the great complexity of all the tax changes, which may serve the president's interests. ''Part of the reason the tax code is so messed up is that politicians can hide behind the complexity,'' Mr. Burman of the Urban Institute said. ''It's very difficult for the public to keep track of everything that's going on.'' 
 The incremental approach to the administration's tax cuts keeps the focus on individual policies rather than on the bigger picture. It's very much like the administration's approach on spending in the war in Iraq. Who can keep track of how much is being spent in total when every so often Congress approves another few hundred billion dollars of emergency spending?
 The voters will have a lot to say about whether Mr. Bush's tax policies live on past his presidency. Still, it may not be all that easy to undo them. 
 And that may mean the nation ends up staring at a big ugly hole in the budget that at first seemed impossible to live with.

HEADLINE: Solution or Distraction? An Ethanol Reality Check 

BYLINE: By JIM MOTAVALLI

 BODY:
ETHANOL is on a roll, increasingly promoted as a homegrown alternative to oil from the Middle East. But is ethanol really the fuel of the future, or is it destined to remain a niche product in the Midwest, subsidized by Congress for the benefit of farm-state politicians? Here are some basic questions and answers: 


Q. What is ethanol and how is it made?

A. Ethanol is a form of alcohol; in the United States, it is produced mainly from corn. The starch in the corn is converted to sugar, which is fermented to produce the fuel, a process not unlike making corn liquor in a still. Ethanol fuel, typically blended with 15 percent gasoline and sold as E85, has some advantages over gasoline -- lower emissions of greenhouse gases and higher octane -- but it has about 25 percent less energy per gallon and is incompatible with older cars.

Q. How much ethanol is produced in the United States? What's the potential?

A. Some 3.9 billion gallons were made in 2005 (nearly triple the 1.4 billion gallons produced in 1998), the Omaha-based Ethanol Promotion and Information Council says. Tom Slunecka, the council's executive director, said production could rise to 40 billion gallons by 2025, displacing a third of the unleaded gasoline now used each year.

Q. Is ethanol fuel a new idea?

A. No. The elimination of lead as an octane booster in the 1970's, and the creation of tax incentives for blended gas by federal and state governments, gave rise to a new market for ethanol as an additive, causing production to jump from 10 million gallons in 1979 to 175 million gallons in 1980. For automakers, the big ethanol opportunity came in 1988, when Congress passed the Alternative Motor Fuels Act. It provided credits for manufacturers that raised their corporate average fuel economy numbers, known as CAFE, for producing gasoline vehicles that were also ethanol-ready. But with the nation's limited ethanol infrastructure, most of the vehicles ended up using gasoline.

Q. So we have a rising number of ethanol vehicles, but not many ethanol stations?

A. Precisely. General Motors' ''Live Green, Go Yellow'' campaign boasts that the company has built more than 1.5 million ethanol-compliant vehicles. But there are only about 600 pumps -- none in the Northeast that sell to the public and only four in California -- dispensing E85 ethanol in the United States, which has about 180,000 gas stations. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 provides a 30 percent federal income tax credit, up to a maximum of $30,000, for each gas station installing alternative fuel pumps. But it may be years before a national network is in place. ''If 5 to 10 percent of our gas stations had ethanol, that would be huge,'' a G.M. spokeswoman, Sherrie Childers Arb, said.

Q. Is this just a G.M. thing?

A. No. Chrysler says it will build 500,000 E85-compliant vehicles a year by 2008; this year, G.M. plans 400,000 and Ford 250,000. Ethanol-ready vehicles range from the Chrysler Sebring to the Chevrolet Suburban S.U.V.

Q. Is corn really the best raw material for ethanol?

A. Maybe not. Other countries are producing ethanol, using less energy in the process, from cellulose-rich sources like sugar cane (Brazil), logging waste (Sweden), sugar beets (France) and sweet sorghum (India). The final product is referred to as cellulosic ethanol. Switchgrass, a native prairie perennial cited by President Bush as a possible ethanol source, also shows promise.

Q. Is E85 cheaper than gas?

A. There is not much of a price advantage now, and ethanol's lower energy content -- which means you must fill your tank more often -- has to be taken into account. E85 prices have risen in some markets to a price slightly less than regular-grade gas, but proponents see it as less subject to supply interruptions and more stable because it is produced in the United States.

Q. Don't some scientists contend that making ethanol requires more energy than it produces? Is there enough agricultural land to eventually grow all of the nation's fuel?

A. David Pimentel, a professor at Cornell University, published a paper in 2005 with Tad W. Patzek of the University of California, Berkeley stating that the corn-to-ethanol process powered by fossil fuels consumes 29 percent more energy than it produces. The results for switchgrass were even worse, the paper said, with a 50 percent net energy deficit. ''I'm sympathetic, and I wish that ethanol production was a net positive and a help to this nation,'' Dr. Pimentel said in an interview. ''But I'm a scientist first and an agriculturalist second. I don't think the U.S. will meet its goals with biofuels.'' He also said the United States did not have enough agricultural land to displace gasoline with biofuels.

Others are far more sanguine. Arthur J. Ragauskas, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology and the co-author of a positive study about ethanol that appeared in the journal Science in January, said the nation could replace a third of its current fuel demands by focusing on cellulosic ethanol from forest products and agricultural residue. Mr. Slunecka of the Ethanol Promotion and Information Council said that Dr. Pimentel's calculations did not account for the increasing efficiency of ethanol plants and rising yields of corn per acre.

Q. Could we actually replace fossil fuel with biofuel?

A. Environmentalists have grand visions for biofuels. Roland Hwang, vehicles policy director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, says the group's research shows that by 2050, biofuels could replace gasoline if cars were also made more fuel-efficient and a program of ''smart growth,'' reducing the need to drive long distances, was put in place.

Q. Aren't the Swedes already making that vision come true?

A. With only nine million people and four million cars, Sweden already has a network of 320 ethanol stations (half as many as in the United States), and a vision of going ''fossil fuel free'' by 2020. Sweden is importing most of its alcohol fuel from Brazil, but plans eight plants to produce cellulosic ethanol.

Saab has sold 5,500 BioPower 9-5 models for the home market that can run either on gasoline or ethanol. Volvo is building as many as 7,000 flex-fuel cars this year that can run on ethanol, and 2,500 cars that can run on gasoline or ''biogas,'' a form of methane that comes from landfills.

Q. Finally, who's this ''Corn Cob Bob'' guy?

A. He's the mascot of the Canadian ethanol industry, promoting good will for corn-based fuel by attending events and handing out balloons and other goodies. But he was unceremoniously thrown out (on his ear) at Canada Day festivities in Ottawa last year, reportedly at the behest of Shell Canada, which had paid to be an exclusive sponsor.

HEADLINE: A Block Built by Shoes Hobbles on Its Uppers

BYLINE: By ALEX MINDLIN

 BODY:
For the last 20 years, West Eighth Street has been one of the city's densest retail clusters, a raucous, shoe-based micro-economy where women shop for clogs, heels and boots in closet-size stores booming with hip-hop. 
 But lately the street has been subdued. There are at least 18 vacant storefronts on the block of Eighth Street west of Fifth Avenue, some empty for several years. And these vacancies have hurt the remaining shoe stores, according to the managers who anxiously surveyed their quiet shops last Thursday.
''This is not the strip no more,'' said Chico Roque, the manager of Make 10, a genial man who wore the key to the cash register on a knotted shoelace that encircled his skull like a headband. ''If I were going to tell you, 'Let's go to Eighth Street,' you'd say, 'For what?' ''
 A few doors down, the scene was similar. Jimmy Vee, the elegantly dressed, dreadlocked manager of Maor Shoes, looked mournfully at a knee-high pair of $995 black snakeskin boots. ''Customers ask: 'Why are all the stores closed?' What's wrong with this street now?' ''
 There are several answers. The opening of giant shoe stores on 14th Street, like DSW and Shoe Mania, has hurt the smaller shops on West Eighth. ''You go to DSW on the weekend, there's 18 registers going, and you still have to wait 10 minutes to check out,'' said Honi Klein, executive director of the Village Alliance, the local business improvement district.
 In addition, commercial rents there, as throughout most of the city, have surged because of soaring property values: two five-story buildings at Nos. 21, 23 and 25 sold for a combined $10.4 million in January. 
 Stores in several recently purchased buildings on the street were asked to leave by their new landlords, Ms. Klein said. Neighborhood residents say another building owner has kept his storefronts empty for years, holding out, they suspect, for rents so high that nobody is willing to pay them.
 But Ms. Klein is upbeat about the street's future, suggesting that new stores will soon fill the old storefronts. A wine store, a waffle shop and a cookware store are already opening on the block.
 In her office, she showed a visitor 50-year old photographs of West Eighth Street, pointing out the kind of stores that have long been absent from the block: a dry cleaner, a deli, a drugstore.
 ''A mix is important,'' she said. ''If anything dominates a block -- shoes or jelly beans or widgets -- then it can become very difficult to attract buyers.'' ALEX MINDLIN

HEADLINE: Just a Guy Named Mike

BYLINE: By JOEL KELLER

DATELINE: WEST CAPE MAY 

 BODY:
TO thousands of New Jerseyans, Michael Colameco is a chef and a personality on public television. But to a dozen or so sixth graders here, he is also someone else.
 ''Mr. Mike!'' one student shouted as Mr. Colameco approached the doors of West Cape May Elementary School. The boy then greeted Mr. Colameco with a chest bump. Once inside, Mr. Colameco read from a book about Nantucket, telling the class how it reminded him of his current hometown.
 Though there was a substitute teacher leading the class usually taught by Fran Horvat, only a few students took advantage of the chance to cause minor mischief. Mr. Colameco commanded attention, something he has been doing almost every year at this school since his oldest son started going here. 
 ''I've been reading at this school for 13, 14 years,'' he said as he walked back to his house around the corner. ''I've watched the kids go to college.'' 
 His grammar-school readings aren't the only thing about Mr. Colameco that are surprising. On the surface, he looks like a motorcycle mechanic, or maybe one of the guys who go out from the harbor to trawl for scallops. He sports a graying ponytail and goatee and tends to dress in black T-shirts. In his younger days, he says, he was a New York Athletic Club boxing champion, a black belt in karate and a marathoner. But it's that regular-guy vibe that has made his public television cooking show, ''Colameco's Food Show,'' a success for the last six years.
 ''Mike is a perfectly natural person, and that's not something you encounter every day,'' said Craig Shelton, the owner and chef at the Ryland Inn in Whitehouse, which Mr. Colameco profiled in a recent episode. ''He's absolutely authentic, and when he says something he means it. He has a great passion and a zest, and I think he's quite captivating on screen and off.''
 In the show, which airs on both Channel 13 (WNET) on Sundays at 6 p.m. and on NJN Public Television on Saturdays at 10:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m., Mr. Colameco, whose full-time job is as an independent food broker, explores restaurants in New York City and New Jersey, sometimes taking viewers on a whirlwind ride through the best restaurants in an area. In other episodes, he explores one restaurant in depth, interviewing the chef, owner and crew to show viewers what goes into creating memorable dining. He spends the second half of each episode creating dishes inspired by his visits.
 Mr. Colameco is willing to explore every culinary experience, from the fine French/American cuisine at Per Se in Manhattan to deep-fried hot dogs at Callahan's. And he is not afraid to experiment when he cooks. He self-produces the series, which has aired on WNET since 2000 and on NJN since 2002; the crew consists of just him and a cameraman. One way he keeps costs low is by shooting the cooking segments in his own kitchen.
 From that well-used kitchen, where he needs ''two days to scrub the stainless steel and get it ready'' for taping, Mr. Colameco shows that he is passionate about food, especially the seafood that comes in from Eastern Seaboard regions -- like the Jersey Shore. 
 ''You have a huge population of America, living cheek-to-jowl with the shore,'' he said. ''None of these people -- smart people, educated people -- these people have no idea when they're going out to eat where this stuff is coming from. 'Where's my fluke, flounder, shellfish, scallops, calamari -- where is it coming from?' It's coming from your backyard.'' 
 He gets a little irritated that, even though so much fresh fish and shellfish come from off the New Jersey coast, people still insist on ordering the same two or three types of fish at restaurants. ''You might have wheat fish, bluefish, monkfish, all of which is indigenous to these waters and pristinely fresh, and people will order tilapia,'' he said with a bit of disgust. 
 Still, he defended the fact that most restaurants seem to have these common breeds on their menus, putting himself in the restaurant owner's position. ''My business isn't to make the public smart,'' he said. ''I need to make money, and I'm not going to do that by putting croaker and whiting on the menu. If everyone wants salmon, that's what they're going to get.''
 Mr. Colameco, 49, knows from experience. After a career as a chef in New York, including a stint as the executive chef at the Ritz-Carlton hotel, he and his wife, Heijung Park-Colameco, 53, a pastry chef, opened the Globe Restaurant in West Cape May in 1988. In the five years the restaurant was open, it did well, but it was usually overshadowed by an Italian place across the street called Godmother's. He recounted those years over a serving of sauteed scallops and porgy over salad greens, a meal he had whipped up as he talked.
 ''Here I am, this kid from New York, and his wife, making tomato sauce from fresh tomatoes, cooked down in the oven with basil and olive oil like a confiture, and I'm having trouble getting customers in,'' he said. ''And I look out my kitchen window, and there's 25 people lined up at Godmother's for canned tomato sauce with oregano in it!'' 
 He laughed, then said, ''I remember just being apoplectic.''
 Three years after the Globe closed, he moved up to Maplewood to be closer to New York City. But the faster pace of life got to them, so the Colamecos and their sons, Sean and Gianni, who are now 16 and 14, moved back to the Shore for good in 1999. Mr. Colameco enjoys the openness and safety of life in a town that offers plenty of large Victorian-era homes as well as modest cottages. 
 He describes the class-free structure of West Cape May with reverence: ''You've got these income strata where you've got millionaires and you've got people who are making 18,000 bucks a year and collecting unemployment for five months. But everybody hangs out because if you're a snob here, you have no friends.''
 That unpretentiousness, combined with local subject matter, has made Mr. Colameco's show one of the highest-rated cooking shows on both regional outlets; WNET reports that the show averages more than 143,000 viewers a week, and NJN says that it lands in its top 25 (and in the top five among locally-produced shows).
 ''I think he comes across as Everyman,'' said Andre Butts, program director for NJN Public Television. ''He comes across as your neighbor who just happens to be in the food business who teaches you some tricks and techniques to making great food.''
 Mr. Colameco commutes weekly to New York to do pre-production and shooting for the show, as well as do research for a book he is writing for Wiley & Sons called ''The Food-Lovers' Guide to New York,'' which is scheduled to be released in 2007. When he is there, he stays at the New York Athletic Club, where he still spars occasionally.
 He has tried to take the show national, only to be rebuffed by Food Network executives for what he claimed is their desire to have hosts who appeal to a younger audience. But he feels they're missing the mark. Children like his show, he said, because ''I'm their goofy uncle that they can talk to about rap music or rock music or sports.'' 
 If the rapt students in Ms. Horvat's class are any indication, ''Mr. Mike'' might just be on to something.

HEADLINE: A Dozen Roadside Attractions

BYLINE: By JONATHAN MILLER

DATELINE: WOODBRIDGE 

 BODY:
AND so they came, tens of thousands of travelers on this miserable day, in cars hauling cranky children, in trucks hauling prime rib, in buses hauling tourists. In they staggered on sore legs, full bladders, empty stomachs and dry gas tanks.
 On a recent Sunday afternoon, the New Jersey Turnpike was not behaving.
First there were the soaking rains. Then came the automotive deluge. And inevitably came a rash of accidents, prompting Jeff McKay, a traffic reporter on NJ 101.5, to tell listeners, ''It's just going to be real nasty out there.'' He then described a 30-mile backup gathering northbound between Exits 5 and 8.
 To the rest stop! Fast! 
 At the Grover Cleveland Service Area, north of Exit 11, things were spinning out of control. Many drivers stuck in the day's traffic had run low on gas and patience and were now wedged into hydra-like lines that had begun backing onto the entrance ramps. Some passengers escaped the lines and scampered to the restrooms. 
 All along the turnpike, whether they like it or not, 20 million motorists and their bored passengers are thrown together inside 12 unadorned buildings for the briefest of moments each year. 
 There is the trucker from Florida hauling chemicals and hunting for a cup of Starbucks coffee, the exchange student from Thailand selling sunglasses, the running back from Maryland returning from a tryout with a Canadian football team, the father pointing to a map of Atlantic City and telling his son: ''There's Ventnor. There's Atlantic and Pacific. There's Boardwalk.'' 
 ''It's kind of like Walt Whitman's America,'' said Angus Kress Gillespie, a professor of American studies at Rutgers and co-author of ''Looking for America on the New Jersey Turnpike.'' (Of course he knew Whitman's rest stop is just south of Exit 4.) ''It's a place for everyone. All colors, races, creeds, genders.'' 
 Indeed it is. White, black, Hispanic, Middle Eastern, Asian. Mercedes, Oldsmobile, Ford, Hyundai, minivan.
 Once grim outposts, 11 of the 12 rest stops have been greatly improved since Dr. Gillespie wrote his book in 1989. Televisions can be found in the dining areas, and people can buy T-shirts, hats and shot glasses that say ''New Jersey'' (in the past it was mostly ''New York''). And the famous people connected to New Jersey who have lent their names to rest stops -- like Joyce Kilmer, Richard Stockton, Vince Lombardi, Clara Barton -- are now given modest tribute with mounted frames in the vestibules.
 More changes may be on the way. A bill proposed in March by State Senator Raymond J. Lesniak, a Democrat of Union, would partly privatize the Garden State Parkway and turnpike and could affect the rest stops, since it would create financial incentives for the operators to provide such services as hotels and even amusements. 
 Although the bill was pulled this month, it is being rewritten to send the bulk of the proceeds of the sale -- about $6 billion -- to the state's Transportation Trust Fund, not the pension fund, as first proposed.
 On a recent Sunday, two brothers from Perth Amboy who asked not to be identified, both in gray polo shirts, were trying to sell sunglasses at the Thomas Edison rest stop. It was a bad day for business: cloudy and wet. The older brother showed a skeptical woman carrying a glittering gold purse a pair for $30. 
 ''See?'' he said, as he led her to the window to view her reflection. ''Even now, when it's raining, it's even more clearer.''
 The younger brother shook his head in admiration and said, ''He's a pro, man.''
 ''On days like this,'' the older brother instructed, '' if you don't do that, you don't make money.'' The woman eventually bought two pair for $53. 
 If you ride the turnpike -- 148 miles from the Delaware Memorial Bridge to the George Washington -- long enough, you learn some secrets.
 For instance, the Vince Lombardi stop, wedged in the swamps of North Jersey, is the last rest area in New Jersey before the George Washington Bridge, and it also tends to be a favored spot for drug deals. 
 In May 2003, Bergen County officials found a truck hauling shrubs and 70 pounds of cocaine. ''It was parked there for quite a while,'' Michael Mordaga, a detective for the prosecutor's office, said at the time.
 Months earlier, officers had smelled marijuana and saw two men acting suspiciously in the Lombardi lot. They were hiding 18 pounds of marijuana in their trailer.
 And in 2000, officials seized 1,900 pounds of marijuana and 850 kilograms of cocaine with a street value of $100 million concealed amid rotting yellow peppers in a tractor trailer parked there.
 One of the more spectacular events occurred at the Walt Whitman rest stop near Camden in September 1998. A fugitive bank robber named Charles Rodriguez was fired on by some of about 90 police officers who had gathered there for a sting operation. Mr. Rodriguez and his crew, armed with armor-piercing bullets and bulletproof vests, were trying to rob an armored car. 
 On another recent Sunday, back at the Vince Lombardi rest stop, Russell Gray, a 43-year-old truck driver from Dallas, was standing outside a trucker lounge -- completed in 2005 -- and said that in his line of work, he had seen a lot of notorious types.
 ''A lot of hookers in these places,'' Mr. Gray said, as he scanned the lot. ''They call them 'lot lizards.' '' On this day, he saw none.
 In his book, Dr. Gillespie makes note of an anonymous student who claimed that she traded sex for rides to Rutgers. Gay Web sites offer unconfirmed tips on where to find potential rendezvous spots, although one site says the parkway seems to be a more popular place for that sort of activity.
 Back at the Thomas Edison stop, the entrepreneurial sunglass brothers say they often see undercover officers in the parking lot. They say they can tell because who else would hang around a rest area all day? 
 The brothers say they have also seen their share of bizarre occurrences, like the time a shoeless man charged into the building, staggered up to the Starbucks counter and shouted in Spanish, ''They're going to kill me!'' The brothers said the man, who looked as if he had been beaten, was taken away.
 On a far more serious note, state officials say that human trafficking is probably rampant on the turnpike.
 ''The New Jersey Turnpike, with a direct exit to Newark International Airport, is a well-known route for couriers of all forms of contraband, with smuggled and trafficked persons no doubt among them,'' a deputy state attorney general, Linda Rinaldi, wrote in the March edition of the magazine New Jersey Municipalities. 
 Some secrets are less racy.
 Christopher Haines, a 37-year-old doctor who grew up in Sewell was leaning against his Mercedes-Benz station wagon and holding his year-old son Charlie. 
 ''I grew up in Jersey,'' said Mr. Haines, who was on his way home to Philadelphia from Montauk, ''and there are very few benefits other than using the tricks on the turnpike.''
 Tricks? Well, traffic often moves more quickly in the truck and bus lanes. Savvy drivers also know that when traffic is bad, in say, the truck lane, getting off at a rest area and then re-entering a different lane can help avoid backups.
 The first two rest stops (Clara Barton and John Fenwick in Salem County, near the Delaware Memorial Bridge) were built in the 1950's at the birth of the turnpike. Since then, the number has expanded to 12, and officials recently said they were considering reopening two stops on the Newark Hudson Bay extension, Exits 14A-C.
 A 5,000-square-foot lounge for truckers, complete with $7 showers (cheap by truck stop standards), washers, driers and a large television room, opened last spring at the Vince Lombardi stop. Turnpike officials said that although they had considered converting an entire stop to a truck area, they chose to expand the Lombardi facility.
 Dr. Gillespie said the engineers who designed the rest stops were smart by putting them on the far right side of the road.
 ''At the Maryland Turnpike, it's a very poor design,'' he said. ''The rest stops are located in the center, which is more economical, but it's kind of crazy because you have to enter from the left.'' 
 These days, the turnpike rest stops are managed by the HMSHost Corporation of Bethesda, Md., a wholly owned subsidiary of Italian-based Autogrill, which pays the state $8.5 million a year for revenue from concession sales.
 For many travelers, rest stops are the price you pay for taking a trip. 
 ''I hate rest stops,'' declared 14-year-old Jordan Book of Denville as she entered the Molly Pitcher stop in Cranbury. 
 The reason? ''I just came back from Disney World,'' she said, ''and we went to a zillion rest stops.'' 
 ''And it kind of smells,'' added her 12-year old brother, Jeff. ''Like a urinal.'' Today, the Books were meeting another family on the way to Philadelphia and later a Black Eyed Peas concert in Camden. 
 ''This is a great place to meet people,'' joked Suzanne Baker, 41, a girlfriend of the children's father, Jon Book. 
 Not far away, the Wyman family emerged from the Starbucks. 
 ''Oh God!,'' said Liz Wyman, 43, of Falmouth, Me. ''All I can tell you is it's a hideous experience.'' 
 The automated faucets didn't work. The automated hand driers didn't work. She had to grab a woman to help her. Still, her husband, Steve Wyman, 42, said the stop was a vast improvement from years ago.
 ''I remember these rest stops from when I was in college,'' Mr. Wyman said. ''They were pretty primitive.''
 His wife was unconvinced. ''Well, I won't stop here again,'' she said.
 At the Joyce Kilmer stop in East Brunswick, Cathy Morrow pushed through the doors. She and six others were returning from a memorial service for her mother in Washington, and they had just been honked at as they searched for a parking spot.
 ''If we lived here, we'd probably be obnoxious,'' Ms. Morrow said to a companion.
 They had already hit the James Fenimore Cooper stop. ''There's six of us traveling,'' she sighed. ''There's six different bladders.''
 But passing into the Kilmer stop sent them into a reverie for the New Brunswick-born poet for whom the station was named. ''Joyce Kilmer made us think about her poem,'' she said, mistaking Mr. Kilmer's gender. 
 Indeed, her Kilmer was a little rusty: ''We didn't get past 'I think that I shall never see a poem as lovely ' ''

HEADLINE: Training to Work in the Home (Someone Else's)

BYLINE: By Joseph P. Fried. 
This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
WITH balloons hovering and relatives smiling, Johanny Tavarez, Hing Ting Chan and more than 30 other New York City residents recently received state certification to work in what labor experts say is America's 10th-fastest-growing occupation: personal and home care aide.
 But rather than going right to work in that vocation, the newly trained aides proceeded to further training for certification in an overlapping occupation requiring additional skills: home health aide, the fastest-growing occupation. 
The certification ceremony, held last month at the training center of the city's Department for the Aging in Lower Manhattan, was another step in filling the ranks of the two occupations. 
 The trainees had attended daily classes there for up to a month, learning the skills needed to work as certified personal and home care aides in New York. The additional training for the higher certification as home health aides was then provided by the caregiver agencies that hired them. With dual certification, they have a wider range of job opportunities.
 ''Home health aides might do some things that a personal care aide is not certified to do,'' said Rebecca Rodriguez, the director of the Department for the Aging's personal care aide program. 
 Both groups give elderly, disabled or sick people the help many need to live in their own homes rather than in nursing homes, or to leave hospitals sooner to convalesce at home. Personal and home care aides -- the government title for people often referred to as home attendants -- perform tasks like housekeeping, cooking and helping clients bathe, dress and groom. Home health aides do that as well as health-related tasks like monitoring blood pressure and respiration rates. ''A home health aide can change simple dressings,'' Ms. Rodriguez said, ''and hook up the nourishment to a feeding tube.'' 
 The growth predictions for the vocations mirror the coming sharp increase in the population of older Americans as the post-World War II baby-boom generation ages. The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the number of personal and home care aides will increase nationally to nearly one million in 2014 from about 700,000 in 2004, or more than 40 percent. The number of home health aides, it estimates, will expand in the same period to about 975,000 from nearly 625,000, a rise of about 55 percent.
 State labor agencies in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut say that 130,000 home health aides and 85,000 personal and home care aides worked in the three states in 2002, the last year for which statistics are available. The agencies foresee significant growth in both occupations in each state, including 46 percent more home health aides in New Jersey in 2012 than in 2002, and 34 percent more personal and home care aides in New York.
 Moreover, job openings nationally and regionally will significantly exceed those from expansion, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says, citing traditionally high turnover in the occupations, where the pay is low and the work often demanding. The bureau says that nationally, home health aides earned an average of $19,200 in 2004, and care aides $17,600.
 The federal government sets training standards for home health aides paid with Medicare or Medicaid funds, and state regulations for the training programs differ. Employment requirements for the personal and home care aides are not federally regulated, and vary from on-the-job training in some states to formal classes in others, like the 40 hours of instruction that New York requires for care aides who assist clients with personal hygiene, dressing and other activities. 
 The New York City Department for the Aging trains about 130 people a year as care aides, Ms. Rodriguez said. The classes are free. About 90 percent who attend are women, she said, and most trainees are welfare recipients referred by the city's Human Resources Administration. The others have lost jobs or want to change vocations. (Information about the program is available through the city's 311 help line.)
 Which brings us back to Hing Ting Chan, 55, of Manhattan. ''I was a seamstress for over 20 years,'' she said, ''but the factory closed.'' She said a friend told her about the training program.
 Ms. Tavarez, 39, of Queens, managed a restaurant that closed. She said she hoped that working as a home health aide would be a step toward another job. ''I'd like to be a nurse's assistant,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Through a Glass Brightly

BYLINE: By JOHN FREEMAN GILL

 BODY:
EDDIE CANTOR, one of the most popular singer-comedians of the first half of the 20th century, began his career as a Lower East Side orphan. By 1933, he was earning enough money as a movie and radio star to move his young family to a penthouse triplex in one of the Upper West Side's signature buildings: the twin-towered San Remo Apartments on Central Park West and 74th Street. 
 Not long after the move, his adventurous 7-year-old daughter, Janet, clambered up the outside of the colonnaded south tower, where she hung with one hand from a metal rung 27 stories above Central Park West until her terrified nanny coaxed her down.
About 17 years later, Janet was married and living in an apartment just around the corner, where she conceived a son named Brian Gari. 
 Mr. Gari, now a lanky 54-year-old with a salt-and-pepper beard, today has an overview of the ever-evolving Upper West Side that is, in its way, nearly as commanding as was his mother's perspective from atop that tower. A singer-songwriter by profession, Mr. Gari has made a passionate lifelong hobby of documenting the changing streetscape of the Upper West Side, where he has lived all but a few months of his life. His primary method has been to collect every moving image of the neighborhood he could get his hands on, all the way back to a 1910 Edison Company film of Columbus Circle, along with scores of still photographs and salvaged scraps of demolished theaters. 
 Mr. Gari's fascination with the neighborhood's relentless evolution early. In 1964, at age 12, he was so struck by the wholesale demolitions taking place in the name of urban renewal that he traveled up and down Amsterdam and Columbus Avenues with an eight-millimeter camera, shooting a shaky but evocative 10-minute film he called ''City Slickin'.'' 
 Twenty years later, as beloved theaters like the Loew's 83rd Street Quad were facing the wrecking ball, he grabbed a Betamovie camcorder and made another jostling photographic journey, this time down Broadway from West 91st Street past Columbus Circle. And ever since, each time he caught a film or video glimpse of the neighborhood, whether in a documentary of Rudolph Valentino's funeral at the Frank E. Campbell funeral home on Broadway in 1926 or a 1949 television episode of ''Candid Camera'' shot on West 103rd Street, he has saved them and ultimately digitized them for posterity. 

The Secrets of 'Naked City'
 ''I hardly pay attention to the stories,'' Mr. Gari said one recent afternoon as he fast-forwarded through a 1963 television episode of the police drama ''Naked City'' that was playing on a hulking 50-inch television screen in his bedroom. ''I'm looking for the Upper West Side.''
 He was sitting barefoot on a queen-size bed, surrounded by DVD's, film encyclopedias and photographs of his grandfather, in a rent-controlled apartment on West End Avenue near 92nd Street that has been his home since he moved there as a 12-year-old in 1964. 
 ''This is Riverside Drive and the 70's,'' he said, explaining that ''Naked City'' was often shot around there because its production supervisor, Hal Schaffel, the father of a classmate of Mr. Gari's, lived on West End Avenue.
 Noirish black-and-white images of a traffic accident and a murder whizzed past on the screen until Mr. Gari spotted the character Detective Adam Flint and his girlfriend coming out of a luncheonette called Steinberg's Dairy Restaurant, whose facade bore the number 2270. No street signs were visible.
 ''You see where this is?'' Mr. Gari asked excitedly. ''You see the reflection in the window? It's the Town Shop.'' He was referring to a celebrated lingerie store that opened in 1936 on the west side of Broadway near 82nd Street, and in 2002 moved three doors north on the same block. 
 Steinberg's was on the east side of Broadway, just across the street. On Mr. Gari's television screen the reflection in the restaurant's plate-glass window showed not only the reverse-image Art Deco sign of the Town Shop but also the shadowy reversed letters of Endicott Meats, which vanished from the street in 1989. 
 Twiddling his remote control, Mr. Gari froze the frame on fleeting images that revealed other 1963 shops on the east side of Broadway between 81st and 82nd Streets. North of Steinberg's stood Yee's Hand Laundry, a stationery shop, an unidentified store with prices in the window and a pizza place. These last two would be occupied from the mid-1970's to the early 1990's by Marvin Gardens, a popular restaurant. And today all these storefronts, including the Steinberg's site, are occupied by Laytner's Linen and Home. 
 ''If you want to go back in time,'' Mr. Gari declared giddily, ''this is the episode to do it with.''
 On the television screen, a dough-faced cabbie was trying to lure Detective Flint into a fistfight, but Mr. Gari didn't care about that. What really interested him was the mysterious shop on the northeast corner of West 82nd Street (the site today of a Liberty Travel agency) on whose sign he could only make out the letters ''West E.'' 
 ''West End?'' he asked aloud. ''A coffee shop, maybe?'' 
 Unsatisfied, Mr. Gari froze the detective show and bounded out of the room, returning moments later with a crumbling 1966 phone book (he has 40 years' worth of old directories), which he inspected with the intensity of a monk poring over a rare religious manuscript. 
 ''Aha!'' he finally announced. ''West End Fabrics.'' Mystery solved. 

Peeling Away the Present
 To spend hours watching Mr. Gari's moving images of the lost Upper West Side, and then to stroll along Broadway with him looking at today's storefronts, is to see the streetscape as an urban palimpsest, where remnants and recollections of the area's previous incarnations emerge unexpectedly, again and again, from beneath the current streetscape. The experience is like peering at the multilayered, weather-worn posters on a construction site's plywood fence, the top layer peeling away in places to reveal tantalizing scraps of the earlier images beneath it. 
 During an afternoon jaunt down Broadway, Mr. Gari stood outside a shiny Verizon Wireless store on the east side of the avenue near West 81st Street, a spot that in the 1963 ''Naked City'' episode was a bar and restaurant with a small metal awning. With a sweep of his hand, he pointed to other chain stores that in his opinion are robbing the Upper West Side of its individual character, making it increasingly less distinct from other neighborhoods. 
 On the west side of Broadway north of West 82nd Street, nearly the entire block -- home to at least seven shops in 1963, including a Plymouth clothing store and a Schrafft's -- was now taken up by Barnes & Noble and Talbots. On the southeast corner at 81st Street, the Italian Renaissance-style 1913 81st Street Theater building, where shows from vaudeville to ''Sesame Street'' were performed, was now occupied by what Mr. Gari sees as three prime examples of the Upper West Side's increasingly soulless homogenization. These are a Starbucks, a Staples and the lobby of the inevitable condominium, a high-rise built on the site of the old theater's auditorium, which had been a second structure located behind the surviving Broadway building.
 Mr. Gari gestured toward a few filled holes in the terra cotta on the building's corner, where a huge ''RKO Keith's 81st Street'' sign was once anchored. ''To lose that building is sacrilegious,'' Mr. Gari grumbled, referring to the renovation of its interior. ''It's historic, and now it's just been gutted, and all you've got is the shell.''

Stops Along the Subway Circuit
 Perhaps because of his grandfather's five-decade run as a star, first on New York's theatrical stages and then in its movie houses, Mr. Gari has always felt a particular pang of loss any time an Upper West Side theater disappears. He has episodes of ''Naked City'' showing the Loew's 83rd Street movie palace in 1961 and 1963, and in 1984 he captured the theater on video a few months before it was knocked down to make way for the Bromley condominium.
 After the theater's demolition, he poked around in the debris and found a certificate issued to the theater by the New York Edison Company in 1935. 
 ''It's trash to people,'' Mr. Gari said with a chuckle. ''But to me it's history.'' 
 Mr. Gari also rescued a heavy metal-and-glass ''Next Attraction'' sign from the New Yorker theater, on Broadway near 89th Street, as the revival house was being razed in 1985. And he picked up a video camera and ambled into the old Thalia theater, on 95th Street off Broadway, as that Art Deco theater was being gutted in 1999 -- until he was chased out by a beefy worker. 
 Among the places Eddie Cantor performed were theaters on the so-called Subway Circuit, which booked shows after their Broadway runs. One theater on the circuit was the Standard, later called the Stoddard, which was built in 1914 at 90th Street and Broadway. By the 1960's, the theater had become a supermarket, its marquee used to advertise specials on lobster tails and steer liver, as shown in documentary images Mr. Gari obtained from CBS. 
 After the supermarket, which had become a Food Emporium, was demolished in the mid-80's to make way for the New West apartment building and a new Food Emporium, Mr. Gari waded into the rubble. He emerged with a surprising vestige of the market's former incarnation: a 1961 form issued to the Stoddard Theater by the Workmen's Compensation Board. 
 But if the theater was once part of the Subway Circuit, where was the subway? Mr. Gari discovered the answer to that question in 1971, when he spotted a phantom platform and token booth while hurtling south on the subway from the 96th Street stop. For half a century beginning in 1904, the local IRT train stopped at Broadway and 91st Street, but as trains became longer, some stations were lengthened and others closed. The 91st Street station, rendered obsolete by the extension of the 96th Street platform, was shut down in 1959.
 Standing on the northwest corner of West 91st Street and Broadway, Mr. Gari held up a 1940 photograph showing an ornate subway kiosk on that very spot. ''Wanna see?'' he asked, pointing to a small grate in the pavement. ''This is what's left of the 91st Street station.'' In the murk below the grate, one could make out an abandoned, dead-end staircase. ''Buried,'' Mr. Gari declared darkly. 
 One block downtown, Mr. Gari stood in front of the City Diner, previously the Argo coffee shop, on the northwest corner of Broadway and 90th Street. Buttoning up his TV Land jacket for warmth, he recalled a 1961 ''Naked City'' scene, shot north across 90th Street from the Standard Theater building, that showed a restaurant on the corner called Stark's. With a grin, he pointed out bolt holes still visible on City Diner's facade, beneath which could be discerned the all but invisible outline of the words Stark's Fine Foods.

In Search of a Personal Past
 Mr. Gari has produced 13 CD's of performances by his grandfather, and as he has delved into Mr. Cantor's life, he has been surprised to discover how often he himself has unwittingly trod the same Upper West Side turf that his grandfather did.
 In 1963, as a sixth grader at the McBurney School on West 63rd Street, Mr. Gari cut gym for months to watch ''The Price Is Right,'' the television game show, as it was telecast up the street at the Colonial Theater on Broadway, north of West 62nd Street. Only years later did he learn that his grandfather performed there as far back as 1911, the year after Charlie Chaplin made his American debut on its stage. (The Colonial has since vanished and is now a nondescript public space called Harmony Atrium.) 
 When ''The Price Is Right'' moved to the Ritz Theater on West 48th Street, Mr. Gari followed, still regularly cutting gym. By coincidence, when his career led him to follow his grandfather to Broadway 23 years later, it was at the Ritz that ''Late Night Comic,'' a short-lived 1987 musical for which Mr. Gari wrote the music and lyrics, was performed. Mr. Gari's account of the musical's bumpy production, ''We Bombed in New London,'' will be published in July. 

'You'll Be the One'
 A few months before he died in 1964, Mr. Cantor wrote a letter to his grandson, then 12, that Mr. Gari says provided a lift of creativity that would determine the direction of his life. 
 After expressing his eagerness to see his grandson's film of the West Side, Mr. Cantor wrote: ''From all appearances, it seems to me, you'll be the one to carry on the tradition of show business in the family.'' In October, the month his grandfather died, Mr. Gari wrote his first song. By the age of 15 he was traveling around the city by bus, selling his tunes to music publishers for $50 a pop. 
 One of the publishers he sometimes visited had its offices in the modern tower at 10 Columbus Circle (which, along with the adjoining New York Coliseum, was demolished in 2000 to make way for the Time Warner Center). More than three decades would pass before Mr. Gari discovered just how much meaning that site has held for his family across three generations. 
 About five years ago, Mr. Gari explained the other day as he walked in the shadow of the blue-glass Time Warner complex, someone told him that his grandfather regularly served as host of the NBC variety show ''The Colgate Comedy Hour,'' which was broadcast live from Columbus Circle. Mr. Gari's father, an actor and dancer named Roberto Gari, also performed in the show.
 ''The weird thing is,'' the son said, ''it didn't make sense to me, because I only knew Columbus Circle as post-1956.'' The notion of a theater there seemed mistaken. 
 Then, four years ago, Mr. Gari had an epiphany while watching a 1954 Judy Holliday film called ''It Should Happen to You!'' In the movie, Holliday's character decides to have her name painted in giant letters on a billboard in Columbus Circle. And there, just south of the billboard, on the spot that in 1956 would become 10 Columbus Circle, could be seen the marquee of the International Theater, from which Mr. Cantor's highly rated television program was beamed to a national audience during the 1950-51 season. 
 ''It was so important to me,'' Mr. Gari said, ''because I got to see a living, breathing picture of how this block looked with a theater here.'' 
 Squinting with distaste at the gleaming 21st-century Time Warner Center, Mr. Gari pointed in the general direction of Stuart Weitzman, a shoe and handbag boutique on the ground floor. 
 ''Right over there is where my grandfather did his show,'' he muttered. He wandered into the shiny mall inside the complex, then emerged a few minutes later with fresh evidence of just how mercilessly the city can expunge its past.
 ''Borders,'' he said ruefully, ''doesn't even carry an Eddie Cantor CD.''

HEADLINE: A Flag Not Everyone Is Rallying Around

BYLINE: By SAKI KNAFO

 BODY:
At Paddy Duggans Pub, a snug drinking spot on Greenpoint Avenue in Sunnyside, Queens, a clutch of middle-aged men sat at a corner of the bar on a recent evening nursing bottles of American beer and pints of Guinness. Between sips, an Irish carpenter named John Murphy swept his hand toward a row of empty stools. 
 ''In the last three years,'' he said in a heavy brogue, ''this place is dead for the Irish.''
Mr. Murphy was referring not only to the bar but also to the Celtic enclave of Sunnyside. Like many Irish immigrants, he has recently seen droves of friends leave the United States, something that he attributes not only to a now-prosperous Ireland but also to the hardships facing illegal immigrants in this country. But when he was asked about the large immigration rallies in Queens this month, his angular face took on a dour expression. ''They're turning people against us,'' he said bitterly.
 Nearly two weeks ago, tens of thousands of immigrants in New York, along with those nationwide, demonstrated against proposed legislation that aims to toughen measures against illegal immigration. In a gesture of solidarity, many immigrant shopkeepers closed their businesses for the day. But within the Irish community, these tactics met with overwhelming disapproval.
 ''We don't know how many times you have to put people out in the streets to make a point,'' said Niall O'Dowd, chairman of the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform and publisher of The Irish Voice. ''The backlash is a very real notion.''
 The marches in New York were dominated by Latinos, as are many commercial stretches in the traditional Irish strongholds of Sunnyside and neighboring Woodside, which have seen an influx of immigrants from Central and South America in the last two decades. The local demographics reflect a global story: a booming Irish job market is drawing Irish immigrants back home, while some Latin-American economies are faltering. 
 On Roosevelt Avenue, in the shadows of the elevated platform for the No. 7 train, Colombian cafeterias and Argentine bakeries sit next door to Irish pubs and grocery stores. Yet the proximity of these businesses only accentuates the lack of solidarity between the different groups of immigrants who run them and frequent them. On May 1, for example, the day of the protests, Paddy Duggans was serving the usual Guinness, while the Mexican restaurant beside it had its doors bolted shut. SAKI KNAFO

HEADLINE: In Wake of Casinos, Suburbs Mushroom 

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS

DATELINE: OCEAN CITY 

 BODY:
JIM PESSOLANO was in the appliance business in Atlantic City 28 years ago, when the first dice were rolled and the first playing cards shuffled at the Resorts International casino there. He and his wife, Elizabeth, grew up in this quiet beach town just south of Atlantic City, its flashy neighbor to the north, during the Depression and returned there after World War II.
 ''Atlantic City was dying,'' before the casino's arrived, the 81-year-old Mr. Pessolano said. ''There was really nothing there. Living in Ocean City, well, you didn't have to be rich to do it. My wife worked for New Jersey Bell and I was managing the appliance store and we could just live here on the bay.''
 A generation later, Mr. Pessolano said, many of their contemporaries have cashed out -- some for hundreds of thousands of dollars and other for millions -- and either moved inland or left the region. 
 ''You can't discount all those jobs in the casinos and related to them,'' as a factor in driving up real estate prices, he said, noting that several of the younger generation in his family have held summer jobs or full-time positions in the casinos. ''It has given everyone a boost.''
 While much has been made about how the casinos have transformed Atlantic City -- long a tattered and tired resort whose year-round population has remained about 40,000 since Resorts opened in May 1978 -- less noticed but equally startling has been how the gambling industry, with its tens of thousands of employees, has significantly altered the landscape of what were once sparsely populated communities on the mainland as well as down the shore and in Brigantine, to the north. 
 In 1980, Hamilton Township was home to 9,499 people, according to the census; 20 years later, that population had grown to 20,499. Galloway Township, which had 12,176 residents in 1980, nearly tripled to 31,209 by 2000. 
 And Egg Harbor Township, which starts just across Lake's Bay from Atlantic City and had 19,381 residents in 1980, had an estimated population of 37,000 in 2004 and is likely to soon surpass Atlantic City as the most populous town in Atlantic County. 
 Everyone attributes the sharp increase in population to the casinos, but many residents of those once-sleepy communities are not pleased with the sweeping changes.
 ''Every time a new casino comes to Atlantic City, I shudder and think that it is not a good thing for Egg Harbor Township,'' said James J. McCullough, who has been the township's mayor for 17 of the last 20 years. ''When I hear that some casino is building a 500-room tower, I know we will get more homes, too many homes, with no state aid for infrastructure and yet another school to build in a couple of years.
 ''Some growth is O.K.,'' Mayor McCullough added, ''but too much, too fast is just changing this community too quickly.''
 Joseph Kelly, the president of the Atlantic City Regional Mainland Chamber of Commerce, said that while he empathizes with Mr. McCullough, he is still happy to be saddled with the Atlantic City area's problems.

Problems, but Jobs
 ''The issues are real -- the lack of adequate transportation, the effects that all this has on our schools,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''At the same time, I would rather be managing growth than managing decline. A plant closure with 5,000 people out of work or having to pass another school bond, which would you rather have? I would much rather worry about getting better roads and schools than rampant unemployment. That is what the casinos have changed for us here.''
 Jeffrey Vasser, the son of a former Miss Atlantic City, who grew up in Margate -- which shares Absecon Island with Atlantic City as well as with Ventnor and Longport -- said that when the casinos started opening in the late 1970's, his family benefited greatly.
 ''My mother was there at the opening of Resorts as a dealer, a widow with five kids,'' said Mr. Vasser, who today is the executive director of the Atlantic City Convention and Visitors Authority. ''She was making $40,000 a year in the late 1970's, which was really good money, where there were no jobs like that before. The opening of casinos made a world of difference to my family and many others.'' Mr. Vasser, who left the area in 1982 and returned four years ago to run the authority, now lives in Linwood, one of the more prestigious suburban towns on the mainland east of Atlantic City, but a place that was an afterthought when he was growing up.
 ''When I was young, the islands were the center of the universe,'' he said. ''There were not many people living in places like Egg Harbor Township or Linwood, and even then they were isolated and you didn't know them. Now, I find that Linwood is Margate west, so many of my old neighbors live there. It's the natural outgrowth of what has happened here, and there are now so many ancillary jobs, people who grew up here can stick around.''
 It was surely not that way in the early and mid-1970's.
 ''I moved to Atlantic County from upstate New York in 1977,'' said Michael Franks, a professor of psychology at The Richard Stockton College of New Jersey in Pomona, who has studied the casino industry here since its inception. ''The year prior, there was not one commercial permit to build in the entire county. Think about that. As a direct result of casinos, which came in two years later, the entire southern region of New Jersey has profited enormously.''

Driving a Gantlet
 When leaving Atlantic City and heading north, a driver can go through the gantlet of three sprawling townships: Galloway to the north of the Atlantic City Expressway, Egg Harbor to the south and Hamilton a little off to the west. The proliferation of upscale tract homes and strip shopping centers has given the region a look that is similar to many of the exurban communities that have sprouted up across the country over the last 20 years.
 ''Some would say it hasn't been a good thing,'' added Dr. Franks, who also studies pathological gambling. ''But, look, Atlantic County has a sewer system now. Most of it was just septic tanks then. This area was nowhere.''
 Dr. Franks said he bought his first house in Galloway Township when it seemed like the area had no amenities and was just acre after acre of scrub pine.
 ''When you buy your first house, you think you spend your whole life at the home improvement store because you are always fixing up,'' he said. 
 ''Well, one day, I'm coming home from the Home Depot, or whatever, and I can't find my house. There were no street lights anywhere. That's how it was. There were no services, no infrastructure, few schools. Now, for better or worse, we are suburban.''

A Plan
 In the aftermath of the success of the early casinos, the New Jersey Pinelands Commission set up areas near Atlantic City where growth was encouraged and others where it was restricted. 
 At the time, it seemed like a win-win situation. Either towns were able to build and benefit from taxable properties -- as happened in Egg Harbor, Galloway, and Hamilton Townships -- or, like Port Republic and other towns farther inland, to allow large swaths to remain undeveloped.
 But Mr. McCullough said the plan eventually became too much of what at first seemed like a good thing.
 ''The problem is that the state, through the Pinelands Act, forces the growth into our towns and then doesn't provide us the wherewithal for schools and infrastructure and so forth,'' he said, noting that if current growth patterns continue, Egg Harbor Township could well have 33,000 homes -- the maximum permitted under the Pinelands Act. 
 Mr. McCullough added that when that day comes, the township population will have at least doubled and presumably surpassed Camden -- with a population of almost 80,000 -- as the largest community in South Jersey.
 ''We are building a school every three years, and that isn't the biggest part of it, staffing is,'' he said. ''We have to go find all these teachers, and you want them all to be good.''
 Looked at another way, there are 7,793 students in the Egg Harbor Township Schools now, compared with 4,641 a decade ago. And of course, those students do not spend all of their time in the classroom.
 ''I went to throw out the first ball for softball and Little League and there were 1,500 kids signed up,'' Mr. McCullough said. ''That's good, but it is too much, too fast here. People came to a place with forests of trees and were used to seeing deer and all that kind of stuff. Now the only deer you see are smashed on the side of the road.''
 On the other hand, he said, the housing stock in Egg Harbor Township has improved.

Big Houses, Big Prices
 ''Who ever thought people would be paying $450,000 to live in a house here, or that houses would be so big?'' Mr. McCullough said. 
 Yet many of his friends and former neighbors have fled the prosperity and the flood of new residents, moving to states like Delaware and South Carolina -- not so much because they are cheaper, but rather because they more closely resemble the rural, sparsely populated area that Atlantic County used to be.
 Harry Brown has decided to have it both ways. Last year, Mr. Brown retired from his job as a computer analyst at the Federal Aviation Administration complex in Pomona. He sold his house in Brigantine -- an island community just to the north of Atlantic City -- where he and his family had lived since 1969, and now owns a condominium in Key Colony Beach, Fla., where he and his wife spend the winter, and another in nearby Linwood, where they can be near their family during the summer.
 ''Brigantine was a quiet little town when we came there,'' the 68-year-old Mr. Brown said. ''There was only one way on the island, a two-lane drawbridge. Casinos came and it got busy. They finally had to replace the bridge and put in traffic lights. Lots of casino workers came to live here, but I guess they mostly rented, because we didn't know many of them. As time went on, though, I thought it became more of a Las Vegas culture, which I didn't like.''
 Richard Perniciaro, director of the Center for Regional and Business Research at Atlantic Cape Community College, said Mr. Brown's perceptions were pretty accurate, noting that casino employees are a transient group.
 Indeed, Dr. Perniciaro estimated that 20 to 25 percent of the casino work force turns over every year.
 ''That means that at least 10,000 employees come and go on a yearly basis,'' he said. ''On the other hand, the jobs are no longer seasonal. It used to be that most jobs at the Shore were four or five months at best.
 ''It has become a year-round economy,'' he said, ''but many of the jobs pay $10 an hour and have shift work, so they turn over much more rapidly than other kinds of work.''
 The other wave of growth -- prosperous middle-aged people desirous of second homes at the shore -- has also affected housing prices, Dr. Perniciaro said, driving those $10-an-hour and even $20-an-hour casino workers farther and farther from Atlantic City.

Exporting Poverty
 For instance, Buena, a rural community in the far western margins of Atlantic County, about an hour's drive from the casinos, now has the highest poverty rate in the county, according to Dr. Perniciaro's research, and is populated more and more by low-paid casino employees.
 ''Even though the casinos tout that they employ so many people now, it is probably more like 43,000 than 50,000, and since they had 48,000 in 1991, and the Borgata has opened since then, I think you would have to say the employment situation has been stagnant for a long time,'' he said. 
 On the other hand, Dr. Perniciaro noted, most of the jobs lost were lower-paying positions, adding that there are more executives, managers and dealers and fewer valet parkers and coin-changers.
 Dr. Perniciaro said that wages are likely to go up for lower-paid casino workers because the economy has been strong and because of the lack of affordable housing close to Atlantic City.
 Not surprisingly, the surge in population has resulted in bigger traffic problems as well.
 ''In Galloway, where I live, when I bought my house in 1992, for me to make the five-and-a-half-mile commute, there were 5 traffic lights; now there are 14,'' said Joe Weinert, a former reporter at The Press of Atlantic City who now works for the Spectrum Gaming Group, a consulting firm.
 ''I look on my kid's soccer team and the coach can make all the evening practices, but for him to make the noon games without being really tired is sometimes difficult, because he works the graveyard shift at the casino. I hear my neighbors leaving for work at 12:30 a.m. sometimes and coming home at 4 a.m., so there can be traffic at any time.
 ''That means there is somewhat of a 24-hour community here,'' Mr. Weinert went on. ''You can definitely find a gym, say, to go to in the middle of the night. Chances are there will be a casino worker on a treadmill when you get there.''

Stagnation, Then a Shift
 Towns like Absecon and Pleasantville -- situated just outside Atlantic City along Routes 9, 30 and 40 -- underwent a period of stagnation and watched their downtowns deteriorate after the casinos opened. 
 Yet lately they have slowly been picking up new tenants like accounting and law firms and other service-oriented businesses because of their convenient location in Atlantic County.
 ''In the long run, all of this may be good, because it will bring more people into the middle class here,'' Dr. Perniciaro said. 
 As for casino executives, he said that some of them commute from as far away as Haddonfield or even Princeton.
 ''Those who want a downtown kind of feel aren't going to get it in Linwood or Galloway or Egg Harbor and are willing to commute an hour each way,'' he said. ''Some, though fewer, live in places like Ocean City, but they are shying away from that if they have kids, since the school population and year-round housing there has dwindled as more island properties become second or retirement homes.''
 As Larry Mullen, the president of the Borgata, the newest hotel and casino, put it, ''Yes, I know more and more of our employees live further away.'' 
 He then boasted: ''Tell me a thriving industry that doesn't have most of its employees commuting a half-hour, and ours is often commuting through beautiful pines or the beach. Who could complain about that?''

HEADLINE: Adding More Urban To Suburbia

BYLINE: By DEBRA WEST

 BODY:
THIS winter the Brookings Institution said in a study that the nation's oldest suburbs were growing older and poorer, and were sure to face challenges that come with a dilapidated housing stock and deteriorating infrastructure. 
 Perhaps the institute should take a second look at Westchester.
From New Rochelle to Yonkers to White Plains, the county's first suburbs are undergoing a transformation that rivals the urban renewal efforts of the 1960's. This time around, the engines of renewal are luxury residential skyscrapers and gleaming retail galleries, skyline views and stainless steel appliances. 
 ''The 50's and 60's suburban ideal was 'You don't want to live anywhere near a storefront, you want to get as far away as possible from commercial development,' '' said Brian J. Nickerson, director of the Michaelian Institute for Public Policy and Management at Pace University. ''Now, you want to live above the storefront.'' 
 And you want to live well. Westchester's new skyscraper condos are generally built with one-and two-bedroom apartments, outfitted with marble baths, granite counters and amenities like indoor and outdoor pools, tennis courts, valet parking and concierge service. The target market for these condominiums are young professionals who commute to Manhattan and have no children, or older couples who are downsizing and want something easier to maintain and often more sumptuous than a house, Dr. Nickerson said. 
 But weren't the suburbs the land of minivans and soccer moms? Weren't they populated by families who wanted to give their children backyards to play in and trees to climb? Beaver Cleaver, make room for new urbanism.
 New Rochelle, the commuter suburb of Rob and Laura Petrie, is now on track for a glamorous downtown makeover. More than 2,000 high-end apartments -- condos, co-ops or market-rate rentals -- have been built or are being planned within blocks of the train station. 
 In Yonkers, a $3.1 billion downtown redevelopment plan envisions residences, offices, stores and a minor league ballpark on 450 acres between the Hudson riverfront and the Saw Mill River Parkway. That is in the same southwest Yonkers neighborhood in which the city was once accused of warehousing the poor -- the spark that ignited the Yonkers desegregation crisis. 
 And, of course, the new White Plains is leading the renaissance. At the intersection of Mamaroneck Avenue and Main Street, there are now six residential towers vying with one another for a mark on the skyline. The projects, some planned and others already built, range in height from 22 to 40 stories. Some apartments are rentals, but most are condominiums that start around $700,000 for a one bedroom and run as high as $2.9 million for a four-bedroom penthouse. 
 ''The discussion and debate these days is 'Are you taking suburban areas and turning them into cities?' '' said Richard V. Guardino Jr., dean of the Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra. ''And, are the suburbs around New York City going to be places that the middle class will be able to afford?''
 In the new urbanist suburb, perhaps the middle class need not apply. To buy a $700,000 apartment with a typical 20 percent down payment requires an income of $170,000, Dr. Nickerson said. 
 Craig King, commissioner of development for New Rochelle, said his city was wary of shutting out the middle class. In fact, the City Council adopted a rule in April requiring that 10 percent of any new development be set aside for affordable housing. But Mr. King said most of the current projects were planned before the law took effect and will not have to comply with the rule.
 ''It's becoming a community of very wealthy people and very poor people,'' he said. ''Our concern was that we provide for workforce housing for teachers and firefighters and police officers. We didn't want a situation where teachers are teaching children of hedge-fund managers but can't afford to live in the community where they work. Most other communities in Westchester have no affordable housing requirement at all, or they require much less.''
 Affordable housing, under New Rochelle's guidelines, would be a rental apartment for about $2,300 a month for a family of four, or a condo sale of $250,000 to $325,000.
 Noam Bramson, the mayor of New Rochelle, expressed delight about the new developments, which he said were by and large being built without displacing existing residents and were bringing new life and an increased tax base to the city. 
 New urbanism has been touted by planning professionals for decades as the antisprawl ideal for development. It uses existing infrastructure, is built near public transportation so that people will need to drive cars less and creates walkable, mixed-use communities. 
 ''I believe it will be a better, more vibrant and more economically viable community,'' Mr. Bramson said. ''We need urban density and scale in our downtown. In the neighborhoods outside of the downtown, we need to preserve and protect the suburban way of life.''
 But Melvin Burruss, a lawyer who is president of the African American Men of Westchester, an advocacy group, is concerned that African-Americans who have stayed in Westchester's urban areas through hard times could be displaced now. 
 ''This is happening in so many places at once and so fast, that it was only at our last meeting we discussed that we better stand up and have a voice in this,'' said Mr. Burruss, who lives in Peekskill. ''The affordable units are not there; it's all luxury. We are concerned that there will be relocation, that people will be pushed out, just like the urban renewal of White Plains in the past.''
 ''Another concern is employment,'' he added. ''You don't see African-Americans on the job sites. Neither the unions nor the employers are trying to put them on there. And what about opportunities for vendors? The municipalities should be requiring that African-American vendors are used. With all this development, black folks are simply not there.'' 
 Paula F. Piekos, a teacher who grew up in White Plains and recently returned to care for an ailing parent, questions whether the development will help or hurt her city. She wonders if construction is being carried out in an environmentally sensitive manner and whether the existing infrastructure will have to be upgraded -- at taxpayers' expense -- to accommodate the new residents.
 ''St. Agnes Hospital closed, Union Hospital closed, if there is an emergency and all of these people are rushing to White Plains Hospital, will they be able to handle it?'' Ms. Piekos asked. ''And, these tall buildings were supposed to keep our taxes low, but our taxes are going up anyway.''
 No one is more of a champion of new urbanism than Louis R. Cappelli, the Westchester developer who reignited downtown New Rochelle with the 1999 opening of New Roc City, an entertainment complex that was the first investment of confidence in an urban neighborhood in Westchester in some time. He soon followed up with the City Center project in White Plains, and now he is all over the Westchester map, with new projects in New Rochelle, White Plains and Yonkers (to name a few).
 ''It took a couple of guys to go downtown and say, 'I made some money,' '' said Geoff Thompson, a spokesman for Mr. Cappelli. ''Then smart guys follow the smart money. Now they all want to build downtown.'' 
 Even Yonkers, a city scarred by a desegregation crisis and urban blight, is finally making a comeback, Mayor Philip A. Amicone said. In February the city announced the redevelopment deal that signals its first resurgence since the 1960's -- when the manufacturing companies that were its largest employers left and the long downhill slide began. 
 ''We are getting some of the best developers in the county coming into Yonkers and redeveloping not only the waterfront -- that's the easy part -- but inland, too,'' Mr. Amicone said. 
 The development team also includes Struever Brothers Eccles & Rouse, which redesigned the Baltimore waterfront, and Fidelco Realty Group of Millburn, N.J. 
 The plan would encompass two miles of Yonkers waterfront and the entire business district. It would run inland across Nepperhan and Yonkers Avenues.
 This is not a project that would bulldoze and rebuild the entire neighborhood as in earlier urban renewal efforts. Instead, properties would be evaluated individually. Some would remain while others would be replaced, said David Simpson, a spokesman for Mr. Amicone.
 The first phase of the redevelopment, called the Gateway District, would include 800 condominium or rental apartments towering over 750,000 square feet of retail, office and entertainment space and overlooking a baseball stadium to be built on top of a parking garage near City Hall. Later, housing and an esplanade would be developed on 10 blocks of riverfront, the Saw Mill River would be uncovered, or ''daylighted,'' and residential and retail development would sprout near the Metro North Ludlow Station.
 Debra Cohen, a lawyer who has represented a group of concerned business owners in downtown Yonkers, said she thought the city planners had learned a lesson from previous development efforts -- like the Ridge Hill project, near the New York State Thruway -- which minimized public input and then ran into fierce opposition and lengthy litigation.
 ''As soon as the downtown development was announced,'' Ms. Cohen said, ''every other word out of the developers' and city officials' mouths was 'the community.' It remains to be seen how they are going to walk the walk, but they have learned to talk the talk.'' 
 She said her hope was that veterans of hard times in Yonkers would benefit in the good times.
 ''Increasing revenues is only one way to judge if a development is successful,'' she pointed out. ''The longtime residents who live here and have been raising families, sometimes under difficult circumstances and sometimes for generations, the development has to work for them, too.'' 
 Mr. Amicone says he shares that concern. 
 ''We're not displacing people,'' he said. ''The people who are here are going to be able to stay here, and we're going to bring in wealthier people, too. We're going to elevate Yonkers back to where it was.'' 
 There is an eminent domain provision in the plans, but the developers do not intend to ask the city to employ it, said Mr. Thompson, the Cappelli spokesman. They would rather negotiate with owners directly to buy properties, he said.
 In White Plains, which jump-started the new urbanism with the opening of the City Center development on Main Street in 2004, residents said they would urge other communities to proceed slowly when embarking on large redevelopment plans.
 Dan Seidel, a lawyer, moved to White Plains 25 years ago and rues some changes that have resulted from the development: traffic and parking problems; buildings that rise high above the tree line; even, he says, an increase in the price of lunch. 
 Mr. Seidel's main objection: He thinks the city has given away too many perquisites to developers without getting enough return.
 ''They set 6 percent as the limit for affordable housing,'' he said, ''but then developers can buy out of the program by paying a fee, which the city can put toward other affordable housing projects, maybe in another part of the city. To me it's clearly economic racism.'' 
 White Plains announced last month that a six-story apartment building with 50 rental apartments would meet the requirement for affordable housing for all six of the towers built near the intersection of Mamaroneck Avenue and Main Street. 

A Gracious Plenty? Or a Glut?
 IN White Plains, two luxury towers are already built and more are on the way. 
 At one tower, City Center, the 311 apartments rent from about $2,200 for a one bedroom to $4,800 for a three bedroom. While next door at Trump Tower, the 212 condos sold out within a year, several that were bought for investment are now back on the market. Recent listings run from about $700,000 for a one-bedroom unit to $1.8 million for a two-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath unit.
 The first 11 stories in one of the two 40-story towers in the new Renaissance Square, also in White Plains, will be a full-service hotel. The next few stories in that tower will be condominiums that offer hotel services. Topping those will be 200 condominium apartments. The second Renaissance Square tower will likely be a mix of offices and residences, but those plans could change. And plans were approved last month for the Pinnacle, two 22-story towers designed by the architect Michael Graves. With a total of 139 condominiums, prices are expected to run from $500,000 for a one-bedroom unit to $2.9 million for a four-bedroom penthouse.
 In New Rochelle, Avalon on the Sound, a 412-unit luxury rental apartment building, opened in 2001 across from the train station. A second phase of Avalon with 600 units is expected to open next year. 
 With more than 2,000 apartments and condos expected to be built in the next five years, New Rochelle's future development will dwarf everything that has come so far, Mayor Noam Bramson said. The plans include: Davenport Lofts, 70 live-work luxury condos; and Trump Plaza and LeCount Square, another Cappelli/Trump residential venture. Also, at a site referred to as the Church/Division Street Garage, 400 condominium units are planned and at New Roc City, the rental apartments above the parking garage are being converted into co-ops.
 In Yonkers, Hudson Park, the first residential redevelopment project in years, opened in 2004 next to the train station. The old Trolley Barn has been converted into SoHo-style lofts with 21-foot ceilings. Also in Yonkers, 800 units of luxury condominiums are planned in the first phase of the $3.1 billion improvement plan. DEBRA WEST

HEADLINE: Commuters, Sprawl And the Tappan Zee

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''The Tappan Zee Divide'' (May 7): The tenacious vitality of the New York region owes this century-long debt to our subway and commuter rail network: downtowns of great economic power and outlying train-station townships of idyllic charm. For our region, the emerging car-to-work trip is a destructive anomaly, and the Tappan Zee Bridge discussion should not focus on mitigating existing trip conditions or expanding auto trip patterns that foster sprawl. 
To serve future jobs and new families, a rail system instead should be put in place, supplemented by local zoning and land use regulations, to promote development around mass transit in the Interstate 287 corridor and to create train-station communities in the growing outer counties. 
 We need to use our access infrastructure investments to shape our future. This may be the last time for the next 50 years we can return to the intelligent planning models of our past, so let's do it now.

HEADLINE: The Pipes Carry Clout With the Oil

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
AS energy-rich countries feel empowered by high oil prices, they are increasingly using a blunt instrument to make their influence felt. Call it the power of the pipeline.
 New, superlong pipelines are planned for South America, the Middle East, Russia and Africa, and oil-producing countries are using them to forge political alliances, punish foes and extract concessions from customers.
''Pipelines mean political leverage,'' said Frank A. Verrastro, the director of the energy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. 
 On a recent visit to Lithuania, Vice President Dick Cheney lambasted Russia for using oil and natural gas as ''tools of intimidation and blackmail.'' Later, on a stopover in Kazakhstan, he urged energy-rich Central Asian nations to bypass Russia altogether when considering pipeline routes to the West.
 President Vladimir V. Putin himself made energy security a theme this year in talks with other industrialized nations. But on the day it took over the presidency of the Group of Eight, Russia cut off natural gas supplies to Ukraine over a price dispute, freezing out both its independent-minded neighbor as well as the European Union in the dead of winter. 
 In the end, a compromise was reached and Ukraine agreed to pay more for its gas, until then subsidized by Russia. But Russia's neighbors also learned a shocking new reality: whoever controls the taps also holds the upper hand. 
 Transnational pipelines have been around for more than a century, but with low prices and supplies aplenty, they had lost much of their strategic significance over time. Supertankers, first built in the early 1950's, allowed producers to ship anywhere around the world, and freed consumers from the whims of a single seller. About two-thirds of the oil trade is now carried by tankers.
 But matters have changed in recent years: higher demand has put pressure on energy networks, supplies have had trouble catching up with consumption, and tensions have risen. Today, every drop counts.
 ''Pipelines play a critical role in an age of increased tightness in energy markets, terrorist threats to energy infrastructure, and political use of energy resources,'' said Anne Korin, the co-director of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security, a research center based in Washington. 
 Consider the case of Iran, which wants to build a natural gas pipeline to India and is even considering extending the route all the way to China. The project, spanning about 1,600 miles at a cost of $7 billion, would provide Iran with a large market for its substantial gas reserves while helping India meet its growing energy needs. The pipeline would also add to Iran's political clout. 
 There are drawbacks. The pipeline must run through Pakistan's Baluchistan region, a prospect that worries India given the area's history of lawlessness. 
 And while Pakistan's current leaders welcome the proposed route because they would also benefit from Iranian gas, a pipeline might afford future governments with a vital means of pressuring India. The United States also strongly opposes the plan. ''The last thing the United States wants is for India to be in Iran's debt,'' Ms. Korin said.
 None of this has been lost on Hugo Chavez, the president of Venezuela, who persuaded his neighbors to look at a 6,000-mile pipeline linking his country to Brazil and Argentina. He has named it El Gran Gasoducto del Sur, the Great Gas Pipeline of the South. With a potential cost of $23 billion, the proposal makes little economic sense; it would be much cheaper to build liquefaction terminals and ship the gas by tankers. 
 But Mr. Chavez's plan is not only meant to transport gas; it also carries a political message. The pipeline should be ''considered one of the fundamental steps to South America's integration,'' according to Petroleos de Venezuela, the state oil company. 
 Russia has been particularly adept at balancing its economic needs and its role as an energy superpower. 
 When considering an oil pipeline to the Sea of Japan or straight to China, Russian energy officials waited for two years before committing themselves. China was initially favored, but after much dithering, Russia picked the longer and costlier option to its eastern seaport of Nakhodka, instead of the Chinese route to Daqing. The reason: the plan allows oil exports to Japan as well as to other potential markets, including the United States and eventually China as well. 
 Then there is the matter of what Mr. Cheney called ''blackmail.'' 
 Last month, President Putin suggested that Russia might redirect future exports to Asia instead of Europe because of what he called ''unprincipled competition'' blocking the expansion of Gazprom, Russia's biggest energy company, in Europe.
 ''To the extent that you are concerned that countries like Russia might be using energy as political tools, one of the best ways to protect yourself is to create alternate pathways to move energy to markets,'' said Steven Pifer, a deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs from 2001 to 2004. 
 In the 1990's, that sort of thinking led energy planners in the United States to support construction of a pipeline to carry oil from the vast reserves of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, which are all landlocked around the Caspian Sea, through Turkey, while avoiding Russia to the north, as well as Iran, which would have provided the shortest route, to the south. 
 ''In all these cases,'' Ms. Korin said, ''you have a big problem with Central Asia, where there is lots of energy but few politically pleasant and unproblematic ways to get the supplies out if you don't want to be overly reliant on Russia or on Iran.''
 It took nearly a decade to build the $3.9 billion pipeline, which starts in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, snakes through Georgia, and ends at the port of Ceyhan, Turkey. Oil will start flowing this summer.
 A big drawback for pipelines is that they are relatively easy targets for terrorists. In Iraq, hundreds of bombings have frozen exports from the northern Kirkuk fields. In Colombia, one pipeline, running from the north to the eastern Caribbean port of Covenas, has been ruptured by so many attacks in the past two decades that it has been nicknamed ''the flute.'' 
 But such concerns won't stop new projects. Mr. Pifer, who also worked at the National Security Council where he oversaw Russian affairs under President Clinton, recalled that in the 1990's the United States distributed a bumper sticker around Central Asia. It read, ''Happiness is multiple pipelines.''


CORRECTION-DATE: November 1, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Saturday about Lithuania's political dispute with Russia over oil rendered incorrectly a word in a quotation from Vice President Dick Cheney, who had commented on Moscow's use of energy exports as a political tool. He said oil and gas were ''tools of intimidation or blackmail'' -- not ''and blackmail.'' (The error also appeared in articles on May 6, May 14, June 29 and July 15.)

HEADLINE: Colleges Increasingly Banking on Deep Pockets for Donations

BYLINE: By STEWART AIN

 BODY:
WHEN Stony Brook University announced a $25 million gift from the Simons Foundation last Monday, it was the latest in a string of multimillion-dollar gifts to colleges and universities on Long Island.
 It was also the biggest recent payoff for concerted fund-raising efforts by those institutions, which have increasingly been focusing on deep-pocketed donors.
Just last month, Adelphi University in Garden City announced the receipt of the largest gift in its 110-year history: $8.5 million. Adelphi has received four other million-dollar gifts since 2003, said its president, Robert A. Scott.
 Hofstra University in Hempstead has announced 5 gifts of $1 million or more this year toward its $100 million capital campaign, for a total of 15. The biggest was $6 million. 
 And Long Island University, the parent of the C. W. Post Campus in Brookville, has received 15 gifts of $1 million or more as part of a long-running $140 million capital campaign.
 ''Inevitably, based on the economics of running a university, more attention has to be given to fund-raising than in the past,'' said Shirley Strum Kenny, the Stony Brook president. ''It has been accelerating over the last 10 years, and announcements of huge gifts have increased the number of fund-raisers we hire. There is a greater effort made, and we have been doing very well.''
 The $25 million donation was from the foundation of James H. and Marilyn Simons of Manhattan and Stony Brook. He was chairman of Stony Brook University's mathematics department from 1968 through 1976 and is now president of Renaissance Technologies, a private investment firm in East Setauket. Their gift increases the total raised for the university's $300 million capital campaign to $165 million.
 The only bigger donation to Stony Brook was $52 million from Charles B. Wang, the computer software entrepreneur, for a cultural center.
 Dr. Simons, 68, said that he had made numerous contributions before but that the giving of such large gifts was a ''relatively new phenomenon due to the fact that there is a growing income disparity and wealth disparity in the United States.'' 
 Jennifer A. McDonough, a managing associate at Bentz Whaley Flessner in Minneapolis, a consulting firm that specializes in fund-raising, said the pool of big donors had increased. ''There is a larger concentration of wealth and more individuals with the capacity to make large gifts,'' said Ms. McDonough, a consultant to Adelphi.
 Large gifts are especially helpful, Dr. Simons said, because the cost of running a university, including faculty salaries and building construction, has been ''roughly double regular inflation.''
 He said his foundation could make such a large donation because ''my business has been very successful and has given my wife and me an opportunity to do things we otherwise wouldn't have been able to do.'' 
 Carol A. Ammon, a trustee at Adelphi who is chairman of Endo Pharmaceuticals, in Chadds Ford, Pa., made the $8.5 million donation to the university. She also credited her success in business for allowing her to make what she said was her first big gift.
 ''I ended up being very blessed with the success of the business, and if you have such good fortune you have an obligation to give back,'' said Ms. Ammon, who earned a master's in business from Adelphi in 1979. 
 She said the business foundation she received at Adelphi was important. ''The tools I learned at Adelphi were so critical to my success that an opportunity to serve the university was appealing to me, and I felt honored to do it,'' she said.
 Ms. Ammon, 55, who grew up in New Hyde Park, said that in recognition of the gift, Adelphi had named its School of Education after her mother, Ruth, who taught second grade in the New Hyde Park School District.
 Dr. Scott said that when he became the Adelphi president in 2000, he made a special effort to raise money and big donations.
 ''We are relatively new at fund-raising,'' he said. ''For a long history, Adelphi didn't have an active alumni program or fund-raising effort.''
 That changed in the 2000-1 academic year, Dr. Scott said, when Adelphi raised $1.1 million. Last year, it raised $4.6 million, and this year, with the help of the Ammon gift, the university will raise about $14 million.
 ''The money helps the university pay for some high-priority need, like student financial aid or a building or equipment,'' Dr. Scott said. ''It also helps with the bond rating agencies. Standard & Poor's and Moody's look at annual giving and capital giving as a sign of the vitality of the institution. The better you do with that, the better the bond rating you get, which means you pay less for your debt.''
 Dr. Scott said the amount of money raised from alumni is also used by college rating guides to gauge alumni satisfaction, and by foundations in choosing whom to donate to. 
 ''Major foundations, like the Kresge Foundation, are very selective in whom they support, and when they see increasing and substantial participation by alumni, and increasing private giving, they are more likely to give,'' Dr. Scott said.
 At Hofstra, the president, Stuart Rabinowitz, said the university had received ''big gifts before, but not in this number or quantity.'' The recent million-dollar donations have increased the amount raised for the capital campaign to $65 million.
 ''At Harvard you see it,'' he said of the large gifts. ''Many of our alums are now at their stage in life where they are able and willing to give back to their alma mater.''
 Mr. Rabinowitz said he believed that these large gifts demonstrate that people believe the 70-year-old university is ''ready to move from a stage of potential national recognition to real national recognition.''
 Marilyn Monter, a Hofstra trustee and an alumnus of its law school, said she recently donated $1 million to Hofstra and allowed it to be publicized at the university's urging.
 ''It thought it was important that the public know that people are giving to the university,'' said Ms. Monter, 55, who is vice president of the Holiday Organization, a real estate development company in Westbury. 
 She said that the gift would be paid over time and that Hofstra prefers to have contributions paid within five years. 
 ''Hofstra's endowment is $175 million, which is more than double since Stuart became president,'' Ms. Monter said. ''There has been a definite push to increase it.''
 At Long Island University, the $140 million capital campaign begun in 1998 is scheduled to conclude next month. The campaign has received 15 gifts of $1 million or more, topped by the $12 million given in 1998 by Edmund T. Pratt Jr., the former chairman and chief executive of Pfizer, and his wife, Jinny. It is the largest donation in the university's 80-year history.
 ''This campaign raised substantially more than we ever raised before,'' said David J. Steinberg, the university president for the last 22 years. ''We are raising money for the first time on a level equal to our brethren at other universities. A lot has to do with perception and quality. People are coming to understand that Long Island institutions are really very good.''
 Dr. Steinberg said that Long Island University had not taken a different approach to fund-raising, but that ''like growing a tomato in a hothouse, you need it to mature.''
 Dr. Steinberg cited Wellesley and Dartmouth Colleges as examples of schools where money ''just rolls in because of a lifetime of cultivation.''
 ''We all now -- Hofstra, Adelphi, Stony Brook and us -- are seeing larger donations from alumni,'' he said. ''The minimum endowed scholarship here is $25,000, and we are increasingly seeing alums who gave $500 a year in the past now saying they will give $5,000 a year for five years in memory of someone. When I started here, we had none of that. Now we have 148.''

HEADLINE: At the Polls, The Demographics Of Pass or Fail 

BYLINE: By FORD FESSENDEN

 BODY:
A SCHOOL district like Cold Spring Harbor, with its combination of high wealth, small size and relatively low property-tax rates, might have been able to propose a tax increase of 13 percent this year without generating enough opposition among taxpayers to defeat its budget.
 But a district like Roosevelt -- bigger, poorer and more heavily taxed -- would probably have to keep its tax increase below 5 percent to win approval.
Those are conclusions from a New York Times statistical analysis of last year's budget votes on Long Island, which show a strong pattern of correlation between first-ballot budget rejections and districts' size, wealth, existing tax burden and rate of tax increase. 
 Voters in every school district in the state, including the 124 on Long Island, will pass judgment on proposed budgets on Tuesday. If the trends and patterns from 2005 hold true, they spell trouble for school systems up and down the Island. 
 Big districts like Brentwood and Middle Country; relatively low-wealth districts like Deer Park; and high-tax-rate districts like Central Islip could be heading for rejections, along with districts that have proposed big tax increases, like Patchogue-Medford, East Moriches and East Islip. 
 Of course, a host of factors could lead voters to buck the statistical trend in any of those communities, or to defeat budgets in the kinds of districts that have been relatively immune in the past. 
 But after two years of swelling tax revolt, school boards have seen and reacted to the broad trend. In a break from the past, the Island's districts are proposing smaller increases in tax levies this year -- an average of 5.8 percent -- than those in the rest of the state, which average 6.3 percent. In both 2004 and 2005, Long Island's average tax increases were higher than the rest of the state's.
 This reversal comes at a time when enrollment is growing on Long Island, but not in much of the rest of the state, reinforcing the impression that Island districts have been trying harder to tighten their belts since voters began to reject budgets in large numbers in 2004. 
 In Westchester, where enrollments are growing at about the same rate as on Long Island, the average district is proposing a 7.6 percent increase in tax levies. Westchester voters have been much less prone to reject school budgets in recent years than Long Islanders have. 
 An increase in state aid this year has helped districts everywhere hold down tax increases, but not nearly as much as some had hoped. Fuel costs are rising, as are salaries. And the costs associated with teacher pensions and health benefits continue to rise steeply. 
 In spite of excellent returns in the stock market for the statewide pension system, districts will be assessed 8 percent of their salary costs for teacher pensions in the coming school year, up nearly 50 percent from last year's assessment. 
 And districts are seeing huge jumps in medical costs. For example, East Islip, which reduced salary spending in its proposed budget, lost all of those savings and more to a 20 percent increase in the cost of health benefits.
 Many factors come into play in school budget elections, and the economic outlook and political atmosphere surrounding this year's voting are different from last year's. For one thing, the embezzlement scandal that embroiled the Roslyn school district has receded further.
 ''Last year, Roslyn was on the minds of most voters,'' said Tim Kremer, executive director of the New York State School Boards Association. ''This year, we hope that voters see most things being well attended to. We hope there is no sense of crisis that would cause voters on Long Island to vote no.''
 STATISTICALLY, though, the link between budget voting and district wealth, size and tax burden was fairly consistent, the analysis found. A similar study of 2004 budget voting statewide by the State Education Department likewise found that voting margins were correlated with tax burdens, size and tax-increase rates.
 So, relatively low-tax districts like Quogue and Amagansett and high-income Nassau districts like Locust Valley and Manhasset would be expected to have a relatively easy time at the polls, if last year's pattern holds. So would districts like Herricks and Bellmore that have proposed below-average tax increases. 
 The single most important factor predicting a budget vote's outcome has been the percentage increase in the proposed tax levy: The bigger the increase, the more likely it is to be defeated. All other things being equal, in fact, a school board can expect to see the proportion of no votes rise by 1.5 percentage points for every percentage point it raises the tax levy.
 Large districts have also been at a disadvantage. The yes vote in a district with 10,000 students, for instance, tends to be 4 percentage points lower than in a 5,000-student district. This suggests that smaller, more homogeneous communities may have an easier time reaching a consensus on school taxes.
 Richer districts have been less likely to defeat budgets than less affluent areas. So a district with about $70,000 in income for each pupil -- the level of Central Islip, according to state figures for 2003, the most recent year available -- could expect 1.2 percentage points fewer yes votes than if it had $200,000 for each pupil -- about the level of the Half Hollow Hills district.
 This suggests that people in richer districts have the resources to cope with higher taxes more easily and so are less likely to vote no. 
 So Cold Spring Harbor, with nearly $700,000 in income for each pupil, ought to be able, at least in theory, to tolerate a much larger tax increase than the average district and still get its budget passed. All other things being equal, last year's pattern suggests it could have safely proposed a 13 percent increase this year.
 There is also a correlation between a district's total tax burden and budget voting. Districts whose taxes were already high, relative to the value of homes, have been more likely to suffer budget rejections, even when proposed increases are not large. 
 For instance, in districts where homeowners pay taxes of about 1 percent of the value of their houses -- a category that included Great Neck in 2003, the most recent year the state published such statistics -- the yes vote can be expected to be about 6 percentage points greater than in a district where homeowners pay 3 percent, like Hempstead, the most heavily taxed on the Island by this measure. 
 The Times also examined the widely held belief that districts with concentrations of older voters have a harder time passing a school budget. But there appeared to be no statistical correlation between the proportion of a district's population that is over 55 and the results of budget votes, either on Long Island or in the rest of the state.

HEADLINE: Stratford Picks a Firm to Revive Its Shakespeare Theater

BYLINE: By JEFF HOLTZ

 BODY:
THE Stratford Town Council on Monday night selected Koerner Kronenfeld Partners, a development company based in Manhattan, to redevelop the Stratford Festival Theater, which has been closed since 1989.
 The council's vote was 9-0 with one abstention.
 Koerner was one of two finalists for the project. The other was the Stratford Theater Group. 
 Mayor James R. Miron of Stratford said Wednesday that he would be meeting with Koerner soon to discuss a contract to renovate the 1,500-seat theater and produce shows there. Mr. Miron said the company had agreed to a town demand that a live production take place on the theater property by this summer. ''It doesn't have to run this entire summer,'' he said. ''It could be a two-week period, or on weekends in September, and it doesn't have to be Shakespeare. And it would have to be done outside, probably in a tent, or something like one.'' 
 Carl S. Koerner, a partner in the company, said it would take $1.5 million to $2 million and about six months to renovate the theater. He said the theater would most likely be ready for shows in spring 2007. 
 ''There aren't any structural issues,'' Mr. Koerner said.
 Ivan S. Kronenfeld, another partner, said the company had already contacted people from the theater industry to help in staging productions.
 ''We've put together an absolutely A-list team of people, and we want to breathe life into that theater and the artistic community in that town,'' he said.
 The partners said they also planned to eventually build two smaller theaters on the property, one seating about 500 people and another with a capacity of about 200. 
 ''For a theater community to really flourish, to have just one venue with 1,500 seats is limiting to what you can offer the audience,'' Mr. Koerner said. ''But were not going to build anything until we get the first one up and running and attract an audience and have quality productions on the stage.'' 
 The Stratford Festival Theater was founded in 1955 by Lawrence Langner, who also founded the Westport Country Playhouse, and built on a site overlooking the Housatonic River and Long Island Sound. Stars such as Katharine Hepburn, James Earl Jones, Christopher Plummer and Jack Palance performed in Shakespeare plays before the theater closed in 1989 because of financial trouble.
 Mr. Miron said having the theater running again would greatly benefit the town. 
 ''It's part of the town's identity,'' he said. ''If you grew up with the theater, you realize how electric it is when there are productions in town. It improves the quality of life.
 ''And it certainly helps from an economic development standpoint. We're looking at new and improved ways to use our waterfront, and this brings more people into town.''
 Mr. Kronenfeld said he was confident the theater could succeed again.
 ''It is troubling that it has been closed for so long, and understand we are going to be swimming upstream at first,'' he said. ''But we believe Connecticut has supported many, many theaters and is a very right place for this kind of cultural event.''
 Mr. Miron said he had spoken to corporations about sponsorships and naming rights for the theater. He would not say what companies he had contacted.

HEADLINE: Attention Shoppers: Low Prices On Shots in the Clinic Off Aisle 7

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Everyday low prices on strep-throat exams. 
 That is the basic idea behind a retail approach to routine medical care now catching on among consumers and entrepreneurs. At Wal-Mart, CVS and other chain stores, walk-in health clinics are springing up as an antidote to the expense and inconvenience of full-service doctors' offices or the high-cost and impersonal last resort of emergency rooms.
For a $30 flu shot, a $45 treatment for an ear infection or other routine services from a posted price list, patients can visit nurse practitioners in independently operated clinics set up within the stores -- whose own pharmacies can fill prescriptions. 
 ''It was a lot easier to know you can just drive up the block to a clinic, rather than spend time in the pediatrician's waiting room,'' said Liz Lyons, who recently took her 9-year-old son to have a sore throat swabbed in a clinic at a CVS drugstore in Bethesda, Md. 
 She made a $10 co-payment, with her husband's insurance picking up the rest of the $59 tab.
 About 100 of these clinics, which typically lease space from the host stores, are now operating around the nation. Hundreds more are in the works, bankrolled by a range of competing entrepreneurs who include Stephen M. Case, the former AOL chairman; Richard L. Scott, who once ran the nation's largest hospital chain; and Michael Howe, a former chief executive of the Arby's restaurants group.
 Despite their diverse backgrounds, those executives and others share a concept of ''consumer-directed health care'' -- a marketing and political term that usually means higher out-of-pocket medical costs -- as a mass-market opportunity. Even some family physicians say the clinics may have their place in the array of American medical offerings. 
 And most insurers so far are welcoming retail clinics as a way to save money. The uninsured, meanwhile, typically find the clinics more affordable than most alternatives -- including the for-profit storefront clinics that have long offered a full range of physician-provided medical services to a walk-in clientele. 
 Uwe E. Reinhardt, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University, said that the store chains, with their reputations on the line, would insist that the clinics maintain high standards and low error rates. ''Primary care is a neglected field in the United States, lagging other economically advanced countries,'' he said. ''The clinics can teach the rest of our health system how primary care could be done and brought to the public.'' 
 Whether a fad or the beginning of a fundamental shift, the retail clinic trend comes in response to an erosion in employer-sponsored insurance benefits that is forcing people to pay more or all of their own health costs. It is also a reaction to the growing perception that conventional medical service for routine and preventive care has become too costly and inefficient. 
 ''Starbucks has 10,000 locations; health care is certainly more important,'' said Mr. Case, who made his name and fortune on the Internet but is now betting that his chain of RediClinics at Wal-Mart, Walgreens and other retailers can be the next big thing. 
 Mr. Case says his epiphany came a few years ago when he took his young daughter to an emergency room on a Sunday for an ear infection. ''We waited four hours and they just weren't able to see us,'' he recalled. ''This is crazy: a society in which everything is convenient other than what people care most about, which is taking care of their health.'' 
 Mr. Case's company, Revolution Health Group, has 11 RediClinics now running, including one at a Duane Reade pharmacy on West 50th Street in Manhattan. He plans to open 90 others in various retail chains by the end of this year, and 500 within three years. 
 Other executives bringing their names and money to the field include Hal Rosenbluth, who sold a travel business to American Express and is now behind a clinic chain called Take Care Health Systems. It has clinics in 16 stores, and Mr. Rosenbluth has raised $77 million with an eye toward expanding to 1,400 in the next few years. 
 Another in the game is Dr. Glen D. Nelson, a Minneapolis surgeon and investor whose company, MinuteClinic, has branches in 73 stores. 
 ''The clinic concept is a microcosm of what you could do to the whole system to improve it and make it more consumer friendly and economical,'' Dr. Nelson said. 
 The licensed nurse practitioners who run most of the clinics typically have advanced training and referral arrangements with local doctors for cases beyond the clinics' scope. When Ms. Lyons recently took her son, Daniel, to the MinuteClinic at the CVS in Bethesda, the nurse practitioner on duty was Trish Hughes, who performed a quick swab test to check for a streptococcal bacterial infection. In less than three minutes, that preliminary test came up negative; the swab was retained for further testing. 
 Ms. Lyons said she was pleased with the clinic experience. ''I will be back,'' she said. 
 For Beth Brauning, 54, a self-employed house cleaner who is uninsured, the prices at a clinic in a CVS near Columbus, Ohio, were a big attraction. The nurse practitioner took her blood pressure and wrote two allergy prescriptions she needed. 
 The bill was $49 -- ''probably half what my doctor would have charged me,'' Ms. Brauning said. ''It was such a good experience for me. You go to an emergency room, it's $300 to walk in the door.''
 Having someone in the store writing prescriptions could be a boon for pharmacy chains. ''Pharmacy is 70 percent of our business,'' said Jim Maritan, a CVS vice president for strategy and business development. ''It is a great experience having a nurse practitioner clinic on site.''
 But some doctors say the clinic-pharmacy relationship could create conflicts of interest. ''We want to make sure that the patient is protected,'' said Dr. Joseph P. Annis, an anesthesiologist in Austin, Tex., who is the chairman of an American Medical Association council that studied the clinics for a report due out later this month.
 Dr. Anne B. Francis, a pediatrician in Rochester, said it was important for children to have a physician who gets to know the family and keeps a complete health record that can help point to underlying causes of some ailments. ''All earaches are not ear infections,'' she said.
 Although some physicians are fearful of losing business to the clinics, others say that the clinics may fill a need. Larry S. Fields, a family doctor in Ashland, Ky., who is president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said that if the clinics ''stick to this limited scope, they may have a small role in providing acute health care to people who are mildly ill, when their only other alternative at the time might be an emergency room.'' 
 With no need for expensive medical equipment or office space, the clinics tend to be cheap to operate -- particularly since the nurse practitioners are paid $30 to $45 an hour, compared with the $65 or much more an hour that a primary care doctor can command. A store clinic can be profitable with 25 patients over a 12-hour day, clinic executives said.
 A clinic company with somewhat grander ambitions is Solantic. Its clinics are staffed by doctors and provide a wider range of services that include X-rays at $90 apiece (or two for $150). 
 For routine services, Solantic's prices may be slightly higher than at other clinics -- $55 or more for a Solantic doctor visit compared with $45 to be seen by a nurse practitioner at a rival's clinic. But having doctors on staff ''dramatically increases the number of services we can provide to a patient,'' said Richard L. Scott, the chairman of Solantic, which is based in Jacksonville, Fla.
 Mr. Scott built Columbia-HCA Healthcare into the nation's largest hospital chain. But in the late 1990's, the company faced an array of charges that it had defrauded the government, charged private insurers for unnecessary tests and improperly paid kickbacks to referring doctors. The board forced Mr. Scott out, and the company paid billions of dollars in fines and penalties; Mr. Scott was never charged with wrongdoing. ''I always wanted to create a clinic business when I was in the hospital business,'' Mr. Scott said.
 Glenn Habern, Wal-Mart's senior vice president for business development, said that Solantic and three of its rivals would be among the clinic companies leasing space in about 60 of Wal-Mart's 1,300 ''superstores'' by the end of this year. 
 ''It's still a test for us,'' Mr. Habern said. ''If customers like it we may open more. So far, we've not seen any reason not to do so.'' But a big Wal-Mart competitor, Target, has evidently seen drawbacks. 
 At the end of this month Target plans to close the 11 MinuteClinics in stores in Maryland and Minnesota; the company would not explain why. ''Target will begin remodeling to open new health clinics in these stores in fall 2006,'' the company said in an e-mail message. 
 Dr. Nelson, at MinuteClinic, said in an interview before the breakup with Target was disclosed that ''the pharmacy business is a small percentage of the Target footprint.'' 
 ''Target also is very disciplined,'' he added. ''They like to have things totally designed and controlled to their own specifications. They struggled with whether they want somebody else talking to their clients.''

HEADLINE: N.F.L. Has Options in Possible Return to Los Angeles

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA

 BODY:
A helpful suggestion for the N.F.L. comes courtesy of Jack McGrath, a public-relations man from Studio City in Los Angeles. Want to put a team in town after a 12-year absence? Name it the Los Angeles Celebs. 
 The red carpet will not be rolled out for professional football in Southern California for at least another four years, but when the league's owners meet in Denver next week, they could choose to build a new stadium, probably in Los Angeles or in Anaheim. If they do, it could mean the return of the league to the nation's second-largest television market and signal the resumption of the N.F.L.'s fitful relationship with an audience that equates its fandom with a broken marriage.
''It's like your wife left and 12 years later you say, 'I don't care,' '' said McGrath, who owned season tickets for the Raiders before they, and the Rams, left Southern California after the 1994 season. ''We're getting along quite well without them. What are you going to do, keep crying? They left. 
 ''But that gets rekindled again. If you know you have a stadium and you know you'll have a team, you'll start getting pretty excited.'' 
 One of the proposals would put a football stadium next to the Angels' stadium in Anaheim. The other calls for a stadium to be built within the footprint of the Los Angeles Coliseum. (A third proposal from Pasadena is considered a long shot.) The owners may not make a decision next week, but they and league officials say there is enough momentum for a decision to be made in the next few months. And that would move the N.F.L. a step closer to a Los Angeles team that begins play in 2010 or 2011. 
 ''I do believe the sooner we do it, the better,'' said the New England Patriots' owner, Robert K. Kraft, a member of the 11-member Los Angeles Stadium Working Group. ''We all realize this is important for our future. In the end, we need to have a team there.''
 No matter the site, the price tag is likely to reach $800 million, and it will ultimately be the responsibility of the franchise's owner to pay it. Neither proposal calls for public money to be used on stadium construction. So the owner would be expected to help pay back the debt by selling the naming rights (The Los Angeles Times reported the rights could bring $50 million) and perhaps personal seat licenses, in addition to luxury suites and club level seats. The league would surely help by placing Super Bowls in the new stadium. 
 The owners have not begun to grapple with whether the N.F.L. will add a team or whether an existing team will move to Los Angeles, but an expansion fee, combined with the cost of the stadium, could mean spending at least $1.5 billion. This figure gives pause to even the league's wealthiest owners, who must make sure that the owner of a Los Angeles team can be financially successful.
 ''The more these stadiums cost, the greater the risk,'' said the N.F.L.'s Neil Glat, who is overseeing the Los Angeles discussions. ''We think L.A. is a great market, and if a team is marketed properly and you connect with the fans and community, there is an opportunity there.''
 Marc Ganis, a Chicago-based sports consultant who has worked with N.F.L. teams on stadium issues, said he expected owners to decide next week on the Coliseum site. The famous facade would remain, according to the proposal. A 68,000-seat stadium, with more than 200 luxury suites and with the flexibility to increase seating capacity for events like the Super Bowl, would be built inside. The Coliseum is owned by the state, so the league would sign a 25-year lease that could be extended to 55 years. 
 If Anaheim is chosen, the N.F.L. will purchase 53 acres next to Angel Stadium for about $50 million. The football stadium could be built amid a vast swath of commercial space, which, when developed, could help offset some of the costs of stadium construction. The city of Anaheim has set a May 31 deadline for a deal. After that, the city will entertain other offers for the land. 
 In a telephone interview last week, Mayor Curt Pringle said he thought Anaheim's greatest obstacle to getting a team was its identity -- it's not Los Angeles. Ganis agreed, saying that if the Anaheim proposal were in Los Angeles, it would be the clear winner over the Coliseum renovation, which Los Angeles political leaders envision as the centerpiece of the revival of south Los Angeles. 
 The size of the project, though, may delay a decision. The N.F.L. has been discussing opportunities to return to Los Angeles nearly as long as the city has been without a team, but owners may want more time to gauge the depth of the commitment of the business community in and around Los Angeles. 
 Because of the stadium costs and the absence of public money, N.F.L. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue has called the business community's involvement a ''surrogate'' for the use of tax dollars.
 Steve Tisch, the Giants' chairman and executive vice president and a member of the Los Angeles working group, said, ''We think it is important to have a team in Los Angeles, but the conditions have to be right, the economics have to work, and the business community has to be strongly involved.''
 If a site is chosen in the next few months, the league will have two years before it is obligated to designate a team that will play there. That would provide time to decide whether to expand or to allow an existing team to move. 
 ''One major benefit to expansion is the league gets to decide who the owner is,'' Ganis said.
 The league will want an owner who will aggressively recruit business and general community support to generate revenue to offset the tremendous debt.
 But expansion also means a further dilution of the revenue all teams share. 
 There will be plenty of options if the league chooses a relocation. The Vikings have stadium troubles, the Saints' post-Hurricane Katrina future is unsettled, and San Diego does not have the money to help the Chargers build a new stadium. 
 If the Chargers cannot find a new stadium site within San Diego County by the end of the year, they will become the most likely team to move to Los Angeles, Ganis said. (The Chargers actually began in Los Angeles as a member of the American Football League.)
 Without a home team, the Los Angeles market posts ratings for football that are below the national average. In an area saturated with entertainment options, the N.F.L. would have to win back what sometimes seems to be an ambivalent fan base. Perhaps the fans have grown weary of waiting for the N.F.L. to return. 
 ''It's not a mandatory part of the culture here, like it is in other places where it's the dominant part of civic pride,'' said Kevin Roderick, a lifelong Angeleno and the editor of LAObserved, a Web site about life in Los Angeles. ''You have an entire generation of kids growing up without football.''
 Of the new team, Roderick added: ''They just better win. They better have a charismatic person on the team, a Kobe or Shaq or a Sandy Koufax, who can be the face of the team.''
 Sounds like a fan already.

HEADLINE: U.S. Aid Can't Win Bolivia's Love as New Suitors Emerge

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: EL PALOMAR, Bolivia, May 7 

 BODY:
For decades, the United States has given hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Bolivia, spending on everything from roads to rural health care. But these days, to Washington's dismay, it is Cuba and Venezuela that Bolivians in places like this small farming community are embracing because of new assistance programs from those countries. 
 Aid from Havana and Caracas has been flowing into Bolivia since a Socialist union leader, Evo Morales, became president in January, and it signals a deepening partnership with the Bush administration's most prominent regional antagonists.
It also highlights Washington's seeming inability, despite its formidable spending, to win over Bolivians. Many Bolivians have come to associate American aid almost exclusively with a generation-old anti-drug policy to wipe out coca, the raw material for cocaine, which has led to years of political unrest here. 
 ''The United States just subordinates Latin America and Bolivia, and it bothers me, it really bothers me,'' said Enrique de la Cruz, 25, a medical student who was waiting for a bus in El Palomar, where many people live in simple adobe homes. ''The alliances with Venezuela and Cuba are super.''
 Development aid from the United States to Bolivia still amounts to about $100 million annually, far more than from any other country. In addition to paying for big infrastructure projects like roads and pushing international lenders to forgive Bolivia's debt -- assistance that for years gave Washington unchallenged influence with governments here -- the aid from the United States has helped Bolivians in more direct ways, too, building clinics and helping small businesses. 
 Still, many people who seek help do not know the money comes from the United States government.
 Now, that aid is going head to head with programs that have been publicly promoted by Mr. Morales and are sponsored by Fidel Castro of Cuba and Venezuela's president, Hugo Chavez, whose country is awash in oil money. 
 The emergence of a populist leader like Mr. Morales, an Aymara Indian and former coca grower, has made Bolivia the most promising place yet for Venezuela, in particular, to showcase its influence and further Mr. Chavez's ambitious policy of countering the Bush administration's aims in Latin America. 
 The total actually spent on the programs so far is unclear; Cuba and Venezuela have pledged to provide development aid and services that could total $130 million or more over the course of several years, but those have not been realized yet. 
 ''The Cubans and Venezuelans are putting a human face on what they're doing, so they can get a hell of a lot of mileage,'' said Myles Frechette, a former United States diplomat in Latin America. ''We have been the donor of choice for a very, very long time, and the kind of things that we help with pay off in the long run. So they tend to be undramatic and people don't notice and seem to take them for granted.'' 
 The new programs include money for rural clinics run by Cuban doctors and literacy classes organized by both countries.
 Venezuela has promised to help Bolivia with its plans to nationalize its energy industry. And it is building 109 rural radio stations, offering scholarships to train Bolivian health workers and leading an effort to help hundreds of thousands of Bolivians get identification papers.
 That aid allowed Wilson Calle, 15, to get his first inoculation the other day at a local school here. Miles away, in the poor city of El Alto, Juan Rolando Jano, 73, received free cataract surgery from Cuban doctors at a center where a banner read Bolivian-Cuban Ophthalmology Clinic. 
 Alvaro Chura Quispe, 15, got his identification card with 250 fellow students at his high school in La Paz, the capital.
 Here in El Palomar, about 30 miles south of the capital, Francisca Tarqui expressed jubilation that because of an education program jointly sponsored by Venezuela and Cuba, she will soon learn to read.
 ''I cannot believe it,'' she said, standing at the door of her home on a dirt road. ''I'm 83 years old!''
 Mr. Morales has welcomed the aid, attending ribbon cuttings for Cuban and Venezuelan programs and meeting with Mr. Chavez and Mr. Castro.
 ''They are the best allies for changing Bolivia,'' Mr. Morales said recently in Havana as the three countries signed a so-called People's Trade Agreement, aimed at countering Washington's efforts to reach free-trade accords across Latin America.
 Mr. Morales hailed the union as an ''axis of good,'' a clear dig at American warnings about the budding alliance of the three leftist governments. 
 For some Bolivians, though, Mr. Chavez has been too eager a patron to be welcomed without reserve. 
 After Mr. Morales announced the nationalization of the gas industry on May 1, Mr. Chavez flew to La Paz and then accompanied Mr. Morales to a meeting with the presidents of Bolivia's two customers for gas, Brazil and Argentina.
 Clearly delighted, Mr. Chavez spoke at length about Bolivia's decision to nationalize its gas industry at a news conference offered by the four presidents, overshadowing his more subdued Bolivian counterpart and the other two leaders.
 ''Chavez acted like he was president of Bolivia,'' said an irritated opposition senator, Carlos d'Arlach, who says he is wary of Venezuela's widening role in his country. 
 Venezuela is quickly positioning itself to help Bolivia's upstart state energy company to produce, process and sell gas. More cooperation accords are expected to be announced when Mr. Chavez visits Bolivia on May 18. 
 Mr. Chavez has also announced that Venezuela will buy all of Bolivia's soybean crop, which had been bought by Colombia but is now threatened by Bogota's new trade agreement with the United States.
 But it is much more Venezuela's and Cuba's small-scale aid projects, which avoid bureaucracy and provide badly needed services to towns that rarely had a state presence, that many Bolivians notice and wholeheartedly welcome.
 ''It's strange to have foreigners here, but we have doctors in Bolivia and they don't want to come out here,'' said Delia Pacheco, 30, who runs a small store in El Palomar. ''This is good. At least we now have a president who remembers the most out-of-the-way areas.''
 Such talk irks American officials, who point out that Washington-financed programs provided by the Agency for International Development can be found all around Bolivia.
 The United States has built homes for the poor, and it is setting up local ''justice centers'' in regions that had no legal presence and is providing advice for dozens of small businesses that want to export products. 
 American officials said that for years aid from the United States had proved crucial for Bolivian development, electrifying the budding town of Santa Cruz, which later became a big city, and helping keep Bolivia's main airline going years ago. Washington also helps pay for 27 clinics across the country staffed by nearly 1,000 doctors and other health professionals.
 Despite that, when many Bolivians think of the United States, they conjure up images of American-backed troops eradicating coca plants and the adoption of privatization and other economic changes recommended by American officials.
 Those twin pillars of American policy were so out of favor by last year that they propelled Mr. Morales's rise to the presidency. He had promised to roll back market reforms and limit American anti-drug efforts.
 Here in El Palomar, villagers say they are simply happy that someone is helping them at all.
 Jose David Poma, 34, smiles when he recounts how a Cuban doctor removed a spine from a cactus that got lodged in his foot. Ruben Quispe, 40, says he feels secure knowing that he can take his children to the clinic whenever they are sick -- and always find it staffed, something new here.
 His mother, Ms. Tarqui, the 83-year-old woman, was most upbeat about the help. An Aymara Indian whose Spanish is shaky, she grew up in Bolivia's desolate countryside, far from any school.
 ''Now I am going to go to school,'' she said, looking forward to the literacy classes. ''I always wanted to learn to read.''

HEADLINE: Military Plans Tests in Search for an Alternative to Oil-Based Fuel 

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13 

 BODY:
When an F-16 lights up its afterburners, it consumes nearly 28 gallons of fuel per minute. No wonder, then, that of all the fuel the United States government uses each year, the Air Force accounts for more than half. The Air Force may not be in any danger of suffering inconveniences from scarce or expensive fuel, but it has begun looking for a way to power its jets on something besides conventional fuel. 
 In a series of tests -- first on engines mounted on blocks and then with B-52's in flight -- the Air Force will try to prove that the American military can fly its aircraft by blending traditional crude-oil-based jet fuel with a synthetic liquid made first from natural gas and, eventually, from coal, which is plentiful and cheaper. 
While the military has been a leader in adopting some technologies -- light but strong metals, radar-evading stealth designs and fire-retardant flight suits, for example -- any effort to hit a miles-per-gallon fuel efficiency rating has taken a back seat when the mission is to haul bombs farther and faster or push 70-ton tanks across a desert to topple an adversary. (The Abrams tank, for example, gets less than a mile per gallon under certain combat conditions.)
 ''Energy is a national security issue,'' said Michael A. Aimone, the Air Force assistant deputy chief of staff for logistics. 
 The United States is unlikely ever to become fully independent of foreign oil, Mr. Aimone said, but the intent of the Air Force project is ''to develop enough independence to have assured domestic supplies for aviation purposes.''
 By late this summer, on the hard lake beds of the Mojave Desert, where the Air Force tests its most secret and high-performance aircraft, a lumbering B-52 is scheduled to take off in an experiment in which two of the giant bomber's engines will burn jet fuel produced not from crude oil but from natural gas. The plane's six other engines will burn traditional jet fuel -- just in case. 
 The Air Force consumed 3.2 billion gallons of aviation fuel in fiscal year 2005, which was 52.5 percent of all fossil fuel used by the government, Pentagon statistics show. The total Air Force bill for jet fuel last year topped $4.7 billion.
 Although the share of national energy consumption by the federal government and the military is just 1.7 percent, every increase of $10 per barrel of oil drives up Air Force fuel costs by $600 million per year.
 Mr. Aimone said that if the synthetic blend worked, plans called for increasing its use in Air Force planes to 100 million gallons in the next two years.
 Air Force and industry officials say that oil prices above $40 to $45 per barrel make a blend with synthetic fuels a cost-effective alternative to oil-based jet fuel. 
 Fuel costs have doubled since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and crude oil prices since Hurricane Katrina have remained above $60 a barrel.
 The Air Force effort falls under a directive from Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld to explore alternative fuel sources. Under the plan, the Air Force has been authorized to buy 100,000 gallons of synthetic fuel. 
 Ground experiments are scheduled to begin in coming weeks at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, followed by test flights at Edwards Air Force Base in California.
 Although the Air Force is leading the project, it is working with the Automotive Tank Command of the Army, in Detroit, and the Naval Fuels Laboratory, at Patuxent River, Md. 
 The research and tests on synthetic fuel would ultimately produce a common fuel for the entire military, Air Force officials said.
 The initial contract for unconventional fuel for the tests will be signed with Syntroleum Corporation of Tulsa, Okla., which has provided synthetic fuel for testing by the Departments of Energy, Transportation and Defense since 1998.
 John B. Holmes Jr., Syntroleum's president and chief executive officer, said his firm would sell the Air Force its synthetic fuel for testing ''at our cost, and we may be losing a little bit.'' 
 Neither Mr. Holmes nor the Air Force would provide cost estimates for the experimental fuel deal in advance of signing a final contract, expected in coming days. 
 Air Force officials have acknowledged, however, that the cost per gallon of the test fuel will be expensive.
 Syntroleum can produce 42 gallons of synthetic fuel from 10,000 cubic feet of natural gas. The raw materials cost about $70. 
 If the military moves ahead with using the synthetic fuels, the Syntroleum technology could be used by factories elsewhere to produce the same 42 gallons of fuel from just $10 worth of coal, Mr. Holmes said.
 ''The United States is essentially the Saudi Arabia of coal,'' Mr. Holmes said. ''It can be mined relatively inexpensively. We really believe that one of the things we can do to help our country's energy needs is to use the abundance of coal reserves.''
 Mr. Aimone said the large plants needed to produce nonconventional fuels did not exist and would have to be designed and built by the industry.
 But he added: ''We believe there are economic incentives as we invest in this, and invest with the industry at large, because there are vast coal reserves in this country. The economic pressures of rising oil prices can be moderated by the price of coal.''

HEADLINE: New Fuel for a Stalled Upstate Economy

BYLINE: By DAVID STABA

DATELINE: SHELBY, N.Y., May 10 

 BODY:
The railroad once carried the economy of this rural town and its upstate New York neighbors. 
 Farmers took their crops to the nearest depot to send to market. Massive blocks of sandstone from local quarries were shipped out by rail. And vegetable processors like H. J. Heinz and the toy manufacturer Fisher-Price located factories here to take advantage of the trains.
But the industrial base of western New York has slowly withered over the last 50 years, with people following jobs out of the region. Fisher-Price in nearby Medina closed its plant in 1995, putting 700 people out of work. And rail traffic slowed to a trickle in the long economic decline, with little more than excursions these days runs by the Medina Railroad Museum. 
 Now, however, local officials are hoping to parlay the railroads, the region's agricultural base and a growing interest in alternative forms of fuel into an economic rebirth.
 Western New York Energy, headed by a farmer who has lived in the area all his life and is backed by local investors, announced last week that it intends to build an $87 million ethanol production facility on an old cabbage farm in Shelby. Construction is set to begin soon, and once the plant is up and running in 2008, it will transform 20 million bushels of corn a year into 50 million gallons of fuel.
 ''We're basically an agricultural community,'' said Dale S. Root, president of the Orleans County Farm Bureau and a fifth-generation farmer. ''We have no major cities and no big factories. This ethanol plant is going to be the biggest thing to happen here in a long time.''
 The announcement has provided the area with sorely needed good news. A week earlier, Bernzomatic, a maker of hand-held torches and one of the last remaining manufacturers in what was once a thriving industrial district, announced it would transfer operations -- and 200 or more jobs -- to Shanghai.
 And in Lockport, about 15 miles to the west, the future of the region's largest employer, Delphi, is in limbo. Last week, lawyers for the auto-parts manufacturer asked a federal bankruptcy court judge to allow it to nullify its contract with the United Auto Workers, which represents about 3,000 workers at the Lockport plant. Union members on Thursday and Friday voted to give their leaders authority to call a strike if Delphi's request is granted.
 Shelby's location in the midst of a traditionally agricultural area and adjacent to an underused rail line makes it a natural site for the ethanol plant, said John Sawyer, Western New York Energy's chief executive.
 ''I really believe in alternative fuels,'' said Mr. Sawyer, who grew up in nearby Albion and operated a grain farm to the southeast in Livingston County until two years ago. ''It's an important issue in our country, and I've thought that for a long time. Until the price of gas climbed to the point it has in the past year, I don't think people in our country really wanted to take it seriously.''
 New York State is taking the gasoline alternative seriously enough that Gov. George E. Pataki attended Monday's news conference and has pledged $6 million in state funds to the effort, plus low-cost power and a package of tax incentives.
 Groundbreaking at the 144-acre site is set for June, with production expected to begin by January 2008. Company officials hope it will be the first functioning ethanol plant in the state. 
 While the ethanol plant is expected to employ about 50 workers, Mr. Pataki predicted the development would ultimately create about 500 jobs, including those on the railroad and at a carbon dioxide processing plant that would handle waste gas produced by the production process. Another marketable byproduct will be high-protein, high-fat animal feed.
 ''I look at this as a tool for development,'' said Merle L. Draper, the Shelby town supervisor. ''The size of this project reopens the rail.''
 Plans call for an offshoot of the line to run through the site and to increase rail traffic from 600 cars to 6,500 annually, Mr. Draper said. About half of the state's contribution will be used to improve the existing rails and extend them.
 Michael Sawyer, John Sawyer's son and the company's project manager, said that while most ethanol plants in the United States are in the Midwest's grain belt, Western New York Energy chose the area because it is near the enormous potential customer base in the Northeast.
 While some of the corn required will be shipped in, the company plans to buy as much as possible from local farmers, Michael Sawyer said. As in much of the rural upstate areas, agriculture remains the leading industry in Orleans County.
 ''With a demand of more than 20 million bushels per year, we'll spur even more production,'' he said. ''We're confident we'll buy as much of our corn as possible from farmers right here in New York State.''
 The plant will encourage area farmers to put fallow land into production, as well as saving them on transportation costs, Mr. Root said.
 ''It's going to give our farmers a market that's desperately needed,'' he said. ''Right now, we have to ship 50 to 100 miles away. Now we'll be able to just take it into town.''

HEADLINE: Puerto Rico's Governor Approves Bailout, Ending Impasse

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: SAN JUAN, P.R., May 13 

 BODY:
Puerto Rico's Senate and governor approved a deal on Saturday to end a damaging two-week partial government shutdown and send about 95,000 public employees back to work. 
 The Senate passed and Gov. Anibal Acevedo-Vila sanctioned two measures authorizing a $741 million bailout loan from the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico, a United States commonwealth, after the House approved the measures late Friday.
The Legislature also passed an ''urgent needs'' fund to be generated through part of a sales tax, still to be determined, to help pay for the loan.
 The approvals ended a political impasse between the administration and the opposition-controlled Legislature that threatened to push the island's economy into recession and prompted Moody's Investors Service to downgrade the commonwealth's general obligation bonds to one step above junk.
 The deal will put furloughed teachers and other government employees back to work on Monday.
 ''The language approved by the Legislature, more than anything, is a victory for the Puerto Rican people, who with their firmness, maturity and posture led us to a permanent solution so that this painful moment in our history will never repeat itself,'' Governor Acevedo-Vila said in a statement.
 The entire Department of Education, including nearly 1,600 schools, had been shuttered along with 42 other agencies since May 1 because the government ran out of funds for the remaining two months of fiscal 2006.
 For months, the governor and the Legislature could not agree on the size of a proposed sales tax to help balance a $1.2 billion structural deficit. The Government Development Bank had demanded the sales tax as a payback guarantee for the bailout loan.
 Pressure mounted as payday Monday neared and the unemployment rate reached 18 percent. Demonstrations were held almost daily, including two huge marches calling on politicians to reach an agreement.
 In addition to downgrading the general obligation bonds, Moody's sank $4.3 billion in appropriation bonds into junk, citing the political impasse.
 The governor had pushed for a 7 percent tax, which would have replaced an excise tax and been tied to changes in income taxes, while legislative leaders had pressed for a lower rate and cuts in government spending.
 The commonwealth's credit remains under watch by the Moody's and Standard & Poor's rating services. Tax and fiscal changes still need to be ironed out in the Legislature and approved by the governor.
 The bank's board will meet Monday to approve the loan, a spokeswoman, Maria Socorro, said Saturday. ''Right now, the bank sees it with good eyes,'' Ms. Socorro said of the deal.

HEADLINE: Long-Term Lodging Finds a Foothold

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH extended-stay hotels have been around for a while in most parts of the country, they have yet to really catch on in New York City.
 A handful of independent hotels provide long-term lodging, but there are only two extended-stay hotels affiliated with national brands: Extended Stay America near LaGuardia Airport in Queens, which opened in 2001, and Residence Inn by Marriott in Manhattan at 1033 Sixth Avenue, near 38th and 39th Streets, which opened in January.
There are no immediate plans for additional branded extended-stay hotels in the city -- in part because of the high costs in developing such properties -- yet some lodging experts say the demand is there. ''There's a very significant opportunity here to create an extended-stay upscale product because it really is a completely underserved market,'' said Mark Gordon, principal and managing director of the lodging group at the investment banking firm Sonnenblick-Goldman. 
 New York, of course, has its share of guests who stay for weeks or months at a time, including business travelers; visitors from abroad who are in town for the opera season or other cultural amenities; and film crews on location. Why, then, aren't more hotels offering long-term lodging for them? 
 There are significant challenges to developing extended-stay hotels in New York, experts say. Typically, extended-stay hotels trade the higher room rates they could charge at peak times for a steadier and higher occupancy rate. Prices for long-term visitors are often discounted as much as 30 percent. But in a market like New York, where shorter-term visitors often pay $200 or more a night, hotel operators may be tempted to hold out for that type of guest.
 Another reason is that space in New York is at a premium, and long-term guests usually require more of it than those staying a single night. It is no coincidence that both the Extended Stay America and the Residence Inn by Marriott favor smaller studio spaces over sprawling suites, which are more typical of suburban extended-stay hotels. Also, New York City guests tend to demand around-the-clock services, experts say, making it hard to limit costs.
 Some hotel operators have actually pulled out of the extended-stay business in Manhattan. Affinia Hotels and the Benjamin, part of a string of nine luxury inns configured for suites, were marketed for many years for long-term guests. No longer. 
 ''We found that many of our customers were looking for more service,'' said John Moser, chief marketing officer for the Affinia hotel chain. 
 Extended-stay hotels began appearing in the late 1970's in suburban areas, where hotel companies sought to carve out a niche in a competitive market by seeking out long-term guests.
 In Manhattan, many of the independent hotels offering luxury accommodations that bill themselves as extended-stay places were developed out of a condominium boom in the 1980's. Often the hotels are classified as corporate apartments and require 30-night minimum stay, a standard that permits lodging to be developed in areas where zoning codes might otherwise prohibit it.
 The Phillips Club at Lincoln Square, at 155 West 66th Street, constructed as part of a mixed-use development at Lincoln Center, is one such hotel. The Phillips Club offers luxury units with full kitchens, marble bathrooms and entertainment centers, along with a variety of services like housekeeping and laundry and a parking garage. The rate on a studio is up to $7,200 a month and a three-bedroom is as much as $30,000.
 About 70 percent of guests are corporate travelers. While there is a lot of that business in New York City, Pamela Malkani, a principal of the hospitality division at Millennium Partners, which built the club in 1996, said she did not anticipate a rush to develop other extended-stay hotels in the city. ''I don't know that it makes sense for someone to construct an extended-stay business in Midtown Manhattan today, with the high cost of real estate and construction,'' she said.
 The two branded extended-stay hotels now in New York also cater to short-term guests. At the Residence Inn by Marriott, only about 30 percent of the lodgers stay five or more nights, and the rest are short-term guests who pay more, said the hotel manager, Foiz Ahmed, of Interstate Hotels and Resorts, which runs the hotel. The operators have put together a marketing campaign aimed at increasing that level to 40 percent by year's end, he said. 
 At Extended Stay America in Queens, the ratio is 70 percent long-term guests and 30 percent short-term, which is fairly consistent for the brand across the country, Tim Groves, executive vice president for sales and marketing at Extended Stay Hotels, said. He says many of the guests at the Queens hotel are nurses and other medical professionals who commute to hospitals in Manhattan, a result of some hospitals' outsourcing of medical professionals. 
 The hotel's studio suites offer basic accommodations, including efficiency kitchens and limited housekeeping services, starting at $139.99 a night. 
 The Residence Inn New York Manhattan/Times Square, meanwhile, offers more upscale services in its suites, including daily housekeeping and a concierge, Mr. Ahmed said. ''Whether you're staying six days or six months,'' he said, ''you still need someone who's knowledgeable about New York City to be your guide.''
 Room rates there range from $259 to $699, depending on the season. Guests staying 30 nights or more receive a discount of around 27 percent.
 Ronnie Gross, a vice president at G Holdings, which developed the Residence Inn, said limited-service hotels affiliated with national brands could survive in New York because they appealed to a range of travelers cutting across economic lines. ''They're more attractive rate-wise and service-wise when times are bad, and when times are good, people are coming up from the lower tiers,'' he said.
 Extended-stay hotels in New York City that hew to the conventional model, with larger rooms and kitchenettes, are somewhat insulated from a market downturn, said Daniel Lesser, senior managing director of the hospitality group at CB Richard Ellis. ''These are laid out such that they could probably be converted to apartments, which is definitely something to consider,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Far-Eastern Campus for Kean

BYLINE: By JOHN KOBLIN

DATELINE: Union 

 BODY:
GLASSES clinked, toasts were made and then leaders of this 151-year-old institution were calling it the most important moment in its history.
 Kean University, a state institution with a student body made up mostly of commuters, is expected in September 2007 to become the first American university to open a newly designed campus in China.
The college, which would be named Kean University-Wenzhou, would grant Kean degrees, instruct all courses in English and serve thousands of Chinese students by 2010, when construction is completed. 
 But with all the bluster of university officials toasting each other at an event last week and describing the deal as their apogee, an obvious question arises: why Kean? 
 With powerhouses like Harvard and Princeton sitting on the sidelines, smaller state colleges like Kean are eyeing a ripe opportunity in China. 
 ''Education is about the only area the American economy hasn't entered yet,'' said Yawei Liu, a director at the Carter Center in Georgia. ''But making money is a big part of education in China and now American schools are moving east to find new sources of revenue.''
 What is striking about the arrangement is not its uniqueness, but Kean's aggressive push as such a minor player. The university -- with a student body of 13,000 -- admits 65 percent of its applicants and has a $5 million endowment, an emaciated figure in a world of bloated tuitions and bullish fund-raising. 
 And with state colleges facing a proposed cut of more than $150 million from Gov. Jon S. Corzine's proposed budget, the president of Kean, Dawood Farahi, said the move to China was driven heavily by money. 
 ''Education is really a commodity,'' Mr. Farahi said. ''It's a commodity that can be sold and marketed, so why don't we take advantage of what we have and market that to China since they want it?'' 
 Kean will not have to put down a single dollar, according to the president. It will be joining up with Wenzhou University, a bottom-tier university in the Zhejiang Province that will foot the bill, estimated at more than $60 million. This includes construction of the proposed campus of 300 acres. Wenzhou University will also pay for all faculty costs and the day-to-day operation of the school. 
 The nascent university will offer courses in education, public administration and business. It is expected to serve predominantly Chinese students, who will be held the same admissions standards as Kean students are now. 
 Leaders at the school are hopeful that as many as 300 of its New Jersey students can study in China and take the same courses on the far eastern satellite campus as they would in Union.
 The minutia of the university life is expected to be retained too, all the way from student organizations to residence life, all in the name of bringing a Western style of education out east. 
 But even with a working deal, there is still more work ahead. The Ministry of Education in China still needs to approve it and Dr. Farahi said that if anything changes, no matter how small, Kean will walk away. 
 For instance, if Kean's Chinese students are not allowed to access the United States version of Google, which permits information freely, unlike the Chinese-only Google that restricts information on issues like the Tiananmen Square massacre, everything is off. 
 ''That's a deal-breaker,'' said Dr. Farahi. ''Any violation of academic freedom and any difference with how we do it here, would not be acceptable.'' 
 The wide-scale ambition of the proposed Kean campus is unique, but certainly American schools already have a presence in China. Harvard Business School and the Northwestern Kellogg School of Management have had small programs for years and New York University is looking to open a new program in Shanghai by next summer. 
 But Kean's plan takes it a step farther and at least one university other plans to follow its lead. The State University of New York, will sign a deal next week with Nanjing University, allowing Chinese students to earn a SUNY degree. 
 And Kean and SUNY are on the heels of Nottingham University in England, the first school to announce a move into China. Indeed, education experts say that this is just the beginning. 
 ''This market is driven by the Chinese's deep value of education and their extremely high willingness to pay for it,'' said Xiaodong Lin, an associate professor of education at Columbia University. ''This is about a small, struggling American university and a small, struggling Chinese university hoping to find a niche,'' Dr. Lin added. 
 Indeed, Dr. Farahi admits as much. With an endowment and an alumni giving rate that he describes as ''very poor,'' he said the only way to narrow the divide between Kean and bigger state schools like Rutgers University, is by moving east. 
 ''In order to attract high-caliber students, name recognition is a major thing,'' he said. ''People know about other universities because of their football team. We can't afford a D-1 football team. This will give us the ability to be known.''

HEADLINE: In Address, McCain Gives Avid Defense Of Iraq War

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: LYNCHBURG, Va., May 13 

 BODY:
With the Rev. Jerry Falwell at his side, Senator John McCain offered a spirited defense of the Iraq war on Saturday, telling graduating students at Liberty University that victory there was crucial to world security. But Mr. McCain urged opponents of the war to vigorously ''state their opposition'' in the interest of critical debate on this increasingly unpopular conflict.
 ''If an American feels the decision was unwise, then they should state their opposition and argue for another course -- it is your right and obligation,'' Mr. McCain said, adding, ''But I ask that you consider the possibility that I, too, am trying to meet my responsibilities, to follow my conscience, to do my duty as best as I can, as God has given me light to see that duty.'' 
Mr. McCain, an Arizona Republican and a likely presidential candidate in 2008, made his remarks to 2,500 graduates in a high-profile appearance at the university, which was founded by Mr. Falwell, a conservative religious leader whom he once described as an agent of ''intolerance'' and a threat to the Republican Party. 
 The appearance came as Mr. McCain -- trying to establish an early dominance in the Republican presidential nomination battle -- has sought to ease tensions with Republican conservatives who have long been suspicious of his commitment to conservative ideals, a perception that was stirred by his difficult history with Mr. Falwell.
 Though the two men shared a stage here on Saturday, greeting each other warmly and drawing applause from the festive audience, Mr. McCain made only a brief mention of Mr. Falwell in his 28-minute speech. And Mr. McCain, who is normally eager to talk to reporters, left immediately after finishing his speech and before Mr. Falwell offered his greeting to graduates. Mr. McCain's aides said that he had to catch a plane for a speech later Saturday to the Utah Republican Party.
 Nearly 50 reporters came here to cover Mr. McCain's remarks, a showing that university officials described as huge for a commencement address in this remote central Virginia town.
 Mr. McCain is also the scheduled speaker at the graduation on Friday at the New School in New York. He intends to deliver the same remarks, his aides said, with the expectation that they may draw a less-than-enthusiastic reaction there, given that school's liberal nature. His planned appearance has caused an uproar among students and faculty because of his conservative positions on issues like Iraq.
 At a time when polls show public support for the war falling, and with calls on Capitol Hill for the United States to figure out a way to withdraw, Mr. McCain argued for staying in Iraq, even as he acknowledged the toll it had taken on the nation.
 ''Americans should argue about this war,'' he said. ''It has cost the lives of nearly 2,500 of the best of us. It has taken innocent life. It has imposed an enormous financial burden on our economy.''
 But he said he had not varied in his own support. 
 ''I stand that ground not to chase vainglorious dreams of empire; not for a noxious sense of racial superiority over a subject people; not for cheap oil,'' he said. ''I stand that ground because I believed, rightly or wrongly, that my country's interests and values required it.''
 Notably, Mr. McCain made no mention of his conservative positions on social issues like abortion and same-sex marriage.
 Mr. McCain's speech offered pleas for civility to an increasingly divided nation. 
 ''Ours is a noisy, contentious society, and always has been, for we love our liberties much,'' he said. ''And among those liberties we love most, particularly so when we are young, is our right to self-expression. That passion for self-expression sometimes overwhelms our civility, and our presumption that those with whom we have strong disagreements, wrong as they might be, believe that they, too, are answering the demands of their conscience.''
 Referring to his own brash political ways as a younger man, he said: ''It's a pity there wasn't a blogosphere then. I would have felt much at home in the medium.''

HEADLINE: A Border-Tightening Congressman Has Immigrants in His Own Backyard

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

DATELINE: SEAFORD, N.Y. 

 BODY:
A three-man crew of immigrant laborers had just finished the lawn work at the yellow house: grass trimmed, flower beds neatened, sidewalk edged and swept.
 The workers said they did not know the homeowner personally, but the one driving the landscaping truck, Elmer Martinez, 34, said that he must be someone important because of the brass plaque on the front door.
''Congressman Peter T. King,'' the plaque reads, ''3rd District, New York.''
 It is the modest home in Seaford of Representative King, a co-sponsor of legislation that would make felons of millions of illegal immigrants, tighten security and support the building of a wall along parts of the Mexican border. The bill, called the 2005 Border Protection, Anti-Terrorism and Illegal Immigration Control Act, has been passed by the House but not by the Senate. 
 Pushing a mower onto a nearby lawn, Mr. Martinez, who is from El Salvador, said he disagreed with such measures.
 ''I think if people come here and work hard, let them stay here,'' he said. Mr. Martinez has a green card and pays taxes on the $150 a day that he earns, he said. He and his wife, who is from Puerto Rico, have two sons, ages 3 and 5, who are American citizens.
 ''I came here because I can make better money than in my country,'' he said. ''There, I make $5 for working a whole day.''
 Another worker in the crew, Alfredo Garcia, 27, said that he, too, had emigrated from El Salvador to have a chance to make more money. Mr. Garcia said he had paid a guide to smuggle him into the United States through a combination of cars and trucks. He later obtained a work permit and legal residency status, he said.
 ''I paid a lot of money to come here, and I've worked hard in this country,'' Mr. Garcia said. 
 He gestured around the neighborhood, a white enclave on the South Shore of Long Island where one can seldom walk a block or two without seeing Spanish-speaking work crews. On a recent Friday morning, a half-dozen crews of Hispanic workers were tending homes within several blocks of Mr. King's house.
 Around the corner, a half-dozen workers from Ecuador and Honduras were fitting heavy stone onto a house facade. Nearby, two Guatemalan immigrants were nailing in roofing shingles, and another block down, a trio of Salvadoran immigrants, who said they had each paid several thousand dollars to be smuggled into the United States, were installing a brick driveway.
 When Mr. King's children, who are now adults, were young a few decades ago, that type of work was done by white American citizens, usually first- or second-generation descendants of the Irish, Italian and German immigrants who still populate Mr. King's district, which sprawls across suburban neighborhoods of single-family homes in Nassau County and western Suffolk.
 But today, Mr. Garcia said, ''You'll never see a white guy cutting a lawn around here; Spanish people do all the work in this area.'' 
 The third man working for Mr. King's landscaper said he spoke no English and declined to be interviewed. 
 Their employer, Steven Sander, has long been a neighbor of Mr. King's, grew up with his children and has been cutting his lawn for years.
 Mr. King does not make it his business to investigate the legal status of each landscaping employee cutting his lawn, Mr. Sander said, but rather trusts that Mr. Sander is employing legal immigrants. He said that his workers were all legal and that he demanded they have tax identification numbers.
 ''They pay taxes and pay into Social Security,'' Mr. Sander said. ''I wouldn't hire anyone without seeing their papers and Social Security number. It's too risky as an employer.''
 In a telephone interview, Representative King, a Republican who was first elected in 1992, said that his stance was not intended to deprive well-intentioned immigrants of the right to work hard for a living. Mr. King voted to remove the felony provisions from his immigration bill, in an amendment that was defeated.
 The priority for the country, he said, is the need to ''gain control of the borders'' for national security. 
 He stressed the need to ''seal the borders and penalize employers who hire illegal immigrants'' before adding mechanisms for illegal immigrants to become legal residents.
 ''I have no problem with increasing the amount of legal immigrants as guest workers, but we have to do it legally,'' he said. ''After 9/11, we don't have the luxury of allowing unlimited illegal immigrants into this country.''
 Asked about his lawn, he said that Mr. Sander used to play Little League with his son, Sean, and had been doing a great job on his lawn for years. He said he trusted Mr. Sander to ensure that the workers were legal.
 Patrick Santivasci, who lives nearby, said he was one of the few homeowners in the neighborhood to still cut their own lawns. 
 Illegal immigrants, he said, are ''taking jobs away from people who really do need them.''
 ''It's wrong that they come here without proper papers,'' Mr. Santivasci said. ''I'm liberal, but you can't milk the system. Ninety percent of them are sneaking their way in. It's a free country, but it's too free.''
 Another neighbor, Richard A. Yodice, 58, who was walking his dog while Mr. King's landscapers were working at another house, disagreed.
 ''They're not taking the jobs we would work,'' Mr. Yodice said. ''They're taking the nonskilled jobs. A white kid these days goes to college and gets into a white-collar job. They don't take the lower-end jobs anymore.
 ''I drive by the 7-Eleven and see hundreds of workers and see 60 or 70 guys swarming a contractor's truck,'' he said. ''I don't care if they're illegal, as long as they're working. I just don't like to see them taking money out of the economy here and sending it home.
 ''I'm a Republican and I always vote for King and read his columns, but I think he comes down too hard on the immigrants,'' Mr. Yodice said. ''I think he's trying to tie it in with the terrorism issue. You're here and working, maybe that's the answer -- if they're legit and working, let them stay.''
 Down the block, one of the workers putting in the driveway, Jose Pineda, 31, said he had borrowed $6,000 back in El Salvador for a ride in a truck to Los Angeles, and then wired back the payments over a year's time. He paid an immigration lawyer to get a work permit, Mr. Pineda said.
 He nodded toward his two workers, his nephew Moses Flores, 24, and his uncle Calixto Pineda, 39, and said they had both immigrated the same way but had paid almost $7,000 each. 
 Jose Pineda said he had learned masonry by working for Italian bricklayers and then had started his own business and had bought a house in Roosevelt. 
 ''They want to kick all the illegal Spanish workers out, but I don't think Americans want to do these kind of jobs anymore,'' he said. ''They all work in offices with their head, as lawyer or teachers or something. Of course, any illegal people who don't like to work should be sent back.''

HEADLINE: A Session Ends With Little Hoopla

BYLINE: By AVI SALZMAN

 BODY:
A YEAR ago, the General Assembly passed headline-grabbing legislation, including a new civil unions law and landmark campaign finance reform. This year, some of the most ambitious proposals made in the Legislature, like Gov. M. Jodi Rell's push to eliminate the car tax and a campaign to transform juvenile justice, never made it to a vote. 
 Instead, the 2006 session was filled with smaller good-faith gestures, to reassure teachers that the state will fund their pensions, convince voters that elections are fair, and persuade companies that Connecticut is business-friendly.
''There wasn't a lot of flash, but there was a lot of mending of things we lost in the past,'' said State Representative Toni Walker, a Democrat from New Haven. 
 In her closing address to the General Assembly, Mrs. Rell recounted the session's highlights, citing fiscal responsibility first. She also patted legislators on the back for meeting the state's obligations to the teachers' pension fund for the first time in five years. 
 Tax cuts also made the governor's list of accomplishments. The state slashed taxes on manufacturing equipment and eliminated the corporation tax surcharge. Under legislation signed by the governor this year, property taxes on manufacturing equipment and machinery will be phased out over the next five years. Property tax credits to homeowners increased to $500 and the Legislature passed new tax breaks for people making movies. If moviemakers spend more than $50,000 on a production, they will be eligible for a 30 percent tax credit.
 All those tax breaks put a smile on Senator John McKinney's face. Mr. McKinney, a Republican from Southport and the second-highest ranking Republican in the House, said the Democrats, who hold large majorities in both the House and Senate, had moved to the right on taxes.
 ''In the past we've had a traditional political split where Republicans support cutting business taxes'' and Democrats talk about raising taxes, he said. ''This year, quite frankly, the Democrats moved to our arguments, being job-friendly and helping the economy. We argued not about whether to cut taxes, but about which taxes to cut.''
 Democrats, however, took credit for the tax cuts and the state's plan for spurring job creation. The state's plan -- a potent campaign issue this year as Connecticut lagged behind most other states in job creation -- offers new grants and venture capital to companies developing new products. It also establishes pilot programs to spur math and science education in high school, offers loans to students pursuing engineering degrees and sets up a center to promote entrepreneurs and recruit faculty at the University of Connecticut.
 Mrs. Rell said in her closing statement that she was hoping to address energy costs, including dealing with the high price of gasoline and increasing the amount of electricity generated in the state, but as with numerous proposals this session, time simply ran out. This year's session was more focused on fine-tuning legislation introduced in 2005. The campaign finance reform bill passed this year is one example.
 The bill the Legislature passed in 2005 introduced numerous reforms, including banning contributions from lobbyists to political candidates and placing restrictions on contributions from companies doing business with the state. It also established a public financing system for campaigns. Though the bill was hailed by many lawmakers as a vast improvement over the old system, proponents acknowledged that it still contained too many loopholes. At the bill-signing ceremony last year, the governor vowed to close those loopholes.
 This year, after a series of squabbles on the last day of the session, the Legislature closed some of the loopholes. The bill wasn't brought up for a vote until the last few minutes of the session on May 3. Nonetheless, it passed unanimously in the Senate and by a broad margin in the House. The bill placed limits on the amount of money that political action committees controlled by leaders in the House and Senate can spend to support candidates who participate in the public financing system. It also made it easier for third-party candidates to receive public financing for campaigns and made it more difficult to derail the public financing system in court.
 Robert Ward, a Republican from Northford and the minority leader in the House, said he was upset at how the legislation was presented and complained that the Republicans had not had a chance to review it thoroughly. Despite those concerns, Mr. Ward voted yes on the bill.
 ''Campaign finance reform should have been taken up weeks ago,'' he said. ''The final bill is weaker than it should have been. I think the Democrats deliberately held it to the end.''
 James Amann, the Democratic speaker of the House, said Republicans in the Senate had approved the revisions and that they had been the subject of discussions for many weeks.
 ''It was the most well-run, well-oiled session in 20 years,'' he said.
 Mr. Amann pointed to the passage of a $2.3 billion transportation package that funds both mass transit and highway projects over the next decade as one of the session's most significant successes. Some of that money will be used to develop commuter rail service from New Haven to Springfield. The package also includes funding to upgrade ports on Long Island Sound so cargo can be moved over water and reduce the number of trucks on Interstate 95.
 Although he said he considered the overall session a success, Mr. Amann acknowledged that certain issues did not get addressed. One of the most controversial issues that some legislators felt got short shrift was eminent domain. Since the United States Supreme Court ruled last year in Kelo v. New London that private property could be condemned and redeveloped by another private owner, lawmakers have discussed changing the state's eminent domain laws. The Legislature did pass a law creating an ombudsman to oversee condemnations and help homeowners, but some lawmakers were upset that further measures failed.
 ''I don't think eminent domain should ever be allowed for purposes of economic development,'' Mr. McKinney said. 
 Mr. Amann said he was also disappointed that the Legislature did not pass a more comprehensive eminent domain bill.
 ''It was a failure this legislative session,'' he said.
 Another proposal that received strong grassroots support early in the session, but never made it to a vote was a plan to raise the age of adult incarceration in the state. Currently, Connecticut is one of three states that treats people as young as 16 as adults in the criminal justice system. A bill to raise the age to 18 was criticized by some officials for being too expensive because it would expand the juvenile justice system to include 16- and 17-year-olds. Although it did not make it to a vote, the Legislature did set up a committee to study how best to approach youth crime and rehabilitation.
 ''I would have liked to have an opportunity to debate it on the floor,'' said Ms. Walker, who pushed the bill through the Judiciary Committee. But Ms. Walker acknowledged that reforming the juvenile justice system is ''not going to be an overnight change'' and said the committee is an important first step.
 Other proposals also foundered in this year's session. The governor's plan to eliminate the property taxes that towns collect on cars was big news early in the session, but the buzz didn't last. The state would have had to take away the property tax credit to make up for the loss in car tax receipts, causing Lt. Gov. Kevin Sullivan, a Democrat to call the plan a ''gimmick paid for with increased income taxes for middle- and lower-income taxpayers.''
 When lawmakers signed the final $16 billion budget bill, the car tax wasn't part of it. Mrs. Rell registered her disapproval and vowed to bring the proposal back.
 ''I'll be honest with you, I think the biggest disappointment of course is that the car tax elimination is not in there,'' she said, referring to the budget. ''It is the art of compromise and there is nothing that would preclude us from going back and taking a look at that again next year and frankly even working at it over the summer.''
 Mr. Ward, who also supported the car tax, said its removal took the shine off the session.
 ''That was the one bold initiative,'' he said. ''I viewed it as kind of a status quo session.''

HEADLINE: Charity Begins at Home, but Must It Stay There?

BYLINE: By John J. Miller. 
John J. Miller, a writer for National Review, is the author of ''A Gift of Freedom: How the John M. Olin Foundation Changed America.''

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
''PHILANTHROPY seems to me to have become simply the refuge of people who wish to annoy their fellow creatures,'' complains Mrs. Cheveley in Oscar Wilde's 1895 play ''An Ideal Husband.''
 In our own day, perhaps no philanthropy has annoyed more conservatives than the Ford Foundation. It looms large in the right-wing imagination as a menacing underwriter of left-wing causes. What annoys conservatives above all, of course, is their belief that Henry Ford himself never would have allowed his fortune to be used for the purposes to which it is now being put -- millions of dollars for the American Civil Liberties Union, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund and the Natural Resources Defense Council, and none for the presumably more Ford-friendly American Enterprise Institute, Heritage Foundation and Institute for Justice. 
But whatever its flaws, the Ford Foundation, which was started by Henry's son, Edsel, is a private institution in a free society. It should not have to endure political shakedowns, even when they come from well-meaning conservatives -- as is happening right now in Michigan, where Attorney General Mike Cox, a Republican, is demanding that the foundation increase its spending in the Detroit area. Conservatives may be tempted to think they stand to gain from any attack on the Ford Foundation, but in reality they have much to lose. Everybody does, in fact, no matter what his politics. 
 On a certain level, Mr. Cox's motivation is understandable. With the domestic auto industry in a slump, Michigan's nonprofit groups are scrambling for funds. They would certainly welcome a return to the days when the Ford Foundation bankrolled the Henry Ford Hospital, the Henry Ford Museum and other local worthies. Mr. Cox estimates that until the early 1970's, the foundation gave an average of more than $50 million annually (adjusted for inflation) to Michigan recipients, and that this figure has plummeted in recent years to less than $3 million. ''It's really like the legacy of Henry and Edsel Ford has been kidnapped,'' Mr. Cox told The Detroit News.
 Yet if the Fords' legacy truly has been hijacked, then Henry and Edsel are not its innocent victims but its primary culprits. Today's Ford Foundation is the result of what happens when wealthy capitalists establish charitable foundations with poorly defined missions and then appoint trustees who do not share their principles. The Fords simply did nothing to ensure that their fortune wouldn't fall into the hands of the left, or into the hands of people who have no special interest in Detroit. 
 If conservatives choose to ignore this failure, then they are buying into one of Henry Ford's most notorious comments: ''History is more or less bunk.'' It is hard to imagine a less conservative viewpoint. Moreover, many conservatives like to describe themselves as strict constructionists who seek to abide by the literal meaning of legal documents such as the Constitution. Their approach to foundations and donor intent should be no different, even when a strict constructionist approach to vaguely worded mission statements yields a displeasing result.
 At the very least, conservatives are certainly not entitled to try to correct the Fords' blunder through political intimidation. Attorneys general have a role to play in monitoring the activities of foundations -- they must guard against corruption and fraud -- but they should not threaten investigations or lawsuits merely because they don't care for the content of grants. This is a principle that ought to find adherents on all points of the political spectrum.
 Conservatives certainly have much to gain from abiding by it. In Missouri three years ago, the state attorney general questioned the giving of the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, the largest philanthropy in Kansas City. The Kauffman Foundation is by no means a right-wing outfit -- it helps subsidize National Public Radio -- but its emphasis on education and entrepreneurship makes it far more amenable to conservatives than the Ford Foundation. After a year of negotiations, the Kauffman Foundation eventually altered some of its bylaws to guarantee a certain level of spending on local projects.
 The result was not wholly unwelcome, but the method was worrisome. The heads of many foundations will say, at least in private, that they don't fear the Internal Revenue Service, which oversees their tax status, nearly as much as they do an attorney general with a political agenda and a hunger for publicity.
 Besides, conservatives in Michigan may come to regret it if the Ford Foundation suddenly looks homeward. Some of its recent spending in the state has included support for the University of Michigan's (successful) legal defense of racial preferences in its admissions policies. This year, the foundation might lavish funds on groups that are working to defeat the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative, a ballot measure that would prohibit state and local government from granting preferential treatment based on race.
 If that happened, Mr. Cox would have succeeded merely in helping the Ford Foundation annoy the right even more.

HEADLINE: France Debates Downloads, With Teenager As Top Expert 

BYLINE: By THOMAS CRAMPTON; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
In the current debate over laws governing music downloads here, some condemn Aziz Ridouan as an advocate of criminal piracy, while others say he represents the new generation of online consumers. 
 In either case, just about everyone involved listens to what Mr. Ridouan, an 18-year-old high school student, has to say.
''All sides must listen to Aziz because he has an entire generation behind him,'' said Julien Dourgnon, economic director of the Consumer's Federal Union, one of the largest consumer advocacy groups in France. ''He may still be in high school, but Aziz has a more profound understanding of copyright law than most lawyers and members of Parliament.'' 
 New proposals to govern music piracy have faced a roller coaster ride through both the French legislature and public opinion here. The National Assembly passed legislation that could force Apple Computer and other companies to make songs purchased on their proprietary online services playable on any MP3 device. The Senate, responding to corporate arguments against such openness, appears ready to approve a weaker version of the law soon. 
 Mr. Ridouan, who began lobbying with protests against America Online when he was 12, first came to the national media's attention in 2004 as the founder of the Audionautes -- which roughly translates as ''the audio surfers.'' The Audionautes is a nonprofit association that provides legal assistance to those accused of illegally downloading music, many of whom were taken to court by the Civil Society of Phonographic Producers, the French equivalent of the Recording Industry Association of America. 
 ''When I started raising the issue, many politicians didn't even know the term downloading,'' Mr. Ridouan said. ''My role often involves telling politicians and audiences what high school students like me are doing today.'' 
 When he was on vacation from school in early May, Mr. Ridouan spent five days in Paris meeting members of Parliament and juggling more than half a dozen media appearances before leading several hundred protesters through the streets of Paris. 
 ''Aziz has been courageous in fighting the medieval-style crusade the music industry runs against music downloaders,'' said Christian Paul, a member of the Socialist Party. ''Sooner or later the music industry will learn they need to adapt to Aziz and his generation.''
 To adversaries, Mr. Ridouan merely offers facile rationalizations for theft. 
 ''You might call him Robin Hood if he gave to the poor by only stealing from the rich. But downloading doesn't just take money from Tom Cruise and Madonna,'' said Pascal Rogard, the director general of the Society of Dramatic Authors and Composers, a group dedicated to protecting authors' copyrights. ''There are many smaller artists who live from the earnings that Aziz refuses to give them.'' 
 French-born of parents, now divorced, who immigrated from Morocco, Mr. Ridouan lives in a government-subsidized building in the central Loire region of France with his mother, who works as a cleaning woman. He introduced his association in 2004 by declaring his downloading habit in the middle of a news conference called by a music industry trade group to announce a crackdown on 50 Internet pirates. 
 ''Until we started speaking out in public, downloaders were only shown on television like terrorists, with their face hidden and voice scrambled,'' Mr. Ridouan said. 
 At the news conference, where he held the Hewlett-Packard laptop computer he always seems to carry above his head, Mr. Ridouan added: ''I am proud to tell anyone that I download and have plenty of music, movies and TV series on my computer.'' 
 The amount of media and consumer attention given to Apple Computer's iTunes service serves only to demonstrate how badly the entertainment industry has addressed young people, Mr. Ridouan said. 
 ''The price for downloaded music is set at a level that includes the cost of making and shipping a compact disc,'' Mr. Ridouan said, pointing to the similarity of music prices in shops and online. ''You can be certain that the money they saved is not going back to the artists.'' 
 Mr. Ridouan said he was eager and willing to compensate artists, but not at the rate that record companies demanded. As for the amount he can pay, Mr. Ridouan said that for a high school student living with his single mother, he cannot afford much. 
 ''The Internet is a magnificent new way to distribute culture, and why should I be stopped because of my limited means?'' Mr. Ridouan said. ''The Internet serves my generation the same role as the library did for previous generations.'' 
 The solution advocated by Mr. Ridouan is to create a fund, financed by fees from Internet users and Internet service providers, to pay artists based on the popularity of their works, similar to the system used by radio stations. 
 Legalizing all Internet downloading for a small fee was briefly tagged onto the copyright law in December by the National Assembly, then discarded. 
 Mr. Ridouan, who intends to study political science in college, said his Audionautes-financed lobbying did not hurt his studies. He has missed some school but has a note from the French interior minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, excusing him from class when he meets with government officials. 
 ''There's no need for me to fake notes to skip class ever since I got Sarkozy's written permission,'' said Mr. Ridouan. ''I don't even have the note anymore because my teacher wanted to keep it as a souvenir.''

HEADLINE: Politics Stalls Plan to Bolster Flood Coverage

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW and JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
If ever there was a moment for the obscure federal flood insurance program to ride to the rescue, it would seem to have been in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. 
 Its premiums were supposed to insure homeowners in flood-prone areas and also protect taxpayers from spending billions to bail out flood victims. But with Hurricane Katrina, the program failed on both counts.
Nearly half the victims did not even have flood insurance. Claims from homeowners who were insured, $25 billion worth, bankrupted the program. And the government has had to commit $15 billion in additional taxpayer money for rebuilding in Louisiana and Mississippi.
 Now, an effort to rescue the insurance program that grew in Hurricane Katrina's wake is faltering, too. Though experts foresee a generation of fiercer and more frequent storms, Congress seems unlikely to make more than modest changes when it takes up the program in the coming weeks. 
 The drive to restructure the perennially underfinanced program has been blocked by real estate interests, who worry that requiring millions more people to buy flood insurance would stifle development, and by lawmakers from areas that rarely flood who see their constituents as supporting those who are frequently flooded, particularly in the South.
 ''You've got people living in dry areas paying for people who want to keep living in wet ones,'' said Representative Candice S. Miller, Republican of Michigan. ''They're sticking it to us, and I don't like to be stuck.''
 The inability over decades to work out who pays the bill for flooding is at the heart of the weaknesses in the insurance program so blatantly laid bare by Hurricane Katrina. 
 A close examination of the program shows how those same lobbying pressures and regional rivalries have helped create an insurance plan that has consistently defied the central rule of how to succeed in the insurance trade: have enough policyholders paying enough in premiums to spread out the risk and build a financial cushion against disaster. 
 Since its beginning in the late 1960's, the flood program has struggled against a basic handicap: Most people, except those in the clearest path of danger, believe they do not need it. 
 So, in an effort to make the insurance affordable and attractive to reluctant homeowners, the government has kept premiums artificially low -- typically $300 to $400 a year for coverage up to $250,000. At the same time, though, it has limited the size of the program's flood zones -- the only areas in which many people are required to buy the policies. 
 A result, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, is an insurance plan in serious danger, groping for a politically palatable way to grow. 
 Testifying before Congress this year, the flood program's acting director, David I. Maurstad, acknowledged that it faced ''numerous challenges on a variety of fronts.'' But insurance officials also say the program, which takes in only $2.2 billion in fees each year, was never meant to handle a devastating storm like Hurricane Katrina. 
 Even so, many of the program's critics in Congress and elsewhere argue that it can and should be rebuilt as a stronger hedge against a less-catastrophic run of storms. 
 ''It hasn't come close to its promise of insuring everyone who's in danger of being flooded, reducing the cost of disasters for the federal government or making sure the program ultimately pays its own way,'' said J. Robert Hunter, who once ran the program and is director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America. 
 ''It's like a trip through the looking glass,'' he added. ''Everything is backwards.''

Asking Beneficiaries to Pay
 The idea of federal flood insurance began in the early 1950's with President Harry S. Truman, after big floods in his home state, Missouri. Private insurers would not provide the coverage, arguing that only those most likely to be flooded would buy it, and that an avalanche of claims would bring big financial losses. 
 But what finally brought the idea to fruition nearly two decades later was a desire to do something about the rising cost of federal disaster relief. In particular, Congress felt it was important that the beneficiaries helped pay the bill. 
 Under the program, the Federal Emergency Management Agency maps areas along coasts, lakes and rivers with significant flood risk -- a 1 percent chance of flooding in any year -- and tries to sell insurance to people in or near them. Though more than 4.8 million people have the policies, that includes only about half the households in the flood zones.
 To attract buyers, the government discounted the premiums, some to a fraction of what a private company would have charged. But initially, no one was required to buy flood insurance, and hardly anyone did. 
 ''People would just say, 'It won't happen to me,' '' George K. Bernstein, the program's first administrator, said in an interview.
 Gilbert F. White, a retired professor whose research in the mid-1960's laid the foundation for the program, said the government originally considered larger flood zones but pulled back under pressure from homebuilders and real estate developers. 
 The program also linked the availability of insurance to agreements by local governments to enact new building codes intended to reduce flood damage, mainly by raising houses above expected flood levels. But the real estate interests persuaded many communities to stay out of the program, Mr. Bernstein said. 

A Program Overwhelmed
 In the summer of 1972, Hurricane Agnes caused $400 million in flood damage along the Eastern Seaboard; only $5 million was covered by insurance. Soon after, Congress made the insurance mandatory for people in the flood zones with federally regulated mortgages. 
 These measures let the program expand just enough to limp along. Over the years, it paid out almost $15 billion in claims, borrowing from the Treasury in bad years and paying the money back, with interest, in quieter times. But by early last year, the fund had slipped into the red again, drained by $2 billion in claims from the hurricanes in Florida in 2004. 
 Then came Hurricane Katrina. 
 Along the Mississippi coast, waves up to 30 feet high surged past the flood-zone boundaries. Federal figures show that two-thirds of the 46,000 flooded homes and apartments in Mississippi were outside the zones. One problem was the flood maps, which had not been updated in more than a decade and no longer reflected the true danger. 
 In New Orleans, the program stumbled on another assumption: though experts had long warned that a terrible hurricane could top the levees and inundate the low-lying city, that possibility was never factored into the hazard calculations. Instead, the mapmakers focused solely on the impact of heavy rains. 
 Luckily for New Orleans, which often floods in bad rains, the bulk of the city was in the flood zones. So 65 percent of the 54,000 flooded homeowners had at least some insurance.
 But a few areas that flooded badly from the levee breaks, like much of the Lower Ninth Ward, were outside the zones. Relatively few people there, or among the city's large population of renters, had insurance. And many others had only enough to cover their mortgages, leaving little cash to rebuild.
 Joy Fortune, a retired bank executive, and her 86-year-old mother, Hazel Castanel, had a $73,000 flood policy on their beige brick home. But after the house sat in six feet of water for two weeks, an adjuster estimated the damage at $124,000, leaving them $51,000 short.
 At first, it looked as if they would not be able to rebuild. But then the Bush administration and Congress came up with $15 billion in grants to make up for gaps in insurance. ''We want to go back,'' Ms. Fortune said. ''It's my home and it's our life.''
 Even with the gaps, the program was swamped by $25 billion in claims from Hurricane Katrina and two other hurricanes last fall, and it will need to borrow all that money from the government to pay them. What is more, insurance officials say they doubt they will be able to pay much of it back, leaving taxpayers with the bill just as if there were no insurance program. 
 It was with that huge bill in mind that two influential congressmen -- Michael G. Oxley, an Ohio Republican who heads the Financial Services Committee, and Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat -- drafted legislation that would have greatly expanded the flood zones to draw millions more homeowners into the program. The new zones would have encompassed areas considered only one-fifth as susceptible to flooding in any given year. 

'A Unique Opportunity'
 Flood experts, consumer advocates, environmentalists and some insurance experts welcomed the move. But lobbyists for homebuilders, real estate agents and mortgage lenders cautioned lawmakers that the extra cost of flood insurance could hurt housing sales and slow the economy. The program ''may need a tune-up, but I don't think it needs radical change,'' David L. Pressly Jr., president of the National Association of Home Builders, said in an interview. 
 In mid-November, a senior Republican on the Financial Services Committee, Richard H. Baker of Louisiana, proposed a compromise -- keeping the current flood zones but requiring coverage for everyone in those areas and in areas adjacent to levees, like those that flooded in New Orleans.
 But the committee narrowly adopted an amendment from Rep. Gary G. Miller, a Republican and a former homebuilder from California, which mandated a study of the situation while FEMA put together a clearer picture of the expanded zones.
 In a recent interview, Mr. Miller said he had no problem with requiring people in areas like New Orleans to buy the insurance, and perhaps having them pay more for it. But expanding the flood zones, he said, amounted to going to people in, say, Los Angeles and telling them: ''We need to raise revenue, so we're going to make you buy into a program that you really are never going to need and never benefit from anyway.'' 
 The bill, which the House is expected to take up in the next two weeks, now calls for updating the nation's flood maps, increasing premiums, and reducing subsidies on small businesses and second homes. It would also raise the maximum coverage on a house to $337,000 from $250,000. In all, these changes could bring in perhaps $500 million more a year. 
 Mr. Frank of Massachusetts said there was ''not as much improvement as we'd like, but it's the best we're able to get right now.'' Lobbyists and legislative aides said they expected no major strengthening of the legislation when the Senate takes it up in coming weeks. 
 Around the country, opposition to expanding the program seems to be growing. In Michigan, Representative Miller said she was so angry about the program's inequities that she was considering urging that the state withdraw from it. People in her rarely flooded district, she said, had paid four times more in premiums than they had received in claims in the past 10 years. 
 By contrast, even before Hurricane Katrina, homeowners in just three hurricane-prone states -- Florida, Louisiana and Texas -- had received nearly half the money paid by the program since 1978, federal figures show. 
 Some experts say the program needs to shift from its ''one size fits all'' approach, which uses the same standards to set rates and the size of flood zones around the nation, to one that takes into account the degree of risk in each area, much as a private insurance plan would. But program officials say they do not believe they have enough history of claims in many areas to make reliable distinctions. 
 Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group, said the shock of Hurricane Katrina had provided ''a unique opportunity for quantum reform'' of the flood program. But he said the steps now being contemplated ''will do relatively little to protect people who live in flood zones and to protect taxpayers around the country.''
 Looming over the debate are the warnings from meteorologists. Christopher W. Landsea, science and operations officer at the National Hurricane Center, says warmer ocean temperatures and less disruptive wind currents could make the next two or three decades much more active for hurricanes. 
 And scientists at Colorado State University recently predicted that there could be as many as five intense hurricanes this year. The chance of one striking the Gulf Coast is nearly 50 percent.

POLITI, ACHILIO FRANCESCO ''FRANCIS,''

 BODY:
 POLITI -- Achilio Francesco ''Francis,'' 95, of Roxbury, VT, died Monday, May 8, 2006, at the Mayo Healthcare in Northfield, VT. He was born in Northfield on March 17, 1911, the son of Emilio and Maria (Ambrosini) Politi. He attended Northfield schools, as well as Eastman College in Poughkeepsie, NY, and Columbia. 
Mr. Politi had started a monument business in Poughkeepsie. At the outbreak of WWII, he set aside his business to support the war effort and traveled to Washington, DC, where he accepted a position in the New Deal Office of Price Stabilization, becoming one of the first government employees to work on the War Productions Board. He later worked in the State Department where he served on the Board of Economic Warfare. He traveled to neutral countries, such as Argentina and Brazil, where he bought up vast stores of commodities like leather, sugar and beef, and sent them to Russia, effectively channeling them away from the Axis powers. Later, when the United States was desperate for elemental silver for the manufacture of electronics, he traveled to Mexico, bought up pesos, and sent railraod cars full of silver coins back across the border, which nearly caused the Mexican economy to collapse for lack of hard currency. After the war Mr. Politi was a top executive at Carborundum International, where he personally established manufacturing operations in more than a dozen cities worldwide. He was able to conduct business in English, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and French. His industrial negotiations took him to Latin America, Europe and the Middle East. Operating from Geneva, he entertained many of the world's richest leaders, closing enormous financial deals with a handshake. His resume later included CEO positions at three international corporations. Before retiring to Roxbury, VT, he maintained residences in Switzerland, Peekskill, NYC, Ft. Lauderdale, as well as Roxbury. In the mid 1980's Mr. Politi's longtime informal association with Norwich University became formalized when he helped establish the Brigadier General Elizabeth P. Hoisington Award, presented annually to the top senior female cadet. Elected to the Norwich University Board of Fellows in 1987, he served on the Peace Corps committee, and in 1996 the University awarded him an honorary Doctorate of Business Administration Degree. In 2004 Mr. Politi established the Politi International Fund, a resource aimed at offering Norwich students an international educational experience. Mr. Politi was also a significant supporter of the Edmundite Fathers and St. Michael's College in Colchester, VT. He enjoyed hosting the annual bocce ball tournament and barbeque for his community friends, Peekskill friends, as well as his friends from St. Michael's and Norwich. Despite his global business experience and entrepreneurial success, he always considered his true ''home'' to be Vermont. Mr. Politi is survived by a nephew, Domenic R. Politi of Stowe, VT, and a cousin, Elvira Lockwood of Peekskill. He was predeceased by his brothers, Domenic and Ugo Politi. A Memorial Mass will be celebrated at St. John the Evangelist Church in Northfield, VT, at a later date. Donations may be made in his memory to the Norwich University General Fund, 1 Winooski Park, Colchester, VT 05439. A Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated Wednesday, May 17, at 10 AM, at the Church of the Assumption, Peekskill, NY. Interment to follow at Hillside Cemetery, Cortlandt Manor, NY. Visiting at the DorseyCarlone Funeral Home, Peekskill, on Tuesday, 4-8 pm

HEADLINE: About That Free Trade 

 BODY:
Global talks to liberalize farm and industrial trade are on life support, and there is not a single character in the cast of supposed free-trade advocates around the world willing to step up and be the doctor. 
 Not President Bush, who has downgraded the stature of his trade office by appointing a technocrat, Susan Schwab, to succeed his political ally, Rob Portman. Not Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, who has allowed the trade component of his campaign to end global poverty to fall by the wayside. And certainly not the European Union's trade chief, Peter Mandelson, who has not lifted a finger to prod big concessions out of the bureaucrats, labor leaders and farmers in France who live, eat, sleep and drink a steady diet of government subsidies.
After another in a long-running series of missed deadlines, things are looking grim. And that is a disgrace that highlights the complete hypocrisy of all those speeches about abolishing global poverty that the leaders of rich countries gave last year. 
 This round of trade talks was supposed to finally address more than a half-century of unfairness in the global trade system. Back in 1947, when 23 nations agreed to start an international organization to promote trade and arbitrate disputes, the needs of poor countries mattered little. Industrialized nations were rebuilding after World War II, and they remained the economic masters of Asia, Africa and Latin America.
 Over the next 50 years, that club, now known as the World Trade Organization, aggressively dismantled barriers against trade in industrial goods and services -- the areas in which its members hold a comparative advantage. That same club dragged its feet on dismantling barriers against trade in agriculture and textiles, where poor countries have an advantage.
 All of that was supposed to change after 2001, when, reeling from the Sept. 11 attack and under intense pressure from the developing world, America, Europe and Japan agreed to slash agricultural subsidies while further liberalizing world trade in services and manufactured goods. Since then, negotiators have, unsurprisingly, made big strides toward agreeing how to cut tariffs in the areas important to the rich countries: manufactured goods, and, to a lesser extent, services. But the talks are stuck on agriculture. 
 The Europeans are the most to blame. But that does not mean the United States does not partake in the shame as well. America has proposed cuts in subsidies to farmers, but it needs to go further. Meanwhile, back in Washington, where lawmakers are preparing for the midterm elections, there is talk now that America should extend, rather than modify, its farm support laws. That is going in the wrong direction.
 World trade talks are notorious for coming back to life after being declared dead. But for thatto happen, someone has to call in the paramedics. Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair are the most likely candidates.
 There is still time to demonstrate that all that talk last year about making poverty history was not just talk.

HEADLINE: Less Than Meets the Eye

 BODY:
President Bush recently discussed the idea of expanding a tax credit for drivers who buy hybrid cars. At first glance, the notion seems like a winner and generally consistent with Mr. Bush's newfound enthusiasm for alternative fuels and technologies. But on closer inspection, the idea looks like a self-serving political ploy -- a quick fix to give the appearance of progress while obscuring serious contradictions in Mr. Bush's approach to oil independence. 
 The tax credit currently on the books offsets some of the extra cost of hybrid cars, but it is fully available only for the first 60,000 that a manufacturer sells. After that, the amount of the credit dwindles, eventually to zero. If Mr. Bush removed that 60,000-car cap it would presumably lead to the manufacture and sale of more hybrids than would otherwise be the case. That's fine. The problem is that more hybrids are unlikely to reduce overall oil consumption, unless there is a concurrent increase in fuel economy standards. Today's standard for cars -- 27.5 miles per gallon -- is a fleetwide average. So if carmakers sold more high-mileage hybrids, they could also sell ever-bigger gas guzzlers and still meet the target.
Mr. Bush is a happy man when he is doling out tax breaks. But he is clearly uncomfortable with imposing higher fuel economy standards on automakers.
 His often-repeated claim that he awaits Congressional permission to raise the standard is a delaying tactic, and especially cynical for a president who has run roughshod over Congressional authority. Ditto his claim that it will take further study to determine a fair and practical new standard. The 27.5-m.p.g. benchmark is the same now as it was in 1985. In the more than two decades since then, there has been ample study and debate on achievable improvements to what is by now a pathetically low standard. What has been missing all those years, and is missing now, is the political leadership to make those improvements. 
 Without higher standards, more tax credits for hybrids are all carrot and no stick. That's pandering, and that's just what American drivers do not need.

HEADLINE: The Pageantry of Wagner and a Young Knight Looking for Truth

BYLINE: By BERNARD HOLLAND

 BODY:
In the dark days before CD's, DVD's and bootleg boutiques, piracy of intellectual property thrived, though on a more primitive scale than today. In 1903 the Metropolitan Opera was itself a culprit in the ''Case of the Pilfered 'Parsifal.' '' 
 Wagner's soaring crypto-religious pageant, in gestation for more than 30 years and finished in 1882, was to be a kind of house opera: its performance restricted to the composer's own festival in Bayreuth, Germany; its function, a vernal reawakening in music and stage pictures, somewhere between a church service and an ancient rite of spring. Not incidentally, tourists would come to see it, bolstering the economy of Bayreuth, not to mention that of Wagner's soon-to-be-widowed wife. 
Conscious that international copyright laws had shorter arms in those times, the Met defied the embargo. Cosima Wagner sued but lost. The righteous among the world's opera houses howled, but stopped howling when exclusive rights to ''Parsifal'' expired 10 years later, making the opera available to them as well.
 The Met, as it has so often in the last 103 years, returned to the scene of the crime on Friday night, bringing with it a cast of improbable depth and eminence, splendid orchestral playing guided by Peter Schneider and chilled and misty forest settings designed by Otto Schenk. ''Parsifal'' deals in Teutonic knighthood, Christian relics (the spear of Jesus' crucifixion, the Holy Grail), a disgraced and wounded king, evil incarnate in the person of Klingsor (to many, a scarcely disguised symbol of anti-Semitism) and a pure fool whose peregrinations of self-discovery will heal them all.
 Recent Met audiences have become accustomed, if not addicted, to the fluid, almost physically sensuous ''Parsifal'' of James Levine, now injured. Mr. Schneider, filling in, conducted with more angles and, in general, a more sober sense of probity, all the while in absolute control of the Met orchestra's transparent sound and subtle responsiveness. Born in Vienna and active in Germany, he should appear in New York more often.
 The role of Kundry is that of a lone woman surrounded by men, but Waltraud Meier made it the star turn of the evening. Known as volatile both onstage and off, Ms. Meier is suited to the part, propelling herself into it like a wide-bore, high-explosive cannon shell. This was singing of fierceness and fearlessness, all of it pertinent to the persona she represented. Ms. Meier gives all and takes risks, and her audience went crazy for her.
 As Parsifal, Ben Heppner, though a little dry in Act I, sang himself into the kind of voice that has made him our reigning heldentenor. It was also interesting to hear a young sound emerging from the mouth of the traditionally decrepit Gurnemanz. Rene Pape's calm, luxurious command wiped away all traces of the boredom some singers can attach to the part. Thomas Hampson has made something of a specialty of the agonized, desperate Amfortas. Nikolai Putilin was the bald and bulky Klingsor. Robert Lloyd sang Titurel.
 It would be customary to say that the five hours flew by. More accurately, this astonishing music made its listeners slower: captive to a different and stretched-out time scheme. Some ''Parsifal'' addicts want it not to end at all, to go on all night. For them there is the consolation of a residue we take home with us, a physical sensation that can resonate inside the head for days.

''Parsifal'' continues tonight and Thursday at the Met, Lincoln Center; (212) 362-6000.

 CORRECTION:
A review on Monday about ''Parsifal,'' at the Metropolitan Opera, referred imprecisely to the design of the forest settings. While Otto Schenk, the producer, is responsible for the overall look of the production, the sets were designed by Gunther Schneider-Siemssen.

HEADLINE: Data Leaks Shake Up Carbon Trade

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS; Katrin Bennhold contributed reporting from Paris for this article.

DATELINE: LONDON, May 15 

 BODY:
It had a promising start, hailed by traders, policy makers and environmentalists as a way to curb global warming with the craft of capitalism. After a banner first year, though, the carbon trading market has suffered a bout of nose dives, missteps and misreadings, leading now to a clamor for major change. 
 It may be just growing pains. But it could point to big problems ahead in carrying out the dictates of the Kyoto Protocol, which many countries are counting on to manage climate change. 
Volume hit $10 billion in 2005, and may grow to as much as $30 billion this year, according to World Bank estimates. By comparison, the value of the entire wheat crop of the United States in 2005 was $7.1 billion. 
 ''The market is nervous and needs to see moves to a more reliable structure to get back its credibility,'' said Ingo Ramming, managing director of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein's emissions business in London.
 More than just trading profits are at stake. ''This is the instrument that politicians choose to achieve climate change targets,'' Mr. Ramming said. If countries are serious about global warming, he added, ''the regulation and framework needs to be right.'' 
 The trading of carbon credits -- which polluters must buy to offset any excess emissions beyond the limits established by international treaty -- has long been considered the driving force behind Kyoto and Europe's plan to reduce greenhouse gases. (The Bush administration has declined to participate in the treaty or the carbon market.) 
 In recent weeks, though, the market gyrations have prompted calls for swift restructuring from participants, environmentalists and government officials. One focus of the complaints is the release of data.
 The most glaring mishap occurred in April, when some scanty information trickled into the marketplace; last Friday, more official data was mistakenly put onto a government Web site and then quickly removed -- but not before it was noticed by market players. 
 In both cases, the market took a jolt because the information showed that European nations had overestimated the amount of carbon emissions their companies had produced. 
 Companies are assigned limits for their emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide, and they need to buy ''carbon credits'' if they want to pollute more. Alternatively, if they pollute less, they can sell their unused credits on the open market. The European Commission's official figures for 2005 were released on Monday, and they show that 21 of the 25 member states produced 44.1 million tonnes (45.92 million United States tons) less carbon dioxide, or 2.5 percent under the level that market participants had been operating on. 
 Taken on face value, this would seem like good news: after all, lowering carbon dioxide is the ultimate goal. But many participants say that governments, under pressure from industry, may have originally overestimated the amount of carbon credits their companies would need. 
 According to this view, the overestimation made it possible for these companies to sell their extra credits and make money without having to actually work hard to reduce emissions or improve efficiency to reach their Kyoto goals. 
 But with the excess in the carbon trading market, traders sold large batches of their credits, sending prices on a roller-coaster ride. With many players suffering significant losses, the experience threatens to drive out participants. 
 The emissions trading system is now facing criticism from several groups of advocates who usually take opposite sides: environmentalists and traders. 
 ''Governments have been cheated by the big industries, which gave them the wrong assumptions for their emissions,'' said Stephen Singer, head of the European climate and energy policy unit of the World Wildlife Fund.
 The emissions market is unique among financial markets in terms of the influence that governments hold over it. Government officials determine specifically which industries and which companies get how many credits. 
 Data about the actual carbon emission levels by companies began filtering out to the markets on April 25, more than two weeks ahead of a May 15 release date. Traders called the situation ''chaotic.'' 
 Last week, an online database of the European Commission accidentally listed a complete set of European data on May 12, three days before the data were supposed to be officially released. Prices plummeted on Friday to 8.60 euros ($11) a metric ton, down from a high of 31 euros in mid-April. 
 Bankers say the government officials have not demonstrated a respect for normal market rules. This ''is not a case study,'' said Mr. Ramming, at Dresdner Kleinwort. ''We are trading in a real market with real money.'' 
 Any market is subject to volatility, of course, and the carbon emissions market is no exception. But it is thinly traded, with about 30 or 40 companies participating in any given day, and so it can be easily swayed. 
 One problem is that official data are released only once a year, rather than quarterly, monthly or even daily, as information in other commodity markets, like oil or copper, is released. 
 Now, banks and traders are calling for the European Commission to release emissions data on a quarterly basis, and to have the same oversight that any securities or bond market would, along with the same warnings and fines for leaking information. 
 So far, the permit market appears to have done more for the balance sheets of power companies than for pollution control. The market has lifted the revenues of power companies in the European Union by 15 to 25 percent, according to research at Point Carbon, a consultant firm based in Oslo that specializes in energy markets and emission trading.
 ''The electricity sector has had a very good year,'' said Kristian Tanger, research director at Point Carbon. ''I don't think the system has been a big driver of energy efficiency.''
 No one is arguing for scrapping the market; indeed, it recovered somewhat on Monday, after the official data on emissions were released. Market participants said they were counting on governments to respond to the criticism about overallotments by reducing the amount of emissions their companies are allowed in 2008. Those allotments are to be reported to the European Union in June. 
 Despite the upheaval, many in the market are still optimistic about the carbon market. ''Trading is the only way to reduce emissions economically and efficiently,'' said Louis Redshaw, head of environmental products at Barclays Capital. ''I am confident this market will be around in 5 or 10 years.''

China allowed its currency to strengthen past the symbolic level of eight to the dollar Monday, rattling Asian markets already shaken by the dollar's extended slide and Friday's drop in share prices in the United States.
 The actual rise in the Chinese currency was tiny: one-tenth of a percent from Friday's level. But the breaching of that threshold unnerved regional investors, who feared that it could open a path for broader declines in the dollar. 
The Bush administration has been pressing China for three years to allow its currency to rise sharply, although the Treasury stopped short last Wednesday of labeling China a country that manipulates the value of the currency, the yuan. 
 That prompted many predictions that China would reward the conciliatory gesture by allowing the yuan to move a little higher in interbank trading in Shanghai. On Thursday and Friday, though, the yuan weakened slightly before rallying on Monday.
 The dollar -- which has fallen markedly against other major currencies in recent weeks -- briefly slipped to a two-year low against the euro and approached an eight-month low against the Japanese yen before recovering considerable ground late in the trading day here and in New York. 
 Ben Simpfendorfer, a currency strategist in Hong Kong with the Royal Bank of Scotland, said the dollar had briefly dropped so fast earlier in the day that investors became worried that a weak dollar would hurt Asian exports and make Asian shares less attractive, which in turn curbed demand for Asian currencies.
 ''What it has done is begin to undermine risk appetite'' for investments in Asia, he said.
 Indeed, stock markets plunged across much of Asia on Monday, partly on worries that American consumers would buy fewer Asian goods if a continued weaker dollar made those goods more expensive. 
 Bourses in emerging markets like India, which fell 3.8 percent, and Indonesia, down more than 6 percent, fared worse than the stock market in wealthy Japan, where the benchmark rate declined less than 1 percent.
 The Shenzhen and Shanghai stock markets, though, rose about 4 percent, continuing a recent rally.
 The appreciation on Monday of the Chinese currency was the first instance of its breaching eight to the dollar since China devalued and unified a series of separate official rates in 1994 into a single exchange rate. 
 At that time, the exchange rate was initially set at 8.7 yuan to the dollar.
 On Monday, the Chinese central bank set a rate of 7.9982 yuan to the dollar at the opening of heavily regulated trading in Shanghai, and the currency strengthened a little further during the day to settle at 7.9976. In New York, it settled at 8.0055 to the dollar.
 Many economists have argued that the biggest beneficiary from an appreciating yuan could be China itself. 
 Wages and real estate prices look so cheap in dollar terms at current exchange rates that foreign corporations and individual investors have been rushing in to buy factories, apartment buildings and other assets -- a frenzy that threatens to kindle inflation in China.
 Allowing the yuan to appreciate also makes gasoline, diesel fuel and other commodities priced in dollars less expensive in yuan, which helps to control inflation as well.
 But Chinese exporters, a powerful constituency in a country where exports equal more than a third of economic output, have been deeply worried that a stronger currency could destroy their profit margins. They are especially worried because big companies like Wal-Mart have resisted paying more to suppliers as the yuan rises.
 ''The impact is very big,'' said John Huang, the owner of Victory Furniture, an exporter in Shenzhen. ''I'm definitely worried about it; our competitiveness is becoming a problem.''
 In products as varied as garments and cars, Chinese companies are already responding to the gradual strengthening of the currency that has taken place, and to the likelihood of further appreciation. 
 With encouragement from the government, companies are trying to develop better-designed, higher-quality, more technologically advanced products that can command higher prices and profit margins.
 ''We are prepared for the appreciation -- we think it is a big test,'' said Jiang Lei, executive vice president of the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, a government agency that helps set automotive policies. ''It is a message for us that we cannot rely on cost alone; we have to improve our technology and our level of management skills.''
 But the Chinese shift toward higher-value goods will put them in more direct competition with products manufactured in North America, Europe and elsewhere in East Asia, and this could fan further trade frictions.
 China revalued the yuan by 2.1 percent on July 21 and has allowed it to creep up by 1.4 percent more since then, including Monday's increase.
 Still, the yuan has been losing ground against the euro and the yen, as the dollar slipped sharply against those currencies in the last month or so. Since April 1, the yuan has fallen 5.3 percent against the euro and 6.1 percent against the yen.
 China released economic statistics on Monday that provided further evidence of a potentially unsustainable economic boom fueled by money pouring into the country. A broad measure of the money supply, known as the M2, accelerated in April to an increase of 18.9 percent from a year earlier, while total loans outstanding were up 14.8 percent.
 Retail sales were also 13.6 percent ahead in April from a year earlier, a sign that domestic demand in China was strong enough that the country's economy might be able to absorb some slowdown in exports as the yuan rises.

HEADLINE: Lens Cleaner Is Recalled Worldwide

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Bausch & Lomb said yesterday that it was halting worldwide sales of its ReNu With MoistureLoc cleaner for soft contact lenses because tests showed that its misuse could leave consumers at risk for a potentially blinding fungal infection. 
 The move followed the company's decision last month to suspend United States sales of the product after federal health officials linked an unusually high number of the fungus cases to use of the lens cleaner. Bausch & Lomb said it would encourage customers to switch to other lens cleaners in its ReNu product line.
''Bausch & Lomb's top priority is the safety of our customers,'' Ronald L. Zarella, the chairman and chief executive, said in announcing the action. 
 The Food and Drug Administration, which has been investigating the problem along with the company, endorsed Bausch's analysis and the recall. 
 The company's stock rose on the news, ending the day up 12.7 percent, at $50.08, but still down more than $10 a share from early April before sales were suspended. Some investors and analysts cautioned that it was too soon to tell whether the other ReNu cleaners would be able to remain on the market, much less make up for the sales of MoistureLoc, which were about $100 million worldwide last year. 
 And analysts said it was too soon to know what Bausch's legal liability could be, although numerous lawsuits have already been filed.
 The infections involve the Fusarium fungus, which is frequently found in drains and sinks, particularly in tropical regions. Bausch & Lomb said it now appeared that common, if frowned-upon, lens care practices -- like topping off solution in the storage case instead of replacing it -- could leave a film on lenses that shielded Fusarium from the sterilizing agent in MoistureLoc. 
 ''We can be reasonably certain at this point that we have a good answer and that the actions taken have been appropriate,'' said Dr. Daniel Schultz, director of the F.D.A.'s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, at a news conference. 
 Dr. Schultz said the agency's inspections of Bausch's Greenville, S.C., factory had uncovered violations of acceptable manufacturing practices that would be disclosed later this week. But none of them appeared related to the outbreak, he said.
 Bausch, based in Rochester, said that its continuing investigations and those of government health authorities had provided no basis so far for believing that the problems extended to its other ReNu products. Mr. Zarella said in a telephone interview that Bausch would step up marketing of the ReNu MultiUse and Multi-Purpose cleaners.
 But skeptics see reasons for caution. The number of cases linked to MoistureLoc in reports to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- an estimated two-thirds of the 122 confirmed cases as of Friday -- was far higher than for any other lens cleaner. But 19 cases cited by the C.D.C. have also been linked to Bausch & Lomb's MultiUse -- about five times the number for products from either Alcon or Advanced Medical Optics, Bausch's two main competitors in the soft lens care market. 
 Mr. Zarella said it was too soon to forecast the economic impact of the company's lens care problem, but that Bausch would clearly have to spend tens of millions of dollars recalling and replacing products. Lens care accounted for more than 20 percent of Bausch's revenue last year, which has not yet been reported because accounting woes in overseas subsidiaries have forced the company to delay reporting its fourth-quarter earnings. The company had revenue of $1.75 billion in the first nine months of the year.
 Because lens care products have accounted for an even bigger share of Bausch profit than revenue, analysts have been sharply cutting earnings estimates for this year. 
 Christopher W. Cooley, who follows Bausch for FTN Midwest Securities in Cleveland, estimated yesterday that Bausch's share of the domestic lens care market was 43 percent at the end of March, just ahead of Alcon's 41 percent and with Advanced Medical at 12 percent. But based on a recent survey of optometrists, Mr. Cooley said, Alcon's share has risen to 60 percent while Bausch has tumbled to 26 percent. 
 ''And 75 percent of the optometrists still sending customers out with Bausch starter kits said it was shaky about whether they would continue,'' Mr. Cooley said.
 Alcon stock rose $1.43 yesterday to close at $102.78. Shares of Advanced Medical rose 16 cents, to $46.35.
 The relative rarity of the fungal infections -- bacterial infections of the cornea are far more common -- and the far-flung distribution systems of global health care companies like Bausch have left the industry, doctors and regulators puzzled for months about the nature and dimension of the problem. 
 In December. Bausch reported to the F.D.A. that a cluster of cases had emerged in Hong Kong. In February, Singapore reported a surprising increase in cases that seemed strongly associated with MoistureLoc shipped from Bausch's Greenville factory. 
 Bausch agreed to withdraw ReNu products from Hong Kong and Singapore and scrambled to test quality control samples, as well as samples returned from retailers and, where possible, lens gear from infected consumers.
 But the company did not announce those moves in this country or interrupt domestic shipments from the Greenville plant. It was not until early March that doctors in the United States began reporting an increase in cases to federal health officials.
 Bausch has said it has been contacting doctors for months asking for information that could help it identify the extent of the problem and updating them directly or through professional organizations on the progress of the investigations. 
 Mr. Zarella said that it was not until early last week that Bausch concluded that MoistureLoc's formulation probably raised the risks of eye infections from the Fusarium fungus, if users do not carefully follow the label's directions for replacing or refilling the solution. Some MoistureLoc bottle tips can also harbor Fusarium if the caps are not regularly closed, he said. 
 A fungal case is normally treated with eye drops that must be administered hourly. Once the fungus and inflammation are under control, most patients undergo corneal transplants to restore their vision. The success rate varies, and in a few cases badly infected eyes must be removed. The C.D.C. has not reported the medical outcomes of the cases it has tracked. 
 Bausch presented its conclusions on Thursday to officials from the F.D.A. and the C.D.C. at a hastily arranged meeting in Washington. Mr. Zarella said that the announcement had been delayed until yesterday morning because the company needed to contact numerous European health authorities, most of whom were unreachable over the weekend. Because MoistureLoc was already withdrawn from the United States and Asia, Europe is the major market affected by the worldwide recall. 
 MoistureLoc is supplied to Europe from a factory in Italy. So far, seven European Fusarium cases linked to MoistureLoc have been confirmed, Mr. Zarella said. 
 Dr. Schultz at the F.D.A. said during a news conference that the agency would review its process for approving Bausch's application to market MoistureLoc, which went on sale in late 2004, but that he did not expect the results to point to any weakness in regulatory oversight. Instead, Dr. Schultz said, MoistureLoc's problem pointed to the need for closely monitoring how health care products perform after they are in the market.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: High Mark For Subway Use 

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK (NYT); Compiled by John Sullivan

 BODY:
Subway ridership climbed to a weekday average of 4.9 million in March, the highest since transit officials began keeping comparable records in 1970, New York City Transit said yesterday. It attributed the increase to a robust city economy, tourism and discounted MetroCard fares. Average weekday ridership on city buses also rose, with the combined total of subway and bus riders reaching 7.4 million, a 3.1 percent gain over March 2005. But an old record -- for the most subway riders in a single day -- remained unbroken, transit officials said. That was set on Dec. 23, 1946, during a giddy Christmas shopping season after World War II, when subway ridership was estimated at seven million, the transit authority said. THOMAS J. LUECK (NYT)

HEADLINE: Rising Diabetes Threat Meets a Falling Budget

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

 BODY:
In Worcester, Mass., scientists are boxing up their test tubes at a shuttered laboratory where just two years ago they isolated a chemical that triggers diabetes.
 In Oklahoma City, health workers faced with soaring rates of Type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the disease, question whether they can afford to continue to offer classes where diabetics learn how to avoid foot amputations.
In Columbia, S.C., diabetes educators say they need more money to expand a program that uses the pulpit in black churches to preach the importance of a healthy diet and exercise.
 Across the country, health care officials who rely on federal money to help stem the growing epidemic of Type 2 diabetes say they have become increasingly frustrated and alarmed. 
 Diabetes is the only major disease with a death rate that is still rising -- up 22 percent since 1990 -- and it has emerged as the leading cause of kidney failure, blindness and nontraumatic amputation.
 But public health experts say federal spending on the disease has historically fallen short of what is needed. And now the government has cut diabetes funds in the budgets for this year and next, despite the explosive growth of a disease that now figures in the deaths of 225,000 Americans each year.
 ''Diabetes is clearly one of the most important threats facing us,'' said Dr. Georges C. Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, ''and its funding is decades behind other diseases.''
 Until this year, federal health spending had risen steadily for more than 20 years, fueling expanded efforts against many diseases, including diabetes. But the experts say the commitment to Type 2 diabetes never kept pace with the spread of the disease.
 The number of Type 2 diabetics in the United States has doubled in the past two decades, to an estimated 20 million, when undiagnosed cases are included, making the disease the country's fastest-growing public health problem. Epidemiologists predict that one in three American children born in 2000 will join the ranks of those afflicted with Type 2.
 This year, the federal government is spending $1.1 billion to study diabetes, less than a quarter of what is spent to study cancer. The government spends 10 times more per patient on cancer research, and the death rate for that disease, unlike that for diabetes, has begun to fall.
 Epidemiologists say the disparity is partly explained by lingering but outdated perceptions of diabetes as a slow-moving condition that preys on the old and obese, not more recent views of it as an expanding danger that is striking people at earlier ages. 
 Spokesmen for the federal health and budget agencies declined to comment for this article on their spending decisions. But some budget analysts said that diabetes activists have not properly credited tens of millions of dollars that the federal government spends annually to stem obesity, a leading cause of Type 2 diabetes.
 Some epidemiologists also suggested that expenditures for cancer research make sense, given the fact that cancer still kills twice as many people as diabetes. And some public health experts said it was often a bad idea to measure spending for one disease against another because overall public health spending needs to be increased.
 ''The reality is that there are always competing requirements when it comes to public health funding,'' said Laura Segal, a spokeswoman for the Trust for America's Health, a nonprofit health research group in Washington.
 Disease research is often underwritten by advocacy groups and pharmaceutical companies, but the federal government is by far the chief financier. From the viewpoint of pure economics, some health experts say it is hard to fathom why the federal government does not spend more on diabetes, which the American Diabetes Association has estimated costs the United States economy about $132 billion per year for treatment and lost productivity at work. Federal spending for both research and treatment, meanwhile, is $1.2 billion annually.
 ''That means the federal government is putting less than 1 percent of what this disease costs us into research and development,'' said Dr. C. Ronald Kahn, president of the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, a leading research institution. ''Even the tire industry spends at least 3 percent of their total sales on research and development.'' 
 Diabetes comes in several forms, all characterized by elevated levels of sugar in the blood. Some 95 percent of all cases are Type 2 diabetes, which is largely associated with weight gain and an inactive lifestyle. Type 1 diabetes, which is thought to stem more from genetic factors, affects a smaller number and has not risen significantly in recent years.
 Federal efforts to fight diabetes are concentrated on two major missions: research on how to prevent, treat or cure the disease going forward, and treatment of people who already have diabetes.
 Roughly a third of the federal research money is being used to study Type 1, which often surfaces in children and is viewed as potentially curable. More is being spent to study Type 2, which is generally viewed as incurable, although medicine and lifestyle changes have been thought to delay, even impede, the treacherous consequences. 
 Research efforts are traditionally financed though the National Institutes of Health, based in Bethesda, Md. Programs to prevent, track and treat the disease at the community level are paid for by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
 Until this year, both agencies had seen two decades of growth in their budgets. The National Institutes of Health budget, for example, increased 261 percent, adjusted for inflation, to $28.6 billion today from $7.9 billion in 1980. The institutes' spending on diabetes research soared as well, by 240 percent, adjusted for inflation, hitting $1.1 billion this year. But since 1980, the percentage of the institutes' budget devoted to diabetes has shrunk slightly, even as the number of diabetics has doubled.
 Chronic diseases like diabetes have always had to battle for funds against infectious diseases like the flu, which seem more urgent because they carry the prospect of a rapid spread, said Dr. James S. Marks, a former Centers for Disease Control official. ''People tend to have more dread about the things they cannot control than they do about the things they can control,'' he said.
 Among the diseases that have consistently drawn more money than diabetes is cancer, in part because it is the nation's second-largest killer, behind heart disease. Since 1990 the death rate from cancer has dropped 12 percent, though it continues to draw considerably more research money per patient than diabetes does: $465 versus $68 in 2004.
 This year, after two decades of increases, Congress trimmed health care spending across the board. Efforts to fight diabetes at both the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control were cut. The 2007 budget proposes further reductions.
 The C.D.C. is facing a cut of $700,000 next year from its $63 million diabetes budget, or just over 1 percent. At the National Institutes of Health, money for diabetes will be cut $1.2 million next year, or a tenth of a percent of the agency's $1.1 billion budget.
 On their face, the cuts to diabetes spending are not huge. But the impact will be felt, according to an internal memorandum from scientists at the institutes' largest diabetes research division. They told the institutes' director that they worried about ''major implications for both the human and economic costs of Type 2 diabetes'' because of the reduced spending.
 At one location affected by the cuts, Dr. Aldo Rossini, director of the Diabetes Division at the University of Massachusetts at Worcester, said the budget shortfalls could not come at a worse time. He is closing down one lab where successful research was being done because federal funds were not renewed, and said he might have to close others.
 ''Diabetes is this massive tidal wave hitting the country,'' he said, ''and we're cutting our best hope at protection.''
 In the past decade, federal money has bought progress in the battles against other diseases, according to epidemiologists. They trace recent drops in the death rates for cancer and for H.I.V. and AIDS to federally financed efforts that refined medicines or promoted diagnostic and prevention measures like mammograms and condom use.
 In the diabetes arena, federal money is paying for projects like one at the University of Miami, where scientists are trying to implant insulin-producing cells into diabetics so they can avoid multiple daily injections of the hormone. In another project, University of Iowa researchers are trying to develop a continuous blood monitor that Type 1 diabetics could wear at night to avoid having to awaken repeatedly to check their sugar levels.
 Dr. Robert A. Rizza, the president of the American Diabetes Association, said the cuts should be viewed in the light of historical underfunding. ''Even if you include federal spending on obesity, the fight against diabetes isn't anywhere near where Congress said it should be when it last had a panel look at this issue,'' he said.
 He pointed to a 1999 report by the panel, the Diabetes Research Working Group, which concluded that by 2004 federal spending on research needed to expand to $1.6 billion, a target that has still not been reached.
 At the treatment and prevention level, the reductions in Centers for Disease Control funds are being watched closely in places like Oklahoma, where the number of diabetics has more than doubled in the past 10 years.
 Federal grants from the C.D.C now pay for all of the state's major prevention and treatment programs. Without this federal help, said Adeline Yerkes, director of the Chronic Disease Service in the state's Department of Health, diabetes threatens to overwhelm the state.
 ''It's still just a fraction of what we need to get this under control,'' she said.

HEADLINE: U.N. Gets Proposal to Speed New Darfur Force

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 15 

 BODY:
The United States introduced a Security Council resolution on Monday calling for strict observance of a new peace accord in Darfur and speeded-up arrangements for a United Nations peacekeeping force to replace the African Union force now there. 
 John R. Bolton, the American ambassador, said he hoped for a vote on Tuesday.
 The move followed a meeting of the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, earlier Monday that urged the Sudanese government to drop objections to putting the force in Darfur, an area the size of France, under eventual United Nations command.
 The African Union diplomats also gave two holdout rebel groups two weeks to sign the peace accord between the Sudanese government and the main rebel organization or face sanctions against their leaders.
 The accord, signed May 5 in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, was aimed at ending a conflict -- marked by extraordinary brutality and labeled genocide by the Bush administration -- that has killed more than 200,000 people and forced two million villagers from their homes.
 The cease-fire is already being widely violated, and the 7,000-member African Union force is unable and ill-equipped to exert meaningful control.
 Jan Pronk, the United Nations envoy to Sudan, told reporters in Addis Ababa, ''It is now high time to take very concrete steps towards a stronger force.''
 Jan Egeland, the United Nations emergency aid coordinator, who has just visited Darfur, said at a news conference in Geneva on Monday that failure to put the peace accord into effect would bring on ''a downward spiral which will get totally out of control and go into the abyss.''
 The resolution sets up a timetable for beginning the transition by the end of September. It says that a joint African Union-United Nations assessment mission should go to Darfur within a week and that Secretary General Kofi Annan should make detailed recommendations on the force's size, mandate and makeup a week after the mission's return.
 It also urges the government of Sudan to cooperate with the United Nations in planning the new force and says ''strong and effective measures'' will be taken against any individuals or groups that try to sabotage the peace agreement.
 Despite the urgency of the crisis, the resolution has undergone some weakening since Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called for prompt action on Darfur last Tuesday at a special session of foreign ministers at the Security Council.
 The draft at that point authorized immediate logistical assistance to the African Union troops from the existing 10,000-member United Nations force monitoring a cease-fire that ended a separate conflict in southern Sudan.

HEADLINE: Remote Pakistan Town Believes Rumors of bin Laden's Arrival Are Greatly Exaggerated

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL

DATELINE: CHITRAL, Pakistan, May 14 

 BODY:
This quiet resort, better known for its polo games and mountain treks, has become the latest site of interest in the hunt for Osama bin Laden, much to the outrage and bemusement of its inhabitants.
 Chitral is the remotest northwestern territory in the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan, stretching along the Afghan border to the high mountain ranges of the Hindu Kush and the Pamirs. The territory is home to rare falcons and the snow leopard, and is cut off by snow from the rest of the country for six months a year.
 It is here in the largest town, also called Chitral, that four Americans from the United States Embassy rented a house last fall, apparently preparing for a long stay, according to Siraj ul Mulk, a member of the traditional ruling family here and the owner of the Hindu Kush Heights Hotel, which overlooks the valley where the four stayed. 
 But the house remained unoccupied until two weeks ago, when an American arrived with two carloads of furniture and equipment, provoking a local politician to object in Parliament and lead a street protest against the presence of what he termed an American ''secret agency.'' The American left the day before the demonstration took place, police officials said.
 While there is no indication that more than one American came to the house this spring, the politician, Abdul Akbar Chitrali, insists that there were four, and that they were up to no good. ''They were from an American secret agency -- the F.B.I. or C.I.A.,'' he said. They were seen driving toward Chitral in an official consulate vehicle, he said, but switched to unmarked S.U.V.'s in a town called Dir, about 25 miles south of Chitral.
 Officials at the United States consulate in Peshawar declined to comment on the incident. The registry of the Pamir Riverside Hotel shows that one American, Paul Aurdic, from the consulate in Peshawar, stayed for three nights beginning April 27, along with a Pakistani colleague, Muhammad Iqbal. 
 Caretakers at the house the Americans rented said the Americans had never stayed there, but seemed to be preparing it for occupation. On Saturday, their belongings -- fitness machines, furniture and a television satellite dish -- could be seen stacked on the terrace, and a pickup truck was parked in the yard. 
 Mr. Chitrali said the Americans were looking for Mr. bin Laden. ''They came on the basis of a very fabricated report that some Arabs came down from the mountains in a Jeep and visited the bazaar,'' he said, ''and on that basis they established an office of the F.B.I. because bin Laden might be hiding in that area.'' 
 He made clear that he has nothing against Americans in general, just these Americans. ''They have no place coming to Chitral, nor would we allow them to stay there,'' he said. ''We are not against foreigners, but the presence of such elements will destroy the peaceful atmosphere of Chitral valley.'' 
 The local deputy police superintendent, Fazal Elahi, said the American told him that he was just preparing a vacation house for himself. After the fuss, two police guards were posted outside the American's hotel room at night for his protection, and a police vehicle escorted him wherever he went, including on his trip back out of the valley, he said.
 ''Chitral is a very peaceful area, but if such activities start, members of the Taliban could come in to attack the Americans, and then we would have bomb blasts and such problems,'' he said. 
 Chitral is indeed peaceful, and has avoided the radicalism and armed militancy so rampant in Pakistan's tribal areas farther south. The area was a staging point and weapons route in the 1980's for mujahedeen who were fighting the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, but since then has slipped back into its previous tranquillity.
 Yet, according to one Western diplomat in Pakistan, there have been ''recurring rumors'' that Al Qaeda and foreign fighters have been seen in the Chitral region in the past year, which would justify a ''possible step into the region.'' 
 In a recent interview, an Afghan intelligence official also mentioned the area as a possible hiding place for Mr. bin Laden, because well-known areas of the tribal regions, such as Waziristan and Bajaur, have come under intense scrutiny and attack by Pakistani forces and even American missiles. 
 A Pakistani official who worked in Waziristan last year recently described an intelligence report from that time of a movement of a large entourage that was protecting an ''important leader.'' 
 The group, which had three rings of security around the leader and bore markings on their clothes so they could identify one another, dressed as nomads and shepherds and moved from an area near Parachinar, south of Peshawar, northward toward Chitral, the official said. Both officials requested anonymity because they are not authorized to talk to the press.
 Chitrali officials deny that any outsiders could take up residence in the area without it being widely known. ''They are not present here,'' said Mr. Elahi, the police official. 
 Mr. Chitrali denied that he forced out the Americans to protect someone hiding in the area. ''I think Osama is dead and the Americans are keeping him alive for their own reasons,'' he said.
 Others thought the American presence, and even the bin Laden tale, might be good for tourism, which is the mainstay of the local economy but declined sharply after 2001.

HEADLINE: Justices Order Rethinking Of eBay Case

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15 

 BODY:
The long-running patent dispute between eBay and MercExchange entered a new and, quite likely, still not final phase on Monday when the Supreme Court sent the case back to the lower federal courts. 
 The justices told the lower courts to reconsider whether eBay -- having been found by a jury to have infringed two MercExchange patents on the method behind the ''Buy It Now'' feature of its online auction business -- should be barred from continuing to use the method.
The decision left the resolution of this dispute uncertain, given the court's insistence that judges must engage in a case-by-case examination of requests for patent injunctions rather than apply one-size-fits-all rules. 
 In a unanimous opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas, the court said that neither of the lower courts that handled MercExchange's request for an injunction had approached it correctly, despite having reached opposite conclusions.
 The Federal District Court in Norfolk, Va., denied MercExchange's request for an injunction on the ground that MercExchange had not itself engaged in ''commercial activity'' to market its patents. MercExchange, a small company in Great Falls, Va., tried but failed in the late 1990's to raise the capital necessary to market its invention.
 After failing to reach agreement with eBay on a license fee, MercExchange filed suit in 2001. It won damages of $25 million but wanted an injunction as well.
 The denial of the injunction was wrong, Justice Thomas said, because the court took too categorical an approach in relying on MercExchange's failure to put its patents to practical use. ''Some patent holders, such as university researchers or self-made inventors, might reasonably prefer to license their patents, rather than undertake efforts to secure the financing necessary to bring their works to market themselves,'' Justice Thomas said.
 But, he continued, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, a specialized court here that handles patent appeals, was also in error for the analysis it applied when it overturned the district court's denial of the injunction. The appeals court invoked what it called the ''general rule'' that ''a permanent injunction will issue once infringement and validity have been adjudged.''
 Justice Thomas said that in resorting to the general rule, ''just as the district court erred in its categorical denial of injunctive relief, the court of appeals erred in its categorical grant of such relief.''
 In patent cases no less than in other kinds of cases, he said, the party seeking an injunction must meet a four-factor test. It must show that it has ''suffered an irreparable injury''; that other remedies like monetary damages are inadequate; that an injunction is warranted; and that the public interest ''would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.''
 While the opinion, eBay v. MercExchange, No. 05-130, emphasized that ''we take no position'' on whether an injunction should eventually be issued, it was clear from a pair of concurring opinions that different justices had different inclinations. In fact, the surface unanimity of the decision could not hide a substantial dispute involving two groups. 
 One group, composed of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Antonin Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, noted in a concurring opinion by the chief justice that ''from at least the early 19th century, courts have granted injunctive relief upon a finding of infringement in the vast majority of patent cases.'' Consequently, courts approaching this issue were not ''writing on an entirely clean slate,'' Chief Justice Roberts said. 
 The thrust of this concurring opinion was that denial of an injunction should be an unusual, even rare outcome of a case like MercExchange's.
 But the other group of justices said that history was not necessarily a reliable guide in the new business climate of today. ''In cases now arising, trial courts should bear in mind that in many instances the nature of the patent being enforced and the economic function of the patent holder present considerations quite unlike earlier cases,'' this group, composed of Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, and Stephen G. Breyer, said in an opinion by Justice Kennedy.
 Justice Kennedy's opinion continued: ''An industry has developed in which firms use patents not as a basis for producing and selling goods but, instead, primarily for obtaining licensing fees. For these firms, an injunction, and the potentially serious sanctions arising from its violation, can be employed as a bargaining tool to charge exorbitant fees to companies that seek to buy licenses to practice the patent.''
 Beyond the ruling, there is another source of uncertainty about the case. The Patent and Trademark Office has embarked on a reconsideration of the validity of MercExchange's patents, a process that could take years and produce more litigation.
 In a decision in another closely watched case on Monday, the court held that the Ohio taxpayers who had challenged the validity of a tax credit intended to stimulate capital investment by businesses in the state lacked standing to pursue the case in federal court.
 The unanimous ruling in DaimlerChrysler Corporation v. Cuno, No. 04-1704, overturned a decision by the federal appeals court in Cincinnati that found the investment tax credit to violate the Constitution by hindering ''free trade among the states.'' 
 Chief Justice Roberts wrote the opinion, invoking a longstanding doctrine that taxpayers generally may not go to federal court with policy disputes in which they cannot demonstrate a concrete stake.
 The case was an appeal by DaimlerChrysler, which received substantial tax breaks under the program for expanding a Jeep assembly plant in a depressed area of Toledo. 
 Prof. Peter Enrich of Northeastern University School of Law, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said the case against the tax credits would be refiled in state court, where ''rules for citizen standing are far more permissive than those in the federal courts.''

HEADLINE: Europe to Offer Iran Conditional Incentives

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, May 15 

 BODY:
The European Union said Monday that it would offer a new incentives package to Iran, including technology to build nuclear power plants for civilian energy production. 
 But Javier Solana, the European Union's foreign policy chief, said Iran would first have to gain international confidence by ceasing any nuclear enrichment, which Iran defends as part of its nuclear energy program but which the United States and the European Union view as camouflage for a nuclear weapons program.
Speaking after a meeting of European foreign ministers in Brussels, Mr. Solana said the European Union was willing to offer Iran ''the most sophisticated technology'' provided that it would be used for generating energy and not building nuclear weapons. 
 ''We want to prove to the Iranians clearly and loudly that we have nothing against Iran using nuclear power for peaceful means,'' Mr. Solana said. ''But we do not have proof that this is the case, and Iranian demands to be able to conduct enrichment for research purposes is something we can't accept.'' 
 He did not explain how technology could be offered that would allow Iran to produce nuclear power without also enabling it to create weapons-grade nuclear materials. Nor did he explain how such technology could be provided without approval from the United States, which insists that Iran halt all nuclear activities. 
 Iran reacted coolly to the proposals, saying it would reject any European initiative that demanded that Iran halt uranium enrichment. Meeting with the ambassadors of Britain, France and Germany in Tehran, Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said in a statement that ''any demand for a suspension or pause'' of uranium enrichment ''is an illogical and unacceptable demand and undoubtedly will be rejected.''
 President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Sunday pre-emptively dismissed any new European offer, asserting that only Iran had the authority to make decisions about its nuclear program. ''They want to offer us things they call incentives in return for renouncing our rights,'' he said. 
 European officials said privately that they were seeking to structure the offer in such a way that Iran would be forced to reveal the true intentions behind its nuclear program. ''We want to tease out an offer that will once and for all force Iran to say whether it wants to use nuclear activities for energy or for nuclear weapons and to stop it from playing games,'' said one official, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of derailing negotiations. 
 European officials said they had discussed an incentives package for Iran that included proposals to speed talks on its potential admission to the World Trade Organization and on expanding university ties between Iran and Europe. However, they emphasized that Europe would not offer Iran security guarantees against potential threats by its neighbors.
 They said a breakthrough was unlikely unless the European Union could garner international support for its package. A final proposal is expected by the end of the month, but European officials said it was unlikely before a meeting on Friday in London of nonproliferation officials from the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. 
 The United States is seeking sanctions against Iran from the Security Council but it has faced resistance from Russia and China, which fear such a move could provoke Iran even further. European officials said the United States was backing European diplomatic efforts while pursuing its objectives through the Security Council. 
 Mr. Solana said the new European package would build on a package of economic incentives offered to Iran last August, when the Europeans told Iran that it could cement its role in international affairs if it ended its nuclear activities. 
 However, a senior State Department official said last week that the package was unlikely to significantly improve upon Europe's previous incentives, which included the restoration of economic and technical assistance for Iran's development and promises to accelerate discussions over its potential World Trade Organization membership. 
 Separately, the European Union said Monday that it was proceeding with plans to get financial aid to the Palestinians without such aid passing through the hands of the Hamas government. 
 Europe and the United States froze hundreds of millions of dollars in direct aid to the Palestinian government after the Islamic militant group Hamas won legislative elections in January. 
 The United States and the European Union view Hamas as a terrorist organization and have called for the group to renounce violence and recognize Israel.

HEADLINE: A Bone for Border Hawks

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
President Bush promised tonight to regain ''full control'' of the border with Mexico. He won't, but that's beside the point. 
 His job last night was not to secure the border but to pretend he could. Like Ava Gardner tending to the germphobic Howard Hughes in his isolation chamber, Bush had to reassure the Minuteman Republicans that they were safely sealed from the perils outside.
 ''The border should be open to trade and lawful immigration, and shut to illegal immigrants,'' he said firmly, sounding as if he believed it himself. It was precisely the cover needed by Republicans to vote for sensible reforms. 
 His plan to send a few thousand National Guard troops to the border is a symbolic gesture, but symbolism is what's needed. Immigrants will find ways to evade the proposed new ID card requirements, as well as the new high-tech sensors at the border, but the ideas sounded good enough on television. Bush's conservative critics accused him of playing politics, but he was just responding in kind to their tactics.
 The fixation on defending the border is a political -- and psychological -- problem, not a rational response to a genuine national threat. People living along the border understandably object to strangers' sneaking through their backyard, but why are so many people in the rest of the country obsessed with keeping out foreigners? 
 The border hawks have two chief arguments, starting with that great debate stopper: Sept. 11. A porous southern border is supposedly no longer tolerable now that terrorists have declared war on America and are threatening even more catastrophic attacks.
 But if terrorists are smart enough to plan such an attack, they're smart enough to get into the United States, no matter how many agents and troops are on the Mexican border. If terrorists have the determination to train for years, if they can pay for flight lessons or anthrax or a nuclear bomb, then they can easily bribe or forge their way into America -- or waltz in with legitimate visas.
 Mohamed Atta did not have to hire a coyote or swim across the Rio Grande. He and the other hijackers entered the country legally. The 500,000 or so people who manage to sneak in from Mexico each year are a minuscule fraction -- about 1 percent -- of the tourists and students and other visitors who enter America legally. 
 Mexico is not the preferred route of the suspected terrorists caught so far because they prefer more convenient options, like the Canadian border. Even if the northern border were sealed with the Great Wall of Saskatchewan, there would still be thousands of miles of unsecured coastline -- and plenty of drug runners with boats and planes who would have no trouble delivering a terrorist or a suitcase bomb.
 The border hawks' other argument is that America must enforce its immigration law or succumb to ''mob rule,'' as one of the Minuteman leaders warned. But for most of the country's history, America allowed essentially unlimited immigration without descending into Hobbesian chaos. The country survived just fine when immigrants were governed solely by the law of supply and demand.
 Bush tried a brief dose of economic reality in last night's speech, pointing out that the lure of America for poor Mexican workers ''creates enormous pressure on our border that walls and patrols alone will not stop.'' As he explained, the way to reduce illegal immigration is to change the law so more people can enter legally. 
 But that was the rational part of the speech, which Bush knew wasn't enough.
 He had to throw in the tough border talk and the ID cards. He had to deal with the new outbreak of xenophobia, the fear that has always been easy for demagogues to arouse because it's such a basic human instinct.
 Distrusting foreigners made evolutionary sense when outside clans threatened to bring in disease and encroach on hunting grounds. It made sense during the thousands of years when towns built walls to stop invaders from plundering their wealth and enslaving their inhabitants. 
 But the immigrants now coming across the Mexican border do not want to sack our cities. They're not about to pillage our granaries or march home with Americans in chains. They just want to mow our lawns and clean our offices. 
 They're coming to feed us, not take our food, yet we're demanding that our leaders keep them out. No Mexican busboys! No Guatemalan cooks! Stop them before they grill again!

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT CALLS FOR COMPROMISE ON IMMIGRATION 

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG; David S. Cloud and Carl Hulse contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15 

 BODY:
President Bush proposed a plan on Monday that could place up to 6,000 National Guard troops along the border with Mexico for at least a year, but he urged Congress to address illegal immigration in a way that maintains the nation's tradition of openness.
 Stepping directly into the middle of a debate raging within his own party and in cities and towns across the country, Mr. Bush offered a menu of proposals on the issue, which has rapidly emerged as among the most challenging confronting Congress and the White House.
 They were intended both to salve conservatives who have demanded concrete steps to stem the flow of illegal workers across the border and to accommodate many members of both parties and business groups who are seeking new ways of acknowledging the presence of an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States.
 ''America needs to conduct this debate on immigration in a reasoned and respectful tone,'' Mr. Bush said in his address, carried by all of the major broadcast and cable news networks. ''We cannot build a unified country by inciting people to anger, or playing on anyone's fears or exploiting the issue of immigration for political gain.'' [Excerpts, Page A22.] 
 Mr. Bush combined a call for considerable increases in the number of border patrol agents and the number of beds in immigration detention centers with an endorsement of proposals that would give many illegal immigrants a chance to become legal and eventually gain citizenship. 
 He reiterated his proposal for a guest worker program giving some immigrants the right to work here temporarily. But he also proposed to strengthen enforcement by creating an identification card system for foreign workers that would include digitized fingerprints. 
 Mr. Bush made his proposals in a 17-minute address from the Oval Office that aides described as a bid to assert presidential leadership at a critical juncture for his administration, which has been beset by political troubles. They said he also wanted to complete an overhaul of immigration policy, an issue that has exploded in recent months into a passionate argument about national identity, economic needs and social strains. 
 The centerpiece of Mr. Bush's speech was his proposal to deploy the National Guard troops in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California. Under the plan, 6,000 National Guard members would be deployed at any one time, with units rotating in and out every two or three weeks, coinciding with their annual training routines. 
 The Guard forces would be under the control of governors in the states, who would have sign on to the plan, but the costs of their deployment would be picked up by the federal government. The numbers of Guard troops deployed on the border would decline after a year, the president said, as the Border Patrol put more agents in the field.
 Mr. Bush said the National Guard would not conduct law enforcement operations, but would support the Border Patrol with intelligence, surveillance and other activities.
 He did not put specific price tags on the proposals he set out in his speech, which he delivered briskly and intently from behind his desk in the Oval Office, a setting that he has reserved until now for national addresses on war and national security. 
 White House officials said in a briefing for reporters Monday afternoon that the president was calling for $1.9 billion included in a supplemental budget bill now before Congress to be used for his proposals.
 Some of the border state governors, Democrats in Congress, and others immediately raised questions about the practicality of the plan. Mr. Bush's broad approach also drew tepid reviews from some House Republicans and conservatives, whose support he will need as he grapples with a problem that has defied decades of proposed solutions: the continued economic imbalances between the United States and its trading partners to the south.
 The reactions underscored the slender line the president is trying to walk between not only Democrats and warring members of his own party who are trying to hammer out legislation, but also between the increasingly powerful Hispanic voters he hopes to recruit to his party and the conservatives who still form its base.
 On Monday, the Senate for a second time this year began debating legislation providing for enhanced border security but also a guest worker program and options for citizenship. Should the bill win approval, as Senate leaders predict, it will fall to Mr. Bush to help broker a compromise between that legislation and a competing bill approved by the House in December that would make it a felony to be in this country illegally.
 The president's speech was devised in large part to allay the concerns of House Republicans that the White House is insufficiently concerned about border security and too willing to contemplate legal status for illegal immigrants. Mr. Bush stressed compromise.
 ''These are not contradictory goals: America can be a lawful society and a welcoming society at the same time,'' he said.
 He said he was not endorsing an automatic path to citizenship, adding, ''That would be amnesty.''
 But, Mr. Bush said, it was not granting amnesty to allow illegal immigrants who have been here for several years -- working, paying taxes and learning English -- to get in the back of the citizenship line after paying a hefty fine and back taxes.
 The White House has signaled general support for the proposal being considered in the Senate to distinguish between immigrants who have been in the country less than two years, those in the country less than five years and those who have been in the United States for longer.
 ''Some in this country argue that the solution is to deport every illegal immigrant and that any proposal short of this amounts to amnesty,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I disagree.'' 
 Some Republicans in the House indicated an unwillingness to back down from their insistence on enforcement-only legislation after the address. 
 ''While I appreciate the president's willingness to tackle big problems,'' Representative Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, the House majority whip, said in a statement after the speech, ''I have real concerns about moving forward with a guest worker program or a plan to address those currently in the United States illegally until we have adequately addressed our serious border security problems.''
 Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, who has been deeply involved in the Senate negotiations on immigration, praised Mr. Bush ''for his courage,'' but said he was worried the National Guard was already spread too thin.
 But among the most important voices will be those of the governors of the four states abutting the southern border: Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and California. It falls to them to make the plan for deploying the guard work.
 Administration officials said governors would have to ask for the Guard troops, and are free to decline them. And, officials said governors would often have to ask for National Guard troops from fellow governors in nonborder states, who could also say no. 
 Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, a Republican, called the plan a ''Band-Aid solution'' in a statement Monday night and complained that he had not been fully consulted.
 Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a Democrat, said the plan fell short. ''The president is putting the onus on border governors to work out the details and resolve the problems with this plan,'' Mr. Richardson said in a statement.
 Gov.Janet Napolitano of Arizona, a Democrat, was generally supportive the plan. . Gov. Rick Perry of Texas also voiced support.

HEADLINE: Border Illusions

 BODY:
President Bush's speech from the Oval Office last night was not a blueprint for comprehensive immigration reform. It was a victory for the fear-stricken fringe of the debate. 
 These are the people who say illegal border crossings must be stopped immediately, with military boots in the desert sand. Never mind the overwhelming burdens of Iraq and Afghanistan, the absence of a coherent and balanced immigration policy, and the broad public support for a comprehensive solution. America must send its overtaxed troops to the border right now, they say, so a swarm of ruthless, visa-less workers cannot bury our way of life under a relentless onslaught of hard work.
 Rather than standing up for truth, Mr. Bush swiveled last night in the direction of those who see immigration, with delusional clarity, as entirely a problem of barricades and bad guys. His plan to deploy ''up to 6,000'' National Guard troops to free the Border Patrol to hunt illegal immigrants is a model of stark simplicity, one sure to hearten the Minuteman vigilantes, frightened conspiracy theorists, English-only Latinophobes, right-wing radio and TV personalities, and members of Congress who have no patience for sorting out the various and mixed blessings that surging immigration has given this country. 
 Those on the other side of the argument have spent frustrating months making a quieter, more complicated case. Supporters of a compromise immigration bill in the Senate want a balanced approach that is both tough and smart. They, too, would add people and technology to enhance security on the Mexican border, which is now about as solid as a screen door. But unlike the House bill, which is fixated on enforcement, the Senate bill seeks to restore law and order in a variety of ways. It would, for example, shorten an immigration backlog by adjusting work and family visa quotas, tighten the enforcement of immigration laws in the workplace, and put illegal workers on a path to assimilation and citizenship.
 Mr. Bush gave lip service to aspects of comprehensive reform, but that part of his message was, as usual, delivered with a mumbling lack of conviction. He denounced ''amnesty'' again, but did not speak up forcefully enough for a citizenship path for the 11 million to 12 million illegal immigrants who, in huge national marches in recent weeks, have made their hunger to assimilate powerfully clear.
 Some say Mr. Bush's proposal is simply a tough act to distract the mob so he can get to the real business of comprehensive reform. But endorsing the Minuteman argument only emboldens hard-liners. Representative Charlie Norwood of Georgia, a state that is leading the nation in trying to remove all the offending noncitizen parts from its economic engine, wrote just before Mr. Bush's speech that he could envision using 36,000 to 50,000 troops to seal the border. The job could be done ''by Memorial Day at the latest,'' he contended.
 Mr. Bush's speech could be dismissed as a mere distraction. But it is worse than that because the best hope of reform, the Senate bill being debated this week, is under fire from the very forces Mr. Bush is trying to appease. 
 That legislation is built around a solid core -- a bill from Senators John McCain and Edward Kennedy -- but in recent months it has morphed into something that is far more complicated and problematic. It's encrusted with new provisions intended to placate the enforcement-only hard-liners by ensuring that an immigrant's path to legality would be anything but quick and easy. Some hurdles are innocuous time-wasters, but others are so onerous and cumbersome that they might put the whole business at risk. 
 The Senate bill is also cruelly inadequate in giving due process to those accused of violating immigration laws. Its reliance on guest workers should be met with wariness. The United States is not an Arab emirate. It does not ennoble our democratic experiment by importing a second-class society of worker bees who are vulnerable to exploitation and have little incentive to adopt our values. If there must be guest workers, there must also be a path so they, too, can seek citizenship if they choose. Mr. Bush last night specifically -- and shamefully -- urged that such a path be denied to temporary workers.
 The core principle energizing and legitimizing immigration reform must be that of citizenship. Ultimately, only those who are full stakeholders in America will put down roots here. Only those whose right to stay cannot be challenged or revoked will be bold enough to insist upon their rights.
 It is still possible that a good bill will emerge this year, but only if Democrats and moderate Republicans hold firm to protect the fragile flame of good sense against the deter-and-deport crowd. This means sticking together to defeat destructive amendments on the Senate floor. It means overcoming this latest contribution from the ever-unhelpful president, who could have pointed the nation toward serious immigration reform last night, but instead struck a pose as Minuteman in chief.

The Great Deluge
Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans and the Mississippi Gulf Coast
By Douglas Brinkley
Illustrated. 716 pages. William Morrow. $29.95.

The Storm
What Went Wrong and Why During Hurricane Katrina
By Ivor van Heerden and Mike Bryan
Illustrated. 308 pages. Viking. $25.95.
 The horror and wretchedness produced by Hurricane Katrina and the government's laggard efforts at relief challenged witnesses' descriptive powers. They drew analogies to disaster movies and horror movies, to Dante's Inferno and Milton's hell, to a futuristic Mad Max world and a vanished medieval fief. Hieronymus Bosch's infernal depictions of misery were invoked, and so were scenes from Job and the Book of Revelations. The Perfect Storm had turned the Big Easy into a place of biblical suffering and woe. 
The historian Douglas Brinkley's harrowing new book, ''The Great Deluge,'' captures the human toll of Katrina as graphically as the most vivid newspaper and television accounts did, and by pulling together a huge, choral portrait of what happened during that first week of havoc and distress (from Saturday, Aug. 27, through Saturday, Sept. 3), he gives the reader a richly detailed timeline of disaster -- a timeline in which the sheer cumulative power of details impresses upon us, again, just how abysmally inept relief efforts were on every level, from FEMA to the Red Cross to the New Orleans Police Department, from the federal government to state and local authorities.
 By moving back and forth between panoramic views and up-close zoom shots of individuals, Mr. Brinkley is able to convey both the larger arc of the tragedy that engulfed the Gulf Coast and the intimate fallout that that catastrophe had on the lives of ordinary people -- many of them black and most of them poor and lacking the resources to evacuate on their own.
 Published less than a year after Katrina's rampage, ''The Great Deluge'' remains heavily indebted to newspaper, magazine and television reporting, most especially to articles that appeared in The Times-Picayune of New Orleans. And in writing a ''fast out of the gates'' book, Mr. Brinkley focuses his energies on providing a you-are-there sort of narrative. He does not try to address questions about the future of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast, the costs of rebuilding, environmental issues or the need to implement better methods of flood control, much less the broader sort of questions about long-term political, social and economic fallout that ''Rising Tide,'' John M. Barry's extraordinary account of the great Mississippi flood of 1927, examined so brilliantly from a vantage point many decades removed.
 But while this volume lacks the scope and magisterial perspective of ''Rising Tide,'' it does leave the reader with a similarly sobering apprehension of the human failings that magnified nature's cruelty: the hubris, stupidity and wishful thinking that led government officials to ignore the myriad warnings about the vulnerable levee system of New Orleans, and the venality, indifference, political gamesmanship and simple incompetence that contributed to the deadly delays in getting help to Katrina's victims.
 A professor of history at Tulane University, Mr. Brinkley writes not as a detached observer but as a longtime resident of New Orleans, and his passion for his beleaguered city -- and his anger at the government's mismanagement of the situation -- are palpable in these pages. He describes ''Katrinaworld'' as ''a denuded black hole of double-talking gibberish where the bureaucrats hid behind the white marble walls of statistical procedure and partisan politics,'' and he charges that ''every time the Bush administration and the State of Louisiana hesitated, lawyered up and read the fine print on homeland security procedure, an American died prematurely.'' 
 Although many of the scenes Mr. Brinkley describes will be familiar to readers from news accounts, he captures the surreal horror that reigned in New Orleans, as the levees were breached, and water poured in, turning the city into a ''smattering of islands, rising out of the 80 percent of the city's land that was submerged.'' He shows us people drowning in their own homes, as they watched their pets, their photos, their possessions of a lifetime wash away; doctors and nurses scrambling to save critically ill patients, as flood-stricken animals (crabs, snakes, turtles, an armadillo) scuttled through hospital corridors; and looters wading through the streets ''like sinister Santa Clauses with bags of stolen merchandise over their shoulders.'' 
 He takes us to the fetid Superdome, where the promised evacuation buses failed to show up day after day, where ''mass confusion reigned,'' and ''a number of women were raped, and a couple of men were stabbed.'' He revisits the even more chaotic Convention Center, where corpses reeked in the hot, suffocating air, and roving gangs ''marked out territory and defended it with guns purloined from stores.'' And he points out the spot on the I-10 highway, where ''people huddled together,'' under the shade of some highway signs, ''making a home of the barren roadway, holding their belongings in a pillowcase or a cart'' and looking like ''refugees from some war-torn area overseas.'' 
 ''Americans were not used to seeing their country in ruins, their people in want,'' Mr. Brinkley writes. ''They began to feel ashamed that their country was either unable or unmotivated to provide the basic necessities of food, water and shelter within its own borders.'' 
 The portraits Mr. Brinkley draws of key government players in the relief (or rather, lack of relief) efforts are scathing. Gov. Kathleen Blanco, though the most sympathetically portrayed government official in this volume, emerges as a dithering executive who should have ''better prepared Louisiana for the Big One'' and who spent the crucial, early hours of the storm ''going through the motions but not much more.'' FEMA's director, Michael Brown, comes across as a self-absorbed paper pusher, hopelessly ''out of his depth'' and cautiously trying to apply a plan to a disaster that had blown all plans to shreds, and New Orleans's mayor, Ray Nagin, as a foolish coward, slow to order a mandatory evacuation because he was worried about closing hotels (which might then sue the city for disrupting the tourist trade) and reluctant to try to rally residents' spirits at the Superdome because he put ''his own personal safety ahead of those poor and elderly in trouble.''
 Mr. Brinkley's greatest contempt, however, seems reserved for George W. Bush, who comes across as an uncaring, out-of-touch president, bizarrely slow to grasp the magnitude of the disaster and reluctant to exercise leadership when it most mattered; and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, who is depicted as being callous to ''the apocalyptic needs of the entire Gulf Coast region,'' apparently unconcerned (as he attended a flu seminar on Tuesday, Aug. 30, in Atlanta) ''with the massive flooding in New Orleans -- even though he had been told by Mr. Brown the night before about the 17th Street Canal breach and even though reports on television on Tuesday morning were showing live footage of a city and a region falling into the very pits of inhumanity.'' 
 Given the relief vacuum left by FEMA, the Coast Guard stepped up, as did smaller agencies like the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, and myriad individuals, intent on aiding neighbors and strangers alike. Five young Mississippi men, a couple of them great-great-grandchildren of Confederate soldiers, risked their lives to save a black family in a small Gulf Coast town; the so-called NOLA Homeboys, New Orleans residents with yachts and dinghies and canoes, refused to evacuate so they could save fellow citizens; and one AIDS doctor at Charity Hospital determined to ride out the storm with her 18 patients, vowing that the group would stick together as a unit.
 It is Mr. Brinkley's portraits of such valiant individuals, combined with dozens of interviews with Katrina survivors, that lend his narrative an emotional immediacy and give the alarming statistics -- more than 1,500 deaths at present count, and according to Mr. Brinkley, some 400,000 displaced residents in Louisiana alone, months after the storm -- a local habitation and a name.
 The narrative approach of Ivor van Heerden, co-founder and deputy director of the Louisiana State University Hurricane Center, is less personal and more science-based than Mr. Brinkley's, but his book (written with Mike Bryan) is equally disturbing in its own way. And he comes to similar conclusions about the human failures that turned Katrina from a dangerous hurricane into a calamitous disaster. The catastrophe (or the magnitude of it, anyway) was ''preventable,'' he stresses: ''If science and engineering had been allowed to play their proper role in the development of policies for the wetlands and the levees, we wouldn't be in this situation today.'' 
 Mr. van Heerden reminds us of the frightening National Weather Service warning, issued on Sunday morning, Aug. 28, that declared that ''most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks perhaps longer,'' ''at least one half of well-constructed homes will have roof and wall failure,'' ''power outages will last for weeks,'' and ''water shortages will make human suffering incredible by modern standards.'' 
 He also reminds us that experts like himself had been warning for years of the catastrophe awaiting New Orleans, noting that some ''local geographers and oceanographers and engineers'' had started ''to suspect that Louisiana was not only more vulnerable to devastation than its citizens wanted to admit, but far more vulnerable than it had been, because the wetlands that buffer the inland zones, including New Orleans, were disappearing at an alarming rate.'' 
 Equally unnerving are Mr. van Heerden's observations that Katrina ''was not the big one,'' and that ''sometime in the foreseeable future a bigger storm will not take that last-minute jog to the east, and every square foot of New Orleans -- and all of it, not just 80 percent -- will be underwater, and deeper underwater than this time.'' 
 If short-term political and commercial interests continue to trump science, if changes in flood control are not made, and adequate financing is not provided, he warns, ''one-fifth of the state of Louisiana -- everything south of Interstate 10 including the city of New Orleans in its entirety -- will disappear beneath the waves, gone for good, and we will have no one to blame but ourselves.'' 
 Should that happen, future authors like Mr. van Heerden and Mr. Brinkley will not be writing about New Orleans or southern Louisiana. They will be writing about what Mr. van Heerden calls the ''Cajun Atlantis.''

HEADLINE: India's Plan To Set Aside Jobs for Poor Stirs Protest

BYLINE: By SARITHA RAI

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India, May 15 

 BODY:
What began in New Delhi last month as a doctors' strike to protest an affirmative action proposal for disadvantaged Indians spread over the weekend and is threatening to flare into a government vs. industry battle.
 As a strike by thousands of doctors and medical students intensified on Monday, services in dozens of hospitals across the country were disrupted. In India's technology capital of Bangalore, 500 medical and engineering students marched in the streets over the weekend.
The protests are a reaction to a federal proposal that calls for nearly half of the jobs at government hospitals and half the seats at medical schools to be reserved for lower-caste and other disadvantaged Indians. Beyond that, several ministers have pushed for legislation to reserve spots at other types of schools as well as jobs in private companies for people belonging to disadvantaged groups. 
 Supporters of the proposal say that India's economy, which is growing by 8 percent annually, has only accentuated the inequalities of Indian society. In a television interview over the weekend, India's industry minister, Kamal Nath, declared that the government was committed to affirmative action and that it wanted to ensure that growth was ''inclusive.''
 But some industry executives said that increasing affirmative action in the private sector would rob the country of its competitive edge. In fact, unregulated labor markets and the country's education system are credited with the spectacular growth of India's outsourcing industry.
 ''There is rising concern that affirmative action in jobs will erode competitiveness and put off multinational firms,'' said Partha Iyengar, vice president for research at the Indian operations of Gartner Inc., a technology research and consulting company.
 Mr. Iyengar said that companies were lobbying against a large-scale move to reserve jobs in the private sector.
 ''If affirmative action is enforced in the outsourcing industry, for instance, it will lead to resource turbulence,'' said Mr. Iyengar, who said challenges like language and culture would reduce the employable pool of candidates for companies.
 Representatives of the Confederation of Indian Industry, India's largest industry group, said that foreign investors were watching the latest developments carefully.
 Affirmative action is a thorny political issue in a country where much of the economy is farm-based, and about one in three Indians live on less than a dollar a day. About two-thirds of India's 1.1 billion people live in villages with poor access to schools and even less access to well-paying jobs. More than half of India's schools have only one teacher for every two classrooms. 
 At the same time, applicants fight fiercely for admission to India's most prestigious medical and technical schools. Competition is widely said to be more intense than in Ivy League schools in the United States. And global companies like Citigroup, Lehman Brothers, Microsoft and General Electric routinely hire graduates of the Indian Institutes of Technology and Indian Institutes of Management.
 ''In the knowledge economy, job reservations will put India at a disadvantage in the global bazaar,'' said N. R. Narayana Murthy, chairman and founder of Infosys Technologies, one of India's largest outsourcing companies. ''Our customers don't care what color we are or where we are from as long as we are labor-competitive.'' 
 Mr. Murthy said he had no doubt that the caste system had done a terrible injustice to a large section of Indian society. But to address it, he said, the country should strengthen the primary and secondary education system. 
 Several founders of Infosys pay for midday meal programs and primary school programs in the country, he said. The company has also recruited disadvantaged residents for its processing unit and has helped put them through school. In two months, he said, the company is starting a software engineering course for candidates from disadvantaged backgrounds, and the first class will have 100 students.

HEADLINE: Metals Plunge on Concerns of a Market Bubble

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Metals prices plunged yesterday, led by gold's biggest decline since 1993, on concern that a speculative rally that sent commodities to record highs may be over.
 Gold fell 4.9 percent in London while zinc had its biggest decline since October 2004. Aluminum lost the most in three months and copper dropped the most in two weeks. Crude oil slid 3 percent, trading below $70 a barrel in New York. 
''Markets are simply way overdone, overbought and running out of new buyers up at these levels,'' said Michael Guido, director of hedge fund marketing and commodity strategy at Societe Generale in New York. ''Most metals are in dire need of a healthy correction in order to bring sidelined players back into the game.''
 The Reuters/Jefferies CRB futures price index of 19 commodities, including energy, metals and agricultural products, fell as much as 2.7 percent, to 351.85, the biggest drop since July 1988. Every commodity in the index declined, led by silver, heating oil and gasoline.
 Oil fell after the Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, said in Jordan yesterday that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which pumps 40 percent of the world's crude, is adding enough new capacity, even if some members are struggling to meet current output targets. Crude for June delivery fell $2.63, or 3.7 percent, to $69.41 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Copper for delivery in July on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange dropped 11.75 cents, or 3 percent, to $3.7465 a pound, the biggest drop since April 27.
 Gold for immediate delivery declined $35.50, to $678.70 an ounce in London, the biggest drop since August 1993. Silver for immediate delivery in London lost $1.23, to $13.14 an ounce, the biggest decline since April 24.
 The declines defied the predictions of some of Wall Street's biggest banks. Citigroup raised its forecasts Sunday for copper, nickel and aluminum, citing supply shortages and rising demand.
 ''A speculative bubble is forming,'' said Tony Dolphin, who helps manage $125 billion as director of economics and strategy at Henderson Global Investors in London. ''It may be sensible for some investors to get out of these markets now and return once there has been a correction in prices.''
 The metals rally has been spurred by increased buying by hedge and investment funds seeking returns that have outpaced those from assets like stocks and bonds. Investors and speculators held more than $120 billion of bets in United States commodities markets in April, Citigroup said in a May 5 report, the second-highest sum on record.
 Driving much of the demand for metals is the booming economy of China, which expanded 10.2 percent in the first three months of 2006 and increased use of metals for buildings and electrical appliances. The nation is the biggest copper user.
 Global copper demand will rise 6 percent this year, to 17.8 million tons, beating production by 200,000 tons, analysts at UBS said in an April 28 report.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises After Commodity Prices Fall 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks advanced yesterday as a plunge in oil and metals prices eased concern that accelerating inflation would drive the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates.
 Financial companies, among the most sensitive to rate shifts, led the rally. Johnson & Johnson and Coca-Cola lifted the Dow Jones industrial average as makers of drugs and consumer products, whose shares have lagged behind the market this year, moved higher.
Exxon Mobil and Alcoa led a decline among energy and metals producers, this year's best performers, as crude oil fell below $70 a barrel and the drop in metals sent gold to its biggest loss since 1993. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 3.26 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,294.50. The Dow average gained 47.78 points, or 0.4 percent, to 11,428.77. The Nasdaq composite index lost 5.26 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,238.52 for its fifth-straight drop.
 Bond yields retreated. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slid 0.04 percentage point, to 5.15 percent. The price climbed 10/32, to 9925/32.
 Investors have been zigzagging between conflicting concerns that the economy is slowing more than expected because of the Fed tightening policy and that economic growth is still too strong to allow the central bank to stop raising rates.
 ''Certainly, good news is hopefully inflation starts to peter out a little bit or we've seen the high in commodities and it takes away some of the motivation for the Fed to raise rates,'' said Jay Suskind, co-head of capital markets at Ryan Beck & Company in Florham Park, N.J.
 A report from the New York Fed yesterday suggested a slowing expansion. The report's general economic index unexpectedly fell to 12.4 in May from 15.8 in April. 
 A measure of financial shares climbed 0.6 percent yesterday. Citigroup, the biggest United States financial services firm, gained 52 cents, to $49.51.
 Johnson & Johnson, the world's largest maker of medical devices, increased $1.14, or 1.9 percent, to $59.97 for the top gain in the Dow average. A rival, Boston Scientific, revealed problems with more heart devices from its Guidant unit. Boston Scientific bought Guidant this year after winning a bidding war with Johnson & Johnson.
 Coca-Cola, the top soft drink maker, added 76 cents, to $43.94.
 Exxon dropped 24 cents, to $62. ConocoPhillips slid $1.67, to $63.52.
 Alcoa fell $1.34, or 3.9 percent, to $33.47 for the steepest loss in the Dow average. Phelps Dodge, the copper producer, sank $6.15, to $89.25.
 Newmont Mining, the world's biggest gold producer last year, tumbled $2, to $54.31. American shares of BHP Billiton, the No. 1 mining company, lost $2.99, to $44.80.
 Gilead Sciences, the biotechnology company, jumped $1.54, to $57.08. The stock was raised to buy from neutral by a Banc of America analyst, David Witzke, who said the company might earn more than expected from H.I.V. drugs because of initiatives to screen more broadly for AIDS.
 Bausch & Lomb surged $5.64, or 13 percent, to $50.08 for the top gain in the S.& P. 500. The maker of contact lens products said a fungal infection tied to its products was limited to its ReNu With MoistureLoc formulation, which it will stop making.
 Target, the retailer, tumbled $2.19, or 4.2 percent, to $50.02, after it reported the first decline in profit margin in at least two years. Gross margin, or the percentage of sales left after the cost of goods sold, narrowed to 32.18 percent from 32.36 percent.
 Four stocks fell for every three that rose on the New York Stock Exchange. About 1.87 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board.
 The following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: IRA Swaps Could Cost U.S. Billions in Tax Revenue

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
President Bush is scheduled to sign into law tomorrow an extraordinary deal for high-income people with retirement savings accounts. 
 By paying $1 in income taxes before the taxes are due, these investors may be able to avoid future taxes equivalent to $3.50.
The deal is a one-time opportunity in 2010 for anyone to convert a conventional individual retirement account, where taxes are deferred until money is withdrawn, into a Roth IRA, where investment gains are tax-free. Conversions are now limited to people who make less than $100,000 a year. 
 One expert, the first of what is expected to be a herd promoting Roth plans, is showing how modest sums put into Roths can produce an enormous bounty over time.
 Those who do not take advantage of the opportunity to roll money into a Roth may think about the deal differently. The tax savings, like all of the Bush tax cuts, would be financed with federal borrowing, adding to the government's interest expense.
 The estimate comparing how much money the government collects up front versus the taxes it will lose in the future comes from the Tax Policy Center, a nonprofit research organization that often produces reports critical of the administration's tax policy but whose computer model the Treasury Department considers reliable. The center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, is run by tax experts who served President Ronald Reagan, the first President Bush and President Bill Clinton.
 Part of the tax savings arises from rules, set by Congress, that require people to withdraw money from traditional retirement accounts starting the year after the one in which they turn 70. For Roths, mandatory withdrawals apply only to heirs, permitting the magic of compound interest to swell the accounts' value for a much longer time for those willing to leave the money alone.
 Leonard Burman, co-director of the Tax Policy Center, said the estimated tax savings was based on current income tax rates. The savings would be greater if tax rates rose in the future, as Mr. Burman says they will because the government is spending more than it is taking in.
 The Treasury Department made two senior tax policy advisers available on condition that they not be named. Those advisers expressed respect for the care Mr. Burman applies to his work. But they noted that the government makes tax estimates only for 5- and 10-year periods, while Mr. Burman's is for 43 years. 
 Under the 10-year period covered by the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation's official estimate, the Roth conversions would raise $6.4 billion in taxes in the short run. But because the government will not collect taxes on the future investment gains, the Tax Policy Center estimates that through 2049, the conversions will cost the government $53.3 billion.
 The center calculated the value of the taxes and savings as if everything happened today, known to economists as the net present value. The center estimated that those taxpayers who took full advantage of the deal would stand to gain $3,500 for every $1,000 of tax paid, for a net gain of $2,500, costing the government the same amount. 
 The Treasury officials noted that if tax rates fell or the government switched from an income tax to a consumption tax, the estimated tax savings would shrink or even vanish. 
 The Treasury officials also warned that people who converted to Roths might be worse off, especially if they withdrew their money quickly instead of allowing their Roth accounts to grow in value.
 And one of the officials, in discussing the expected advertising by investment houses encouraging conversions, warned that much of the tax advice on Roths that he saw promoted on the Internet was flawed. He noted that even technical violations of retirement savings rules could result in draconian tax penalties. ''This is a very tricky area,'' he said. 
 Roth IRA's are now available only to couples making less than $160,000 and single people making less than $110,000. But in 2010 anyone, regardless of income, would be permitted to roll over unlimited sums from IRA's into a Roth. 
 Everyone interviewed agreed that the smart strategy would be to pay the taxes from a source outside of the retirement account being converted to a Roth. That would preserve the amount of money available to generate tax-free returns.
 To help people cover the tax on the conversion, the measure would permit the taxes to be paid in two installments, in 2011 and 2012. An almost identical deal was signed into law by President Clinton, permitting such conversions to Roths in 1998, but with the taxes paid in four annual installments. 
 Ed Slott, a Long Island accountant who publishes a newsletter about how to get the most out of retirement accounts, said that for savers, this was the best deal from the government in a long time. 
 ''You can't beat a zero tax rate,'' said Mr. Slott, author of ''Parlay Your IRA Into a Family Fortune.''

SECTION: Section A; Column 1; National Desk; THE IMMIGRATION DEBATE; Pg. 22

LENGTH: 1932 words

HEADLINE: A Nation of Laws and of Immigrants

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a transcript of President Bush's speech on immigration last night, as recorded by The New York Times. A complete transcript: www.nytimes.com/washington.
 I've asked for a few minutes of your time to discuss a matter of national importance: the reform of America's immigration system.
The issue of immigration stirs intense emotions, and in recent weeks Americans have seen those emotions on display. On the streets of major cities, crowds have rallied in support of those in our country illegally. At our southern border, others have organized to stop illegal immigrants from coming in. Across the country, Americans are trying to reconcile these contrasting images. And in Washington, the debate over immigration reform has reached a time of decision. Tonight, I will make it clear where I stand and where I want to lead our country on this vital issue.
 We must begin by recognizing the problems with our immigration system. For decades, the United States has not been in complete control of its borders. As a result, many who want to work in our economy have been able to sneak across our border, and millions have stayed. 
 Once here, illegal immigrants live in the shadows of our society. Many use forged documents to get jobs, and that makes it difficult for employers to verify that the workers they hire are legal. Illegal immigration puts pressure on public schools and hospitals. It strains state and local budgets and brings crime to our communities. These are real problems, yet we must remember that the vast majority of illegal immigrants are decent people who work hard, support their families, practice their faith and lead responsible lives. They are part of American life, but they are beyond the reach and protection of American law.
 We're a nation of laws, and we must enforce our laws. We're also a nation of immigrants, and we must uphold that tradition, which has strengthened our country in so many ways. These are not contradictory goals. America can be a lawful society and a welcoming society at the same time. We will fix the problems created by illegal immigration, and we will deliver a system that is secure, orderly and fair. 
 So I support comprehensive immigration reform that will accomplish five clear objectives.

Securing the Borders
 First, the United States must secure its borders. This is a basic responsibility of a sovereign nation. It is also an urgent requirement of our national security. Our objective is straightforward: The border should be open to trade and lawful immigration and shut to illegal immigrants, as well as criminals, drug dealers and terrorists.
 I was the governor of a state that has a 1,200-mile border with Mexico. So I know how difficult it is to enforce the border and how important it is. Since I became president, we've increased funding for border security by 66 percent and expanded the Border Patrol from about 9,000 to 12,000 agents. The men and women of our Border Patrol are doing a fine job in difficult circumstances, and over the past five years they have apprehended and sent home about six million people entering America illegally.
 Despite this progress, we do not yet have full control of the border, and I am determined to change that. Tonight I'm calling on Congress to provide funding for dramatic improvements in manpower and technology at the border. By the end of 2008, we will increase the number of Border Patrol officers by an additional 6,000. When these new agents are deployed, we will have more than doubled the size of the Border Patrol during my presidency.
 At the same time, we are launching the most technologically advanced border security initiative in American history. We will construct high-tech fences in urban corridors and build new patrol roads and barriers in rural areas. We will employ motion sensors, infrared cameras and unmanned aerial vehicles to prevent illegal crossings. America has the best technology in the world, and we will ensure that the Border Patrol has the technology they need to do their job and secure our border.
 Training thousands of new Border Patrol agents and bringing the most advanced technology to the border will take time. Yet the need to secure our border is urgent. So I'm announcing several immediate steps to strengthen border enforcement during this period of transition.
 One way to help during this transition is to use the National Guard. So in coordination with governors, up to 6,000 Guard members will be deployed to our southern border. The Border Patrol will remain in the lead. The Guard will assist the Border Patrol by operating surveillance systems, analyzing intelligence, installing fences and vehicle barriers, building patrol roads and providing training. Guard units will not be involved in direct law enforcement activities. That duty will be done by the Border Patrol. 
 This initial commitment of Guard members would last for a period of one year. After that, the number of Guard forces will be reduced as new Border Patrol agents and new technologies come online. It is important for Americans to know that we have enough Guard forces to win the war on terror, to respond to natural disasters and help secure our border.
 The United States is not going to militarize the southern border. Mexico is our neighbor and our friend. We will continue to work cooperatively to improve security on both sides of the border, to confront common problems like drug trafficking and crime and to reduce illegal immigration.
 Another way to help during this period of transition is through state and local law enforcement in our border communities. So we will increase federal funding for state and local authorities assisting the Border Patrol on targeted enforcement missions. We will give state and local authorities the specialized training they need to help federal officers apprehend and detain illegal immigrants. State and local law enforcement officials are an important part of our border security and they need to be a part of our strategy to secure our borders.
 The steps I have outlined will improve our ability to catch people entering our country illegally. At the same time, we must ensure that every illegal immigrant we catch crossing our southern border is returned home. More than 85 percent of the illegal immigrants we catch crossing the southern border are Mexicans, and most are sent back home within 24 hours. 
 But when we catch illegal immigrants from other countries, it is not as easy to send them back home. For many years, the government did not have enough space in our detention facilities to hold them while the legal process unfolded. So most were released back into our society and asked to return for a court date. When the date arrived, the vast majority did not show up. This practice, called catch and release, is unacceptable, and we will end it. 

Temporary Worker Program
 Second, to secure our border, we must create a temporary worker program. The reality is that there are many people on the other side of our border who will do anything to come to America to work and build a better life. They walk across miles of desert in the summer heat or hide in the back of 18-wheelers to reach our country. This creates enormous pressure on our border that walls and patrols alone will not stop. To secure the border effectively, we must reduce the numbers of people trying to sneak across.
 Therefore, I support a temporary worker program that would create a legal path for foreign workers to enter our country in an orderly way, for a limited period of time. This program would match willing foreign workers with willing American employers for jobs Americans are not doing. Every worker who applies for the program would be required to pass criminal background checks. And temporary workers must return to their home country at the conclusion of their stay.
 A temporary worker program would meet the needs of our economy, and it would give honest immigrants a way to provide for their families while respecting the law. A temporary worker program would reduce the appeal of human smugglers and make it less likely that people would risk their lives to cross the border. It would ease the financial burden on state and local governments by replacing illegal workers with lawful taxpayers. And above all, a temporary worker program would add to our security by making certain we know who is in our country and why they are here.

Identification Cards
 Third, we need to hold employers to account for the workers they hire. It is against the law to hire someone who is in this country illegally. Yet businesses often cannot verify the legal status of their employees because of the widespread problem of document fraud. Therefore, comprehensive immigration reform must include a better system for verifying documents and work eligibility. 
 A key part of that system should be a new identification card for every legal foreign worker. This card should use biometric technology, such as digital fingerprints, to make it tamperproof. A tamperproof card would help us enforce the law and leave employers with no excuse for violating it. And by making it harder for illegal immigrants to find work in our country, we would discourage people from crossing the border illegally in the first place.

Citizenship and Deportation
 Fourth, we must face the reality that millions of illegal immigrants are here already. They should not be given an automatic path to citizenship. This is amnesty, and I oppose it. Amnesty would be unfair to those who are here lawfully, and it would invite further waves of illegal immigration. 
 Some in this country argue that the solution is to deport every illegal immigrant and that any proposal short of this amounts to amnesty. I disagree. It is neither wise nor realistic to round up millions of people, many with deep roots in the United States, and send them across the border. 
 There is a rational middle ground between granting an automatic path to citizenship for every illegal immigrant and a program of mass deportation. That middle ground recognizes there are differences between an illegal immigrant who crossed the border recently and someone who has worked here for many years and has a home, a family and an otherwise clean record.
 I believe that illegal immigrants who have roots in our country and want to stay should have to pay a meaningful penalty for breaking the law, to pay their taxes, to learn English and to work in a job for a number of years. People who meet these conditions should be able to apply for citizenship, but approval would not be automatic, and they will have to wait in line behind those who played by the rules and followed the law. 
 What I've just described is not amnesty; it is a way for those who have broken the law to pay their debt to society and demonstrate the character that makes a good citizen.

Speaking English
 Fifth, we must honor the great American tradition of the melting pot, which has made us one nation out of many peoples. The success of our country depends upon helping newcomers assimilate into our society and embrace our common identity as Americans. 
 Americans are bound together by our shared ideals, an appreciation of our history, respect for the flag we fly, and an ability to speak and write the English language. English is also the key to unlocking the opportunity of America. English allows newcomers to go from picking crops to opening a grocery, from cleaning offices to running offices, from a life of low-paying jobs to a diploma, a career and a home of their own.

HEADLINE: President's Middle Path Disappoints Both Sides

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY and RALPH BLUMENTHAL; Monica Davey reported from Chicago for this article, and Ralph Blumenthal from Houston. Brenda Goodman contributed reporting from Atlanta, and Carolyn Marshall from San Francisco.

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 15 

 BODY:
As Jose F. watched President Bush's address from an apartment on this city's Northwest side, he shook his head fiercely at moments: at the prospect of tamper-proof identification cards for legal workers, at the many mentions of increased border security, and at what he saw, in the end, as uncertainty of the future Mr. Bush intended for illegal immigrants like himself. 
 ''I worry about the militarization and whether this will mean more deaths on the border,'' said Jose F., 27, who sneaked in from Mexico nearly eight years ago and who asked that his last name not be used because he feared losing his job at a social services agency, deportation or both. ''And identification cards will only make it harder to survive, and people will have to go further underground and work for cash.'' 
In Houston, meanwhile, Louise Whiteford watched the president with equal skepticism. Ms. Whiteford, president of Texans for Immigration Reform, a group opposed to illegal immigration and founded in 1999, swiftly took issue with several of Mr. Bush's promises and accomplishments, including an increase in the Border Patrol to 12,000 agents from 9,000 since his administration took over.
 ''This is very inadequate,'' Ms. Whiteford, 76, said. ''That's about the number of police in Fort Worth and Dallas.'' When the president said he planned to add 6,000 more by 2008, she shook her head, noting, ''That's too long.''
 If Jose F. and Ms. Whiteford were any indication, Mr. Bush managed to disappoint people on both sides of the immigration debate on Monday night. Each side said it had hoped to hear more encouraging words over an issue that has become a showdown in Congress and on the streets of cities like Los Angeles and Chicago. Each side saw hints of an extended fight ahead. 
 Some supporters of tighter border restrictions said they did not approve of the way they said Mr. Bush had signaled that he wanted some of the nation's estimated 11 million illegal immigrants to become legal. On the other hand, some immigrants and their advocates said they did not agree with his clearly stated opposition to anything resembling ''amnesty.''
 ''I don't know what he is saying for someone like me,'' Jose F. said of the president's description of a ''rational middle ground'' somewhere between granting citizenship to all illegal immigrants and deporting all of them. ''I have been working really hard. I have learned English. I pay taxes. I am not here in the country to bring problems.''
 But Ms. Whiteford, who watched the president on her 12-inch General Electric television with a rabbit-ears antenna, was on guard against anything Mr. Bush had to say about allowing illegal immigrants to legalize their status over time with a fine.
 ''My citizenship is not for sale,'' she said. ''I don't like the idea that money can buy citizenship.''
 Ms. Whiteford grew up in Lima, Ohio, mingling happily, she said, with wartime immigrants, only to find the nation now victimized by ''a form of slavery, bringing in cheap labor that the corporations want and squeezing the middle class.''
 She said immigrants filled no special economic niche. ''I don't buy this 'jobs Americans aren't doing,' '' she said. ''I can't think of a job Americans aren't doing. My granddaughter runs a fishing boat in Alaska. One of my sons worked on an oil rig.''
 In border communities like Yuma, Ariz., however, where a local restaurant had to delay its opening repeatedly because it could not find enough employees, the president's call for immediate action on a way to bring more workers into the country legally struck a positive chord.
 ''We need access to a legal work force,'' said C. R. Waters, president of the Yuma Fresh Vegetable Association, a trade group that represents about 100 area growers. During the last harvest, Mr. Waters said, farms were badly short of labor.
 ''We need our borders secure,'' he said, ''but we also have to have an available legal work force.'' 
 Because it is so difficult for employers to verify legal status, Mr. Waters said his group strongly supported measures mentioned in the president's address like biometric identification, which would make crossing the border legal and rapid for workers who wanted to commute between Mexico and the United States. 
 Others, though, saw little new in the president's plans.
 ''This seems to be a replay of every budget speech for the last 20 years,'' said John D. Trasvina, interim president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. ''They always say they want more personnel and more technology at the border. It's a failed policy.''
 In San Francisco, where the president's speech was broadcast on a television above the jukebox at Los Jarritos, a popular Mexican restaurant, Dolores Reyes, an owner, disagreed with nearly every point Mr. Bush made.
 Ms. Reyes said she favored amnesty and objected to the idea of deploying the National Guard to the border. ''The people will still find a way because money talks,'' she said.
 Back in Chicago, so much talk of border security sent Jose F.'s mind racing back to his own journey to a small town in Arizona after a 12-hour walk over the border. Fears of patrols were bad enough then, he said. 
 ''I think the president needs to remember that all of these illegal people are going to have kids who vote here one day,'' he said. ''They think we don't matter, but those kids are not going to forget who helped their parents and who didn't.''

HEADLINE: Judge Rules Against City's Plan To Renovate Hunts Point Site

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Dealing a setback to the city's plan for redeveloping the South Bronx, a state judge ruled yesterday that the city must start over in trying to fill a big vacant warehouse near the Hunts Point Terminal Market. 
 In a preliminary ruling at the end of a five-week trial, Justice Lucy Billings of State Supreme Court in the Bronx stopped the city from leasing the site to Baldor Specialty Foods, a wholesaler of fruits and vegetables. The merchant cooperative at the Hunts Point market had sued the city and Baldor, contending that the city's Economic Development Corporation illegally awarded the lease last fall.
 Randy M. Mastro, a lawyer who represented the cooperative, argued that city officials chose Baldor to help solve a political problem for the mayor: the pending displacement of vendors at the Bronx Terminal Market, which a developer plans to turn into a mall. But, Mr. Mastro said, not all bidders knew that finding homes for those displaced vendors was a factor in awarding the lease.
 ''When the city runs a competitive process, it has to run a fair process,'' said Mr. Mastro, a former deputy mayor. ''They had in mind a particular party who they knew would be vacating their existing space. But the city didn't disclose that it had a hidden agenda.''
 Terri Sasanow, senior counsel in the city's Law Department, said the city would wait to see the text of the judge's decision before deciding whether to appeal or put the lease up for bids again. But she disputed Mr. Mastro's contention that the first effort had been unfair to his clients or any of the other bidders.
 ''We believe that the E.D.C.'s decision-making processes were fair and legal,'' she said in a statement.
 A spokesman for Baldor declined to say whether the company would take part in a second round of bidding more than eight months after the first one began. The company's chairman, Kevin Murphy, said in a statement that Baldor was ''deeply disappointed with the decision.''
 City officials said they too were disappointed about the scuttling of a deal that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg celebrated just five months ago. Announcing the lease to Baldor at a news conference in Hunts Point in December, Mr. Bloomberg praised the company for agreeing to make its current base of operations available at an affordable rent.
 ''This represents an incredible chance for those tenants to move into a safer, cleaner, more attractive environment and accelerate the renovation of the Bronx Terminal Market,'' the mayor said then.
 Those merchants have to move out by June 1 to make way for the Related Companies to redevelop the site as a shopping mall, said Stanley Mayer, a produce seller who is president of the Bronx Terminal Market Preservation Association. Mr. Mayer said that almost all of the merchants knew where they were going but that none of them planned to move to Baldor's building.
 ''It's beyond ironic,'' he said.

LICALZI, 1ST LT. MICHAEL LUCIAN

 BODY:
 LiCALZI--1st Lt. Michael Lucian. Michael died Thursday, May 11 in Al Anbar Province, Iraq while in the service of his nation. He was 24 years old. 
His death took place while he was a platoon leader in ''A'' Company of the United States Marine Corps 2nd Tank Battalion. Michael and his three other Marine comrades drowned as a result of an accident involving their M1A1 Battle Tank. He was born on Long Island, NY on April 11, 1982 with his twin brother Greg. Michael grew up in Garden City, NY and attended Chaminade High School, Class of 2000, where he was a member of the track, cross country and crew teams. As a child and a young man Mike had always expressed to his family the goal of one day becoming a Marine. Following an arduous admissions process he was appointed to the United States Naval Academy and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics in May 2004. At the Academy he was a model student, courageous boxer and active leader of the 30th Company where he developed strong and lasting friendships. Mike was commissioned as a 2nd Lt. in the USMC at graduation and attended The Basic School in Quantico, VA. It was there that he took the opportunity to make friends with Marines from all corners of the country. He elected to enter armor school at US Army Armor Center, Fort Knox, Kentucky where he was the honor graduate of his training company. Mike was deployed to Iraq with ''A'' Company in late March of this year. Everyone who knew Mike will agree that he was an honest, ethical, modest, diligent and hardworking student and Marine, and that he was exceptionally loyal and fiercely dedicated to his family, friends and the Corps. Everywhere he went and in everything he did Michael gave 100%, whether as a LiCalzi, Flyer, Midshipman or Teufelhund. Among his many interests Mike was a voracious reader, loved to surf, play poker, try new beers, handicap thoroughbreds, watch (but no longer participate in) boxing matches, and root for the Mets. Mike was also an avid outdoor sportsman. His mother and father, Carol and Gregory LiCalzi of Celebration, FL and Westhampton Beach, NY, his sister Elizabeth, his brothers Gregory and Luke, and a large extended family grievously mourn him. Friends are welcome to call at Fairchild Sons Funeral Home, 1201 Franklin Avenue, Garden City (516-746-0585) on Thursday 7-9 PM, Friday 2-4 and 7-9 PM. Mass of Christian Burial will be held at St. Joseph's RC Church in Garden City at 9:30 AM Saturday May 20 with burial at Long Island National Cemetery (Farmingdale). In lieu of flowers Mike's family believes that he would appreciate donations to Chaminade High School or the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation.

HEADLINE: Deere Profit Is Aided by Construction Unit 

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Deere & Company, the maker of agricultural equipment, posted a quarterly profit yesterday that beat Wall Street forecasts, supported by strength in its construction unit. 
 Deere, whose shares rose 2 percent, said better pricing and lower retirement costs supported results, while planned lower manufacturing volumes and higher raw material costs applied pressure. Farm equipment sales declined.
''The number is pretty much where they thought it would be,'' an analyst at Longbow Research, Eli Lustgarten, said. ''It looks like the underlying profitability was better than expected.''
 The company, based in Moline, Ill., reported a second-quarter profit of $744.6 million, or $3.13 a share, compared with $604 million, or $2.43 a share, a year earlier.
 Excluding its discontinued health care business and expenses for a debt redemption and a factory closing, Deere earned $2.37 a share. Analysts on average expected $2.31 a share excluding one-time items, according to Reuters Estimates.
 Deere, which also makes construction equipment and lawn and garden products, said revenue rose 2 percent, to $6.56 billion. Farm equipment sales fell about 7 percent in the quarter, while construction and forestry unit sales rose 10 percent.
 Analysts expect 2006 to be a down year for Deere and its rivals, the Agco Corporation and CNH Global, because of declining farm cash receipts, rising interest rates, high fuel and fertilizer prices and uncertainty about government subsidies.
 Farm equipment sales are expected to be flat to down 2 percent for the year, Deere said. Deere raised its forecast for sales growth in the construction and forestry unit, to a range of 10 percent to 12 percent, from 8 percent to 10 percent.

HEADLINE: Help With Reactor Included In European Offer to Iran

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16 

 BODY:
The leading nations of Europe, working with the United States, are preparing to offer Iran new assistance in building a light-water nuclear reactor for civilian use in return for Iran's ending activities suspected of being a cover for a weapons program, European and American diplomats said Tuesday.
 The offer to help with a light-water reactor, which could not easily be used to make weapons, is part of a new package of incentives the Europeans are assembling in one more attempt to salvage their negotiations with Iran. The package is also to contain threats of economic punishments if Iran does not cooperate. 
In their bid to get Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment activities and reassure the West that it is not making nuclear weapons, the Europeans have previously held out the possibility of Iran's being allowed to have a light-water reactor. But the new package would more explicitly promise Western help to build it, officials said.
 ''The Europeans are dusting off and refining what has already been on the table and seeing what is possible in terms of new ideas,'' said a senior State Department official, one of several diplomats who discussed the European package, on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to describe the plan, which has not been completed.
 A light-water reactor requires enriched uranium for fuel, but under the deal to be proposed by the West, Iran would be guaranteed a supply of fuel from outside the country in return for giving up the fuel after it is used. That way, Western experts say, the reactor byproducts could not be used in a weapons program.
 The Bush administration has not formally endorsed the European package because it has not been completed and because American diplomats say that the package of punishments has not been made final. Washington wants to make sure that Europe presents Iran with inducements for cooperation and disincentives for defiance.
 American and European diplomats acknowledged that they were far from certain that Iran would be interested in the new European proposal, which is to be discussed in London later this week or early next week by top American, European, Russian and Chinese diplomats.
 Russian and Chinese attitudes are considered crucial, the diplomats said. So far, Russia and China have rejected the United States effort to get a United Nations Security Council resolution demanding that Iran cooperate in the nuclear area or face possible sanctions.
 The latest effort to assemble a package came out of a meeting last week of top envoys that European officials say went badly. They said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, had an unpleasant exchange on the Iran issue at a dinner attended by other senior envoys.
 Some officials said Ms. Rice and Mr. Lavrov had spoken harshly in both Russian and English -- languages they both speak -- in a way that filled others with dismay about the prospects for future cooperation. It was then that Ms. Rice and some others came up with the idea of repackaging their proposals to Iran.
 The hope of the United States, Britain and France is that if the latest incentives are rejected by Iran, Russia might be more inclined to move a step toward possible sanctions. But that is a hope more than an expectation, European diplomats said.
 Iran maintains that all its activities are aimed at supplying civilian nuclear energy, but Western specialists say that with all its oil, Iran does not need nuclear energy and must be trying to make a bomb. International inspectors have also cited Iran for failing to disclose its nuclear activities as required by various accords.
 The new package to be presented to Iran is the latest in talks that have been going on for more than a year and a half. The previous package was presented to Iran last August by Britain, France, Germany and the European Union as a whole. I return for giving up uranium enrichment, it offered Iran a full array of cooperative steps, including improved diplomatic ties, possible security guarantees and upgraded economic and trade relations. Iran has repeatedly rejected those offers as long as the price to be paid was giving up uranium enrichment, an activity it resumed last summer in the face of outraged protests from the West. 
 Some members of the Bush administration say that Iran is approaching a ''point of no return,'' if it has not already reached it, in which it will have mastered the technology and understanding of the enrichment process, enabling it eventually to make a nuclear weapon. But actually making weapons would take years, those officials say.

 BODY:

BUSH IMMIGRATION PUSH -- President Bush pushed ahead with his effort to bring Republicans in the House and Senate together on a plan to reduce illegal immigration. But he ran into renewed resistance from conservatives who said they were not swayed by the case he made to give many undocumented workers a chance to become citizens. [Page A1.] 


BERTELSMANN WEIGHS FUTURE -- Sometime next week, executives of Bertelsmann, a trans-Atlantic media colossus and arguably Germany's most influential privately owned enterprise, expect to receive a letter from their sole outside shareholder, calling on them to take the company public. [C1.]

ENRON TRIAL -- In their closing arguments in the Enron trial, defense lawyers ripped into the government's case, accusing prosecutors of pushing at all costs to punish Enron's top two officers for the failure of the company that became synonymous with corporate malfeasance in the late 1990's. [C1.]

IN THE HOT SEAT -- For years, the securities class-action law firm Milberg Weiss Bershad & Schulman inspired fear and uncertainty in executive suites and boardrooms.

HEWLETT PROFIT RISES 51% -- Hewlett-Packard said that strong sales of laptop computers and printer supplies, along with cost-cutting, helped push its second-quarter profit up 51 percent. The company also said its market share in personal computers increased 1.4 percent. [C1.]

GAS PRICES DON'T DETER SHOPPERS -- Defying predictions that rising gasoline prices would rein in consumer spending, the nation's two largest retailers, Wal-Mart Stores and Home Depot, reported sharply higher first-quarter profit. The chains account for more than 10 percent of United States retail sales. [C3.]

VERIZON DENIES IT GAVE RECORDS -- Verizon, the country's second-largest phone company, said it had not provided local phone records to the National Security Agency. A day earlier, BellSouth had issued a similar statement in response to a report in USA Today. [A15.]

HEADLINE: Bar the Door, TV Ads Want Your TiVo

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
NEXT Monday night, Jack Bauer will wrap up the fifth season of ''24'' by trying to bring down the president of the United States. A Richard Nixon look-alike named Charles Logan, the president has been secretly working with terrorists to secure a steady flow of oil to this country and doing a lot of bad things in the process. Bauer, a government agent played by Kiefer Sutherland, seems like the last man who can stop him.
 It will be one of the biggest nights of the television year for the young, well-off viewers the networks cherish. ''24'' may be the 24th-highest-rated show this season, but its high-income fan base -- including insiders in Hollywood and at the White House -- make it a more valuable franchise for Fox than its ranking suggests. 
 That means the show's viewers are also the same people who tend to own a TiVo, so many of them won't really sit down at 8 p.m., 7 central, on Monday to watch the two-hour finale. They will wait until 8:30 and then fast-forward through the ads, or they will do something else entirely on Monday night and watch the finale a day or two later. 
 No Top 40 program has a higher percentage of its audience watching on delay, according to numbers from Nielsen Media Research. Only ''Lost'' and ''Survivor'' come close. 
 It's a perfectly pleasant way to watch a show, and it is easy to imagine that television will always be this good as long as you have a TiVo. But the odds that we have entered a post-advertising age are about as good as the odds that Jack Bauer gets killed next week.
 MANY of the people plotting to solve the TiVo problem are in New York this week for a series of meetings called the upfronts. At the upfronts, each major network gets a day to impress advertisers and critics by showing clips from next season's lineup and then serving a lot of free drinks. Today is CBS's turn, with the clips running at Carnegie Hall and the drinks being poured at Tavern on the Green.
 What makes this year's meetings more interesting than usual is a fight over how television ratings should count TiVo viewers and how much advertisers should pay for them. (To be technical about it, the proper term is ''DVR viewers,'' as in digital video recorders, but I think TiVo has risen to Kleenex status.)
 Advertisers are still smarting from their timidity back in the 1980's, when VCR's started catching on and Nielsen decided that its ratings would include people who taped programs rather than watching them live. The truth, of course, is that many recorded shows never end up being watched. 
 ''We've lived with that decision for 20 years, and we're still living with it,'' said Lyle Schwartz, the research director at a company called Mediaedge:cia, which negotiates with networks on behalf of advertisers. ''Advertisers don't want to pay for people who don't watch their shows.''
 With the stakes much larger this time around, Nielsen has started releasing three different ratings for every show. The first is the old-fashioned version, which counts the live audience (as well as the VCR audience). The second includes people who watch the show on their DVR within 24 hours, while the third adds everybody who watches within a week of a show's broadcast. Mr. Schwartz and his firm are pushing Nielsen to go even further and calculate separate ratings for a show and for its commercials. 
 Network executives, as you may guess, have done their best to pooh-pooh the impact of TiVo. The head of sales at ABC said a few months back that he would not even negotiate with advertisers who insisted on using only Nielsen's live ratings. The networks also released a study suggesting that DVR owners remember as much about commercials as people without the devices, which is clearly ludicrous. 
 Privately, though, the executives understand that TiVo is rapidly undercutting the economics of television. Since ''24'' made its debut in 2001, my wife and I have missed just one episode, yet I don't think we have seen a commercial in three years. We are free riders, enjoying the product without paying the bills.
 By 2008, more than one in four households will own a DVR, up from one in eight now, Forrester Research predicts. So television clearly cannot continue moving in the direction it has been moving. ''For TiVo to matter,'' Thomas S. Rogers, the chief executive of TiVo, said, ''there has to be great television out there, and there has to be the funding for it.''
 Television these days seems to be about where the Internet was five years ago. People are getting an amazing variety of entertainment essentially free, while the companies making the product try to figure out a new business model.
 On the Web, you now must pay for full access to Weather.com, ESPN and this newspaper, among other sites, and you also have to sift through ever more insidious advertising. Television is starting to go the same way.
 More shows are likely to move to a model like HBO's, in which you pay to be entertained but avoid watching commercials. Advertisers will also figure out ways to reach you even if you do own a TiVo. Product placement will become more popular, as it already is on reality shows, and banners and scrolls will appear on your screen even more often. 
 When you put it all together, you start to realize that television may not be changing as much as it sometimes seems to be. TiVo is not going to kill advertising, and it won't kill the networks. If anything, it may help them, by increasing the audience for top shows like ''24'' at the expense of shows that just happen to be on when you turn on your set. 
 And once they have gotten you to watch the show, the TiVo-proof ads will surely follow. The golden age of commercial-free prime time isn't going to last long.

HEADLINE: An American Embassy in Tripoli

 BODY:
There's something about the news that the United States is renewing diplomatic relations with Libya after more than 25 years that justifiably leaves a lot of Americans feeling dissatisfied. For almost three decades, Libya has been synonymous with terrorism, fanaticism and undiluted anti-Americanism. 
 This is the country that used its vast oil wealth to finance Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's fantasies of international revolutionary leadership by sponsoring coups, invasions, assassination attempts and terrorist atrocities across the world. Americans got a taste of Colonel Qaddafi's methods in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, an attack that killed 270 people. A year later, another Libyan terrorist bomb killed 170 people on a French airliner over Africa.
Libyans themselves have endured decades of assassinations, abductions and torture. Somehow, the idea that this can all be washed down the memory drain with new diplomatic flourishes doesn't seem right.
 Yet the reality is that the world has changed immeasurably since the days when relations were so bad that President Ronald Reagan bombed targets in Tripoli and Benghazi after accusing Libya of ordering the German disco bombing that killed three people. There is the obvious: the Sept. 11 attack, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the crisis over Iran's nuclear ambitions. But beyond that, the truth is that Libya isn't so much of a player in the world of state-sponsored terrorism anymore.
 In recent years, Colonel Qaddafi has withdrawn from direct involvement in international terrorism. He also agreed in 2003 to dismantle Libya's unconventional weapons programs, and all reports say he has done just that. In addition, he has apparently refrained from channeling any funds into financing weapons programs or terrorism.
 Colonel Qaddafi's one-time protege, Charles Taylor, the former Liberian president and warlord, has now been neutered and is behind bars, where he belongs. There is a strong case for easing Libya's economic isolation and improving the lot of its people. 
 But the Bush administration's decision to make nice with Libya does highlight the apparent schizophrenia of America's relations with other countries -- like Iran. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, in announcing on Monday the restoration of full diplomatic ties with Libya, called Libya an ''important model as nations around the world press for changes in behavior by the Iranian and North Korean regimes.''
 That raises this question: Hasn't the breakthrough come about because the United States has held direct talks with Libyan officials? That certainly isn't the case with Iran. Perhaps it should be.

HEADLINE: To Revitalize a City, Try Spreading Some Mulch 

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
IN many ways, this city's current fortunes are all about mulch. It's everywhere. Bark mulch is spread in neat circles around the city's trees; roughly 30,000 new trees are planted annually. Darker leaf mulch fills planters along State, Dearborn, Michigan and the other major thoroughfares now blooming in spring colors. 
 Mulch adorns 70 miles of green medians that have been sown over the last decade with native flowers, grasses and bushes. It's spread on the gardens and open spaces now required by the city to accompany new homes, stores and office buildings. And it sits on many of the energy-saving green roofs of 200 buildings.
But even more than its soil-enriching, moisture-conserving utility, mulch is an organic metaphor, tying together the various pieces of Chicago's novel development strategy, praised by the Sierra Club and the Chamber of Commerce alike. By wrapping its arms and famous big shoulders around its Latin motto -- Urbs in Horto (City in a Garden) -- Chicago has become a global model for how a metropolis can pursue environmental goals to achieve economic success. 
 During the last decade, the city's performance, measured in virtually every conventional category of civic well-being, has been off the charts, local boosters say. Chicago attracted more than 100,000 new residents, added tens of thousands of downtown jobs, prompted a high-rise housing boom, reduced poverty rates, built thousands of affordable homes, spurred a $9-billion-a-year visitor and convention industry, and transformed itself into one of the most beautiful cities in America.
 The generator of Chicago's mulch is Richard M. Daley, the unorthodox and popular Democratic mayor who took office in 1989 vowing to replant the urban forest of his youth that was lost to Dutch elm disease and other blights. At the time, the pledge raised the eyebrows of supporters and critics, who chalked up the mayor's love for trees to his birth on Arbor Day in 1942.
 The tree planting, though, evolved over Mr. Daley's five terms into a much more sophisticated understanding of the benefits -- including to the city's treasury -- of conserving resources, saving energy, expanding parks, constructing environmentally sensitive buildings, reducing the amount of storm water, restoring wetlands, generating renewable energy and doing everything feasible to heal instead of harm the city's natural systems. 
 Over the years, Mayor Daley's plan to turn his hometown into the ''greenest city in America'' has ceased to be an unusual experiment in revitalization. Instead it is seen by urban policy specialists as an effective response to the rapidly changing expectations that business executives and residents, especially young professionals, have for cities. 
 ''It's not so much about saving the world,'' Sadhu Johnston, the 31-year-old environment commissioner for Chicago, said in an interview. ''It's more about using green technology to save $4 million here, or earn $10 million there, and make the city better by doing that.''
 The breadth and diversity of Mayor Daley's environmental and economic pursuits, one idea connecting and supporting the next, mimic natural systems. Take Mr. Daley's fondness for mulch. It's useless unless it gets spread. 
 That falls to people like Christy Webber, a landscape contractor who has turned Chicago's devotion to lawns, gardens, planters, parks and green roofs into a $13-million-a-year business and one of the city's fastest-growing small companies. ''By planting more gardens, the mayor encouraged new businesses to grow,'' said Ms. Webber, whose company, Christy Webber Landscapes, has helped install many of Chicago's important new gardens. 
 Ms. Webber, who is 44 and was raised in a working-class family outside Flint, Mich., started her company in 1990, the year after Mr. Daley was elected. Her company's development closely tracks the mayor's evolution of environmentalism as an economic plan. 
 The Daley administration has planted 500,000 trees, is putting up the most energy-efficient and environmentally sensitive municipal buildings in the country, has agreed to provide developers with much faster permits if they construct green buildings, instituted a $600-million-a-year program to repair neighborhoods and city parks, promised to obtain 20 percent of the electricity used by the city from clean and renewable sources, and converted hundreds of abandoned and contaminated properties into new businesses. 
 Mr. Daley's commitment is praised by the city's environmental leaders, although they note that there are gaps in the green program -- including the presence of two big state-licensed coal-burning power plants that operate without modern air-pollution controls. 
 ''The mayor took the idea of green and has become increasingly serious,'' said Scott Bernstein, the founder of the Center for Neighborhood Technology, a research and policy organization that earlier this year earned ''platinum'' designation from the U.S. Green Building Council -- the nation's highest environmental rating -- for the renovation of the center's West Side office. ''If you compare where the city was when Daley first came into office and where the city is now, it's night and day.''
 Nobody in or out of the Daley administration, including the mayor, knows exactly when environmental sensitivity became central to Chicago's development strategy. Ms. Webber is convinced that the moment came in 1996 when Mr. Daley began spending on a citywide beautification program to impress the delegates and the media who were attending the Democratic National Convention that year.
 City crews cleared abandoned buildings in the West Side neighborhoods surrounding the United Center, the convention site. Mr. Daley accelerated bush and flower planting, hung flowering pots from new period street lamps and promoted neighborhood gardens.
 The sparkling appearance turned heads. Mayor Daley and his green initiative rose to national and international prominence. In 2001, Boeing moved its headquarters from Seattle to Chicago, partly because the company's executives said they wanted to live there. That same year Mr. Daley built a green roof on City Hall. 
 Ms. Webber rode the green wave to contracts to cut, plant, mulch, install and maintain enough gardens and parks to employ over 100 people. Her revenue increased to $2 million in 1998, and $6.8 million in 2003. In 2004, Inc. Magazine said she and her squad of workers were the 54th fastest growing ''inner city'' company in America. This year Ms. Webber is scheduled to move the company to a new green headquarters designed by Farr Associates, the most prominent of the city's growing cadre of ecologically sensitive architects. 
 ''After the convention, business just took off,'' said Ms. Webber, whose building is going up on the reclaimed site where the 1996 West Side demolition debris was dumped. ''And it hasn't stopped.''
 Indeed, when the results of the 2000 census were published, the magnitude of Chicago's transformation became clear. The city population increased by 112,000 people, the first time that happened since the 1940's. Just as striking was the resurgence of Chicago's downtown neighborhoods, which grew by 16,000 residents during the 1990's, according to an analysis by the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program. The city's median income increased 12.6 percent in the 1990's, 2 percent higher than the median incomes of the state or the six-county metropolitan region. With the new wealth, Ms. Webber and others here assert that Mr. Daley's crowning achievement is Millennium Park, a 24.5-acre, $475 million expanse of lawn, wild-grass prairie, sculpture and gardens that joins the fast-growing neighborhoods along Michigan Avenue. 
 Ms. Webber helped install the turf and gardens, but says she lost money on the project because of constant design changes. Mr. Daley, who also encountered turmoil, dedicated the park in July 2004 amid criticism about delays and the cost, which was three times the original estimate. 
 Hardly anybody is still complaining. Landscape architects say the park set a new standard for design. Environmental leaders note that it showcases some green technologies, especially because it is the largest green roof in the world. Millennium Park is above an underground parking garage and ribbons of old Illinois Central track, which for more than a century separated the South Loop from the lakeshore. 
 Mr. Daley and his staff say that the park provides more evidence of the value of pursuing green goals. A market study commissioned by the city found that the park attracts nearly four million visitors annually, was responsible for encouraging at least 25 percent of the 10,000 units of new housing under construction or planned in neighborhoods nearby, and increased hotel, restaurant, shopping and entertainment sales by $190 million a year.
 Chicago is currently the host for an exposition, Garden in a City, set in an adjoining park. The show, which opened on May 13, is expected to attract tens of thousands of home owners and landscape professionals before it closes this Sunday. On display are plants that thrive in cities, with demonstrations on how to decorate bungalow backyards and build beautiful plazas. Ms. Webber prepared an exhibition to showcase her company's work. No surprise, the event also features beds of mulch.

HEADLINE: Panning E-Waste for Gold

BYLINE: By SUSAN MORAN

 BODY:
RENEE ST. DENIS is prospecting. Scanning the rows of the latest arrivals of discarded computers and other electronic products at Hewlett-Packard's 200,000-square-foot recycling plant, she searches for precious metals. 
 A co-worker calls out, ''Renee, check this out -- an arcade console!''
Ms. St. Denis, who directs Hewlett's recycling operations in the Americas, dashes to the game station towering above boxes of computers, keyboards and other junk. 
 Ms. St. Denis points out that this plant, which is in Roseville, Calif., and Hewlett's other recycling operation, in Nashville, process 1.5 million pounds of electronics a month. The materials that they sort through are richer in precious metals than ore from a mine. Hewlett collects 8 to 10 ounces of gold, silver, palladium and other precious metals per ton of ''ore,'' compared with 6 ounces per ton in a typical extractive mine. 
 ''We all want these valuable resources put back into the economy in some way, shape or form,'' she said.
 Ms. St. Denis is at the forefront of a major behavioral shift among electronics manufacturers. Many of them are taking more financial responsibility for the recovery and recycling of the goods they make and sell. They are also creating products with fewer toxic materials, and in some cases with biomass-based materials, so that the equipment can be more easily reused, recycled or decomposed in landfills. 
 Companies contend that the upfront investment in greener product design and recycling can pay off down the road -- by avoiding regulatory fines, averting shareholder complaints and lawsuits, and catering to the demands of customers who want to use greener products.
 Necessity is behind much of the invention. The European Union passed several environmental directives in recent years. One mandate, which takes effect in July, severely restricts the six deadliest materials used in making most electronic equipment: lead, mercury, a carcinogenic form of chromium, cadmium and two polybrominated flame retardants (PBB and PBDE).
 The mandate applies to products sold in the European Union. But many multinational manufacturers anticipate that other countries will soon follow suit with equally strict laws, so they are rolling out products to meet the most rigorous standards. 
 ''The trend is for more and more regulations,'' said Mark Newton, the head of Dell's environmental affairs group on product design. ''When you're a global company, you need to have a global solution. And if you wait to make changes in your products it can be extremely expensive.''
 For Dell, redesigning products to be more ecological has been a ''net gain,'' Mr. Newton said. 
 Lead, for example, is used in cathode-ray-tube monitors for TV's and older computers to protect users from exposure to X-rays. Most companies have already eliminated or reduced lead in computer monitors.
 Sony has replaced lead solder with a tin-silver-copper alloy. Sony, Panasonic, Apple, Hewlett-Packard and others have phased out lead in some cases by replacing cathode-ray tubes with liquid-crystal displays. 
 Matching the properties of lead and other toxic materials, however, is no minor challenge. Lead has a higher melting temperature than most alternatives, which means it can withstand more heat. 
 Mark Small, senior vice president for environmental safety and health at Sony, said it took six years to master lead-free solder. ''In the short term, it's more expensive and more difficult to work with than lead solder,'' he said. ''But we're motivated by the long-term environmental benefits and compliance issues.'' 
 Most major manufacturers banned polybrominated flame retardants -- some have been linked to damage in the hormonal and skeletal systems in people -- from their products several years ago, well ahead of the European Union's directive. Some companies are starting to use recycled polyethylene. Hewlett-Packard reuses polyethylene (from its inkjet printers and from water and soda bottles) in the carriage covers of some of its Scanjet scanners. 
 One of the most intriguing areas of green design is what some call the hydrocarbon-to-carbohydrate revolution: substituting petroleum-based plastics with biopolymers made from corn and other plants. The Japanese companies NEC Corporation, Unikita and NTT DoCoMo have developed cellphones with casings from bio-based plastics like polylactic acid reinforced with kenaf fiber. 
 While biomass-based alternatives easily meet standards in cold-food packaging, making the grade for electronics housings is much more difficult. John Dorgan, a professor of chemical engineering at the Colorado School of Mines who specializes in polymers, said that many of the bio-based acids are brittle. And some compounds that are added to strengthen the biopolymers negate their ecological benefits. 
 Another problem with biopolymers is their heat intolerance. Case in point: A group of Hewlett's scientists developed a prototype printer with a polylactic acid shell. Last summer, John Frey, Hewlett's manager for corporate environment strategies, showed the printer at a meeting in Texas. He put it in the car trunk and drove to a meeting on a hot afternoon. When he arrived, he found the printer's shell had collapsed. 
 While Hewlett continues to develop products with some parts made of recycled plastics, for now it has shelved its biomass-based product research and development. ''We must have a valid business reason for doing things, not just an environmental reason,'' Mr. Frey said.
 Manufacturers are also focusing their greening efforts on reducing the electronic waste they produce and that consumers discard. Electronic products make up the fastest-growing portion of the waste stream. 
 Last year alone, more than 63 million computers in the United States were traded in for replacements or thrown out. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that more than two million tons of electronic waste ends up in landfills each year. TV's and computers are not harmful, but when burned or dumped, toxins in the products -- like lead, mercury and cadmium -- endanger health as well as air and water quality. 
 While a combination of United States laws and regulations ban dumping electronic waste in domestic landfills, many recyclers and brokers export e-waste to mostly unregulated markets overseas. About 80 percent of computers and other electronics collected for recycling are dumped in landfills in developing countries, according to watchdog organizations and industry groups.
 Electronics manufacturers are getting little prodding from the United States government; it is the only industrialized nation that did not ratify the Basel Convention, which prohibits richer nations from exporting hazardous waste to poorer countries. 
 Barbara Kyle, coordinator of the Silicon Valley Toxic Coalition's computer take-back campaign, said that until the United States signs on to the Basel treaty, e-waste will continue polluting communities overseas. 
 ''All these efforts to do more recycling, if not accompanied by closing the door to exporting e-waste to the third world, will mean we're just adding to the problem of other countries that are in no position to deal with our waste,'' Ms. Kyle said.
 Another European order, which requires all electronics manufacturers to pay for the collection, disposal and recycling of their products sold within the European Union, has lately been echoed by several state laws in the United States. Together, they have provided an impetus for manufacturers to control their e-waste. 
 Another reason for the greening trend among manufacturers is feisty shareholders. At Apple Computer, a shareholders'group drafted a resolution before the company's April 27 annual meeting demanding that the company extend its free iPod recycling program to all Apple products. The board, and ultimately the majority of shareholders, voted no. But a few days before the meeting, the company said in a press release that, starting in June, it would take back old computers, at no cost, when customers buy a new Apple computer online or at an Apple retailer.

HEADLINE: What's Kind to Nature Can Be Kind to Profits

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
GENERAL ELECTRIC would like you to know that it makes the world's most efficient electric generators, part of its Ecomagination program of clean technologies. BP, which used to be an abbreviation for British Petroleum but is now the company's official name, is promoting itself as ''Beyond Petroleum,'' with solar cells and wind.
 Ford, which before its profits fell off a cliff was promising to increase the fuel economy of its S.U.V.'s by 25 percent, still cares about the environment, company executives insist. Now it has found a way to paint cars that drastically cuts emissions of pollutants, and has patented technology that lets cars run on fuel from corn.
These industrial Goliaths want to be Jolly Green Giants. They have investors to impress and public images to maintain so that they can pursue high-profile projects that need government approvals. 
 They may also have profit motives; most of the green technologies that make money now are profitable only because of government tax incentives or subsidies. But if oil and natural gas become expensive enough, some technologies could become commercially viable on an unsubsidized basis.
 Green is in fashion -- the new black, the must-have, this decade's version of business imperatives like ''total quality management'' or ''management by objective.'' How else to explain why the National Football League plants hundreds of seedling trees to offset the greenhouse gas emissions produced by Super Bowl events? Did it help sell out the stadium or make football a more popular sport? The last World Cup soccer championship was also carbon-neutral. So was the 2002 tour by the Dave Matthews Band. 
 Business is going green for many reasons, not just the most obvious one, public image. There is also competitive advantage.
 ''You don't just compete on cost or quality of new products; you can also compete on environmental performance,'' said Donald B. Rosenfield, a senior lecturer at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management. At first, he said, companies simply dealt with regulations; later, they anticipated regulations. 
 ''Now I think that a lot of this is evidence that companies are viewing environmental capabilities as a strategic criterion by itself,'' he said. 
 In other words, add environmental impact as an element of consumer choice. ''Norms change,'' Mr. Rosenfield said. 
 Andrew L. Shapiro, chief executive of GreenOrder, a New York consulting firm that helped G. E. develop its Ecomagination campaign to stress its environmental credentials, called the current stress on green the ''third wave'' of business interaction with the environment. 
 The first, he said, was the familiar conflict with governments and environmentalists over pollution. The second was business concern about the environment and about public image, but with an underlying attitude that environmental good behavior incurs a financial cost. The third, now taking hold, he said, is ''seeing environmental leadership or stewardship as a source of business value for firms, in the long term.'' 
 Some specialists are not sure how far that trend goes. Mark C. Trexler, for instance, who founded a company in 1991 to advise corporations on carbon mitigation strategies, cited the Super Bowl, the soccer championship and the rock band tour in an article in the current issue of Environmental Forum, a publication of the Environmental Law Institute.
 ''I would venture to say 98 percent of the people attending those events don't have a clue,'' he said. ''So what are we doing it for?'' To educate the people attending, he answered, but consumers have yet to demonstrate much willingness to pay for being carbon-neutral.
 Ford is testing that proposition, now offering to sell car buyers ''carbon-offsets,'' essentially certifications that somebody somewhere is going to build a windmill, make electricity from cow manure or do something else to cut carbon emissions to balance what the new vehicle will emit.
 Business, in a step beyond the consumer mainstream, is proceeding with the conviction that there is profit in greenness. And even though the Bush administration, rejecting the Kyoto climate treaty and all mention of a carbon tax, is trying to shield businesses from carbon limits, some are calling for such a system.
 Cinergy, a utility with nine large coal-fired power plants, has called for regulations on carbon dioxide emissions. One reason is a simple desire for regulatory certainty. American Electric Power, the country's largest investor-owned coal burner, decided in 2004 to look into the threat posed by global warming. 
 Both companies could profit under certain kinds of carbon-limitation schemes. For example, if emission limits were based on historical averages, both would have huge allowances, which they might be able to sell for cash if they could cut their own output.
 No such system is in place now, of course, and the federal government's position does not call for limiting greenhouse gas output. But the government does not have to decide that global warming is making storms like Katrina more powerful; Wal-Mart has already done so. 
 In a recent speech, H. Lee Scott Jr., the chief executive of Wal-Mart, declared the ambitious goals of being supplied 100 percent by renewable energy, producing no waste and selling products ''that sustain our resources and the environment.'' He did not give a timetable. But even so, this is not your mother's Earth Day.
 Companies like Wal-Mart and Cinergy may be earning points that would be unavailable if the government were more involved. ''The logic for this kind of thing is much greater when you've got 75 percent of the public saying this is a big problem, and the federal government has no policy,'' Mr. Trexler said. ''There's a place for people to step into that and take advantage of that disconnect.''
 Wal-Mart's goals are ambitious, Mr. Scott said, and ''I'm not sure how to achieve them, at least not yet.''
 BP does not know how to achieve a carbon-balanced world either, but it has found advantages in supporting one. While environmentalists organized a boycott of Exxon Mobil last summer because it challenges the theory of global warming and wants to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, BP faced no such pressure.
 And when BP announced that it would build a plant that runs on oil residues and that the carbon dioxide would be permanently stored underground, the governor of California showed up for the announcement. The irony cannot be lost on Exxon Mobil, since BP is the biggest Alaskan producer. 
 BP's Web site includes an animated ''carbon calculator'' where consumers can enter their household size, housing type, number and type of vehicles and other factors, and get an estimate of how much of the world's 20 billion tons a year of carbon dioxide output is theirs, and how that compares with the average production. Most of the forms of energy consumers use, including gasoline, natural gas, electricity and aviation fuel, are produced either directly or indirectly by BP.
 A gallon of unleaded regular from BP will produce the same 20 pounds of carbon dioxide as a gallon of unleaded regular bought anywhere else, of course. But the solar cells and wind turbines built by BP are linked, said Mr. Shapiro, the consultant. ''There's a halo effect,'' he said. ''The soccer mom driving down any suburban route in America who sees three different gas stations, Exxon, BP or Shell, will pull into BP.'' 
 The company's advertising tagline is, ''It's a start,'' which is literally true. BP hopes for revenues of $1 billion from solar power by2008, which is substantial but minuscule compared with total revenues last year of over $350 billion.
 The company's chief executive, Lord Browne, said in an interview that policy makers, especially in Europe, were demanding low-carbon technologies, and that his company's goal was to provide a menu of them that is more attractive than the alternatives offered by its competitors. 
 Much of being green revolves around energy: whether making fuel, converting it to energy or, finally, selling products that work by using energy. BP is in the first category, and G.E. in the second and third.
 General Electric, which once polluted the Hudson River with PCB's as it manufactured transformers, now promises that it will invest $1.5 billion annually in research in cleaner technologies by 2010, up from $700 million in 2004. G.E. also says it will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 1 percent by 2012. With business as usual, the company says, it would have increased those emissions by 40 percent.
 More important is the efficiency of the products it sells. While its announcement stresses products that consumers do not buy, like electricity generators that churn out hundreds of megawatts, it also says it makes ''some of the world's most energy-efficient household solutions.'' (''Household solutions,'' to judge from the Web site, are what used to be called ''white goods,'' like washing machines and clothes dryers.) 
 To improve its image, the company organized a tour for reporters that included viewing windmills in the Irish Sea, each big enough to power 3,600 average window air-conditioners; 12-cylinder diesel engines in locomotives in use in California and Colorado with 40 percent less emissions than earlier models; and water desalination in Aruba.
 On G.E.'s Web site last year, fashion models seemingly unaccustomed to manual labor wave pickaxes in a coal mine, part of a promotion for cleaner ways to use coal.
 Ford, at the other end of the energy chain, builds products that turn fuel into work. In 2000, Ford promised to increase the fuel economy of its S.U.V.'s 25 percent by 2005; but in 2003, its income statement weakening and the public showing a taste for the biggest, thirstiest vehicles, Ford backed off. 
 That doesn't stop Ford from trying to be green. It holds meetings with reporters to promote ethanol, which can be made from corn, and last November it agreed to subsidize the installation of pumps that sell a mixture of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline. This is unusual in the car industry, which typically has a Hatfield-McCoy relationship with the fuel industry.
 The relevance of flex-fuel vehicles is modest; gasoline consumption is about 33 times larger than ethanol. Ford, however, is still pushing for any environmental advantage it can, on the factory floor or in the public eye. In December, it did both at once, announcing that it was developing a ''paint shop of the future.'' 
 The shop, at a truck plant, avoids the old system of applying an undercoat, drying it, applying a color coat, drying that and then applying a gloss coat and drying that. The three steps take time and space, and each drying operation uses energy and results in fumes that will cause smog unless they are burned.
 The new system applies all three coats at once and then dries them, and captures the fumes to use in generating electricity. That saves the natural gas that had been used to burn the fumes, and cuts the space required for the paint shop.
 ''This renders that ongoing conflict between doing good and making money into a thing of the past,'' said Andrew S. Hobbs, director for the environmental quality office at Ford. In a conference call with reporters, he called it ''the embodiment of sustainable manufacturing.'' 
 The finished truck will still emit tens of tons of carbon dioxide over its lifetime, but the new paint process saves $7 to $11 per vehicle. As BP might say, it's a start.

HEADLINE: Many Little Piggies, Handled With Care

BYLINE: By CHRISTIAN L. WRIGHT

 BODY:
IN 1993, Russ Kremer was driving his new boar from a pen to the sows on his farm in Osage County, Mo. The boar became aggressive while passing another boar and swung his head around abruptly, puncturing Mr. Kremer's knee with his tusk. Mr. Kremer, a fifth-generation pig farmer, said he didn't think much of it until his leg swelled to twice its normal size. 
 He checked into the hospital and ''they gave me all kinds of antibiotics,'' Mr. Kremer said, but the infection was resistant to them. The doctors finally determined that the cause was a mutated form of staphylococcal bacteria. Mr. Kremer recovered after a course of the most powerful antibiotic, and then he traced the history of the boar that he had bought from a farmer in Kansas.
 ''The original farmer had fed penicillin daily to his hogs to keep in check a staph problem that he had,'' said Mr. Kremer, who studied genetics at the University of Missouri and had, until then, been hog farming in a conventional, intense-production style. The experience awoke him to the fact of resistance to antibiotics in livestock and the significant health risk it posed to humans. ''I went cold turkey,'' he said. 
 Mr. Kremer eliminated his herd and started over. Today, he raises about 1,200 hogs a year -- focusing on heritage breeds like Tamworth and Berkshire -- and uses no antibiotics or growth hormones. ''I save $12,000 a year on drug and vet bills,'' he said. 
 Missouri is one of the largest hog-producing states in the country, partly because of the more than 400 confines with tens of thousands of hogs. They're known as confined animal feeding operations, or CAFO's. Obviously, independent family farmers can't compete with the production numbers of the industrial farms, never mind endure market fluctuations.
 When pork prices fell to 7 cents a pound in 1998, Mr. Kremer traded a 250-pound pig for a case of Miller Lite one night. ''That's what it was worth,'' he said. So, family farmers have had to differentiate their products and sometimes band together to create their own opportunities in the marketplace.
 In the spring of 1999, Mr. Kremer and a group of like-minded independent farmers formed the Missouri Farmers Union ''to protect and enhance the economic interest and way of life of family farmers and ranchers and the rural communities they represent,'' according to the mission statement. Under the organization's guidance, 34 farmers formed the Ozark Mountain Pork Cooperative in 2001; they raised $790,000 and bought a small production plant in Mountain View. Operations began in 2002, with its products sold under the Heritage Acres label.
 All the members, including Mr. Kremer, adhere to strict protocols: animals must be fed a nutritious diet, free of additives; they must have access to the outdoors; and they must have shelter. Before slaughter, the pigs are handled without stress to the point of electrical execution, which is strictly monitored. ''The hog feels no pain,'' said Mr. Kremer, who makes a weekly visit to the plant. ''And then he's dead.'' 
 In 2004, Heritage Acres Pork was certified by the Humane Farm Animal Care Association (funded partly by the Humane Society) to use the ''Certified Humane Raised and Handled'' label on its products. This is the kind of value-added distinction that seems to make a difference to an increasing number of consumers who are interested in the food system, the whole process from farm to fork.
 The co-op started to sell its products to regional supermarkets and local restaurants. At Riddles Penultimate Cafe in St. Louis, the menu describes the source of its $18.50 pork loin (from the Ozark Mountain Pork Cooperative) as ''the happy pigs.'' Today, the co-op sells to Whole Foods Market; the restaurant chain Chipotle; the food supplier Sysco; and some of the best chefs in the country.
 ''We did a blind tasting and we preferred the Ozark,'' said Adam Longworth, the sous chef at Gotham Bar and Grill in New York City. ''It's a superior pork chop. We put it on the menu right away.'' 
 Such reviews are true validation for Mr. Kremer, proof that his efforts are paying off.
 His day starts at 4:30 a.m., when he checks on his piglets and perhaps prepares some food. He keeps accurate records of the feed that he mixes and grinds himself, does some office work on his laptop and checks his BlackBerry. Then he sets off for the Missouri Farmers Union offices in Jefferson City, about 30 minutes from his farm.
 There, he and his tiny staff work on five or six major projects at any given time, including the credit union and building marketing relationships for the pork co-op, as well as Mr. Kremer's activities as the only livestock farmer on Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns's Advisory Committee on Biotechnology and 21st-Century Agriculture. 
 The Ozark Mountain Pork Cooperative is finally beginning to see profits. In the last two years, the farmers have been getting $40 to $50 a hog. 
 Mr. Kremer, 48 and the president of the Missouri Farmers Union, has been farming since he was 6. He grew up in Frankenstein, Mo. -- population 30 -- on his family's 220-acre farm. He was responsible for raising the runt and orphaned piglets. When he was 8, he earned enough to buy his own sow.
 ''You learn at a young age that the more you put into something, the more you get back from it,'' he said. ''If you provide T.L.C. to the sow, she'll reward you with more production.'' His sow produced 15 piglets. ''That's a huge litter,'' he said. ''There were only 13 places to drink, so I did have to do some shifting.''
 As a young person, ''I had them all named,'' Mr. Kremer said. ''They have personalities like kids, you might say. Pigs are curious and intriguing. They're very clean, very smart and very protective of their litters. It's a complex animal.''
 Of course, it was difficult for him to reconcile himself to the slaughter, but as he reasons: ''Food is a part of life. I know it seems like an oxymoron, but that's why humane handling, care and transport all the way to slaughter have always been important to me.'' 
 Mr. Kremer admits that he still names some of his hogs. There is Petunia, Emma, Honeysuckle and ''some more common pork names like Porky and Babe,'' he said. He's happiest on his farm, with its two-bedroom house perched on a hillside. ''It's very quiet, and there's only one way to get there and one way to get out. And I like it like that.'' 
 A champion of rural life and a proud pig farmer, Mr. Kremer pointed to a recent study that ranked Missouri one of the best places in the country to raise children and to raise pigs. ''I haven't had time for kids,'' he said. ''But I do have my pigs.''

HEADLINE: Technology's Future: A Look at the Dark Side

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
AS far as anyone knows, the plight of civilization is nowhere near as dire as in the opening pages of Douglas Adams's ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,'' where alien spaceships are poised to destroy Earth to make way for an interstellar highway.
 Still, with resource consumption and environmental destruction rising at unsustainable rates, plenty of people view the future with alarm. That spotlights technologies like nuclear power, genetic engineering and nanotechnology, which are often cited as crucial to heading off economic and environmental disaster.
The catch is that any technology powerful enough to improve life radically is also capable of abuse and prone to serious, unanticipated side effects. It's a great time to be a Hollywood screenwriter, but rough on policy makers and business strategists. Mix new technologies with the wide variations in how organizations and individuals behave, and you often have ''a recipe for explosion,'' said Edward Tenner, author of ''Why Things Bite Back: Technology and the Revenge of Unintended Consequences.'' 
 The table setter for fears about potentially useful technology was nuclear power, which emerged as an energy source while images of the waste laid to Hiroshima and Nagasaki by atomic bombs in 1945 were still fresh. 
 ''It's not the probability of a nuclear accident that matters in people's attitudes,'' said Charles B. Perrow, a risk analysis expert whose newest book, ''Disaster Evermore? U.S. Vulnerability to Natural, Industrial and Terrorist Disasters,'' will be published this summer. ''It's the possibility, which is very much there.'' 
 Despite several close calls, the deadly explosion at Chernobyl in 1986 is the utility industry's sole catastrophic failure. But the costs imposed on power companies to manage risks had already halted expansion of the nuclear power industry in the United States and elsewhere in the 70's.
 Now, even though the risks of accidents are presumed to be growing as the first generation of plants age, orders are picking up for new plants in Asia. And some American utilities like Exelon, Entergy and Dominion are saying they want to build nuclear plants in the United States alongside existing ones. Those plants currently supply just over 20 percent of the nation's electricity with operating costs far below fossil fuel plants.
 Advocates for renewed investment in nuclear power say that new plant designs could reduce or eliminate many of the meltdown and contamination risks associated with current plants. Critics say the industry is still too riddled with bad management and lax regulation to allow new plants to be built.
 ''The driver of a car has a much bigger impact on safety than whether it's a Volvo or a Yugo,'' said David Lochbaum, director of the nuclear safety project for the Union of Concerned Scientists.
 But some nuclear critics are reconsidering their positions based on the conclusion that of all the proven power-generating technologies, only nuclear power is ready to deliver large amounts of electricity without creating greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.
 ''I see climate change as being so disastrous that increased nuclear energy may be the way to go,'' Mr. Perrow said. 
 The new designs still do not address concerns about the accumulation of nuclear waste that will be radioactive for centuries unless a new way of dealing with it is devised. And nuclear plants -- and the technology to support them -- strike some critics as inviting targets for terrorists. Still, many energy experts see nuclear power as the best bridge to an energy future based on renewable sources like solar power. 
 The ambivalence in green policy debates about nuclear energy also runs through talk about biotechnology, especially when it comes to genetic engineering. Arguments that humankind is foolishly ''playing God'' have been common ever since research breakthroughs in the late 1970's laid the groundwork for innovations like transferring to crops the genes that tell bacteria how to make insect-killing proteins. 
 Pioneering biotechnology researchers sought to prevent accidents and minimize regulation by voluntarily adopting good practice codes for experiments that produced genetically engineered animals and plants. But if confidence has grown as the years pass without any biological Chernobyls, doubts have persisted about the long-term health effects from engineered plants and animals. 
 Some critics also say the technology makes farmers too beholden to giant agribusinesses. 
 More recently, security experts have begun to fret that terrorists could engineer and release novel viruses, bacteria or fungi. 
 Still, the potential environmental benefits of greater use of genetic engineering have excited researchers from the technology's earliest days. The Supreme Court's 1980 decision in Diamond v. Chakrabarty, which upheld the right of businesses to patent engineered organisms, involved a bacterium that General Electric hoped would become a green ''product'' to clean up oil spills. 
 In the end, G.E.'s oil-consuming microbe proved ineffective when transferred from a flask to slicks on the seas. But bioremediation -- using naturally occurring microbes to clean up a wide variety of air, water and soil pollutants -- is growing. 
 Backers of the technology argue that accelerated use of genetic engineering offers the only hope of feeding, clothing and housing the growing global population. Skeptics say the financial incentives driving agribusiness leaders like Monsanto, DuPont, Bayer and Cargill -- and the political incentives for governments to keep food costs low -- continually push all types of biotechnology toward an industrial model of agriculture that is too energy intensive, wasteful of water and dependent on chemicals. 
 The scientific questions underlying debates about biotechnology's risks can be bewildering for nonscientists, but nanotechnology may be even harder to comprehend. The term is derived from the nanometer, or a billionth of a meter.
 Nanotechnology is often described as dealing in dimensions tens of thousands of times smaller than the width of a single hair. But what really matters is that by operating at the nanoscale, researchers can create new materials and extract novel behaviors from familiar ones because they are working with small numbers of molecules, the building blocks of all biology and chemistry. 
 After watching how alarmed activists stopped the nuclear industry in its tracks and slowed the introduction of biotechnology, many nanotechnology advocates propose engaging the public and investing heavily in toxicology research. 
 It is already documented in animal research that some man-made nanoparticles can move easily into the brain and deep into the lungs. ''But we don't know how to find these things in the body or how to measure them in the air,'' said John M. Balbus, a nanotechnology expert at Environmental Defense, an advocacy group that has argued that investment in safety research should be more than doubled and restrictions be imposed on the use of some nanoproducts. ''There's a lot of basic gaps in information.'' 
 Surveys show that most people pay little attention to nanotechnology, which is used in products that make sunscreens invisible, skis lighter and pants stain resistant. Advocates and critics alike thought that might change when Kleinmann, a German subsidiary of Illinois Tool Works, recalled a bathroom cleanser, Magic Nano, on March 28 after nearly 100 customers had trouble breathing. 
 But the brouhaha surrounding the first health-related recall of a ''nanotechnology product'' subsided rapidly, partly because the later investigation raised doubts whether there were indeed any nanoscale ingredients in the product. If the biotechnology experience is a guide, getting governments more involved in nanotechnology risk management and educating consumers may generate profits in the long term.
 ''Companies need to embrace government oversight that makes consumers comfortable, and they need to offer people choices,'' said Rebecca J. Goldburg, a senior scientist at Environmental Defense. ''Once people are empowered to make choices, they will often take what appears to be riskier options.''

HEADLINE: A Developer Thinks Putnam County Is Sorely in Need of More Stores 

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP

 BODY:
Paul A. Camarda, a developer, wants to bring more stores to Putnam County.
 Putnam, which is still largely bucolic, has a population of only about 100,000, but Mr. Camarda is convinced that many county residents would love to be able to shop in a warehouse-type store like Costco, a consumer electronics store, a department store, a sporting goods store, a large bookseller like Barnes & Noble, a Gap or a men's store.
 ''You can't buy a man's suit in Putnam now, as well as most of your electronics, like a computer or a television,'' he said last week. ''The paradox of this county is that we have the highest median income of any county in the state as well as one of the highest rates of home ownership, but there is no opportunity to shop.''
 As a longtime developer who used to focus mostly on single-family homes, Mr. Camarda, who lives in Ridgefield, Conn., says he is always looking for building voids that need to be filled. 
 But in Putnam, immediately north of Westchester County, many residents have fought to preserve the county's vast expanses of green, while developers have also been stymied by the county's being within the 380-square-mile Croton watershed, where strict environmental limits are imposed on development. 
 In the last five years, Mr. Camarda has proposed four projects that might entail sizable retail development, and while he is now actively pursuing only two of them, he is determined to bring the county more nationally known stores. 
 Putnam is studded with small businesses, often family-owned, but many residents continue to shop outside the county, at places like the Danbury Fair Mall in Connecticut and the Jefferson Valley Mall in northern Westchester.
 Most of the nationally known retailers that have stores in the county are found at the Brewster Highlands shopping center in the town of Southeast, a 377,000-square-foot property that has a Home Depot, Kohl's, Linens 'n Things and Marshalls. 
 The county executive, Robert J. Bondi, and some other elected officials want to encourage more retail development as a way for Putnam to counter its high property taxes, as well as to retain some of the money that is now leaving the county. Mr. Bondi says this outflow amounts to two-thirds of the disposable income generated by the county's residents.
 In late February, he introduced a program aimed at encouraging ''smart'' commercial retail development. It would give local municipalities a portion of any future sales tax revenue generated by new stores within their borders for use on projects like libraries, town halls or playing fields. 
 Still, some towns in Putnam seem determined to oppose development. Last week, the board for the town of Putnam Valley, citing significant growth and development pressures, proposed a yearlong moratorium for residential and commercial construction so that the town could update both its master plan and its zoning regulations. A public hearing on the moratorium is scheduled for tonight.
 Kevin Bailey, the president of the Putnam County Economic Development Corporation, said his office was reviewing the moratorium and might ask the town board to reconsider a freeze on commercial (but not necessarily residential) development.
 ''Any development is going to have thoughtful opposition to it, but we have to determine where residents' rights end and developers' rights begin,'' he said. ''Our school taxes are so high that if we don't get good clean commercial development, I think that half of the people who are living here now will move out within the next five years.'' 
 Mr. Camarda said the retail projects that he would like to build would be either on major highways or on the perimeter of the county. In addition, he said, the projects were designed so that only a third of the land would be used for buildings and parking lots, while another third would be landscaped and the rest left untouched. 
 Mr. Camarda's two retail developments that are active are the 406,000-square-foot Patterson Crossing, proposed for the intersection of Interstate 84 and Route 311, and the 183,000-square-foot Stateline Retail Center, which he hopes to build in Southeast.
 So far, citizens' groups like the Stop Patterson Crossing Committee have weighed in against both projects. As for the town of Southeast, its board recently proposed a zoning amendment that, if passed, would limit retail development within many parts of the nearly 35-square-mile town to stores that are less than 25,000 square feet. 
 Mr. Camarda clearly feels stung by the proposal. ''Most anchor stores are between 120,000 and 140,000 square feet in size, so this kind of limit is an effort to make the center an impossibility to build,'' he said last week. ''In the end, it would be just another strip center filled with pizzerias, delicatessens and nail salons.'' 
 On Monday, Mr. Camarda said that the master plan for the town of Southeast did not currently have restrictions against big-box stores and that he might take legal action if he decided he had been treated unfairly.
 Mr. Bailey said the town of Southeast was considering restricting the size of new retail projects because it already had much of the commercial development within the county. 
 Lately, some towns in Putnam, like Carmel, have weighed in with strong support for Mr. Camarda's efforts. Carmel, which is where Mr. Camarda's development company is based, approved a zoning amendment in late December that would allow the first large hotel in Putnam to be built on an 85-acre parcel of land that used to be zoned for light industrial use. Mr. Camarda hopes to use it for a large mixed-use development.
 The project, to be called Gateway Summit, would have a 150-room extended-stay Staybridge Suites hotel with about 12,000 square feet of conference and banquet space, as well as two restaurant chains, a convenience store and about 16,000 square feet of office space. 
 Some local residents have criticized Mr. Camarda for not bringing a luxury hotel to Putnam County, but Robert Radomski, vice president for brand management at Staybridge Suites, said his company expected the hotel to attract strong interest from the many companies that have offices nearby, like Duracell, Pepsi and I.B.M. 
 Some local residents, meanwhile, see another potential benefit: no longer will they have to travel to hotels in Fishkill, N.Y., or Danbury to hold large catered events like conferences and weddings. 
 ''I've been working for the longest time to get a hotel to come to the county, and about five years ago we had hoped to be able to get a Marriott,'' said Robert J. Ravallo, a councilman from Carmel. ''This hotel is not going to turn away users, especially on the weekends, and if it's successful, then it's going to bring in even more good retail projects.''

HEADLINE: Wholesale Prices and Housing Data Cool Inflation Worry

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Two economic reports indicated yesterday that wholesale prices remained tame and the housing market continued to cool, easing the inflation worries that rattled Wall Street late last week.
 The Labor Department said that the Producer Price Index rose 0.9 percent in April but that the core index, which excludes food and energy, edged up 0.1 percent, the same rate as in March and less than the 0.2 percent expected by economists.
And the Commerce Department said yesterday that the number of new homes started last month fell 7.4 percent, to an annual pace of 1.85 million. It was the third consecutive monthly drop in housing starts. 
 Taken together, analysts said, the reports show that growth is easing and that higher gasoline prices do not appear to be increasing the cost of other goods and services. Investors hope the data will sway the Federal Reserve to leave its benchmark short-term interest rate, now at 5 percent, unchanged at its next policy-making meeting on June 28-29. At its meeting last week, the Fed said it would leave its options open.
 Separately, a Fed report showed that the nation's mines, factories and power plants increased production at a robust pace in April, signaling that manufacturing may take up some of the economic slack created by a weaker housing market.
 Bonds rose yesterday and stocks closed down slightly. At the end of last week, the financial markets posted two days of significant declines as investors worried that higher inflation would prompt the Fed to raise short-term interest rates again.
 Today, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its April estimate of an even more important barometer of inflation, the Consumer Price Index. 
 ''The telling variable between now and the end of June will be the core inflation numbers we get for April,'' said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital.
 Unlike consumer prices, wholesale prices do not include taxes and distribution costs. Energy prices rose 4 percent in April as gasoline reached $3 a gallon in many parts of the country. Food prices rose 0.1 percent. Compared with a year earlier, wholesale prices were up 4 percent; excluding food and energy, they were up 1.5 percent.
 Prices earlier in the production process rose even more. Raw materials increased 1.2 percent in April from March, after decreases of 2.7 percent in March and 9.2 percent in February. The price of intermediate goods rose 0.9 percent after small declines in the previous two months.
 The increases do not seem to be slowing manufacturers. Industrial production increased 0.8 percent in April after a 0.6 percent rise in March and a 0.4 percent increase in January, the Fed reported. Capacity utilization, a measure of how fully factories, mines and power plants are running, rose to 81.9 percent, from 81.4 percent. Production has increased for three consecutive months and is up 4.7 percent from April 2005.
 The cost increases ''are a challenge economically and they are a challenge to pass on'' to customers, said Cliff Waldman, an economist at Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a policy research group in Arlington, Va. But businesses ''have managed to always find ways to use raw materials more productively.''
 Mr. Waldman noted that strong global demand, particularly for capital goods like airplanes, was bolstering production. And the recent drop in the value of the dollar against other currencies should help keep factories humming through the rest of the year by making American goods cheaper overseas.
 In housing, the number of permits issued for new homes, an indication of future construction activity, fell 5.4 percent, to an annual pace of 1.98 million, in April after smaller declines in the two months before.
 It appears that a 13.1 percent jump in the number of homes started in January may have been a blip caused by unusually warm weather, as many analysts suspected. The number of housing units being built fell 1.6 percent, to 1.39 million.

HEADLINE: Vision

BYLINE: By CHESTER HIGGINS JR.

 BODY:
Laurie Cumbo conceived of the Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan Arts nearly a decade ago, envisioning a place where artists of African descent could exhibit their work. 
 Today, her mission is more complex: ''To reach people who traditionally don't go to museums by providing exhibitions and programs that they are part of and to give them voice.''
Ms. Cumbo, the museum's executive director, is all about change. One focus is the way art is defined -- ''what's good art; what's bad art; what's popular and what's not popular; what's academic; and what's worthy of being in a museum.'' She wants ''to create social, political and economic equality through the visual arts.''
 The museum opens this month, expanded, in a new location. What began on the fourth floor of a church building in Bedford-Stuyvesant has grown to inhabit half a floor at 80 Hanson Place in Fort Greene, in the neighborhood's cultural district.
 Ms. Cumbo sees an even larger space in the future -- ''an institution that would give me the opportunity to have several different exhibition galleries, to have space to start a permanent collection, have classrooms for young people, a research library of the African diaspora, a sculpture garden, cafe, gift shop, and a theater for performance, lectures and public programs,'' ideallyback in Bedford-Stuyvesant.

HEADLINE: Challenge to Weld in Governor's Race Stirs a Battle for the Republican Soul

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 16 

 BODY:
As the leaders of the state Republican Party searched for their candidate for governor last summer, they found a man who appeared to be the perfect choice.
 The former governor of Massachusetts, William F. Weld, would be gregarious and telegenic enough to capture the attention of New Yorkers. His stance on abortion and gay rights leaned enough to the left to rally support from suburban voters. And he had already proved that he could pull off a victory in a state where Democrats vastly outnumber Republicans, a key selling point in the battle against the likely Democratic nominee, Eliot Spitzer, the state attorney general.
But as Republican leaders prepare to meet at their state convention in two weeks, Mr. Weld's chance to replicate his Massachusetts victory in New York is being steadily tested by a man who refuses to obey the wishes of the state party leadership, former Assemblyman John Faso.
 Mr. Faso has been steadily lining up the support of key county leaders, is showing surprising strength in statewide opinion polls, and is almost certain to capture the endorsement of the state Conservative Party, without whose backing no Republican has been elected governor since 1974. 
 While it is still early in the campaign season, Mr. Faso's ascent has made some Republicans nervous. Two of the state's most important Republicans, Gov. George E. Pataki and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, have yet to make endorsements in the race, even though they have long ties to Mr. Weld.
 Mr. Faso, a conservative Republican from the Hudson Valley, ran for state comptroller four years ago and narrowly lost to Alan G. Hevesi. This time, his candidacy has galvanized Republicans disgusted with a party leadership they believe has not only steered too far to the center, but also tried to anoint Mr. Weld as the nominee despite his positions on abortion and gay rights.
 ''We have a whole history of people saying what they think we want to hear, and then we get them elected and they are something different'' said Robert Smith, the Republican chairman in Onondaga County, which includes Syracuse. ''We're in a state where we don't even have our identity anymore. Even if we lose the election, I am going to feel better running a candidate who represents our core.''
 Developments in the last few weeks show the extent of Mr. Weld's troubles. Joseph L. Bruno, the State Senate majority leader and one of the top Republican officials in the state, said last week that Mr. Faso should be given a chance to be on the September primary ballot. And on Thursday, the Westchester County Republican Party threw its weight behind Mr. Faso, the strongest evidence yet that he has attracted support from the moderate suburban voters Mr. Weld was counting on.
 On Monday, Mr. Faso will hold one of his largest fund-raisers, with the support of nine Republican state senators, including several from New York City and Long Island. And some Republican officials say that Nassau and Suffolk Counties may back Mr. Faso at the convention, which would be a major coup.
 ''Every day I wake up and I am the underdog, that motivates me,'' Mr. Faso said in a recent interview at his campaign headquarters in Albany. ''I know the state and its issues, and I am able to engage people on that.''
 Some of Mr. Faso's supporters have portrayed Mr. Weld as a carpetbagger, but Mr. Weld's backers say that labeling him an outsider could only help him in the general election, where much of the debate could focus on reform in Albany. 
 ''John Faso has proved that he is very good at the inside game, but Bill Weld has a proven record of getting things done,'' said Andrea Tantaros, a spokeswoman for Mr. Weld. ''But when you look at the big picture, who is more likely to change the way Albany does business?''
 Several top Republicans privately concede that the eventual Republican nominee, no matter who he is, will have an uphill battle against Mr. Spitzer, who is expected to secure the Democratic nomination at the party's convention this month. 
 The battle has become something of a fight for the soul of the party. Republicans backing Mr. Weld worry that Mr. Faso's position against abortion will alienate some voters and hurt the party over all in November should he emerge as their candidate. They point out that the most successful Republicans in the state -- Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg -- all support abortion rights.
 But some influential upstate leaders say that focusing on the suburban swing vote has proved to be a failure for the Republicans and praise Mr. Faso for his clear stances against abortion rights and gay marriage. 
 Mr. Faso says he is against abortion except in cases of rape, incest or when the life of a mother is endangered. The day after he announced his candidacy, Mr. Faso said he would limit abortions for Medicaid recipients to those instances. 
 On Monday, the Republican Majority for Choice Political Action Committee called Mr. Faso ''out of step with the typical New York voter'' and said that his candidacy would put at risk the slim Republican majority in the State Senate. 
 ''There are many ways we could go, but no matter what we do, we have to put our best face forward,'' said Michael A. L. Balboni, a state senator from Nassau County who said he might support Mr. Weld. ''There are some out there who are advocating the scorched-earth philosophy. I'm still an idealist who is pushing for consensus.'' 
 While Mr. Weld has said he has no objection to a primary challenge, Stephen J. Minarik III, the chairman of the state Republican Party and a Weld supporter, has said it could drain the party's resources, hurting the party in November.
 ''The party has to think about three things: capability, electability and certainly fund-raising ability,'' said Ryan Moses, the executive director of the state party. ''There are millions and millions of people below the Tappan Zee Bridge where the Democratic registration is tremendous and you need crossover appeal.''
 Although Mr. Faso may be bucking the party leadership this year, he has been a faithful soldier in the past, and in some ways is now paying the consequences. In 1994, Mr. Faso was the likely Republican nominee for comptroller, but stepped aside for Herbert London, an economics professor who was threatening to challenge Mr. Pataki for governor. But Mr. Faso says this campaign has nothing to do with a grudge. 
 ''I have expressed no disappointments in politics,'' he said. ''I've kept up the same good relationships I've had for decades, and now I am reaping the benefits.''
 Apart from his political stances, Mr. Faso has won favor among local county leaders simply by getting into their backyards. During the first six days of May, Mr. Faso's agenda included an annual dinner for Fulton County Republicans, a cocktail reception for the Westchester County Conservatives and a Women's Republican Club meeting in Genesee County. His campaign seems proud to say that no event is too small to warrant Mr. Faso's attention. 
 On Monday night, for instance, Mr. Faso sat patiently at the Westchester County Republican convention for more than an hour and a half before making a speech that lasted just more than a minute. 
 ''We're really going to surprise people,'' he said in White Plains. ''New York is at a crossroads and we can make a choice.''

HEADLINE: City to Drop Lawsuit Against Transit Strikers

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
The city has agreed to drop a lawsuit seeking huge financial penalties against individual members of the city's main transit union, while the union has accepted terms for payment of $2.5 million in fines assessed against it for its 60-hour strike in December. 
 The deal did not appear to bring Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union or the Metropolitan Transportation Authority any closer to the bargaining table, or to a settlement of their stalled contract. But it tied up legal loose ends for a union that is already under financial duress, and had been threatened with more fines.
Michael A. Cardozo, the city's corporation counsel, appeared in court on Dec. 13, before the transit strike, and said the city would seek $25,000 in fines from each Local 100 member on the first day they walked off the job, and that the amount would double on each day of a strike.
 Citing the economic disruption that a subway shutdown would cause the city, he said it would seek $1 million more a day from the union itself.
 In a the deal disclosed yesterday, and signed by Justice Theodore T. Jones of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, the city is to receive the $2.5 million already assessed against the union for violating the state's Taylor law, which prohibits strikes by public employees. The payments will be made in 12 monthly installments starting June 1.
 ''No further purpose would be served by the city pursuing its own lawsuit,'' said Georgia Pestana, chief of the labor law division of the city's Law Department. She said the $2.5 million penalty would ''warn the T.W.U. and other unions that contemplate violating the law that the law must be obeyed, and that public employees and their unions have no right to betray the public's trust.''
 ''The city is pleased that the T.W.U. has agreed to promptly begin paying the $2.5 million penalty,'' Ms. Pestana said.
 The deal also provides the union with some breathing space in a separate penalty imposed by Justice Jones, who ordered that the automatic payroll checkoff of Local 100's union dues be discontinued by the authority. Local 100 had said that the elimination of dues deductions from members' paychecks was the harshest penalty confronting the union, since it would severely limit its ability to collect money and pay its bills.
 Under the agreement, dues checkoffs will remain in place until the final installment of the $2.5 million fine is paid. Then, after three months, the union can apply to the court to have the checkoff reinstated.
 Roger Toussaint, the president of Local 100, said yesterday that the agreement, by allowing dues checkoffs for another year, would provide an opportunity to ''permanently replace dues checkoff with direct payments to the union.''
 ''We will use this as a challenge to reinvent Local 100 into a union driven by one-on-one contact with its members,'' he said.
 He also maintained that the Taylor Law was unfair, and that legislation was needed to protect workers from ''out-of-control bureaucracies like the M.T.A.''

HEADLINE: The Lights Are Still Out at the Victoria

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The sign behind the popcorn stand at the Victoria Theater, a once-thriving vaudeville house and movie palace on 125th Street, spells out the last featured performance before the theater closed its doors in 1997: ''Godspell.''
 A state board has chosen two finalists for the long-awaited redevelopment of what was Harlem's largest and most elegant theater, only a few doors east of its smaller and better-known sister, the Apollo Theater. The proposals would preserve the Victoria's Ionic columns and terra-cotta rosettes while transforming the property into a hotel, condominium and entertainment complex along Harlem's resurgent central shopping and cultural thoroughfare.
But the project is more than a year behind schedule. Like the lobby, it is frozen in time, as members of the state board, the Harlem Community Development Corporation, battle with the Pataki administration over the fate of the 89-year-old theater.
 The board's chairman, Assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright, who like many of its members is a Democrat, says that the state is improperly trying to force a real estate company with close ties to the Republican governor back into consideration. The board pared the company, Apollo Real Estate Advisers, from a list of bidders in January. 
 Little has happened since, although Mr. Wright said a showdown might be in the offing. State officials, he said, are scouring Harlem for Republicans to fill a half-dozen long-vacant seats on the board of the development corporation. 
 ''We're fighting for the soul of one of Harlem's grandest edifices,'' Mr. Wright said last week during a flashlight tour of the Victoria, where the electricity works only in the lobby. ''The state is being very heavy-handed. They're trying to stuff Apollo Realty down our throats. The board wanted minority participation, job creation and a cultural component.'' 
 Nonsense, countered Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation. He said he was merely asking the Harlem corporation, a subsidiary of Empire State, to account for its decision to turn down what he said was the best financial offer for the property, $27 million, or $5.25 million more than any other bidder.
 That bid came from Apollo and its partner, Starwood Hotels and Resorts. Apollo, a large national real estate investment concern, was co-founded by William L. Mack, whose family has been a generous contributor to the Republican Party and Gov. George E. Pataki. The governor put Mr. Mack's brother, David, on the board of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey; another brother, Earle, is ambassador to Finland and a friend and unofficial adviser to Mr. Pataki.
 ''It had nothing to do with Mack,'' Mr. Gargano said. ''It's a question of accountability. That was our concern.''
 Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for Apollo, sharply denied any implication that the state's intervention was due to political influence. He said William Mack had not contributed to Governor Pataki's political campaigns in many years. ''On the merits,'' Mr. Rubenstein said, ''Apollo deserves to win.''
 The Victoria, built in 1917, was designed by the theater architect Thomas W. Lamb for vaudeville, and it later became a first-run movie theater. The state took it over in 1977. It was carved into five small theaters, which offered movies, plays, lectures and musical performances before the complex closed in 1997.
 In October 2004, the Harlem development board members solicited bids from developers, and much to their surprise, received nine offers. The long-planned revival of 125th Street was finally getting under way, with businesses like Old Navy, Seaman's, Magic Johnson Theaters, Modell's and H & M moving there.
 In its request for proposals, the board said it wanted a project at the Victoria that would preserve the theater's architecture, create jobs for local residents, complement nearby development, include a cultural component and give the state an economic return. 
 After months of delays, the executive committee of the development corporation voted in January to narrow the list of finalists to two from four: Steven C. Williams of Danforth Development Partners and Robert Jones and Paul Williams of Victoria Tower Development. Apollo and another developer, Integrated Holdings, failed to make the cut.
 The Pataki administration representatives voted in favor of either Apollo and Danforth, or Apollo and Victoria Tower, according to the minutes of the committee meeting. After the January vote, the administration said the entire board had to vote on the matter and comply with a recently enacted state law requiring it to explain why it had not picked the highest bid for the property.
 When the full board voted in April, it ratified the selection of Danforth and Victoria Tower as the finalists, to the chagrin of the state officials on the board and in part because of information in an analysis from Mr. Gargano's staff. Memos from his agency in March and April ranked the value of the Apollo bid behind offers from the two finalists.
 Mr. Gargano said those earlier memos were based on inaccurate information. After the January vote, he said, his agency obtained additional data from the bidders for a side-by-side comparison, which shows Apollo's $27 million offer far ahead of Danforth's $21.75 million and Victoria Tower's $19.6 million.
 Mr. Gargano is pressing for yet another vote and has notified the board that the state will be appointing at least one new member, Keith Wofford, a Republican lawyer from Harlem. Five of the board's 25 seats still remain open.
 Until the dispute is resolved, the leading bidders remain in limbo. Mr. Williams of Danforth said he was puzzled as to how the state valued the bids. He said the original bid documents ''never implied this was an auction for the land.'' 
 He added, ''They talked about creating a catalyst for development, for housing, and providing access for community arts programs and employment opportunities.''
 The Danforth proposal called for creating a new Savoy Ballroom with banquet space for 300 people, as well as a 90-room hotel designed by Ian Schrager and two theaters for performing arts companies.
 The other selected bidders, Mr. Jones and Mr. Williams of Victoria Tower, sent an angry letter on April 3 to the Harlem development corporation questioning whether the selection process was ''being undermined, if not thwarted, by forces outside of the board solely for the benefit of a third proposer who has close ties to high government officials.''
 The Victoria Tower proposal included a 304-room hotel, condos, a B. B. King Entertainment Center and two music clubs reflecting black and Latino culture. Apollo and Starwood proposed creating a $103 million W hotel with 58 condos and office space for the Apollo Theater Foundation, as well as a small performing arts theater and a cafe.
 State Senator David A. Paterson, Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr. and Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, all Democratic members of the Harlem board who favored Danforth and Victoria, said the state was trying to change rules at the end of the game. 
 ''This raises so many red flags,'' Mr. Paterson said. ''It will ignite so much acrimony in the community if this continues. If they already knew who they wanted to give the contract to, why did they go to bid?'' 
 Assemblyman Wright said the board ultimately rejected the Apollo proposal because it did not appear that the jobs would go to Harlem residents or that the theater's architectural integrity would be preserved.
 This proved to be an important issue even for a state appointee who ultimately voted in favor of the Apollo proposal. According to the January minutes, Deborah Boatright, who represents the state's housing commissioner, said that the company was ''willfully weak'' in areas of importance to the community. If Apollo did not improve its proposal during contract negotiations, she said, ''they should not get this deal.''

HEADLINE: For the Neediest of the Needy, Welfare Reforms Still Fall Short, Study Says

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
Several years into Wisconsin's stringent welfare-to-work program, which helped reduce welfare rolls in the state by 80 percent, the remaining welfare recipients fared poorly, seldom finding steady jobs or stable lives, according to a new study that spotlights the severe personal problems afflicting the poorest families. 
 Wisconsin was a pioneer in welfare reforms adopted by Congress in 1996, imposing work requirements and limits on cash assistance while providing child care, tax credits and other supports for working mothers. 
The overhaul, in Wisconsin and other states, helped place more single parents in jobs. But the new study points to another national legacy: the often critical needs of those still seeking aid, who may encounter profound barriers to work that include disabilities or problems with mental health or substance abuse. 
 ''The mix of people the welfare office serves has changed radically,'' Mark E. Courtney, chief author of the study, said in an interview. ''The population that remains is, on average, a much needier population, and they were not helped.''
 Perhaps the most alarming finding was that because of neglect or abuse, a child was removed from the home of one in every six parents during the five years after they applied for welfare.
 Dr. Courtney, director of the Chapin Hall Center for Children at the University of Chicago, said that in addition to helping applicants with job skills, welfare agencies must more aggressively address personal and family problems.
 Wisconsin had already recognized this challenge when the study was under way and has taken steps to coordinate child welfare and other services with the jobs program, said Jennifer L. Noyes, who ran the state's revamped welfare agency in 2000 and 2001 and is now a researcher at the University of Wisconsin. 
 ''The program hasn't been static,'' Ms. Noyes said. ''It is constantly changing in response to needs.''
 In a written statement, Roberta Gassman, Wisconsin's secretary of workforce development, called the new study important and said it showed the wisdom of ''program improvements that we have made in the last three years,'' including closer screening and broader aid for welfare recipients.
 Dr. Courtney agreed that Wisconsin had improved its social services for recipients but said many other states had not done nearly as much.
 The new report, to be released today by the Chapin Hall Center, followed 1,075 parents, mainly black single mothers, who applied in Milwaukee in 1999 to the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program, the new name for welfare adopted by Congress in 1996. Most of those women cycled into and out of the program in subsequent years, some working intermittently. 
 But four years after they first contacted the welfare agency, only one-third of the parents held jobs in each quarter of 2003. Few, even among the successful workers, received enough income through work and public benefits to lift them above the poverty line. 
 ''Most of these TANF applicants were no better off, and in many cases they were worse off than when they sought assistance,'' Dr. Courtney wrote with his co-author, Amy Dworsky, a researcher at the Chapin Hall Center. 
 Under Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, Wisconsin led the way in welfare reform in the 1990's, pushing many applicants quickly into jobs or community service work and providing supports including supplements to the federal earned-income tax credit and wider access to Medicaid. Wisconsin also passed along fathers' child support payments to mothers, contrary to states' common practice of keeping them to offset welfare costs.
 In 1996, Congress adopted similar goals for the nation, though Wisconsin has remained a showcase because of its strong work requirements for those deemed able. 
 Studies that followed Congress's action found that large numbers of single mothers around the country did enter the work force, though few escaped poverty. One of the most visible changes was a huge drop in the number of welfare recipients, by more than half nationally and by 80 percent in Wisconsin.
 The rolls shrank in part because some mothers entering welfare were more quickly ushered into jobs, but at least half the decline reflected a drop in first-time applicants, said Steven J. Haider, an economist at the University of Michigan. 
 Scholars attribute the decline in applications to several factors, including a wider availability of low-end jobs, new supports like the earned-income tax credit and a deterrent effect of more stringent welfare rules. 
 This year Congress acted to stiffen work requirements more, penalizing states that did not increase the share of welfare recipients going into jobs or into preparation for employment. Some experts say this mandate may be unrealistic, given the traits of the remaining welfare population. 
 Experts said they were startled by the high proportion of welfare applicants in Milwaukee who had come to the attention of child welfare officials: in a five-year period, 40 percent of the parents were investigated for the possibility of abuse or neglect, and a child had been removed from the homes of 16 percent.
 Since most of these parents had already been investigated, the study did not indicate that the welfare program itself, with its required work or training efforts, was causing child abuse. But at the least, Dr. Courtney said, the findings show that many parents seeking welfare are having ''a profound difficulty balancing the demands of work and parenting.''

HEADLINE: A Redevelopment Scuffle in Queens

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
The streets are strewn with garbage and littered with abandoned cars. There are potholes the size of craters but no sidewalks. Deep puddles linger long after a rainstorm, and business owners must make do with cesspools instead of sewers.
 In all, Willets Point seems more like a neighborhood in a developing country than an easily accessible 75-acre enclave in the shadow of Shea Stadium in northern Queens.
In what is shaping up as a contentious development fight, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg hopes to transform Willets Point -- also known as the Iron Triangle because of its concentration of small auto-parts and repair shops -- into a retailing and entertainment district with a hotel and convention center. The redevelopment efforts have assumed added urgency for City Hall now that a new $700 million stadium is planned for the Mets. The new ballpark will be closer to 126th Street, just opposite Willets Point. 
 But there is one big obstacle. Apart from the streets and 13.5 acres owned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the remaining 46 acres of Willets Point are privately owned and home to 250 businesses employing at least 1,200 people, by the city's count. Not all these businesses are expected to go quietly. 
 Undaunted by the nationwide furor over eminent domain resulting from a Supreme Court ruling last July -- which upheld a decision by officials in New London, Conn., to force property sales to foster economic development -- city officials say they are prepared to use their condemnation powers at Willets Point. Citing various environmental violations, including illegal dumping and open petroleum spills, they say the area is a public health hazard.
 ''In some ways, this is the most compelling case for eminent domain,'' said Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor who oversees economic development. ''It has nothing to do with the uses. It has to do with intolerable conditions.''
 Mr. Doctoroff estimates that it would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to clean up Willets Point. No private capital will be invested there if there are holdouts who might bring about further contamination, he said.
 In February, the city invited eight development teams, including some of the most active companies in the city -- like Forest City Ratner (which is the partner of The New York Times Company in its new headquarters building on Eighth Avenue in Manhattan), Vornado Realty Trust and the Related Companies -- to submit proposals for the ''creation of an experience unique to the New York metropolitan region'' at Willets Point.
 Steeped in the language of the New Urbanist movement, the New York Economic Development Corporation's request for proposals seeks ''pedestrian-friendly urban design and superior architecture.'' Maintaining that the borough is ''significantly underserved by retail,'' the agency asked for letters of intent from retailers that are ''unique'' to Queens. Housing may be included but is not mandatory. 
 A hotel and exposition center is envisioned for the northern end of Willets Point. In a 2004 feasibility study, HVS International, a consulting company based in Mineola, N.Y., that specializes in the hotel and convention business, identified Willets Point as the best location in Queens for a 125,000-square-foot conference center with a 250-room hotel because of its proximity to major highways and ''the large amount of contiguous land'' that could be redeveloped.
 Developers' submissions are due in mid-June, with the rezoning process set to begin in January. A development partner will be selected once the plans are approved by the City Council.
 Administration officials say the request for proposals was preceded by a planning process that began in 2002, when Mr. Doctoroff organized a task force of business and community leaders to come up with development goals for downtown Flushing, which lies across the Flushing River from Willets Point. About four miles from La Guardia Airport and easily accessible by highway, subway and train, Willets Point is bordered on the north by Northern Boulevard, on the east by the Van Wyck Expressway, on the west by 126th Street and on the south by Roosevelt Avenue.
 The administration's strategy is being attacked from several directions, even by those who say eminent domain is sometimes necessary for urban redevelopment.
 One such critic is Brad Lander, executive director of the Pratt Institute Center for Community and Environmental Development, who said the city should have led ''a public process, informed by data'' before asking developers to submit detailed proposals.
 ''This seems to me to fly in the face of one of the few things that Kelo says you have to do,'' he said, referring to the majority decision in the Supreme Court eminent domain case, Kelo vs. New London. ''You have to have a planning process to determine if there's a public good to the thing you're doing.''
 Others say the mayor has underestimated the neighborhood's role in the city's economy. Several local business owners say they were offended to hear the mayor refer to Willets Point as a haven for ''chop shops and deserted warehouses'' in a recent radio interview. ''There's no real economic activity there,'' Mr. Bloomberg declared.
 During a recent tour of the neighborhood, Hiram Monserrate, a city councilman who represents Willets Point, said most of the businesses there are operating legally and offer entry-level jobs to immigrants.
 Tom Angotti, a professor of urban affairs and planning at Hunter College who has just completed a study of the area, said these businesses form a cluster that would be hard to duplicate elsewhere.
 ''This is the kind of community economic development experts are trying to create, and it's already here,'' Dr. Angotti said at a recent news conference to unveil his report. ''The question should be: How do you nurture this? How do you make it better? Does it make any sense to get rid of them and bring in somebody new?''
 Janice Serrone, who runs an auto glass company on Willets Point Road that draws customers from as far away as Connecticut, said: ''We're kind of all dependent on each other. People know that over here you can pay $140 for a windshield. In Connecticut, they're going to pay $340.'' 
 While auto-related uses predominate in Willets Point, about 500 people work for the larger, long-established family businesses. These include the Tully Construction Company, which operates a waste transfer station and recycling plant; House of Fodera, a national distributor of flour and other ingredients used in bagels, muffins and croissants; and House of Spices, where food imported from India, like basmati rice, is cleaned, repackaged and sold to restaurants.
 ''My employees have no cars,'' said Neil Soni, a vice president of House of Spices, which has 110 employees. ''If I moved to the Bronx, how will they get there?'' 
 These property owners, who have hired Peter F. Vallone, the former speaker of the City Council, to lobby for them, say that, because of its location, Willets Point would thrive as an industrial area with more distribution centers if the city would just pave the streets and hook up the sewers. They say the neighborhood has been neglected by successive administrations because of its potential as a redevelopment site. 
 ''We don't need a private developer to come in and try to develop our land,'' said Peter K. Tully, the president of Tully. 
 Mr. Doctoroff said that the city had identified 16 other places suitable for the development of distribution centers but that La Guardia had no room to grow. ''This just isn't the right place for it,'' he said. 
 Helen M. Marshall, the borough president of Queens, said the community supported redevelopment. ''I know there are good solid stakeholders'' in Willets Point, she said, but ''we can't afford to have this kind of place in Queens anymore.''

HEADLINE: Unfazed by Risk, Investors Pour Money Into Faraway Markets

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
Simon Nocera runs a hedge fund that invests in emerging markets, and so, perhaps not surprisingly, prides himself on having a keen appetite for risk. But even he had to draw the line when his broker tried to get him into Zambian treasury bills.
 ''It was pure, baseless speculation,'' said Mr. Nocera, who has been investing in developing markets for more than 15 years. ''If I am going to play the casinos, I would rather go to Las Vegas.''
Mr. Nocera did not make the trade, but a number of his even more adventuresome peers did. Propelled by a boom in copper prices, Zambian government bonds, denominated in kwachas and yielding 25 percent for five-year paper, returned more than 40 percent this spring for those with a stomach strong enough for such a risky venture. 
 Four years into what has become the longest bull market in the brief, turbulent history of investing in emerging markets, investors from hedge funds to mutual funds to public and private pension funds have shown a willingness to take on increased levels of risk in developing markets. Benchmark stocks in the largest markets -- like Brazil, Russia, India and China, collectively labeled B.R.I.C. -- have experienced gravity-defying run-ups, prompting return-starved investors to look farther afield. Now in vogue are banks in the former Soviet republic of Georgia, airline companies in Kenya, oil refineries in the central Russian republic of Bashkortostan and start-up stockbrokers in India that go by the name of Indiabulls. 
 How short memories can be. 
 This week, a round of mini-devaluations in Turkey, South Africa and Indonesia was a reminder that emerging markets, despite their improving economies and stabilizing currencies, remain volatile and unpredictable. Seasoned investors note that while the Mexican devaluation of 1994, the Asian currency crisis in 1997 and Russia's default of its debt in 1998 were ultimately spawned by faulty policies in each country, the pandemic nature of these blow-ups was deepened by the panicked selling of unsophisticated investors. 
 Now, in the eyes of some, this combination of record capital inflows and indications that investors have once again have become indiscriminate in their buying, spells trouble. 
 For James Trainor, a portfolio manager at Newgate Capital in Greenwich, Conn., a leading emerging markets hedge fund, the sign that the fever for emerging market stocks was running too high came earlier this month when he overheard the short-order cook at his local diner debating which oil stocks in Venezuela he should be buying. ''He was saying, 'Just wait until oil hits $100 -- then these stocks will double,' '' he recalled. ''My reaction was: now things are really getting top-heavy.'' 
 Mr. Trainor, who manages more than $3 billion in assets and is a survivor of the previous decade's market meltdowns, sees other warning signs as well. ''Brazilian banks are trading at five time earnings. Russian debt has become investment grade. The risks associated with international investing have been pushed aside because of the returns,'' he added, his voice rising to be heard above the din of a traffic jam in Mexico City, where he was calling from.
 Despite the market turmoil this week, there is no indication yet that developing markets are prepared to collapse. Dollar reserves are at historic highs and the broad macroeconomic health of many of these countries is vastly improved, helped by soaring commodities prices and robust exports. 
 Indeed, these economies have undergone startling economic transformations. Not only do China and South Korea hold more than a trillion dollars in reserves between them, but companies like Gazprom in Russia and Samsung in South Korea have emerged as influential global conglomerates that are among the world's largest companies. 
 ''The center of gravity has shifted,'' said Antoine van Agtmael, a long-time investor in developing economies, who coined the term emerging markets. ''These countries have become creditors instead of debtors. Current-account deficits have become surpluses.'' 
 Nevertheless, the pell-mell rush of funds into these markets as well as the push for more exotic, riskier investment fare suggests that memories of past emerging market crises may have dimmed. Last week, funds that invest in emerging markets took in one of their highest weekly sums ever, bringing this year's figure to $33 billion, already outpacing last year's record $20 billion, according to EmergingPortfolio.com.
 For hedge funds, always on the lookout for the next hot investment fad, it has been an opportunity not to be missed -- 153 funds were formed last year to invest in emerging markets, according to Hedge Fund Research. 
 There is much anecdotal evidence to be found that shows how investing in emerging markets has evolved from a niche area for hardened globetrotters and steel-nerved investors. 
 In India, for example, a market that has shot up 141 percent over the last two years, some of the largest shareholders of top Indian companies are American mutual fund companies like Janus, known more for its momentum style of investing than for its emerging markets expertise. 
 Just as technology stocks were good to Janus in the late 1990's, so have Indian stocks been this time around. In the foreign large-growth mutual fund category, according to Morningstar, the top three performing funds over a one-year period are all from Janus. And all three funds have Reliance Industries and Tata Steel, two Indian companies that have gone up 166 percent and 71 percent, respectively, as their top two holdings. 
 Bidding wars have broken out between hedge funds for Indian investing talent; investment banks like J. P. Morgan, with limited experience in India, are now marketing closed-end Indian real estate funds to their high-net-worth clients; and Arshad R. Zakaria and Vikram S. Pandit, both of whom rose to be top executives at Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, respectively, formed funds to invest in India's private and public markets after leaving their old firms. 
 In Russia, where the stock market is up 150 percent over the last two years, investors have been piling into commodity-based stocks. Indeed, the excitement for Gazprom, whose shares are up 266 percent over the past year, has become such that James Cramer has begun to shout out the company's virtues on his ''Mad Money'' program on CNBC, while more sober-minded industry analysts talk of it becoming the world's first trillion-dollar company.
 It is not just foreign money that is pushing up stocks abroad. In Pakistan, where suicide bombings remain a frequent occurrence in Karachi, the country's commercial center, an aggressive economic overhaul has lured billions of dollars from Pakistanis at home and abroad into the stock market. Since 2001, the stock market capitalization has exploded from $10 billion to its current $55 billion, and it has only been in the last six months that foreign investors have started to dip their toes back into the market.
 Perhaps the broadest indicator that shows how comfortable investors have become with emerging market risk is the historically narrow interest rate spread that separates the government bonds of countries like Indonesia, Mexico, Turkey and Pakistan from United States Treasury bonds, long the paragon of risk-free investment. In the past, the gap separating the paper of emerging economies has been wide, reflecting the higher economic and political risk associated with these countries.
 But as these countries have turned their economies around, narrowing budget deficits and accumulating current-account surpluses, their credit ratings have improved. In a curious reversal, many of these countries, in Asia especially, are now the largest buyers of the Treasury securities that the United States government has been selling as its own budget deficit has widened.
 ''For the first time in modern history, poor countries are financing the rich,'' said Marc Faber, a global investment analyst noted for his gloomy prognostications. ''I would not rule out one day that Brazil will have a better credit rating than the U.S.'' As an example he cites the time this spring that the yield on 10-year Polish bonds actually fell below United States bonds of the same maturity -- a highly unusual occurrence for an emerging market bond. 
 But with spreads widening, seasoned investors like Mr. Trainor worry that that the sudden influx of new money, especially from hedge funds, many of which now are among the largest shareholders of companies in Turkey, Argentina and Mexico, may not have the patience or experience to withstand the volatility of these markets.
 ''Shining returns have attracted all walks of investors like mosquitoes around a lamp post,'' said Mr. Trainor, this time in an e-mail sent from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. ''For an asset class best left to dedicated investors, those that aren't afraid to kick the tires in some of the most remote parts of the world, these mosquitoes better be careful or they might just get zapped.''

HEADLINE: INFLATION RISING, MARKETS TUMBLE

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Only a week ago, the Dow Jones industrial average was on the verge of a record high. Without much fanfare, the Dow -- the best-known indicator of the stock market's performance -- seemed about to regain all that had been lost since the spectacular 1990's boom came to an end. 
 But nearly every trading day since last week's high-water mark, stocks have fallen, and yesterday they really tumbled on a government report that showed consumer prices rising more than expected.
The Dow industrials fell 214.28 points, or 1.88 percent for the day, closing yesterday at 11,205.61, for the biggest point decline in more than three years. That left the index down 437 points since its close last Wednesday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq fell as well, with the Nasdaq composite index hitting a new low for the year. 
 Behind the market's reversal is a growing concern among investors that inflation may not be as firmly under control as they had hoped. Even as most economic signals continue to point to a growing economy, the prospect that the Federal Reserve might still feel compelled to keep raising interest rates has unnerved many on Wall Street.
 ''Many investors have taken large positions in stocks and they are getting spooked,'' said James Glassman, senior United States economist for J. P. Morgan Chase & Company. ''These investors are often hedge funds and foreigners, and if the Fed is going to raise rates more than they thought, that makes it less attractive for them to hold onto their big positions.''
 Indeed, the sudden unwinding in the market began on May 11, the day after Fed policy makers raised interest rates another quarter-point, to 5 percent, and left open the prospect that more interest rate increases ''might yet be needed to address inflation risks.''
 Higher interest rates, by raising the cost of borrowing, curb spending by consumers and companies. That helps to prevent bottlenecks in the economy and takes the pressure off prices.
 Many investors had been counting on the Fed to finally take a breather after nearly two years of predictably raising rates at every meeting. But Fed officials, by signaling that they would henceforth be driven by fresh economic data, turned Wall Street's attention to scrutinizing every new statistic for clues to their next move. 
 Yesterday's government report was seen as the worst omen yet. The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced a jump of 0.6 percent in the Consumer Price Index for April, mostly because of gasoline prices, but also because, as the government calculates it, the cost of owning a house and renting an apartment was up smartly. The latest increase in consumer prices came on top of a 0.4 percent increase in March. 
 Many economists, however, are not as alarmed by the inflation figures as the market reaction suggests. Because of a quirk in the way the C.P.I. is calculated, they explained, the latest reading may actually be signaling a slowing economy and, eventually, less inflation.
 Those subtleties are not always immediately apparent to market participants. Traders have also been whipsawed by conflicting data lately. Earlier this month, a government report showing relatively weak job gains encouraged the view the Fed would stop raising rates after this month, setting off a four-day rally that sent the Dow up close to its record last week. 
 ''If you are trading in the market, you have to put a lot of weight on each new bit of information, even if you know the data is perhaps not significant,'' said Bill Cheney, chief economist for John Hancock Financial Services. ''It is, after all, the latest information and so you have to react to it, and almost always it is an overreaction.''
 If there was an overreaction, it may be because many traders do not take into account how the Consumer Price Index measures the cost of housing, which gets more weight than any other item.
 The bureau, relying on data that is relatively easy to compile monthly, uses the cost of renting as a proxy for the cost of owning a house or an apartment as well as the cost of renting one. 
 Now that home sales are leveling off, the demand for rental properties has risen and so have rents.
 Rising rents, more than any other item, explain why the core C.P.I. -- which excludes volatile food and energy prices -- jumped 0.3 percent last month. For the first four months of this year, the core C.P.I. rose at an annual rate of 3 percent, up from 2.2 percent for all of last year. 
 For the overall C.P.I., including food and energy, the annualized increase this year through April was 5.1 percent, up from 3.4 percent last year.
 The Fed's focus, however, is on the core rate -- and so is the market's. That may be leading to a perverse reaction to the Fed's efforts to keep inflation under control. 
 ''In a way you could argue that the rental phenomenon is a result of rising mortgage rates, which in turn reflect the Fed's rate increases,'' said Nigel Gault, the United States economist for Global Insights. But ''as the housing market slows, so will the economy, and that will bring down inflation. Pursuing this line of reasoning, you can also argue that the Fed's rate increases so far are enough.''
 That was not the view yesterday from the stock market, which fears that the Fed is now more likely to raise rates at its next meeting in June. The big drop in the Dow yesterday followed two earlier declines of more than 100 points last Thursday and again on Friday. 
 The index closed last Wednesday at 11,642.65, or just 80.28 points shy of its record 11,722.98 on Jan. 14, 2000.
 While the S.& P. 500 and the Nasdaq were also down sharply yesterday, they never regained as much ground as the Dow since their peaks in 2000 and have generally been less volatile. 
 For investors, the biggest concern is that rising oil prices will feed into the cost of goods and services dependent on oil. So far, the main impact is on gasoline pump prices, which averaged $2.79 a gallon in April and $2.97 a gallon in May, according to Energy Department surveys. 
 An indirect effect is evident in rising air fares, in surcharges on overnight air freight, and in a few chemical products made from petroleum. But those increases are still isolated.
 ''You are really not seeing much pass through yet,'' said Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs. ''What worries me is that the markets' reaction to the inflation numbers will push the Fed into tightening more than is necessary.''

HEADLINE: A Last Chance for Ground Zero

BYLINE: By James E. Young and Michael Van Valkenburgh. 
James E. Young is a professor of Judaic and Near Eastern studies at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Michael Van Valkenburgh is a professor of landscape architecture at Harvard.

 BODY:
IMAGINE our country today without the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, without the open and painstaking competition that gave veterans, their families and the rest of us a place unlike any other to mourn our losses of that era. As difficult and adversarial as that process was at times, it was necessary. Our need for a memorial at ground zero is no less profound, as is our need to stick by the plan for the World Trade Center Memorial devised more than two years ago, no matter how difficult that may be.
 The memorial at ground zero is not a zero-sum project in which one interested party gets its way. It is, rather, an accretion of personal and civic memorial needs, a place for memory, mourning and the history of that horrible day. As 2 of the 13 jurors who eventually chose Michael Arad and Peter Walker's World Trade Center Memorial design, ''Reflecting Absence,'' out of 5,201 submissions from 63 countries, we can no longer sit by while a meticulously organized process for the memorial threatens to come off its tracks. 
 The memorial project is sagging beneath the weight of competing constituencies, conflicting agendas and unfortunate political exploitation of the memory of 9/11. And while it's true that all memorials evolve according to economic and political needs of the moment, the trade center memorial has not evolved so much as it has been piled on with additional features, pushed by well-meaning interests, which now threaten to sink it beneath a budget of nearly $1 billion. 
 The key to moving ahead will be making a simple but crucial distinction between the stages of memory at ground zero -- focusing first on building the memorial as designed by Mr. Arad and Mr. Walker, and next on the memorial museum and other needs. 
 The memorial design is composed of two square, one-acre reflecting pools marking the footprints of the twin towers, each with a square void at its center. Reaching the base of these lower pools by ramps, visitors will find the names of victims inscribed on walls at the water's edge. 
 This is not an underground memorial, as its detractors claim -- an echo of the criticism once directed at Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Rather, it is stitched into the fabric of the city and streets around it, allowing visitors to peer into the depths of destruction from street level. After they descend they can look up to the heavens through veils of falling water. The memorial is at once above and below ground, a moving exchange between the depths of destruction and the life of the city around it. On its unveiling in January 2004, this design was widely embraced by the families of victims, by the public and by cultural critics. 
 As originally commissioned, ''Reflecting Absence'' came within an estimated $500 million budget, of which a majority would go to restore utilities, roadways, mechanical areas and other underground infrastructure. But with the post-competition additions of a memorial museum and a larger section of exposed slurry wall tacking on hundreds of millions of dollars, the overall costs do, indeed, seem to break the budget. 
 Rather than allowing the combined costs of the memorial and the museum to stop the entire process, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and the Port Authority need to restore the plan to its distinct stages, first one, then the other. This would allow construction of the memorial to continue even as preparations are made for the museum. 
 A two-step sequence would ensure that the stages of memory support each other rather than negate each other, or worse, foreclose the entire memorial project altogether. As for the museum, we suggest that instead of putting it underground as an abutment to the open subterranean galleries of the memorial on the south side of Fulton Street, the development corporation and the Port Authority agree to put it in the ground-floor atrium of the Freedom Tower itself, where it would be immediately accessible to pedestrians and all who work there. 
 This plan would preserve the integrity of the memorial while ensuring that the museum and Freedom Tower remain anchored in the history and losses of Sept. 11, 2001. 
 As to other sticking points now bedeviling the process, we believe that the development corporation -- whose new chairman, Kevin M. Rampe, was appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki yesterday -- should create an impartial design advisory board to mediate between the designers' artistic vision and the realities of security and the difficult nature of the site. 
 Compromise will certainly be necessary, for example, on the number of ramps into and out of the memorial and on the exact location of the reflecting pools in relation to the original footprints of the towers. Particular needs of family members -- like the desire to mark the affiliations of those who died in the line of duty that day with a simple insignia next to their names -- should be accommodated without further debate.
 No memorial design and construction process is ever perfect, and no memorial ever enjoys universal acclaim. But it is precisely this imperfection that animates and sustains the best memorials. By respecting the human logic of this process, which includes at its core the constant and transparent give and take among all parties, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation could best guarantee that the World Trade Center Memorial continues to move forward, informed by dissent and discussion, not paralyzed by it. We must ask all parties to allow the project to unfold as it must -- noisily perhaps, contentious certainly -- toward the memorial that all of us, victims' families and the wider public, need and deserve.

HEADLINE: Democracy In Egypt Faces 2 Tests Today

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN; Mona el-Naggar contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: CAIRO, May 17 

 BODY:
In separate courtrooms in downtown Cairo on Thursday morning, judges will be asked to consider two cases that have called into question President Hosni Mubarak's promise to bring democratic practices to Egypt. 
 The cases are those of Ayman Nour, the second-place presidential candidate sentenced to five years in prison, and of two judges who charged publicly that parliamentary elections were fixed and fraudulent.
While the government has made plain that it will not back down in its action against the judges -- or their colleagues who are demanding judicial independence -- it has sent some signals that Mr. Nour may be granted a new trial and perhaps be released. 
 The government's intentions in the judges' case seem clear. The Interior Ministry announced Tuesday that all demonstrations in support of the judges would be deemed illegal, and it began Wednesday night to move riot-equipped police forces into the area around the High Court. 
 But the outcome for Mr. Nour is unclear, as his lawyer, his wife and some government officials pointed to a recent report by the prosecutor's office that agreed that there had been errors in his trial.
 Further, the government's tone toward Mr. Nour and his family -- which for the past year has been aggressive, dismissive and punitive -- took a noticeable turn in recent days, with the prosecutor's report and even an invitation to his wife and foreign diplomats to attend the court hearing.
 ''I am optimistic, because his current legal status can set him free,'' said Mr. Nour's lawyer, Amir Salem, offering the first upbeat assessment since his client was arrested on charges of forging signatures to create his political party. ''This should have the court release and retry him.'' 
 Whether by design or circumstance, Mr. Nour's case offers Egypt a chance to try to shift the international focus away from its war with nearly 7,000 judges and their supporters. The United States and the European Union have condemned Mr. Mubarak's government for beating and detaining demonstrators who support the judges' call for independence of the courts and for the right to oversee all elections.
 Even while Mr. Mubarak and his inner circle have demonstrated that they are reluctant to appear to respond to foreign pressure, he faces another potentially embarrassing moment on Thursday between demonstrators and the police, a problem magnified because Egypt will serve as the host of the World Economic Forum, which begins Saturday.
 Egypt's treatment of the judges and the demonstrators, its reauthorization of an emergency law and its decision to postpone local elections for two years all threaten to take attention away from a forum that officials hoped would highlight this country's efforts at economic reform. 
 Whether those factors will play into the decision on Mr. Nour remains uncertain, and on Wednesday some officials said they were reluctant to make a prediction.
 In the case of the two judges, Mahmoud Mekki and Hisham Bastawisi, a judicial panel is to consider disciplinary charges against them. Mr. Bastawisi was hospitalized Wednesday, and friends of his said he had suffered a heart attack, making it uncertain whether the hearing would go forward. 
 Recent decisions in Egypt, from arresting a popular blogger to postponing local elections, present a problem for the White House. Not only do they contradict President Bush's call for spreading democracy, but they complicate the administration's effort to maintain the nearly $2 billion a year that Egypt receives in military and development aid in the face of some calls from Congress to re-evaluate the package.
 But despite the potential public relations value to the government if Mr. Nour is granted a new trial -- and presumably released -- such a decision would do little to make substantive changes in the political landscape of Egypt. 
 The judges' demands, on the other hand, have been widely seen as a direct challenge to the ability of the governing National Democratic Party's ability to maintain power and guarantee that its handpicked nominee will replace Mr. Mubarak, who turned 78 this month and has ruled Egypt for 25 years. 
 The call to have completely independent oversight of elections comes at a time when the governing party has appeared weak and divided, the president's popularity is low and the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood is strong and popular. Many supporters and opponents of Mr. Mubarak are discussing who will be the next president, even while the subject remains officially taboo.
 ''If the judges succeeded it would show how weak the N.D.P. is,'' said Salama Ahmed Salama, a political analyst and longtime columnist for the semiofficial daily Al Ahram. ''It may call into question all those figures who govern us.''
 The speculation over succession has increased because while the government made it impossible for independent opposition parties or political leaders, like Mr. Nour, to build a following, the president's son, Gamal Mubarak, 42, has taken on an increasingly visible and important role in the party and the country. He recently made a private visit to the White House, where he was greeted by President Bush and met with Vice President Dick Cheney and the national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley.
 The younger Mubarak has repeatedly said he has no intention to run for president, but his denials have been greeted skeptically.
 Judge Mekki said in an interview that a friend inside the National Democratic Party had warned him that its leadership viewed the fight with the judges as one over succession. 
 The government has said the judges' dispute is an intra-judicial problem and has nothing to do with the government or the of succession issue. Muhammad Kamal, a member of the governing party and an ally of the younger Mubarak, said the party had not even begun to discuss the issue. 
 For more than 20 years, Egypt's judges have called for independence from the executive branch. But the judges' demands became of central concern to the governing party when the Constitutional Court ruled in 2000 that all elections must be supervised by judges. Since then judges have complained that they are allowed to monitor only polling places, but not vote counting.
 The government plans to submit a proposed bill addressing some of the judges' concerns to Parliament in the next few days, said an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the topic. But the official said judicial oversight of elections was not even on the table.

HEADLINE: Giving Galilee A Foothold In Industry 

BYLINE: By GREG MYRE

DATELINE: TEFEN INDUSTRIAL PARK, Israel, May 15 

 BODY:
Warren E. Buffett, the multibillionaire investor, put up $4 billion to buy 80 percent of the Iscar Metalworking Company without bothering to visit its hilltop headquarters here in the isolated Galilee region of northern Israel. He missed quite a trip. 
 Since its founding on the Wertheimer family's kitchen porch in 1952, Iscar, which makes precision metal-cutting tools for a wide range of industries, has been led by a fiercely independent father-and-son team, Stef and Eitan Wertheimer, who have always operated well outside the business mainstream.
Literally. They run their company from one of the most rural and remote corners of the country, far from the commercial capital of Tel Aviv. Eitan Wertheimer's new office offers a commanding view of the region's open spaces. His closest neighbor is a Druze village, and beyond that are the rolling hills that mark Israel's volatile border with Lebanon. 
 The company has always been privately held and never publicly discloses its finances. The compact headquarters and adjacent factory are part of an industrial park built by the Wertheimers 20 years ago on a stony hill, with the aim of nurturing businesses in the thinly populated and largely undeveloped Galilee. 
 ''This is the place we love, and this is what we love doing,'' said Eitan Wertheimer, 54. ''We wanted to stay the way we are, to keep the same culture, but be part of something bigger. Warren Buffett understands this.''
 The Wertheimers were already one of Israel's wealthiest families before Berkshire Hathaway, Mr. Buffett's company, bought its controlling share of Iscar in a deal announced May 5. The Wertheimer family retains the remaining 20 percent of the company, with Eitan remaining as chairman. Stef Wertheimer, 79, is now the company's honorary chairman.
 Mr. Buffett's investment, his first purchase outside the United States, has provided a positive jolt to Israel's financial community and further lifted the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, which has been hitting record highs this year.
 While the Palestinians are mired in a financial crisis, Israel's economy is galloping ahead. After growing at about 4 to 5 percent for the past few years, the economy surged at an annual rate of 6.6 percent in the first quarter of this year, the to government said on Monday.
 The Wertheimers' industrial parks are large-scale philanthropic ventures based on their belief that spreading economic prosperity more widely will lead to Arab-Jewish coexistence and bring an end to decades of Middle East conflict.
 ''This area doesn't have much experience in industry, but this is what it needs to get on its feet,'' Stef Wertheimer said. ''The idea is to put people to work, get them off the street, and end the quarreling about land and religion.''
 At the Tefen Industrial Park, established in the mid-1980's, Iscar is now just one of 60 companies that employ some 4,000 workers, many of them Druze and Arab. The park resembles a college campus, with manicured lawns and roses now in full bloom. It is one of three such parks in the Galilee, and there is another in the Negev desert in the south.
 ''I made my money in Iscar,'' Stef Wertheimer said. ''I spend my money on the industrial parks.''
 The parks in Israel are seen as a success, accounting for a significant share of the country's industrial production and exports. Elsewhere, it has been a tougher challenge. This week, for example, Stef Wertheimer was in Turkey to promote an industrial park established last year outside Istanbul.
 In the 1990's, he drew up plans for an industrial park in Rafah, in the Gaza Strip. The Palestinian and the Israeli governments both offered support, he said, but it has been shelved for now, a victim of the violence of the last several years. ''These industrial parks could work for the Palestinians, but perhaps the time is not right,'' Stef Wertheimer said in a telephone interview from Istanbul. Iscar's global reach now includes production facilities in 60 countries, and sales in nearly 100 countries.
 The deal with Mr. Buffett began last October, when Eitan Wertheimer sent an unsolicited letter, with a brief description of Iscar, to Berkshire Hathaway, based in Omaha.
 He received a prompt response and traveled to see Mr. Buffett that month. The contract was put together and signed in 10 days, and announced this month by Mr. Buffett at the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting in Omaha.
 Eitan Wertheimer says he is thrilled to be working with Mr. Buffett, and stylistically, they have much in common. Both are decidedly low key and folksy. They talk about multibillion-dollar businesses as if they were merely large lemonade stands. And they delegate responsibility, as Mr. Buffett puts it, ''almost to the point of abdication.''
 Eitan Wertheimer said that when Iscar's president, Jacob Harpaz, raises an issue, Mr. Wertheimer's standard response is, ''Do whatever you like, it seems to be working.''
 ''Now Warren tells me exactly the same thing,'' he added. 
 ''The last time we had a board meeting was 15 years ago when several of us had coffee in the cafeteria,'' Eitan Wertheimer said. ''My main job is not to disturb anybody.''
 The Wertheimers have designed their industrial parks to include much more than factories. There are museums and sculpture gardens and occasional concerts, as well as classrooms where businesses hold training sessions. 
 These additions are intended to ''to give respectability to industry,'' Eitan Wertheimer said. ''Jewish mothers don't like their kids working in factories. They think they are dirty, they don't smell nice, and they don't pay well.''
 ''But if we can make them look like a place you want to visit, then maybe industry doesn't look so bad to the Jewish mothers,'' he said, adding that the Tefen Industrial Park draws about 250,000 visitors a year.
 For all their emphasis on education and training, neither father nor son had much time for formal education themselves.
 When he was 10, Stef Wertheimer's family fled Nazi Germany and came to what was British-ruled Palestine in 1936. He left school at 14, and helped to make weaponry for a Jewish underground militia before Israel's independence in 1948.
 Four years later, he started his tool-making shop at the family home in the quiet town of Nahariya. Mr. Wertheimer served in Parliament briefly, but found politics frustrating. He left in the early 1980's with the conviction he could accomplish more with industrial parks, which he calls a ''capitalist kibbutz.''
 The younger Eitan Wertheimer, meanwhile, made it through high school, but he never went to college, aside from a few management courses at Harvard Business School in the 1980's.
 In 1982, Eitan's father asked him to restructure an ailing part of Iscar. The following year, after Stef Wertheimer suffered a severe concussion in a car accident, Eitan took over the company.
 Israeli newspaper reports have estimated annual profit at more than $300 million on revenue of more than $1 billion.
 ''These are purely guesses,'' Eitan Wertheimer said. ''We never talk about figures.''

HEADLINE: Where AIDS Galloped, Lessons in Applying the Reins 

BYLINE: By Celia W. Dugger

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya 

 BODY:
Kenya is a rarity in Africa, a nation where experts say the AIDS epidemic shows signs of easing. So this land of safaris has become a hunting ground of a different sort, attracting policy makers and researchers looking for keys to slowing the relentless spread of AIDS elsewhere on the continent. 
 The trends are heartening. Medical experts here estimate that the number of new H.I.V. infections has plummeted over the last decade from a peak of more than 200,000 a year to fewer than 90,000. 
And changes in sexual habits seem to be contributing to the decline. Men say they are having sex with fewer partners, and women report losing their virginity later. Many teenagers, once sexually active, say they are abstaining entirely.
 Such shifts, documented in large-scale surveys, suggest that abstinence programs championed by Congressional Republicans in Washington have some chance of success. Critics of the Republican approach say it has overemphasized abstinence at the expense of condoms and other prevention strategies. Kenyan health officials frankly acknowledge that evidence is lacking on the effectiveness of programs that promote condoms or abstinence. 
 According to the United Nations AIDS agency, Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe are the sub-Saharan countries with documented declines in H.I.V. prevalence. Researchers agree that the fall is partly because AIDS deaths have reduced the population of H.I.V.-positive people. But they also say it is likely that behavior change has helped. In Uganda, increased use of condoms has been important.
 Health officials here say the spread of knowledge about how to prevent infection and a rising tide of death have been catalytic. Three out of four Kenyans now know someone who has become sick or died from AIDS, up from 40 percent a decade ago. ''That is a shock treatment,'' said Godfrey M. Baltazar, an epidemiologist who oversees monitoring of the Kenyan government's AIDS programs.
 As donors have ratcheted up financing of anti-AIDS programs, the landscape for prevention has changed. Since President Bush's global AIDS plan was enacted in 2003, the United States has become the dominant donor in Kenya, spending $208 million this year to combat AIDS -- more than all other donors combined. 
 More than half that money is financing the feverish drive for diagnosis of AIDS and treatment of infected people here. The number tested in Kenya, with a population of 32 million, has more than tripled since 2003, to 1.5 million last year. The number of AIDS patients receiving drug treatment has rocketed to 70,000 from fewer than 10,000 in 2003.
 Paradoxically, the explosive growth in testing and treatment may be Washington's most important contribution to preventing the spread of the disease. Once people know that AIDS is not a death sentence, they are more willing to be tested, and once they know their H.I.V. status they can protect themselves and their sexual partners. 
 This knowledge is critical in light of the experts' judgment that more than half the new infections in Kenya are with couples in which one partner is H.I.V.-positive. 
 The United States is also paying for programs aimed at changing behavior. This year, it will spend $15.7 million on programs that promote abstinence and faithfulness, and $7.8 million to prevent sexual transmission of H.I.V., including distribution of condoms to high-risk groups. 
 Seen from Kenya, the debate that rages in Washington over AIDS and sex sometimes seems more a reflection of American culture wars than African realities. 
 Conservative Republican leaders in the House of Representatives successfully included a provision in the 2003 law requiring that a third of AIDS-prevention money go to programs that promote abstinence. 
 Under the guidelines, United States funds can be used in schools to educate children 14 and younger about abstinence and faithfulness, with condom education added for those 15 and older. The rules permit teachers and volunteers to answer children's questions about condoms, though not to introduce the topic. 
 With United States financing, Population Services International, a nonprofit group, is organizing abstinence clubs for 10- to 15-year-olds here. P.S.I. does not teach the children about condoms, but answers their questions. 
 Terry Mathenge, 19, a P.S.I. volunteer in a Nairobi school, said she answered directly when, for example, a 10-year-old girl slapped by a parent for asking about condoms repeated the question at a club meeting. 
 ''It's better to tackle it head-on,'' Ms. Mathenge said, adding, ''Speak the truth and the truth will set you free.''
 But she also said abstinence was important. ''In the past, the voice of condoms was louder than the voice of abstinence, and I'm glad that's changing,'' she said. 
 Among those listening to her one recent afternoon in Nairobi was Michael Gerson, an evangelical Christian and a close adviser to President Bush. He told the young people assembled that the American debate was polarized between those who favored abstinence only and those who said the promotion of abstinence was naive. 
 ''It seems like you're saying it's neither,'' he told Ms. Mathenge. 
 Mr. Gerson later said the best programs set an ideal of sexual behavior, but were realistic about human nature ''and deal with young people where they are, and sometimes that includes condoms.'' The Congressional earmark on abstinence funding was needed to correct an overemphasis on condoms, he said.
 Dr. Lawrence Marum, who heads the global AIDS program in Kenya for the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said abstinence programs helped give girls the confidence to resist pressure for sex. 
 Since teenage girls are six times more likely to be H.I.V.-infected than boys, these programs are needed ''to save their lives.'' 
 But Dr. Marum also noted that a minority of adolescents had sex by age 15 and needed education in human sexuality, including how to protect themselves with condoms, before they became sexually active.
 Scholars say much work remains to be done to figure out which of the so-called ABC programs -- abstain, be faithful, use condoms -- are effective. ''We don't know what works,'' said Michael Kremer, an economics professor at Harvard who is helping evaluate the programs, ''and it's not at all obvious.'' 
 But efforts to prevent the spread of AIDS will not wait for definitive evidence. In societies where sex can lead to death, many people on both sides of the ideological divide agree that abstinence for the young should be embraced. It is also clear that many young people will have sex despite the dangers, and that abstinence programs alone will not protect them.

HEADLINE: U.S. SAID TO WEIGH A NEW APPROACH ON NORTH KOREA

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17 

 BODY:
President Bush's top advisers have recommended a broad new approach to dealing with North Korea that would include beginning negotiations on a peace treaty, even while efforts to dismantle the country's nuclear program are still under way, senior administration officials and Asian diplomats say.
 Aides say Mr. Bush is very likely to approve the new approach, which has been hotly debated among different factions within the administration. But he will not do so unless North Korea returns to multinational negotiations over its nuclear program. The talks have been stalled since September.
North Koreans have long demanded a peace treaty, which would replace the 1953 armistice ending the Korean War. 
 For several years after he first took office, Mr. Bush vowed not to end North Korea's economic and diplomatic isolation until it entirely dismantled its nuclear program. That stance later softened, and the administration said some benefits to North Korea could begin to flow as significant dismantlement took place. Now, if the president allows talks about a peace treaty to take place on a parallel track with six-nation talks on disarmament, it will signal another major change of tactics. 
 The decision to consider a change may have been influenced in part by growing concerns about Iran's nuclear program. One senior Asian official who has been briefed on the administration's discussions about what to do next said, ''There is a sense that they can't leave Korea out there as a model for what the Iranians hope to become -- a nuclear state that can say no to outside pressure.''
 But it is far from clear that North Korea would engage in any new discussions, especially if they included talk of political change, human rights, terrorism and an opening of the country, topics that the Bush administration has insisted would have to be part of any comprehensive discussions with North Korea.
 With the war in Iraq and the nuclear dispute with Iran as distractions, many top officials have all but given up hope that North Korea's government will either disarm or collapse during Mr. Bush's remaining time in office. Increasingly, they blame two of Mr. Bush's negotiating partners, South Korea and China, which have poured aid into North Korea even while the United States has tried to cut off its major sources of revenue. 
 In his first term, Mr. Bush said repeatedly that he would never ''tolerate'' a nuclear North Korea. Now he rarely discusses the country's suspected weapons. Instead, he has met in the Oval Office with escapees from the country and used the events to discuss North Korea's prison camps and the suffering of its people. 
 Mr. Bush has also been under subtle pressure to change the first-term talk of speeding change of government. ''Focusing on regime change as the road to denuclearization confuses the issue,'' former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger wrote in a lengthy op-ed article that appeared in The Washington Post on Tuesday. Noting that the negotiations have been conducted by Christopher R. Hill, a seasoned diplomat who played a major role in the Dayton peace accords, which halted the civil war in Bosnia, he said, ''Periodic engagement at a higher level is needed.''
 A classified National Intelligence Estimate on North Korea, which was circulated among senior officials earlier this year, concluded that the North had probably fabricated the fuel for more than a half-dozen nuclear weapons since the beginning of Mr. Bush's administration and was continuing to produce roughly a bomb's worth of new plutonium each year. But in a show of caution after the discovery of intelligence flaws in Iraq, the assessment left unclear whether North Korea had actually turned that fuel into weapons.
 With the six-nation negotiations over North Korea's nuclear program appearing to go nowhere, the drive for a broader strategy was propelled by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and one of her top aides, Philip D. Zelikow, who drafted two papers describing the new approach. 
 Those papers touched off what one senior official called ''a blizzard of debate'' over the next steps that eventually included Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, who has been widely described by current and former officials as leading the drive in Mr. Bush's first term to make sure the North Korean government received no concessions from the United States until all of its weapons and weapons sites were taken apart. It is unclear where Mr. Cheney stands on the new approach that emerged from the State Department. 
 Now, said one official who has participated in the recent internal debate, ''I think it is fair to say that many in the administration have come to the conclusion that dealing head-on with the nuclear problem is simply too difficult.'' 
 The official added, ''So the question is whether it would help to try to end the perpetual state of war'' that has existed, at least on paper, for 53 years. ''It may be another way to get there.''
 An agreement that was signed in September by North Korea and the five other nations involved in the talks -- the United States, South Korea, China, Japan and Russia -- commits the country to give up its weapons and rejoin the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty ''at an early date'' but leaves completely unclear what would have to come first: disarmament or a series of steps that would aid North Korea.
 It also included a sentence that paves the way for the initiative recommended to Mr. Bush, declaring that ''the directly related parties will negotiate a permanent peace regime on the Korean Peninsula at an appropriate separate forum.'' But it does not specify what steps North Korea would have to take first.
 As described by administration officials, none of whom would speak on the record about deliberations inside the White House, Mr. Bush's aides envision starting negotiations over a formal peace treaty that would include the original signatories of the armistice -- China, North Korea and the United States, which signed on behalf of the United Nations. They would also add South Korea, now the world's 11th-largest economy, which declined to sign the original armistice. 
 Japan, Korea's colonial ruler in the first half of the 20th century, would be excluded, as would Russia. 
 A National Security Council spokesman declined to comment on any internal deliberations on North Korea policy and referred all questions to the State Department, which has handled the negotiations with the North. The State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, declined to discuss the recommendations made to Mr. Bush and said, ''The most important decision is with North Korea -- and that is the strategic decision to give up their nuclear weapons program.''
 ''They signed a joint statement,'' he added, ''but they have yet to demonstrate that they have made a decision to abandon all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs.'' 
 In justifying its refusal to return to talks, North Korea has complained bitterly about the financial sanctions imposed by the United States, which have been aimed at closing down the North's banking activities in Macao and elsewhere in Asia. The United States has described those steps as ''defensive measures'' intended to stop the country from counterfeiting American currency and exporting drugs and missiles.
 Even if peace treaty talks started, officials insisted, those sanctions would continue. A month ago, Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser, told a small audience of foreign policy experts that the sanctions were ''the first thing we have done that has gotten their attention,'' several participants in the meeting said. 
 Some intelligence officials say they believe the protests may have arisen in part because they affected a secretive operation in North Korea called Unit 39 that finances the personal activities of Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader, providing the money he spends for his entertainment and to win the loyalty of others in the leadership.

HEADLINE: Honda to Drop a Hybrid and Eventually Offer a New One

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY; Micheline Maynard contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 17 

 BODY:
The Honda Insight, the first gasoline-electric hybrid vehicle to be sold in the United States and the most fuel-efficient car in America, will be discontinued later this year, American Honda said Wednesday.
 Honda is dropping the Insight, a quirky two-seater that gets an estimated 66 miles a gallon with a manual transmission and can go 670 miles on a tank of gas, because it is preparing to introduce a new hybrid vehicle in 2009.
Honda also sells hybrid versions of its small Civic and midsize Accord. 
 Honda started selling the Insight in 1999, a few months before the Toyota Prius went on sale in the United States. Sales of all hybrids have risen sharply in recent years along with the price of gas.
 Hybrid vehicle sales more than doubled last year, but still make up just over 1 percent of the market. Automakers sold about 200,000 in the United States last year. By contrast, they sold fewer than 8,000 in the year 2000.
 The Insight, which is built low to the ground and has an aluminum body that some have likened to an upside-down bathtub, failed to achieve the popularity of the Prius, a four-door model with a more conventional, though slightly futuristic, appearance.
 Honda sold 666 Insights last year, while sales of the Prius reached 107,897.
 Analysts say Honda hopes the Insight's replacement, which will be smaller and significantly less expensive than the Civic hybrid, will put it on a more equal footing with the Prius, which has become a favorite among environmentalists and Hollywood celebrities.
 Although it reached the market first, the Insight ''quickly got to be a rather forgotten car,'' said Philip Reed, consumer advice editor for Edmunds.com, an automotive Web site that offers buying advice and other car information.
 Mr. Reed said the Insight, which costs about $20,000, represented more of a statement about Honda's commitment to fuel economy than a vehicle intended to have mass appeal. 
 In addition to its small interior, the Insight's popularity was undoubtedly hindered by its exterior. Mr. Reed described the Insight, designed in a teardrop shape to minimize wind resistance, as ''sort of Flash Gordonish -- what we thought the future was going to look like back in 1960.''
 But Mark Mattke, a flooring salesman in Sparta, Wis., was drawn to the vehicle by its unique design as well as its size. He said he was sad it would no longer be sold. He bought a used Insight last fall and traded it in for a new one in March.
 ''I only needed it to seat one,'' said Mr. Mattke, who also owns a Civic hybrid. ''I needed one seat for me and a place to put my briefcase and some product samples.'' 
 Mr. Mattke has filled up his Insight's 10.6-gallon tank just five times in two months and keeps a spreadsheet showing he has saved $200 over his previous vehicle, a supercharged Chrysler PT Cruiser.
 Honda officials refused to give details about the new hybrid, but said they wanted to focus on small vehicles before introducing larger gas-electric offerings. ''Hybrid technology works best in smaller vehicles,'' said John W. Mendel, senior vice president of American Honda's auto operations.
 Honda said it hoped to sell at least 100,000 a year of its new hybrid, which will be built in Japan.
 The vehicle is part of Honda's plan to increase its United States sales by 300,000 vehicles by 2009. To do so, it will build a new factory somewhere in the Midwest. It said in Tokyo on Wednesday that it would spend $400 million on the new plant, its sixth in North America.
 A Honda spokesman, Jeffrey Smith, said the automaker was ''in the final stages of securing a plant site'' but would not reveal where it would be or when a decision might be announced.
 Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky are considered the most likely choices.

HEADLINE: A Fungus's Toll on One Lens Wearer 

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
For Janice McConnell of Frazer, Pa., a longtime contact lens wearer, the problem began with redness and severe pain in her eye in mid-November. Her left eye became so sensitive to light she wore dark sunglasses indoors. ''You know what it felt like?'' she said. ''Like something had bitten my eye.'' 
 Her doctor thought it was a bacterial infection and gave her medicine, but it did not work. On the Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend, she said, the pain was so severe she went to the emergency room of a local hospital. That hospital immediately sent her to the Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia, where the fungal infection was diagnosed.
For the first several weeks of treatment, she had to get up every hour at night to put drops in her eyes. Still, her cornea was so damaged that on Jan. 19 she had surgery to clear out the fungus and transplant a cornea. 
 ''I came within one week of losing my whole eye,'' Ms. McConnell, 56, said, citing what her doctor told her. 
 But while she has her eye, she cannot see through it. A big cataract has formed and doctors will not even try to remove it until August, after her eye has had time to heal from the transplant. 
 ''If you looked at my left eye you wouldn't even be able to distinguish a pupil,'' she said in a telephone interview, with her lawyer, Paul Pennock, on the line. ''I always joke that I have two eyes that don't match, but it's not funny. 
 Ms. McConnell said she had worn contact lenses for almost 30 years and had previously never had trouble, using lenses and solutions from Bausch & Lomb, including older ReNu products. She said she began using ReNu With MoistureLoc in September, hoping its moisture-retention feature would prevent the wintertime drying of her eyes and her contact lenses. 
 Ms. McConnell said she had lost three and a half months of work from her job and her daughter lost time from work caring for her. She has now returned to her job as a coordinator in a program that helps find jobs for the unemployed. 
 But with sight in only one eye, she said, ''I'm constantly bumping into people, spilling things.'' She said she drove only in daytime and on familiar roads. ''It's very limiting,'' she said. ''I just stay home.'' 
 Ms. McConnell said she would never wear contact lenses again, even if she was physically able to. And she said she felt betrayed by Bausch & Lomb. ''I read about where 36 to 39 people in Singapore complained to Bausch & Lomb and they stopped shipments there,'' she said. ''But they didn't tell anyone here. It's like an insult.'' 
 Bausch & Lomb suspended shipments of ReNu With MoistureLoc to Singapore and Hong Kong in February, but it did not do so in this country until April. The company declined to comment on lawsuits regarding the ReNu product.
 Ms. McConnell sued the Rochester-based company in state court in New York. She found her lawyer through an Internet search. Since then, she said, five other law firms have asked to represent her.

HEADLINE: Mexican Economy Grows 5.5% On Strength of Autos and Oil 

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, May 17 

 BODY:
Mexico's economy expanded 5.5 percent in the first quarter over the similar period last year, the Finance Ministry said Wednesday, the fastest growth since 2000. 
 Economists pointed to the data as evidence that Mexican industry was recovering from the shock of Chinese competition. 
A surge in manufacturing that began late last year and increased construction spending was behind the growth, analysts said. Mexico's auto industry has had the most notable rebound: output grew 54 percent in the first quarter as plants here began producing models like the Ford Focus. 
 At the same time, the federal government is flush with additional revenue from the soaring price of Mexican oil exports. By law, much of that money must go toward spending on infrastructure. With an eye to presidential elections on July 2, both the federal and state governments are hurrying to make those investments. 
 Alfredo Thorne, an economist with J. P. Morgan Chase in Mexico City, remarked, ''The truth is that all the stars are aligned in favor of Mexico, and that's what the numbers are showing.''
 On a seasonally adjusted basis, the economy grew 1.54 percent over the preceding quarter, the ministry said. 
 After President Vicente Fox took office at the end of 2000, Mexico's economy sustained a double blow. 
 A recession in the United States, which buys 85 percent of Mexico's exports, stunted export growth.
 At the same time, China's economic rise created a longer-term challenge as factories there competed directly with Mexico to sell the same goods more cheaply to the United States. Employment in this country fell as companies left for China.
 Growth in the first five years of Mr. Fox's presidency averaged less than 2 percent annually, and the anemic economy fueled continuing emigration to the United States. 
 In response to the Chinese threat, many companies cut costs and invested to become more competitive. Along with the auto industry, new foreign investment has revitalized the electronics industry, Mr. Thorne said. 
 But few economists maintain that the economy can sustain this kind of growth for the rest of the year. In part, the first-quarter figures were buoyed by the fact that Easter week this year fell in April, which meant that there were more working days in the first quarter this year than last year. 
 And analysts are watching for signs that the United States economy will slow later this year. 
 Delia Paredes, senior economist at the Santander Financial Group in Mexico City, said she expected national growth for the year to reach about 3.5 percent. For an economy with the potential of Mexico's, she said, that is not enough.

HEADLINE: A Region Now Offers More Than Cheap Land 

BYLINE: By James Flanigan. 
This column about small-business trends in California and the West appears on the third Thursday of every month. E-mail: jamesflanigan@nytimes.com

 BODY:
SMALL businesses are tinkering and adapting technologies in Southern California's grandly named Inland Empire. The area of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties, east of Los Angeles, has swelled for years with rapid population growth and the largest annual increases in employment in all of California. 
 The area's attractions were simple: cheaper land and housing than in Los Angeles County and adjacent Orange County. Businesses moved in to lower their costs and residents came because they could afford housing, even if it came with hours of commuting on congested freeways.
But now technology-based companies and institutions are expanding in the Inland Empire, creating economic opportunity for employees skilled in the modern disciplines of information and medical sciences. And as everywhere in California -- and the rest of the country for that matter -- opportunities are arising in small and midsize companies, working on products and services scarcely dreamed of a decade or two ago. 
 Garner Holt Productions, for example, programs microprocessors and software to create walking, talking lions, tigers and bears as well as pirates, dinosaurs and mangy critters for the Disneyland theme parks and for casinos in Las Vegas and the Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants nationwide. 
 ''The business is very sporadic and dynamic,'' Mr. Holt said. ''We'll get a call for a brontosaurus or a thousand singing canaries. We're just completing fire-breathing dragons 40 feet tall for a Disney project in Tokyo.'' 
 The company has come a long way from its start when Mr. Holt, now 43, was 15, and designed a haunted house in his parents' San Bernardino backyard. A local shopping mall asked him to do a similar Halloween display and he has been in business developing the art and science of animatronics since. 
 Today Garner Holt Productions has 50 employees, $6 million in annual sales and an evolving vision in Mr. Holt's mind of using his company's skills with human form and movement to do well and do good. Noticing recently that a friend who had lost an arm to cancer had an unattractive prosthesis, he fashioned a new arm for her with lifelike skin and shape and flexibility. ''Prostheses could be a new field for us,'' Mr. Holt said, casually demonstrating a forearm.
 Amro Albanna deals in illusions of a different sort at his company, Qmotions, which produces adapters for video games that allow players to swing golf clubs and baseball bats or ride skateboards and exercise bikes. ''Basically we've brought physicality to video games,'' said Mr. Albanna, demonstrating a golf ball suspended from the arm of a small device that is packed with electronic sensors and coordinated with a golf instructional video showing a broad green fairway. 
 When a player swings at the ball, the device indicates instantly how far the shot would go and whether it would slice or hook. The living room duffer can fantasize playing with Tiger Woods.
 Mr. Albanna, who came to the United States from Egypt at age 17 and earned a business degree from California State University, San Bernardino, founded Qmotions three years ago with the help of $1 million from angel, or early-stage, investors in Riverside. He is now working with a forum of executives from technology companies and engineering professors at the University of California, Riverside.
 ''I like the personal side of the Inland Empire,'' Mr. Albanna said. ''People enjoy helping each other do business.'' 
 With the increasing number of high-tech workers and companies, ''the Inland Empire is passing into a new stage in its development,'' said John Husing, an economist who studies the region, which is almost as large as the whole of New England. 
 Colours in Motion illustrates aspects of the region's changes and even more the drive of an entrepreneurial business. The company, which makes wheelchairs for playing tennis, basketball and other sports as well as everyday use, was founded in 1992 by John Box, its president and a paraplegic from a motorcycle accident at age 17. 
 ''After the accident I figured I'd better go to school,'' said Mr. Box, who earned degrees in business and in metallurgical engineering from California State University, Fullerton, in Orange County. 
 Unable to persuade a manufacturer to adapt his wheelchair so he could improve his tennis game, Mr. Box modified the chair himself, then did the same for other disabled athletes and started Colours -- using the British-style spelling, he explained, ''because we like to be different.''
 Today, the company has grown to sales of more than $2 million or 2,000 chairs a year and 16 employees, the majority of whom use wheelchairs. It has just moved to new premises in Corona in Riverside County, he said, ''because it is more convenient for disabled employees'' who live in the region because of its affordable housing. 
 An inspiring business can also be a tough one. The relatively tiny Colours is pressed by price competition from large wheelchair manufacturers and by bill-paring medical insurance providers. Still, Mr. Box is obtaining financing to develop a chair with greater abilities.
 ''We're the leader,'' Mr. Box said. ''We come up with new features and we cheer when we see others follow. We have to keep innovating.''
 If small firms succeed and grow, there is a considerable ripple effect on the regional and national economy. A granddaddy of Inland Empire development demonstrates that effect. The Environmental Systems Research Institute was founded 37 years ago by Jack Dangermond, an entrepreneur who studied computer mapping at Harvard University and came home to Redlands, in San Bernardino County, to put his new learning to use.
 The institute started out with satellite maps developed by NASA and military services. It combined the maps with other data, like real estate records and wind and tide statistics, to develop software systems that could analyze land-use planning, help business decisions on plant locations and even predict the paths and effects of oil spills and hurricanes. Today its systems track outbreaks of bird flu. 
 The institute grew steadily through changes in technology, from minicomputers to workstations to desktop computers. It has 300,000 customers worldwide, more than $600 million in annual revenue and 2,900 employees -- 1,500 of them at headquarters in Redlands. 
 It has become a national source of geographic information. The institute helped New York get its bearings with specialized maps and data after 9/11; 600 of its software customers helped the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina. It has spawned small companies working in aspects of its technology, and given rise to research centers in geographic studies at the University of Redlands, at Harvard and at the nearby Loma Linda University Adventist Health Sciences Center. 
 Now it is about to start what Mr. Dangermond calls its ''biggest effort ever,'' an interactive Internet edition of its geographic information systems. Customers, he says, ''will post their specific applications on the global system, creating a cumulative, growing base of knowledge.''
 In the 19th century with refrigerated rail car technology, the Inland Empire brought California citrus fruit to the national market. Today the region brings knowledge to the global economy.

HEADLINE: A Contrarian Look at Whether U.S. Chief Executives Are Overpaid

BYLINE: By Tyler Cowen. 
Tyler Cowen is professor of economics at George Mason University and is co-author of a blog, www.marginalrevolution.com. He can be reached at tcowen@gmu.edu.

 BODY:
FROM 1980 to 2003, the average compensation of an American chief executive at a top 500 company rose by a factor of about six. The average compensation for the chief executives of these top companies reached roughly $11 million a year, including the value of options. No other country pays so much. For instance, American chief executives received roughly four times what their Swedish counterparts in comparably sized companies did and 3.1 times that of a Japanese chief at a comparably sized company. 
 Not surprisingly, many people think the American executives are overpaid. Their salaries are set by corporate boards, often filled with insiders or friends. Salaries for the top executive are far from transparent, especially when stock options and complex compensation plans are used. Nor is pay always linked to performance. Kenneth L. Lay received a salary and bonus of more than $8 million plus perks in 2000, less than a year before Enron's collapse. 
But in a new paper, ''Why Has C.E.O. Pay Increased So Much?'' (http://ssrn.com/abstract=901826), the economists Xavier Gabaix of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Augustin Landier of the Stern School of Business at New York University offer a contrarian view. They suggest that the higher salaries for chief executives can largely be explained by increases in the value of the stock market. Viewed as a whole, these salaries are a result of competitive pressures rather than the exploitation of shareholders.
 Their core argument is simple. If we look at recent history, compensation for executives has risen with the market capitalization of the largest companies. For instance, from 1980 to 2003, the average value of the top 500 companies rose by a factor of six. Two commonly used indexes of chief executive compensation show close to a proportional sixfold matching increase (the correlation coefficients are 0.93 and 0.97, respectively; 1.0 would be a perfect match). 
 So how does this argument work? Better executive decisions create more economic value. If the number of big companies is greater than the number of good chief executives, competitive bidding will push up pay to reflect the value of the talent. 
 As Professors Gabaix and Landier predict, chief executives' salaries in different sectors are higher when the capitalization of that sector is higher. A stronger sector means more bidders for a chief executive of a particular kind; an executive who has run one car company can go run another. Chief executives in large industries, therefore, receive more, even after adjusting for the size of their current companies. Business services, computers and banking turn up as exceptions for this comparison; their top executives are overpaid relative to what market capitalization alone would imply. Perhaps chief executives can add more value in more dynamic sectors.
 The authors are still working on their international comparisons; it is difficult to compare compensation across countries. But the preliminary results suggest that the total value of the companies in the sector helps predict how chief executives' salaries vary from country to country. Executives of large companies in France have fewer outside opportunities in comparable companies than their American counterparts and they thus receive less compensation, in this case by a factor of 2.4 to 1. 
 The approach of Professors Gabaix and Landier to executive compensation is influenced by their French background. In the United States, the popular debate turns on merit -- whether chief executives are worth the money. In Europe, where inequality is less socially acceptable, the popular debate concerns whether anyone could possibly deserve so much money. This perspective led Professors Gabaix and Landier to focus on explaining the overall level of executive compensation, opening up a new approach to the problem.
 The two also find that the best chief executives do not seem to have much more talent than other chief executives in what they define as the top 250. By their calculations, replacing the No. 250 chief executive with the No. 1 will increase the value of the company by only 0.014 percent. The No. 1 chief executive receives much more compensation, but that is mostly because he manages a larger company and thus his talent has a longer reach. That is another way of thinking about why the same chief executive will make more money in a larger marketplace or in a larger country.
 The Gabaix-Landier argument does not cover all objections. We do not have adequate data for longer stretches of American history. There are important cultural differences across countries. Lucian A. Bebchuk of Harvard Law School, a leading critic of chief executives' pay, argues in response to the paper that pay remains insensitive to performance, that high executive pay is correlated with bad corporate governance and that chief executives take great care to hide their true compensation. For those reasons, he does not believe that executive pay is driven by productivity. 
 In any case, the debate over chief executives' salaries has moved a step forward. Yes, there are numerous examples of corporate malfeasance. But it is not obvious that the American system of executive pay -- taken as a whole -- is excessive or broken. The critics contend that chief executives cheat public shareholders. But private equity typically pays its top executives very well, even though public shareholders are not a factor. Furthermore, the rate of productivity growth in the United States has been the envy of the world. Chief executives must be doing something right.
 The growth in executive compensation reflects how much more is at stake in American companies. Is not the real question which policies and institutions have led to this explosion of value?

HEADLINE: Hotel Labor Issue Clouds Hartford's Redevelopment

BYLINE: By ALEJANDRO LAZO

 BODY:
With its marble lobby, nightclub, rooftop gym, luxury suites and expansive views of the lush, green Connecticut River valley, the new Marriott Hotel in Hartford offers a taste of the hip and the cool in a capital city still struggling with high poverty and empty storefronts.
 Because the 409-room hotel adjoins the state's new $275 million convention center, the two properties are considered the linchpin of the state's ambitious plan to remake Hartford's downtown. 
Now, nearly nine months after the hotel opened and 11 months after the Connecticut Convention Center began holding events, a complicated dispute involving the city, a union and the hotel's developer threatens to undermine the state's efforts.
 The Connecticut Conference of the United Church of Christ, the largest Protestant congregation in the state, has vowed not to hold events at the center as long as the dispute continues. Several important local groups have urged the Waterford Group, the hotel's majority stakeholder and manager of the convention center, to resolve the disagreement. 
 And the state's Democratic Party has abandoned plans to hold its statewide nominating convention there this weekend. 
 The impact on bookings troubles the state officials who are charged with overseeing the state's investment in the development, known as Adriaen's Landing.
 ''The state has invested a lot of money, and we are sort of at a juncture here,'' said Michael Cicchetti, assistant director of the Capital City Economic Development Authority. ''We don't want it all thrown away because one union has said 'our way or we go to war.' ''
 The dispute does not concern salaries or benefits. Nor is it about whether the workers can unionize. Rather, it concerns whether the developer must abide by a Hartford ordinance that requires developers of city-subsidized projects to sign an agreement with any union seeking to organize workers promising that there will be no strikes, boycotts or pickets.
 The idea behind such an accord is to ensure that the city's investments will not be derailed, or slowed, by protracted labor disputes, according to Matthew J. Hennessy, the chief of staff for Mayor Eddie A. Perez. ''The reason for labor peace is simple: If the city is an investor and partner in a development, we don't want our investment degraded,'' Mr. Hennessy said, adding that labor discord ''hurts the viability of the project.''
 But Len Wolman, the chief executive of the Waterford Group, has refused to sign a labor peace agreement with Unite Here, a hotel and restaurant workers' union that wants to represent Marriott workers. He argues that the ordinance does not apply to his hotel.
 While it was under construction, the hotel was exempt from city rules under a state law intended to expedite the project. And now that the hotel is up and running, he has argued, it should not be considered a ''development project'' under the ordinance that requires the labor peace accord.
 The city disagrees. City officials say that any project that receives $100,000 or more in subsidies from the city is bound by the ordinance, whether the project is in development or operating. 
 City officials have shown they are willing to play hardball. Mr. Wolman's organization received 15 years of property tax abatements as an incentive to build the hotel, in a deal that the mayor's office estimates is worth as much as $30 million. The city has threatened to revoke the tax abatements if Mr. Wolman fails to comply with the local law. ''We don't intend to look the other way,'' Mr. Perez said. ''The law is the law.''
 On March 28, the city gave the Waterford Group 30 days to sign a labor peace agreement with the union. Mr. Wolman responded by asking the National Labor Relations Board to conduct a secret-ballot election to determine whether workers want to be represented by the union. The board turned down Mr. Wolman, who filed an appeal on Tuesday. 
 Union officials do not want their options limited to a secret-ballot election. ''We're open to many ways of resolving the labor peace ordinance,'' said Anthony Dugdale, a senior research analyst for Unite Here.
 Though he declined to discuss other organizing approaches, unions are increasingly turning to a card check process in which companies grant recognition once a majority of workers sign cards saying they favor a union. Many businesses oppose card checks because they say the procedure makes it much easier for unions to secure majority support.
 With the 30-day deadline for Mr. Wolman to sign the labor accord having passed, Mayor Perez said that he was ''considering all his options,'' but that he did not want to say more because litigation was likely.

HEADLINE: Civic Pride and Volunteerism Bring Allure Back to Riverside Park

BYLINE: By TONI WHITT

 BODY:
Twenty years ago, Riverside Park was a forlorn and perilous slice of Upper Manhattan. 
 People who used it knew to leave by dusk, when drug dealers and prostitutes moved in. A playground at 91st Street was a homeless encampment. Graffiti covered seemingly everything, even Grant's Tomb. A hillside on the park's northern end was a graveyard for the skeletons of stolen cars, and the air was often pungent with the smell of decaying dog carcasses.
 ''The area where they used to shoot up was so bad,'' recalled Jenny Benitez, 73, who has lived on Riverside Drive for 44 years. ''There was no fence there, and the users would just slide down the hill.'' 
 It was hardly the vision Frederick Law Olmsted had in mind when he designed the park in the 1870's to give people access to the water and a bit of serenity. Today, even a quick stroll shows how much has changed at Riverside over the years. 
 Where cardboard boxes and plywood lean-tos used by the homeless once stood around 138th Street, Mrs. Benitez and others tend garden boxes filled with lettuce, basil, tomatoes and flowers. Near 122nd Street, bird watchers look for the abundant species that stop on their migratory travels in an area of the park where a 23-year-old jogger was raped and beaten in 1985. The 91st Street playground is filled with children who cool off in water fountains near the flowers that cover the area once littered with hypodermic needles. 
 It is a striking transformation that began around a kitchen table where a group of residents decided to reclaim a space they considered their front yard. ''It became obvious that if we wanted to make something happen, we had to do it ourselves,'' said Mary Frances Shaughnessy, 61, who attended that first meeting. 
 Those informal gatherings were the beginning of the Riverside Park Fund, which is marking its 20th anniversary this year with an art exhibition scattered across the 330 acres of what is now one of the city's jewels. 
 ''It was a struggle,'' Milton Norman, 80, the chairman emeritus of the park fund, said of the group's start. ''I used to stay up nights worrying about having enough money to pay the executive director.'' 
 Early on, the group realized it had to raise money and recruit volunteers to do the work long neglected by New York City as it dealt with a financial crisis. Information about the fund and requests for donations were mailed to nearby residents. For its first project, the fund decided to do something that would benefit everyone living along the park's four-mile stretch from 65th to 155th Streets, so emergency call boxes were installed and fencing was repaired, said Pamela Tice, one of the group's founders. 
 Reviving the park, Ms. Shaughnessy said, ''involved a lot of different neighborhoods and involved bringing a lot of different people together who normally wouldn't have had contact.''
 Volunteers cleaned the park and hauled in soil to help fill in erosion. People with expertise in fields like horticulture and botany helped recruit and train other volunteers. 
 ''In the first years volunteers were picking up trash and needles,'' said James T. Dowell, the president of the Riverside Park Fund. ''We've moved far beyond that.''
 The fund encouraged local groups to adopt different parts of the park to care for, and in the first 10 years roughly 40 spots were taken. One group maintained the clay tennis courts, others looked after the playgrounds and a community garden group took responsibility for beautifying the park's northern section. 
 In the early years, volunteers brought their own tools and lugged buckets of water from their homes because there was no running water. Garden hoses were dragged into the park across Riverside Drive. Mrs. Benitez, who is a volunteer outreach coordinator for the fund, remembers attaching a hose to a faucet in her home, throwing it over her balcony and dragging it down the hill to the park. The fund has since installed an underground irrigation system covering much of the park, and the Riverside Drive rampart at 138th Street is used as a tool shed. 
 The buzz of civic involvement also put pressure on the city to do more in the park. The Parks Department continues to provide basic maintenance and trash pickup, but in recent years it has helped finance larger projects, like putting artificial turf on the ball fields. And for the past five years, the city has been working on connecting Riverside to its southern neighbor, Hudson River Park.
 Adrian Benepe, the parks commissioner, grew up and lives on the Upper West Side, so he remembers Riverside's decline. ''We despaired that anything would ever get better,'' he said. ''Then bit by bit neighbors started to organize.'' 
 Today the park has so many concerned constituents that changes tend to spur heated discussions. In recent years two projects in particular stirred debate, the one to put artificial turf on heavily used ball fields at 103rd Street and 107th Street, and another to pave a dirt path extending north and south from the Firemen's Memorial at 100th Street. 
 ''Now you see the park and it's full of people,'' said Ms. Shaughnessy, who still volunteers with the park fund even though she now lives in Midtown. 
 Mr. Norman said that despite its annual budget of nearly $2 million, the Riverside Park Fund is still at heart a grass-roots organization. 
 ''We've redone every playground, and have a lot of irrigation, but our pride and joy is our volunteer force,'' he said. ''We put 350 to 400 people in the park. It remains a neighborhood park.''

HEADLINE: Richard Stengel Is Chosen To Be Top Editor at Time

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
Richard Stengel, a long-time writer and editor at Time magazine and the former head of its Web site, was named its managing editor yesterday, the 16th person to hold the job in the magazine's 83-year history.
 Mr. Stengel, 51, will oversee the newsweekly, which has a circulation of four million, and its Web site, Time.com, which draws more than three million unique visitors a month, a number that has grown by more than 33 percent this year. 
 Mr. Stengel said yesterday that in some ways, the Internet poses the same kind of challenge to newsweeklies that the plethora of competing newspapers posed to Time when Henry Luce founded it in 1923.
 ''In a similar way, people were looking for one source to speak with authority and explain the world, and in many ways, that's still our mission,'' Mr. Stengel said. ''We can be your guide through the forest of confusing information.''
 Melding the magazine with the Web, he said, ''will be a big, big part of what I'm going to have to do.'' 
 Mr. Stengel succeeds Jim Kelly, 52, who is moving to a newly created position of managing editor of the entire magazine company, Time Inc.
 Mr. Kelly and Mr. Stengel are longtime friends, having met in a writing class taught by John McPhee at Princeton in the mid-1970's. Mr. Stengel, who is president of the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, is to move into Mr. Kelly's office on June 15.
 The appointment ends two weeks of speculation over who would get one of the most prestigious jobs in publishing. Attention centered on several journalists outside the Time family, including Tina Brown, the former editor of Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, and Jacob Weisberg, the editor of Slate.
 John Huey, Time Inc.'s editor in chief, had decided in November to move Mr. Kelly, who had served as editor of Time for more than five years, to a position in which he is to concentrate on standards and ethics at all Time Inc. publications. 
 Mr. Huey then spent the next several months talking to scores of journalists about what the magazine needed and later, about whether some of them were interested. Acting as his chief consultant in the search was Daniel Okrent, the former public editor of The New York Times and the former editor at large of Time Inc. and managing editor of Life magazine.
 ''This has been a long process and one that I obviously took very seriously,'' Mr. Huey said. ''There's a great deal at stake. I had a lot of help from people who ended up not getting the job and I hope they don't feel exploited.''
 Among those he met with were Michael Kinsley, former editor of the editorial page of The Los Angeles Times and former editor of Slate, and the current editor of Slate, Mr. Weisberg. 
 He met with Mr. Stengel several times and had lengthy, Socratic discussions about the news and the magazine and finally decided that Mr. Stengel was ''the one who brought everything to the table.''
 Mr. Huey said that despite reports that he was looking for someone who could expand the magazine's coverage of celebrities, ''I never had any idea of blowing the thing up into something weird or strange.''
 Mr. Stengel, a Rhodes Scholar who grew up in New York, started with Time in 1981, becoming a senior writer and covering the 1988 and 1996 presidential campaigns. In 1999, he left the magazine to write speeches for Bill Bradley, a fellow Princeton graduate, in Mr. Bradley's failed bid for the Democratic nomination for president. He returned to Time to run Time.com and also served as nation editor and culture editor. 
 The author of several books, Mr. Stengel collaborated with Nelson Mandela on Mr. Mandela's autobiography, ''Long Walk to Freedom,'' and helped produce a documentary, ''Mandela,'' which was nominated for an Oscar in 1996.
 Since 2004, Mr. Stengel has been the president and chief executive of the National Constitution Center, a nonprofit and nonpartisan museum and education center on Independence Mall in Philadelphia. The center teaches the importance of the Constitution and civic engagement.
 Following Time tradition, his appointment was announced with some suspense. Three chairs were set up at the front of a room full of Time employees -- one with Mr. Huey's name, one with Mr. Kelly's name and the third with a question mark.
 Two other Time executives walked into the room but did not sit in the chair, adding to the drama. Then Mr. Huey and Mr. Kelly appeared, followed by Mr. Stengel.
 ''It's Rick Stengel!'' someone in the room blurted out, leading to an outbreak of applause.
 One Time staffer said the main reactions were shock and relief -- shock because Mr. Stengel's name had not been mentioned prominently and he was not perceived as ''an inside-the-organization power player,'' and relief because the new editor was familiar with the Time culture and the challenges it faces.
 Mr. Huey said the applause was so vigorous that he decided not to deliver his prepared remarks. ''I thought, Why mess this up?'' he said. ''I'll quit while I'm ahead.''

Two Investigative Reporters Leave
 Donald Barlett and James Steele, two investigative reporters who have chronicled the vicissitudes of the American economy for Time magazine since 1997, have lost their jobs in a budget squeeze.
 The reporting duo, who together won two Pulitzer Prizes and two national magazine awards, were on the payroll of Time Inc. Their jobs were among about 650 that the company has eliminated in the last six months. 
 John Huey, editor in chief of Time Inc., said that as he cut corporate costs, he sought unsuccessfully to place the two men on the payroll of a company magazine.
 ''They're very good but very expensive, and I couldn't get anyone to take them on their budget,'' Mr. Huey said. ''We'll miss their work.''
 Mr. Steele, 63, who began working with Mr. Barlett, 69, at The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1971, said: ''We've had a great run at Time, but apparently the decision was made at the corporate level not to fund this kind of work.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Hopes to Block Candidate as Extreme

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY and JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
Prominent New York Republicans took steps yesterday to derail John Faso's bid for the party nomination for governor by assailing him as an extremist conservative who would drag down the entire Republican slate in the November elections.
 The onslaught against Mr. Faso, a former assemblyman, could help prepare the way for a major development, several New York Republicans said: Gov. George E. Pataki's endorsement of another candidate, William F. Weld.
These Republicans, who are close to Mr. Pataki, said he would like to endorse Mr. Weld but could do so only if Mr. Faso was seen by Republican voters as an out-of-touch extremist who would not win enough support from moderates and women to beat the likely Democratic nominee for governor, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. These Republicans were granted anonymity to disclose political strategy that they were not authorized to discuss publicly. 
 ''While the governor thinks John has been an outstanding candidate, he has significant concerns about his voting record and the ability to raise the funds to overcome it,'' a Republican close to the governor said. But, this Republican cautioned, ''It is incumbent upon the Weld campaign to talk to party leaders throughout the state.'' 
 The attacks on Mr. Faso's conservative record have been unfolding for days now, at the same time as his campaign has picked up steam with important endorsements and a rise in the polls. Those attacks intensified yesterday when Republicans released a letter from William L. DeProspo, the party chairman in Orange County, to other Republican leaders criticizing Mr. Faso's voting record in the Assembly. 
 Republicans said that if the attacks on Mr. Faso succeeded, Mr. Pataki might announce in the coming days that he was urging voters to support Mr. Weld for governor and, perhaps, Mr. Faso as his running mate.
 Joseph L. Bruno, the majority leader in the Senate, said yesterday that he wanted both Mr. Weld and Mr. Faso on the ticket in November, an idea advanced by other Republicans eager to present a united front. Mr. Bruno sidestepped a question about which one he preferred as the candidate for governor. 
 ''I think that what they'd have to do is flip a coin, and I would be happy to flip it for them,'' Mr. Bruno said. When asked which way he hoped the coin would land, he said, ''I would hope that it would stay on its edge.'' 
 Mr. Bruno's fence-sitting could indicate that he is less worried than are the Republicans attacking Mr. Faso. Those Republicans, who include county chairmen and some political advisers to Mr. Pataki, see Mr. Faso's conservatism -- specifically, his opposition to abortion rights and gay marriage -- as political poison for other Republican candidates this November.
 For instance, the Republican candidate for attorney general, Jeanine F. Pirro, supports abortion rights and is counting on votes from women and from moderate and liberal Republicans; so are several moderate Republican candidates for the State Senate, where Mr. Bruno leads an eight-vote majority. If Mr. Faso is at the top of the ticket and the Democrats emphasize his conservatism on social issues this fall, the thinking goes, he may alienate or discourage voters that Ms. Pirro and others need.
 ''Every Republican candidate in this state will suffer the consequences if we run an out-of-touch candidate like John Faso as our standard-bearer this November,'' Mr. DeProspo wrote in his letter to Republican leaders. 
 Mr. DeProspo said he sent the letter on Tuesday, mindful that several important counties, including Nassau and Suffolk, had yet to endorse either candidate publicly, and he wanted Mr. Faso's record to be known. 
 The letter outlines Mr. Faso's voting record on several bills under headings like ''votes against women,'' ''votes against honoring civil rights,'' and ''votes against education.'' In some instances, Mr. Faso was the only member of the Assembly to vote against the legislation.
 In 2002, for example, he voted against a bill for ''comparable worth'' that would have required equal pay for men and women by setting pay scales for jobs in the private sector. (The bill was passed only by the Democratic-controlled Assembly and never became law.) In 1994, Mr. Faso voted against a bill that would have provided more educational services, like bus transportation, for homeless children. 
 Mr. Faso stood by his record yesterday and dismissed the attacks as ''orchestration'' from his opponent. He said the ''comparable worth'' proposals were discredited by many serious economists.
 ''It means that I was the only one who really understood the issue and had the political gumption to vote against some nice-sounding but some thoroughly discredited idea,'' Mr. Faso said. ''I have a pretty consistent record of being honest with how I voted and why I voted.''

HEADLINE: New Official Named in Push To Rebuild Ground Zero

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Eager to show progress after months of squabbling over the memorial and commercial development at ground zero, Gov. George E. Pataki moved quickly yesterday to replace John C. Whitehead, the former banker who headed the state authority in charge of rebuilding downtown.
 The governor said he had appointed Kevin M. Rampe as the chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the same organization he once served as president, to complete the design guidelines for the 16-acre World Trade Center site and to coordinate the redesign and construction of the memorial by Sept. 9, 2009. Last week, Mr. Whitehead, 84, announced that he was stepping down at the end of the month. 
Mr. Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg also said yesterday that they had asked Frank Sciame, a builder and developer, to convene yet another downtown committee, to ensure that a proper memorial is built within the $500 million budget recently imposed by the state and the city. The World Trade Center Memorial Foundation's latest estimate had put the cost at nearly $1 billion.
 The committee, which includes the architects Michael Arad, Peter Walker, J. Max Bond Jr. and Daniel Libeskind, will work on refining a budget and a design by June 15 with the development corporation, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the memorial foundation. This formally takes the design out of the foundation's hands, a move that drew some criticism yesterday. 
 The announcements came a day before Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver was to convene a state hearing at 7 World Trade Center to look into the lack of progress and coordination in rebuilding Lower Manhattan, more than four years after 9/11.
 At the same time that hearing begins, the governor and the mayor are scheduled to hold a 10:30 a.m. news conference at 1 Hudson Street to announce that Sears, Roebuck & Company has moved 80 product designers there from Chelsea. The employees moved in last week.
 Mr. Silver said yesterday that it was unclear exactly how much progress had been made in rebuilding at ground zero. 
 He said it now looked like the cornerstone the governor laid for the Freedom Tower almost two years ago would have to be moved. He also said he would ask state and city officials to explain the deal they recently completed with the developer Larry A. Silverstein, and exactly when two towers damaged on 9/11 -- the Deutsche Bank building and Fitterman Hall -- would finally be demolished.
 ''The purpose of my hearing,'' Mr. Silver said, ''is to put all these quote-unquote announcements in perspective. There's been a bumbling of everything that goes on down there. There's been a floating blame game. But there's still a hole in the ground with nothing sticking out.''
 Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff and Mr. Silverstein, who has an agreement to build three office towers at ground zero, are scheduled to testify this morning. Charles A. Gargano, the state's chief economic development official; Stefan Pryor, the president of the development corporation; and Kenneth J. Ringler Jr., the Port Authority's executive director, are to testify in the afternoon.
 Mayor Bloomberg and Thomas S. Johnson, chairman of the memorial foundation's executive committee, endorsed the choice of Mr. Rampe. 
 ''I am humbled by the opportunity to play a small part in bringing back Lower Manhattan,'' said Mr. Rampe, an insurance company official. 
 The governor said that Mr. Rampe ''brings the dedication, experience, energy and insight necessary to keep the momentum going on the reconstruction of the World Trade Center and the revitalization of downtown.''
 Officials said that Mr. Sciame, chairman of the F. J. Sciame Construction Company, and his committee would present the mayor and the governor with refined design proposals for the memorial by June 15, then public comments would be solicited. The development corporation plans to adopt a final design in July so that construction can begin by Sept. 11.
 That announcement drew some fire yesterday. ''Governor Pataki and Mayor Bloomberg have lost their compass,'' said Monica Iken, who, like Mr. Rampe, is a board member of the foundation. ''They're returning to the practice of railroading the memorial process for a political agenda.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: June 3, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article in some copies on May 18 about the appointment of Kevin M. Rampe as chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which is overseeing the rebuilding of downtown, misspelled the name of a building damaged on 9/11. (The error was repeated in an article in some copies on May 19 about the progress on rebuilding at ground zero.) It is Fiterman Hall, not Fitterman.

HEADLINE: House Passes a $2.7 Trillion Spending Plan

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Thursday May 19 

 BODY:
After more than a month of delay as Republicans feuded among themselves, the House early Thursday narrowly approved a $2.7 trillion spending plan for next year.
 The vote, 218 to 210, came at 1 a.m. after Republican moderates dropped threats to withhold support unless they received commitments to add $3 billion for education, health and community-development block grants. In a nod to the moderates, House leaders included a statement ''recognizing'' that those programs should receive more than President Bush had requested if savings could be found in other areas.
 The vote occurred hours after President Bush signed a bill extending his signature tax cuts. 
 Meanwhile, House and Senate Republicans continued to haggle over how to extend a long list of other expiring tax breaks, including a deduction for college tuition payments and a savings credit for low-income families, that were left out of the bill that Mr. Bush signed in the White House Rose Garden.
 The fights over taxes and spending highlighted the extent to which Mr. Bush and the Congress have become increasingly bogged down on their long-term goals. The struggles are largely over one- and two-year extensions of tax breaks rather than the permanent tax reductions or broader overhaul of the tax cut sought by Mr. Bush, and over comparatively tiny slices of total spending.
 The $70 billion bill that Mr. Bush signed would extend his 2003 tax cuts on stock dividends and capital gains for an extra two years, to 2010, and shield 15 million taxpayers for one more year from a big increase in the alternative minimum tax.
 The House spending resolution, though largely symbolic, would set broad limits on spending for next year and nonbinding goals for the next five years. 
 The measure calls for increasing military spending by 7 percent, to nearly $558 billion in 2007, a figure that includes $50 billion for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The package would essentially freeze or cut spending on most domestic discretionary programs, including education, energy and national parks, and it calls for trimming $6.8 billion over five years from entitlement programs like Medicaid and farm subsidies. 
 The plan would raise the debt ceiling by $653 billion, to $9.6 trillion, and it assumes that the shortfall next year will be $348 billion, about what it is likely to be in 2006.
 Democrats argued that the measure would put the burden of budget cuts primarily on poor and middle-class people, as the benefits would flow primarily to the wealthy. 
 Few lawmakers expected to work out differences between their bill and the spending plan that the Senate passed in March. A failure by House Republicans to pass even their own plan would accentuate their disarray on fiscal issues at a time their public approval ratings, even on issues like taxes, are plunging.
 A failure to approve a House spending bill would also have practical consequences, because it would give lawmakers more opportunities to add provisions on the floor and exceed the overall spending limits that Mr. Bush has demanded.
 As House Republican leaders worked through the day on Thursday to win over party moderates, Mr. Bush celebrated the limited extension of his tax cuts for investors, small businesses and big financial companies with overseas operations.
 Surrounded by Republican leaders and Vice President Dick Cheney as he signed the measure, Mr. Bush again said the cuts were crucial to the long-term health of the economy.
 ''The American people have used their money better than the government ever could have,'' Mr. Bush said. ''They've used the tax relief to provide for their families and create jobs and help the American economy become the envy of the industrialized world.''
 The House spending plan calls for $228 billion in tax cuts over the next five years, mostly extensions of tax breaks that are set to expire. 
 The struggle for House Republicans on Wednesday was to keep total discretionary spending, which includes the Pentagon budget, at $873 billion for 2007 while satisfying demands from Republican moderates for an extra $3 billion on health and education programs.
 Moderates, led by Representative Michael N. Castle of Delaware, had already persuaded leaders to shift $4 billion from military spending. House Republican leaders tried to persuade Mr. Castle and other moderates to settle for a promise to channel any additional savings to community-development block grants, schools and police programs.
