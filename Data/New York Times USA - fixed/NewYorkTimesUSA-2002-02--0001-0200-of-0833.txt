HEADLINE: FORUM IN NEW YORK: ALTERNATIVE FORUM; 
Bigger Crowd Urges a Focus On Social Ills

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: PORTO ALEGRE, Brazil, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
While the world's elite set to talking at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York, thousands of the most vocal critics of globalization are here at the World Social Forum, a counterweight to the discussions on Park Avenue.
 More than 14,000 delegates have arrived, four times the crowd in New York, to discuss how to attack global capitalism. Another 25,000 people came to attend parallel events, demonstrations and fringe meetings, some directed against the agenda of this meeting. 
 In contrast to last year, the six-day event began with a drift toward the center. Citing the pacifist underpinnings of this year's theme, "Another World Is Possible," organizers refused entry to groups that use violence, like the Basque separatist group E.T.A. and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. 
But they also barred "neo-liberal elements," including World Bank officials and Guy Verhofstadt, the Belgian prime minister, from taking part in workshops. Mr. Verhofstadt has criticized antiglobalization movements, the organizers said.
"We want a peaceful gathering of participants who agree that the actual system of global capitalism has lost legitimacy," said Oded Grajew, one of the Brazilian organizers. "I doubt that we're on the same page as the World Bank." 
Leading leftist figures like Noam Chomsky of M.I.T. and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the presidential candidate of Brazil's Workers Party, held news conferences to open the six-day event, but most attendees focused on easygoing conversation with counterparts from more than 100 countries in the cafes and gardens of the sprawling Pontifical Catholic University, where the workshops are being held.
"A new pragmatism is emerging about what can be done to mitigate the effects of globalization," said Maria Ivanova, a delegate from Bulgaria who focuses on the environmental. "I'm here more than anything to form a bond with people who can eventually wield influence over important policy decisions."
Mario Soares, the former president of Portugal; Rigoberta Menchu, the Guatemalan Nobel laureate; and Danielle Mitterrand, widow of the late French president, are among the luminaries here.
George Soros, who shares some of the delegates' concerns, considered attending but decided his presence might be disruptive, said Michael Vachon, a spokesman for Mr. Soros.
In contrast to the $25,000 needed to take part in the World Economic Forum, this meeting charges delegates about $50. Participants dressed for balmy summer weather in shorts and sandals. The relaxed atmosphere extended to the themes of some workshops, like "Samba as an Instrument of Resistance and Fighting Racism," or "Sex, Lies and Business."
In some ways, the forum has a French flavor, although organizers said the second-largest nationality in attendance after Brazilians are Italians. Three French presidential candidates, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, Noel Mamere and Olivier Besancenot, are here, as well as six ministers and representatives of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and President Jacques Chirac.
Last year the French agricultural activist Jose Bove stole the show when he was arrested for ripping genetically modified soybeans out of the ground at a nearby agricultural laboratory operated by Monsanto. Mr. Bove is here this year, too, though he is keeping a low profile after promising organizers he would not do anything illegal. 
The forum's centrist tilt is not endorsed by everyone here. Some 300 homeless families connected to Brazil's National Shelter Struggle occupied an abandoned 14-story building in the old city center today, draping the movement's red flags out of broken windows.
"The World Social Forum is reformist economically, traditionalist politically and conformist socially," said Moesio Reboucas, one of Brazil's first antiglobalization organizers. Mr. Reboucas said he was especially critical of the role played by socialist politicians at the forum.
About $1.5 million of state and municipal subsidies allowed the forum to be held here, a city of 1.2 million people. For much of the last decade, leftist mayors from Brazil's Workers Party have governed this industrial center, a drab cityscape of whitewashed high-rises and low-slung warehouses. It is the capital of Rio Grande do Sul, a state also governed by the Workers Party.
Fausto Bertinotti, the secretary general of the Communist Refoundation Party in Italy, said he was pleased to be in a Latin American city governed by the left. 
"The elite that are gathering today in New York share the mindset of the people at the I.M.F. who ruined Argentina," Mr. Bertinotti said. "They are a world away from us and what we are trying to do, which is to brainstorm for policies that are not a dead end for humanity." 
Few delegates expect concrete proposals to emerge here. Instead, many hope to contribute to a dialogue on ways to mitigate capitalism's ills.
Carlos Rodgrigues, the owner of a video-game store who watched several thousand people gather downtown today for a peaceful march, was surprised by the kaleidoscope of ideas and approaches.
But he added, "I don't know if we taxpayers should be subsidizing an opportunity for Europeans to come to the southern hemisphere in their winter."

HEADLINE: AUTOS ON FRIDAY/ SAFETY; 
Dummies Feel the Pain of New Rules

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich. 

 BODY:
THE government's crash-test dummy has given up his hard-living bachelor ways for family life.
 Automakers are grappling with a new battery of federal crash tests, to be phased in over the next decade. Those tests will require a family of dummies instead of the only federally required test dummy since the 1970's: a 5-foot-7, 165-pound model meant to represent the average guy. New tests will add dummy stand-ins for a small, slender woman, as well as for 1-, 3- and 6-year-olds. 
 These dummies don't sit up straight like proper ladies and gentlemen, but slouch more like real people. One new test will position a childlike dummy standing on the front passenger seat. Another has the child dummy kneeling in the front footwell, in front of the passenger seat, with its head right in front of the air bag -- a position that one engineer called "the worst-case scenario."
The tests are part of extensive modifications announced in May 2000 to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208, the regulation that governs occupant protection inside automobiles. The changes will be phased in from 2004 to 2010.
The tests aim, in part, to reduce the dangers that air bags pose to small children, who have been hurt and killed by the force of air bags' deploying, while preserving the bags' utility in the many situations where they can reduce injuries. And the new version of 208, as the standard is known, also aims to enhance protection for both belted and unbelted car occupants. That is a point of contention, because some automakers say that designing air bags that protect the unbelted may increase risks for those who heed the law and buckle up.
Companies like Ford and General Motors had already been working on next-generation technologies, using dummies of various sizes, but the 208 standard requires a rethinking of how seat belts and air bags interact with each other and with different sorts of people inside a car.
"It's the most comprehensive regulation we've seen relative to crashes," said James Khoury, manager of advanced safety engineering at G.M.
David Clark, a safety engineer at Ford, said, "You can imagine the number of test considerations and evaluations -- small occupants, belted or unbelted, middle-sized occupants, large occupants, all the different crash scenarios." He added, "Trying to pull that whole picture together and balance the system design so it's completely optimized for all these combinations -- it's a tremendous challenge."
Call it a holistic safety approach. Ford and G.M. are refining computerized safety brains that rapidly collect information from sensors all over the automobile. Some of these sensors are already on the road. This week, Ford had a press conference here to demonstrate its newer technologies as well as some still being developed.
The Ford Taurus is equipped with "dual stage" air bags, as are several G.M. vehicles, like the Chevrolet Impala, and a number of imported cars. The bags inflate in one of two ways: in some crashes, they are only half-filled, or not used at all, depending on how far forward the front seats are positioned and whether the seat belts are in use.
How is this done? Data is collected from sensors and transmitted to the restraints control module, which is bolted to the floor under the front seats and is the car's safety brain. G.M. calls its version the sensory and diagnostic module.
A first line of intelligence gathering is a crash-severity sensor near the front bumper that tells the brain the force of the crash. The Ford Windstar minivan also comes with a sensor that weighs the driver and front-seat passenger. And the Jaguar XK sports car has four infrared sensors that indicate how someone is leaning inside the car. Both G.M. and Ford are also considering digital cameras that track a person's movements during the flickering course of a crash.
Once the brain gathers this data, it can determine if the seat belts are being used and, if so, how forcefully they should restrain the occupant. It also decides whether the air bags should deploy, how much they should inflate and even at what point the steering column will collapse. Ford and G.M. are also working on technologies that would provide a range of inflation options for an air bag, beyond two settings, as well as tethers that alter how far out the air bag will protrude.
"By the end of the year, we'll have two million vehicles on the road with the personal safety system," said Sue Cischke, vice president for environmental and safety engineering at Ford, referring to the company's name for its newer safety technologies.
In recent years, Ford has been troubled by safety problems related to its Explorer sport utility. And this week, an Atlanta lawyer involved in a civil lawsuit raised questions about the fuel-tank design of Mustangs built in the mid-1990's. Ford vigorously defended the Mustang design.
At its safety press conference on Tuesday, the company accentuated the positive. Ford was the first automaker to participate in a government study of vehicles that use advanced air bag technology. Most of the first 60 accidents the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has studied involved the Taurus and its sister model, the Mercury Sable, though a few tests were done on the Honda Accord and other vehicles.
"The whole purpose was to preserve the tremendous benefit of air bags, but reduce some of the risks we saw in the first generation," said Rae Tyson, a spokesman for the highway safety administration.
He said the newer technologies appeared to be addressing some air bag problems, but it was too early in the study to draw definitive conclusions. "What we've seen so far is encouraging," he added.

HEADLINE: Harvard President Backs Raises for Low-Wage Staff; University Works to End Grade Inflation 

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
Moving to resolve an issue that has dogged the university for months, Harvard's president, Lawrence H. Summers, said today that he would support substantial raises for its janitors, gardeners, security guards and other low-wage workers. 
 Mr. Summers accepted the recommendations of a commission that called for base wages of $10.83 to $11.30 an hour. Out of 13,000 workers at Harvard, about 400 earn less than $10.25 an hour. Several hundred employees of outside subcontractors and temporary employees also make less than that; some are paid as little as $8.50 an hour. 
 The new pay rates, however, still fall short of the "living wage" that students and other protesters have demanded. They had estimated the "living wage" at $15 to $20 an hour to support a family in Boston.
The wage issue spurred the longest sit-in at a Harvard building, a three-week occupation last spring of the first floor of Massachusetts Hall, which houses the university president's office. About 40 students camped out outside the office of the president, then Neil L. Rudenstine.
Some 400 faculty members signed a letter supporting the protesters, and the students also won the support of the state's two United States senators, the Cambridge City Council and labor leaders. In response to the protests, Mr. Rudenstine appointed a 19-member commission.
The commission did not recommend, and Mr. Summers did not endorse, setting a fixed "living wage," and "living wage" advocates said they would continue their campaign. 
"Janitors at Harvard will still be making less than they made 10 years ago and won't even approach many other universities' wages," Minsu Longiaru, an organizer with the Harvard Workers' Center, said in a statement. 
"There's a lot of questions that still remain, and Larry Summers really needs to answer those questions and answer them pretty soon," said Arin Dube, another student protester.
Mr. Summers agreed with commission recommendations that the raises be negotiated through collective bargaining with unions. The initial wage increases are likely to cost several million dollars a year. 
In a statement, Mr. Summers said he also wanted to encourage scholarly work on "issues relating to income inequality and the challenges faced by lower wage workers."
Harvard also grappled this week with another contentious issue: grade inflation. About half of the grades awarded in recent years to Harvard students were either A's or A-'s. And 91 percent of seniors graduated with honors last June. 
For months, Mr. Summers has been talking with professors about grade inflation, urging them to curb it in their own classrooms.
On Wednesday, Harvard's dean for undergraduate education, Susan Pedersen, raised another proposal, that the university stop giving honors to students who earn only a B average. Dean Pedersen's proposal referred only to a student's overall grade-point average. It would still allow students with a B average to get honors if they do honors-caliber work in their major or concentration, including writing a thesis. 
If such a policy had been in place last year, about a quarter of the students who received honors would not have. Other Ivy League universities, including Princeton and Yale, give honors only for exemplary performance in a major, and some will give honors to a maximum of a third of graduating seniors.
Not everyone on the Harvard campus sees the issue as a clear-cut problem. Some faculty members and students say that grades may be higher at Harvard than they used to be because students are studying more to compete for jobs and graduate schools. They also say Harvard classes are smaller than they used to be, implying that teachers are devoting more time to each student. 
Brian R. Smith, a student who is a member of the undergraduate education committee, which received Dean Pedersen's proposal Wednesday, said he was not convinced that students are given honors too easily, or that Harvard is out of line with other Ivy League institutions. 
"What's the big deal about honors anyway?" he said. "Maybe it helps you with graduate school in the end, but the question is, are you getting a quality education at your school?"

HEADLINE: Panel of Politicians Is to Advise in Rebuilding 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation said yesterday that it had enlisted several high-ranking state and city political officials, as well as business and community leaders, as advisers in its effort to form a consensus on how to proceed with rebuilding Lower Manhattan.
 The development corporation had been expected to appoint four advisory councils representing various groups, including relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 attack, downtown businessmen, Lower Manhattan residents, and arts and cultural organizations. But in addition, the corporation announced yesterday a general advisory committee made up of political officials, business representatives and a labor leader. 
 The new appointments might dilute one of the primary criticisms leveled so far at the development corporation: that, with 7 of its 11 members appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki, its decisions may represent the governor's wishes but not those of city officials and residents. 
But the new general advisory committee adds another layer of oversight to the decision-making process for downtown redevelopment, threatening to slow what some critics have said is already a glacial pace in beginning the planning for a key part of the Lower Manhattan business district.
The new committee, which will be led by John C. Whitehead, includes Sheldon Silver, the state Assembly speaker; Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority leader; United States Representative Jerrold Nadler; City Council Speaker Gifford Miller; Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields; Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney; Deputy Mayor Dan Doctoroff; and the Senate minority leader, Martin Connor.
Also serving on the advisory panel will be Robert Douglass, chairman of the Downtown Alliance, a business improvement district for Lower Manhattan; Robert Catell, the chairman of the New York City Partnership, a group of business leaders; Dennis Hughes, the president of the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O.; and Charles Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, the parent organization of the Lower Manhattan group.
In a news release announcing the appointments yesterday, Mr. Whitehead called the advisory groups "an important vehicle for the public to participate in the revitalization of our great city."
A spokesman for the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation declined to offer further comment on the origins of the general advisory committee, which had not been mentioned in Mr. Whitehead's previous statements about the panels that the corporation would name.
The members of the general advisory committee will be able to serve on any of the four specialized advisory councils, each of which will include about a dozen members; two development corporation board members; and several ex officio members, including prominent clergy members, city officials and business leaders.
Some downtown residents who have already been active in efforts to help shape the redevelopment plans said they believed that the general advisory committee suffers from some of the same faults as the corporation itself.
"When I look at it from a neighborhood standpoint, the people who are working most directly with the neighborhood don't appear to have prominent positions on the list," said Beverly Willis, a co-chairwoman of Rebuilding Downtown, Our Town, a group of residents, small-business people, civic groups and others interested in the rebuilding effort.
One notable absence from the general advisory committee is Betsy Gotbaum, the public advocate, who in an interview last night said she was "obviously upset" that she was excluded from the group.
"That's the kind of thing I was elected by the people to do," Ms. Gotbaum said. "A lot of people who live in the areas near ground zero and Battery Park City are confused and frankly don't necessarily trust what they are hearing" about issues involving the redevelopment effort.

HEADLINE: McGreevey Says Republicans Enacted 'Fraudulent' Budget 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
Using his harshest language yet to assign blame for New Jersey's budget deficit, Gov. James E. McGreevey today accused his Republican predecessors of brushing aside warnings of the oncoming recession last summer and enacting steep spending increases in a budget he called "fraudulent." 
 Mr. McGreevey, who has spent his first two weeks in office trying to contend with budget gaps estimated at $2.9 billion this year and $6 billion for the fiscal year beginning July 1, compared former Governor Christie Whitman and Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco to executives of the Enron Corporation, who are accused of concealing the company's bleak financial situation until it declared bankruptcy in December. 
 Speaking before a meeting of the Associated Press Managing Editors Association, Mr. McGreevey used an assortment of props, charts and internal Treasury Department memos to argue that his Republican predecessors had knowingly deceived state residents and continued to adopt costly tax rebates and spending initiatives even as economists cautioned that the state's revenues were likely to drop significantly.
As a result, Mr. McGreevey said, the state now faces a budget shortfall of 12 percent this year and 25 percent next year, which will force painful cuts in spending.
"What happened here was a disgrace," he said. "Those in power throughout the last year saddled the people in New Jersey with what you might call an Enron budget. They cooked the books, they hid the truth and they left taxpayers to foot the bill."
Mr. McGreevey said that his predecessors had so recklessly overestimated the state's projected revenues that he would be willing to cede some of his power to set projected revenues. That power now belongs solely to the governors' office. But he stopped short of embracing a plan put forth by State Senator Leonard Lance, a Republican from Hunterdon, that would constitutionally mandate such a change. 
Although Mr. McGreevey criticized the Republicans' fiscal policies throughout the campaign, his words today were notably acerbic, even by the raucous standards of New Jersey politics. His decision to ratchet up his attacks suggest that the tenor of the budget deficit debate may grow increasingly partisan. 
After ignoring some of Mr. McGreevey's complaints during the transition, Republicans have begun returning rhetorical fire. And State Senator Joseph M. Kyrillos Jr., the state Republican chairman, has repeatedly urged the governor to stop using "campaign trail rhetoric." 
After the broadsides in Mr. McGreevey's speech, Governor Whitman's spokesman said he felt compelled to respond, saying that the new governor had failed to mention that virtually all the spending programs he now decries received significant support form Democrats.
"Every spending decision made, every tax cut, every bond issue to save open space or rebuild our schools was a bipartisan effort," said Peter J. McDonough, Mrs. Whitman's former communications director. "I don't see any Democrats lining up to say, 'Let's take back the School Construction Act,' 'Let's roll back the property tax rebates,' or 'Let's forget about open space.' His revisionism is laughable." 
The spokesman for Mr. DiFrancesco did not return calls today.
Whatever tone the political debate eventually takes, the repercussions of New Jersey's budget problems are likely to be severe.
Since taking office on Jan. 15, Mr. McGreevey has tried to plug this fiscal year's deficit by ordering across-the-board spending cuts, slashing more than 1,000 jobs from the state payroll and ruling out any increases in state aid to municipalities, a move likely to prompt property tax increases in many communities. Mr. McGreevey will not unveil his complete deficit reduction plan until he addresses a joint session of the State Legislature on Feb. 11, but administration officials said that he was considering suspending the property tax rebate and dipping into the reserve accounts of the state unemployment insurance fund and retiree medical benefits fund.
The governor also confirmed today that to plug next year's deficit he plans to have the state issue bonds against New Jersey's portion of the national tobacco settlement. That will give the state cash, but contradict Mr. McGreevey's promise not to take on more debt.

HEADLINE: The Big City; 
Anarchy As a Matter Of Apples

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
MANY of the protesters in town this week call themselves anarchists. But they sound suspiciously like control freaks.
 They like to project themselves as unfettered young rebels, like the goateed guy in cargo pants on the cover of The Village Voice this week. "Anarchists pick up where progressives left off," proclaims the cover, which features an illustration titled "Passing the Torch." It shows the young guy, like a runner getting a baton in a relay race, reaching out to a middle-aged, balding guy in a suit and tie who is handing over a flaming Molotov cocktail. 
 The protesters this week have not yet celebrated violence quite as openly as The Voice has, but they have cultivated their image of Anarchist Chic. They're not like the earnest other protesters -- environmentalists, union members, socialists -- demanding more rules and bigger bureaucracies. Anarchists present themselves as the smashers of rules and hierarchies.
They speak of "direct democracy," which seems to resist direct definition. The author of The Voice article, Esther Kaplan, offers a summary: "They envision an egalitarian society without nation states, where wealth and power have been redistributed, and they take great pains to model their institutions in this vein, with autonomous, interconnected structures and consensus-based decision making."
Got that?
It's not easy to get more detailed plans from anarchists, especially when they're busy planning protests. But in Monday's paper, one of the protest organizers, Brooke Lehman, a New Yorker who lectures at the Institute for Social Ecology, an anarchist school in Vermont, was quoted being mercifully specific. While explaining "communal economics," she illustrated the problems of global capitalism with an example from the supermarket.
"We don't need to be getting apples from New Zealand," Ms. Lehman said.
We don't? I called Ms. Lehman to find out how she had determined this. What if, when apples were out of season in the northern hemisphere, some free-spirited, anarchic members of the community have a hankering for a fresh Braeburn apple from New Zealand? "In a society that was making decisions in a rational way," Ms. Lehman replied, "you'd be looking at not expending fuel to ship apples from across the world if you had them in your own community. Why is it easier to get a New Zealand apple in New York City than to get an apple from upstate New York? Those decisions aren't being made democratically. They're being made by a corporate elite."
Well, there may be corporate elitists at the Waldorf-Astoria this week who would like to decide what kind of apple you eat. But they have not had much luck in the past. The New Zealand Braeburn apple happens to be an illustration of how little power those corporate capitalists have.
In the 1980's, critics of corporations complained about another kind of apple: the American Red Delicious. The national chains wanted to sell cheap, good-looking apples to the masses year round, and the Red Delicious variety was sturdy enough to survive shipping and long periods of storage. Critics complained that supermarket executives and factory farms had left shoppers with no choice but a stale cardboard apple.
MEANWHILE, though, New Zealand's apple industry was pioneering tasty new varieties of apples that could be grown and shipped cheaply. As New Zealand's fresh Braeburns and Gala apples arrived, the produce sections of supermarkets expanded, and the American apple industry was forced to grow more varieties. Free trade enabled individual shoppers to impose their will on corporations, and now, thanks to Federal Express and the Internet, they can order more varieties than ever. If Ms. Lehman prefers apples from upstate New York, she can order them directly from growers there.
How would apples be distributed according to "communal economics" instead of capitalism? Some members of the community, objecting to the energy used in shipping New Zealand apples, would insist on doing without them even when there were no fresh apples from upstate. Others would consider the energy a small price to pay for a tasty, nutritious apple.
Whatever "consensus" was reached, one side would end up imposing its will on the other. A group of people claiming to be anarchists would end up dictating what kind of apple an individual could eat. Somehow that sounds more like the Taliban than like a group of free-spirited rebels. These control freaks are giving anarchy a bad name.

HEADLINE: FORUM IN NEW YORK: STREET; 
Officers, Primed for Demonstrations, Find Few to Police

BYLINE:  By DAN BARRY and WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM 

 BODY:
There were more than 4,000 of them yesterday, most of them in distinctive attire. They stood in clusters on the cold and rainy streets of Manhattan, chatting among themselves, eyes darting in search of action. They were out in full force for the World Economic Forum, just as they had promised.
 And they were all police officers. 
 On the first day of a highly publicized economic forum at the Waldorf-Astoria, one-tenth of the New York Police Department's work force was deployed to Midtown. There were police officers everywhere: on horseback, on bicycles, directing traffic, guarding shops, searching cars with trained dogs. And just in case, near the East River were an armored vehicle with a water cannon and a tanklike personnel carrier.
All this for expected hordes of demonstrators who, for the most part, never showed up.
David R. Graeber, one of the organizers of the weekend protests and a founder of an anarchist group called the Anti-Capitalist Convergence, said that the demonstrators' plans were centered on the weekend. Yesterday and today, he said, were reserved mostly for workshops on such matters as how to defuse confrontations with the police.
He said that a lot of last-minute work was still being done in preparation for the protests against the forum, which demonstrators say is an elite gathering of 3,000 corporate executives and world leaders intent on controlling the global economy. There are banners to be created, puppets to be made, costumes to be assembled.
"We're trying to create costumes that are both colorful and protective against police batons," he said.
The decision by the protesters to keep their puppets mostly idle ceded the day to the Police Department, which in recent weeks has tried to strike a balance in the message it wanted to convey about its preparations for the economic conference. On the one hand, police officials say, they will protect the free-speech rights of protesters wanting to demonstrate. On the other hand, they emphasize, New York -- which is still recovering from the terrorist attack of Sept. 11 -- will not tolerate any of the vandalism or minor violence that has punctuated protests at other economic conferences around the world.
So the police seized the moment, flooding Midtown with thousands of officers and setting into motion various plans to ensure that they were not caught by surprise. They had police helicopters, they had surveillance cameras, they had uniformed and plainclothes officers sizing up the people walking anywhere near the Waldorf. In addition to the 4,000 officers in the vicinity of the hotel, there were an additional 3,000 in the surrounding areas. 
According to Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, each component was part of a strategy that would allow for peaceful protest, as well as for an immediate response to any destructive or violent behavior. "I wanted flexibility and mobility," he said.
The police also had another factor in their favor: a chilly rain that was not particularly conducive to protest. It rained on the 200 practitioners of Falun Gong chanting at East 48th Street and Park Avenue, and soaked the two flags hanging outside the Waldorf across the street -- the American flag and the World Economic Forum flag, with the motto: "Committed to Improving the State of the World." 
Despite the inclement weather, some protesters still managed to voice their dissent -- and earn the attention of the police. For example, a California man was arrested on charges that he had spray-painted a symbol for anarchy on the window of a Starbucks outlet in Lower Manhattan. And several AIDS activists were arrested after they tried to hang a banner from a building near the Holland Tunnel.
There were other demonstrations and gatherings around the city: for example, an organization called the Students for Global Justice publicized a series of workshops at Columbia University, and then refused to allow reporters to attend. But the day's premier event was supposed to be a demonstration, led by a coalition of labor groups, in front of the Gap store at Fifth Avenue and 54th Street. 
As the rally's organizers assembled a stage on the rain-slickened street, so too were the police assembling, by the hundreds. Officers in uniform and in plainclothes were stationed on all four corners of the intersection, including a row of officers lined up in front of the Gap, as if to provide security for the precious hold of cotton and khaki inside.
"When did dissent become a crime?" asked a passer-by of no one in particular, although she could be confident that with so many officers present, one of them would hear her. A little while later, four burly plainclothes officers stopped and stared at three young men who had stopped to stare at the Gap store (including one whose face sported almost as many metal studs as his leather jacket).
But that was about as tense as it got at the Gap. About 1,000 protesters, most of them union members, filed into a penned-in area, protested against the company's labor practices in developing countries, and then left, their duty done.
"I think they're being very good," said Christopher Dunn, a senior staff lawyer at the New York Civil Liberties Union, referring to the police. "I don't think they're being tested yet. I think the police officers on the streets are taking a very tolerant approach so far."
Mr. Graeber, of the Anti-Capitalist Convergence, said that the Police Department's zero tolerance policy regarding demonstrators had not quenched the passion of the protesters. "I'm really inspired by all the people rising to the occasion," he said. "A lot of people have told me, 'I don't care how much they intimidate us, I'm going to be there.' "
And so will police officers like Francis Spangenberg, one of the thousands of officers who spent the day standing in the rain. His assignment was in front of a Starbucks cafe in Union Square.
"Starbucks can rest easy for another day," he said. "Maybe tomorrow your fair-weather anarchists and sunshine Trotskyites will come marching forth."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Rally for 2nd Day on Fed Outlook

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Wall Street gained momentum yesterday, surging higher for the second day on the Federal Reserve's positive outlook for the economy.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose by triple digits, bringing its two-day advance to more than 300 points. 
 Investors are feeling more confident that business is poised to turn around after the Fed's statement on Wednesday that the economy was strengthening. Procter & Gamble reported earnings that exceeded expectations, which added to the gains, while an analyst upgrade of Intel helped technology stocks. 
Still, there were some signs of lingering caution, including some early selling of technology stocks.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 157.14 points, or 1.6 percent, to 9,920.00. The biggest contributor to the Dow's gain was P.& G.
The broader market also finished higher. The Nasdaq composite index rose 20.59 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,934.03. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 16.63 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,130.20.
Investors were also encouraged by the economy's resilience; it grew at a 0.2 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, the government said on Wednesday. That increase could signal that the recession ended late last year.
Also, the Labor Department reported yesterday that Americans' incomes increased 0.4 percent in December, after holding steady the month before.
"What we have seen this week is that we have turned the corner," said Jeff Kleintop, chief investment strategist for the PNC Financial Services Group in Philadelphia. "We have left the recession behind." 
Procter & Gamble soared $3.39, to $81.68, after beating expectations by a penny and reaffirming its projections for fiscal 2002. P.& G., the maker of Crest and Tide also posted its first sales increase in a year. 
Another consumer products maker, Kraft Foods, climbed $1.56, to $37.06 after raising its 2002 earnings projections beyond analysts' expectations.
Intel, also a Dow component, rose $1.18, to $35.04, after its shares were upgraded by Merrill Lynch.
Analysts said bargain hunting also factored into yesterday's advance as buyers took advantage of cheaper prices after a big sell-off on Tuesday, when the Dow tumbled 247.51 points, its biggest one-day point drop in three months. Worries about companies' accounting procedures, precipitated by the collapse of Enron, were cited as the biggest factor in that drop. --------------------

Treasury Prices Fall
By Reuters
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday as a second day of stock gains and minutes of the December policy meeting of the Federal Reserve solidified the view that the Fed had come to the end of a yearlong course of cutting interest rates.
The Fed ended a two-day policy meeting Wednesday with an announcement that it would keep rates steady after a string of 11 rate reductions that brought the federal funds rate down 4.75 percentage points to 1.75 percent.
The release of minutes from the Fed's last meeting in 2001 showed that several members of the monetary policy committee thought that the December rate cut was a close call and one member voted against it.
The difference in yield between two-year notes and 30-year bonds shrank to 2.27 percentage points, down from recent peaks in mid-January of 2.63 percentage points.
Bond investors were also a little defensive before two major economic reports today -- one on national manufacturing activity and the other on the labor market -- which could provide more evidence that the economy is regaining its strength at the start of 2002.
The benchmark 10-year note fell 7/32 , to a price of 99 23/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 5.04 percent from 5.01 on Wednesday.
The 30-year bond was unchanged at 99 5/32 , and its yield was 5.43 percent.

HEADLINE: City Plans to Prohibit Turns Onto Broadway in Times Sq. 

BYLINE:  By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
As the final part of a plan to ease congestion and make the streets safer for pedestrians in Times Square, the city plans to prohibit vehicles from turning onto Broadway from 44th through 47th Streets beginning later this month.
 Those blocks were chosen because traffic planners consistently found the largest pedestrian crowds at intersections there. Problems occur mostly in the evenings, when theatergoers and drivers on their way home engage in their daily duel for dominance of the streets. Usually the crowds win, making it very difficult for cars to turn and backing up traffic for blocks on the side streets. 
 The situation is also very dangerous for pedestrians.
"We found that the lion's share of pedestrians were on those blocks," said Tom Cocola, a spokesman for the city's Department of Transportation. "And obviously what we want to do is give the pedestrians a chance."
The department first addressed the danger last year by instituting a plan known as traffic calming: narrowing some outer lanes and widening several sidewalk areas with painted stripes, raised pavement, stanchions and heavy planters.
The turning ban, first reported yesterday in The Daily News, was originally supposed to go into effect last fall, but after the World Trade Center attack, transportation officials decided to wait and see what effect the event and other traffic restrictions would have on crowding in Times Square. The decision was finally made to wait until after the World Economic Forum, being held in Manhattan this week, and to begin the ban on Feb. 11.
Signs will be installed next week announcing that no turns are permitted at the four intersections, and the police will be out in force to make sure they are obeyed, city officials said.
Mr. Cocola said that the ban was not a response to an accident in Herald Square at the end of December, in which a van lurched wildly out of control and killed seven pedestrians. But he added that the accident had highlighted the city's need to examine crowded neighborhoods where cars and pedestrians are in dangerous proximity.
"You can't avoid absolutely everything at all times in a city like this," he said, "but we're trying to make sure, as well as we can, that pedestrians and bikers and cars can share space safely."

HEADLINE: FORUM IN NEW YORK: WORKERS; 
Labor Brings Witnesses to Tell Of a Harsher Side to Growth

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Sofia Sazo, a longtime garment worker from Guatemala, came to New York this week to tell a tale about the world economic order that the corporate chiefs attending the World Economic Forum probably do not want to hear.
 The managers at her blouse factory, which makes clothes for The Gap and Polo, often yell at the female workers and sometimes even hit them, she said. Some days the workers are forced to stay until 4 a.m. and then have to report back four hours later. The pay is typically less than $7 for a 10-hour day, and pregnant workers are often demoted to jobs that pay less. A five-minute stay in the bathroom usually brings a warning letter. 
 Ms. Sazo, who recently quit her job to become a labor organizer, was flown to New York this week as part of an A.F.L.-C.I.O. campaign to make the global economy friendlier to workers. 
Standing 4 feet 8 inches tall, with flowing dark hair, Ms. Sazo had a straightforward message: "Companies should pay a just wage and treat people like human beings."
The World Economic Forum not only is the world's foremost annual gathering of business and government leaders, but also serves as the foremost intellectual seminar about globalization.
Recognizing this, unions have seized on the occasion to try to get across their take on globalization.
More than 500 union members demonstrated yesterday in front of The Gap's flagship store on Fifth Avenue to denounce its use of low-wage factories overseas. About 40 labor leaders are attending the forum at the Waldorf where they will make repeated broadsides against corporate-dominated globalization. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. also sponsored an unusual forum in which three laid-off workers from the United States joined three workers from overseas to rail against the dark side of international business.
These workers and union leaders are scrambling for a strategy or tool, perhaps through trade agreements, that would stop what they call a race to the bottom in which many companies move operations to the lowest-wage countries. 
But many corporate leaders at the forum argue that moving operations to low-wage countries is good for those countries and their workers. This creates jobs, they argue, which usually pay more than subsistence farming. Globalization, these leaders say, helps poor countries develop their economies. 
Ms. Sazo agreed that many workers are glad to have the jobs.
"A lot of people say at least we have enough to buy bread for the children," she said.
Unlike many anarchist protesters who want to roll back globalization, union leaders accept it as a fact of life. "It's clear that globalization is here to stay," said John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president who is attending the Waldorf meeting. "We have to accept that and work on having a seat at the table when the rules are written about how globalization works." 
Labor leaders worked closely with environmental and human rights groups at last year's trade talks in Qatar, but failed to win labor, environmental and human rights protections in trade agreements.
Just before yesterday's demonstration at The Gap, Mr. Sweeney said labor leaders were eager to keep this week's demonstrations nonviolent. "Violence is not the way to achieve a satisfactory resolution of these issues," he said. "If anything, it hurts us in the long term."
Russell Sheffler, a steelworker from Cleveland, says globalization cost him his job. He was laid off in December, after 28 years on the job, when LTV Steel shut down permanently and laid off 7,500 workers. 
Mr. Sheffler, like others, attributed his jobless status on low-price imports from low-wage countries. 
"I don't' think corporations want to lift the standards of the people overseas," he said. "I think they want to bring us down to their level."
Richard Trumka, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s secretary-treasurer, said, "They say the backlash against globalization stems from an image problem. It's not an image problem, it's a reality problem."

HEADLINE: FORUM IN NEW YORK: COMPUTER SECURITY; 
Protesters and Police Plot and Thwart Online

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM 

 BODY:
As the police and federal agents and scores of protest groups prepare for disruptive demonstrations outside the World Economic Forum, both sides are taking up positions on another potential battleground -- the Internet.
 Demonstrators are using the Internet to organize protests and publicize their causes. The New York Police Department is using it to glean information about groups that it says may pose a threat. And federal authorities say they fear that some protesters will use it as a tool of disruption or destruction. 
 Representatives of several of the larger umbrella groups planning protests dismissed the idea of "cyberattacks" and said they had none planned. But federal officials said they had "significant concerns" and, along with forum officials, were taking precautions.
The Secret Service is working with the Police Department on security preparations. So far, the specter of tumult in the streets -- and the kind of vandalism and violence that marred similar economic gatherings in recent years -- has driven concern about the protests. But increasingly, the potential havoc wrought by a computer attack has drawn the attention of federal authorities.
"We're living in a world where a keyboard has the potential to do enormous damage," said Bruce A. Townsend, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service's financial crimes division in Washington. He would not say whether there was a threat specific to the forum. But he said the agency's New York Electronic Crimes Task Force, a joint effort with the Police Department and nearly 50 other state, local and federal law enforcement agencies, had painstakingly reviewed computer systems associated with the meeting to make them less vulnerable. 
Cyberattacks on the World Economic Forum are not without precedent. Last year, a computer hacker gained access to the forum's database and obtained credit card and other information on hundreds of participants who attended the group's regional meetings in 2000.
At the other end of the spectrum is a group planning a "cyberaction" for this year's meeting. The group, called the Electronic Disturbance Theater, is using its Web site to call for a "Net strike" to "disturb the electronic infrastructure of the W.E.F.'s corporate membership." The group wants large numbers of people to swamp the Web sites of the forum and its corporate members. 
But the group's co-founder, Ricardo Dominguez, drew a distinction between his efforts, which he said were aimed at "social disturbance" rather than disruption or destruction, and those of anyone trying to break into or destroy computer systems. 
"It's a very American thing to do," he said, comparing the action to sitting down in the middle of a street in an act of civil disobedience.

HEADLINE: FORUM IN NEW YORK: PROTESTERS; 
Paper Giants As a Voice For Ideas

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
Looking like an arts and crafts teacher who had been dropped into a Fellini film, David Taylor was struggling to clothe a papier-mache giant and simultaneously direct paint-splattered volunteers when yet another reporter asked the question: Were he and his fellow protesters planning to clash with the police over the next few days? Mr. Taylor, a 24-year-old computer programmer from Oakland, Calif., put down the puppet he was wrestling and tried to stifle his indignation. 
 "If you want to know what those young crazy radical activists are up to, you've come to the right place," he said, glancing around a vast industrial space buzzing with politically minded artisans and packed with their handiwork. "I'm really getting sick of that question." 
 While the police on the streets seemed to be steeling themselves for civic unrest, the atmosphere yesterday morning inside the garage, along the West Side Highway at 57th Street, was anything but martial. The message from Mr. Taylor and two dozen other volunteers was clear: make art, not war. 
There was, however, a looming sense of panic as the hours passed and the afternoon debut of this cardboard pageantry neared. There were robber-baron style top hats bearing the words "WEF: We Are All En-Wrong" and beachball-sized wine goblets painted like globes that read "Earth For Sale." A blown-up photograph of Kenneth L. Lay, the former chairman and chief executive of Enron, leaned against a pillar, not far from a row of huge pretzels, an apparent reference to the snack food that recently felled President Bush as he watched a football game. 
Over the past week, scores of volunteers from across the country have been flocking to the space to glue, paint and stitch together props that will animate the street protests accompanying the World Economic Forum. Two New York organizations, Arts in Action and Time's Up, helped put together the makeshift workshop. 
But alongside the levity yesterday afternoon there was an undercurrent of fear. Many of those planning to join the protests said they were worried about the potential for violence at the hands of the police. Others said they were frustrated by journalists' single-minded focus on the potential for Seattle-style disturbances. "We're not out there to fight with the police," said Payal Parekh, 28, an oceanography graduate student from Boston who was helping to organize the puppet making. "We're trying to get our voices heard but the media is obsessed with security issues." 
Whether or not their fears are real, even those organizing the puppet workshop were not taking any chances. Bill DiPaola of Time's Up tried to find a backup location, just in case something were to go awry. "You can't be too careful about these things," he said. 
Still, with the demonstration at the Gap at 54th Street near Fifth Avenue already under way, there were more pressing concerns. Clapping to get the room's attention, someone urged the crowd at the garage to head east and "help animate the images we created." A pickup truck was loaded with props; everyone else took the crosstown bus. Ten minutes later, the truck pulled up to the curb at 54th Street and into the arms of the police. "I promise there are no rocks or bottles," one woman joked to an officer who was visibly suspicious. "It's just a bunch of goofy puppets." After a brief verbal tussle and a few tense moments, the police relented, gave the group five minutes to unload and everyone, it seemed, was happy.

HEADLINE: An Architectural Milestone Loses Its Pedigree 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
The Bronx Developmental Center, a complex of buildings that has drawn global praise as a masterpiece of Modernism, is being partly demolished, significantly changed and expanded by its new owner.
 Architectural purists are aghast, but are helpless to stop it. 
 The new owner, Joseph Simone, who bought the complex from the state in May, is making what he hopes will be the largest office building in the Bronx out of the complex, a former center for the mentally retarded that is visible from the Hutchinson River Parkway. In the process, Mr. Simone is replacing the elongated portholes with conventional office windows and peeling off the buildings' celebrated aluminum-colored skin and replacing it with white aluminum. Most significant, he plans to enlarge the 330,000-square-foot complex to as much as one million square feet. 
"We're on the cusp of signing the first big lease," said Mr. Simone, the president of the Simone Development Companies in New Rochelle, N.Y., which paid the state $3.7 million for the property. "This is the biggest thing to hit the Bronx in decades."
The company has both demolition and building permits and work has begun. The goal is to take what everyone admits has become a decrepit, outmoded treatment center and turn it into premier office space. Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president, said in 1999 that a transformation similar to the one actually being done could ultimately generate 6,000 jobs.
The casualty is one of the treasures of late 20th-century architecture, in the judgment of many architects and preservationists. After Richard Meier, the architect of such celebrated buildings as the Getty Center in Los Angeles and the Museum for the Decorative Arts in Frankfurt, Germany, and numerous distinctive white houses, finished the Bronx Developmental Center in 1977, Ada Louise Huxtable, the architecture critic for The New York Times, called it "the cynosure of the architectural world."
The AIA Guide to New York City says, "A consummate work of architecture, it is among the great complexes of its time."
Mr. Meier, who is attending the World Economic Forum in Manhattan, said yesterday that the news of the demolition was upsetting. He said preservation laws in Europe, particularly in France, would have prevented such a change.
"I hope that what he's replacing it with has the quality of what we built there," Mr. Meier said. "It's interesting to me that they never come back to the original architect."
Robert A. M. Stern, the architect and historian, called the news "a shocker," saying he felt as if he were losing a familiar acquaintance. "And, my God, we've lost the trade center," he said. "This is a monument of exactly the same period. This is serious."
There seems to be little that preservationists can do. The city's Landmarks Preservation Commission can confer landmark status only on buildings that are at least 30 years old. To qualify for the federal and state historical registries, buildings generally must be at least 50 years old.
Sherida E. Paulsen, chairwoman of the commission and an architect, said she was sad that she seemed powerless to help. She lived in the Bronx when her husband was going to medical school there, Ms. Paulsen said, and she remembered how much she loved to look out her window at Mr. Meier's creation. 
"This is a tragic loss," she said. "This is one of the first buildings by one of the pre-eminent architects of the late 20th century, and it's gone."
Preservationists were particularly disappointed that the buildings just missed being old enough to be protected by the city. "It's almost at the eligibility age for landmark protection, and yet it isn't," said Frank E. Sanchis III, executive director of the Municipal Art Society.
Roger P. Lang, director of public affairs for the New York Landmarks Conservancy, a private advocacy group, said, "This is one of the handful of works of modern architecture that deserved care and protection. And it's apparently been lost, and there's no recourse."
In "New York 1960" (Monacelli Press, 1995), the authors -- Mr. Stern, Thomas Mellins and David Fishman -- said the idea of the complex was to convey a comfortable ambience, despite the slick aluminum panels. They called it "rationally planned and utterly logical," but also "dauntingly abstract in form."
But from the beginning, the buildings had critics who insisted the effect was far from inviting. Mark Stevens said in his review in Newsweek, "Architecture is art's ambassador to the real world, but some psychologists and parents of retarded people think Meier has forced an unhomelike art upon the lives of his patients."
He suggested that the architect's hand might have been too visible. "Great buildings seem given, not designed," he wrote.
The book authors suggest that for many people who are not students of design, the buildings may have been a bit unsettling, much like the Guggenheim Museum remains for some. The "symbol of Modernism," they acknowledge, may also have served as "the butt of jokes."
Dean Bender, a spokesman for Mr. Simone, said the buildings had fallen into serious disrepair well before the state put it and four other mental health centers up for sale in 1999. The first step in converting the complex to a new use will be to rip out the interior space. "It really was in a very rundown condition, the building, the grounds," Mr. Bender said. Referring to Mr. Simone, he said, "He's really cleaned up the site."
Plans call for a first phase in which the complex's size will increase to 450,000 square feet. A second phase may increase the total to one million. The interior courtyards, praised by architecture critics, will be preserved.
The pace of development will depend on how quickly tenants sign leases. Several are negotiating for large amounts of office space.
Whatever happens, the edifice will never look the same. But there is a scale model available: it was shown at the Jeu de Paume in Paris in 1999 in a major retrospective of Mr. Meier's work.

Not Even Terror Attack Dims Manhattan Market

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
Despite the recession and tremors from the World Trade Center attack, the prices of co-op and condominium apartments in most of Manhattan ended last year with a 5.2 percent gain, reaching a median of $505,000, according to a leading market report. And while closings slipped from the year before, the number of sales contracts has bounced back in the past two months. 
 "It's clear that market activity is returning to more normal levels," said Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, the appraisal company that prepared the report for the Insignia Douglas Elliman brokerage firm. 
 "I would characterize the pattern in transactions as a V-shaped trend," he said, "indicating a rapid drop and quick recovery after this market trauma, as opposed to a U-shaped trend with a more prolonged decline and recovery period." 
The Elliman report is based on 7,858 co-op and condominium sales from Battery Park north to 116th Street on the West Side and to 96th Street on the East Side. 
In addition to calculating the 5.2 percent rise in the median price for all of 2001 -- to $505,000 from $480,000 in 2000 -- Mr. Miller also tracked the median price from quarter to quarter. During the first quarter, it was $500,000, up 2 percent from $490,000 in the last quarter of 2000. In the second quarter of last year, the median rose by 8 percent to $540,000. Then, during the third quarter, ending Sept. 30, the market experienced its first price decline in three years, dropping 3.7 percent to $520,000. 
"That trend continued in the fourth quarter, incorporating more of the influence of the Sept. 11 attack," Mr. Miller said. (Closings typically follow sales contracts by weeks or months.) During the fourth quarter, the median price slipped by 8.7 percent, to $475,000. 
Still, the 5.2 percent increase for the entire year "shows the resiliency of the market despite the Trade Center attack and the national recession," Mr. Miller said.
In the past five years, he pointed out, the overall median price for Manhattan has risen by 140 percent, including a whopping 50 percent jump -- to $480,000 from $320,000 -- in 2000.
The chief economist for the Real Estate Board of New York, Gregory Heym, said the 5.2 percent rise indicated by the Elliman report for last year "certainly coincides with our findings." 
"Most apartment size categories are up between 3 and 5 percent from last year," Mr. Heym said. "We do notice a lot of strength in the studio market. I think most of the activity has been driven by the small units; they hold their value well." 
The strength of the small-apartment category, coupled with slippage in the high-end market, was reflected in the findings of another appraisal company -- Mitchell, Maxwell & Jackson -- indicating a drop in the average price (as opposed to the median) for Manhattan. 
"We've looked at new mortgage applications below 96th Street, month by month," said Jeffrey Jackson, chairman of Mitchell, Maxwell & Jackson. In January 2001, he said, the average price on those mortgage applications was $734,300, while in December it was $645,389, a drop of 12.1 percent. 
"You had fewer sales in the high end of the market, and more at the low end," Mr. Jackson said. "That drags down the average." 
According to the Elliman report, overall sales volume dipped last year, but showed signs of recovery in recent months. There were 7,858 closed deals in 2001, the report said, a 10.7 percent drop from 8,799 in 2000. Those two years came off the all-time high of 9,245 transactions in 1999. 
During the first quarter of last year, 2,039 closed deals were recorded. In the second quarter, there were 1,829 sales. Then, in the third quarter, 1,904 sales were closed. And in the fourth quarter, there were 2,086 sales. "It must be pointed out, however, that many of the transactions that closed in the third and fourth quarters went to contract prior to Sept. 11," Mr. Miller said.
So, to get a further sense of the market, Mr. Miller tracked sales contracts signed, month by month, from August through January. In August, 166 contracts were signed. In September, however, that figure dropped to 35, followed by 29 in October and 42 in November. Then a sizable rebound began in December, when 148 contracts were signed, followed by 195 in January. 
There has also been a slight uptick in contract prices over the past five months. During September, October and November the median contract price was $490,000. That rose by 1 percent during December and January, to $495,000. 
As further indication of a recovery, Mr. Miller said, "If you take the number of contracts for this past December and January, and compare them to the same period a year ago, current sales are 2.7 percent higher."

Re "Seeking Safety, Manhattan Firms Are Scattering" (front page, Jan. 29): 
 There may be an unexpected benefit for employees of firms relocating after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
When the firms were in Manhattan, many workers had long commutes that cut into precious family time. 
 My own research on working families in Massachusetts shows that significant commutes -- along with inflexible work hours -- impede volunteerism in schools, child care centers, faith-based organizations and other institutions crucial to the health of local communities. 
While restoring the vitality of Lower Manhattan is a worthy goal, a regional approach is needed. Lower Manhattan draws on a multistate labor market, and its fortunes are tied to the well-being of large numbers of families in many communities. 
If all stakeholders take part in the dialogue on redevelopment -- including families, schools, child- and elder-care providers, along with employers and real estate developers -- there may be gains for working families and their communities.

Re "Seeking Safety, Manhattan Firms Are Scattering" (front page, Jan. 29):
 While it may be true that large companies like Morgan Stanley and Goldman, Sachs are choosing to scatter operations beyond Lower Manhattan for safety reasons, the message that they send the public, and for that matter terrorists, is a lack of loyalty to New York City, just when it needs it most. 
 The companies may fear another catastrophe, but one can wager that the moves to suburbanize are also a matter of convenience and money, coupled with a lack of commitment to the community of New York City. I hope that New York will not become a suburban agglomeration like so many other American cities.

Loria to Get Help Buying the Marlins

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Major League Baseball not only plans to buy the Montreal Expos from Jeffrey Loria, but it will also subsidize Loria's purchase of the Florida Marlins.
 A person familiar with Loria's pending purchase of the Marlins said yesterday that Major League Baseball would lend Loria $38 million to enable him to buy the Marlins for $158 million, which is the price John Henry paid for the Marlins three years ago. Loria will receive $120 million from baseball for the Expos. 
 Henry has to sell the Marlins because he heads the group that has been approved as the new owner of the Boston Red Sox. Loria wants to buy the Marlins because he wants to remain in baseball, and the Expos are one of the two teams that Commissioner Bud Selig has included in the owners' contraction plan. 
Two legal challenges, however, have stalled contraction. Baseball officials still say they can jettison two teams up to opening day, March 31, but the plan becomes increasingly doubtful with each passing day. If the Expos remain alive this season, baseball will operate them.
The Expos could be an expensive takeover for baseball, though the linked deal with Loria and the Marlins could prove beneficial for baseball down the road. Rather than costing baseball $120 million, the cost in the next year will be closer to, or more than, $200 million, including the team's payroll, which is expected to exceed $35 million this year.
The person who spoke about the loan said Loria would pay no interest the first couple of years. If the Marlins do not get a new park within five years, $15 million of the loan will be forgiven and Loria will owe baseball only $23 million with no interest on the balance. 
On the other hand, said another person familiar with the transaction, if the team gets a new park, baseball would receive 20 percent of the Marlins' profits for the first five years. 
Loria, and not baseball, would also have to pay off financial obligations that he incurred in his purchase of the Expos. He borrowed about $59 million under the industry's line of credit, and he has a $30 million obligation to government authorities in Canada as part of the original purchase price. Loria did not return a telephone message.
Baseball officials had hoped that the deal would be completed by yesterday. One official said lawyers were still working on contract language. The ownership committee is scheduled to meet by conference call today and could nevertheless approve the sale conditionally. 
The league notified clubs yesterday of an owners meeting with the agenda including action on the Marlins and the Expos. No date was given, but the notices were sent yesterday to comply with the 10-day notification rule, allowing Selig to call the meeting for the week of Feb. 11.
The owners want to eliminate two teams with low revenue to improve the economic status of the other 28 teams. National television revenue and shared local revenue under the revenue-sharing plan would be divided by two fewer teams.
But the expense of buying and operating the Expos and subsidizing Loria's purchase of the Marlins would cost each team around $7 million. That's a steep sum for the small-revenue teams that are subsidized by revenue sharing. The clubs might get that money back if the Expos were sold to an owner in Washington, or northern Virginia, but there has been no indication when that might occur.
The other contraction case, involving the Minnesota Twins, also goes on. Lawyers for the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission and the state submitted briefs yesterday to the Minnesota Supreme Court. They argue there is no need for the court to review a lower court's ruling that upheld a temporary injunction barring baseball from eliminating the Twins this year.

HEADLINE: Japan Leader, Facing Crisis, Moves to Fill Minister's Job 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, moving to contain a growing political and economic crisis, chose Yoriko Kawaguchi today as his new foreign minister, replacing Makiko Tanaka who was fired in what is becoming known here as "the Tuesday night massacre."
 Ms. Kawaguchi, who was previously environment minister, is not a member of Parliament. With fluent English, a doctorate in economics from Yale University, and several years of experience in Washington with the Japanese Embassy and the World Bank, she is considered a quick study, capable of preparing for President Bush's visit here in two weeks. 
 The appointment came after Mr. Koizumi was blindsided by a wave of popular anger over his firing of Ms. Tanaka, a peppery parliamentarian who appeared on television almost nightly during the last nine months, pushing her crusade against Foreign Ministry bureaucrats.
In the last two days, this anger has been reflected in falling poll ratings and increasing business nervousness that could hamper Mr. Koizumi's attempts to adopt free market changes needed to help pull Japan out of its fourth recession in a decade. On Thursday, the yen briefly hit its lowest level in 40 months, at 135 to the dollar. This morning, the Nikkei index of the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell 179 points for a morning close of 9,818, one of the lowest levels since Sept. 11. On Thursday, Standard & Poor's, the global risk evaluator, warned that any delay in reviving Japan's stalled economy, weighed down by bad loans and deflation, could result in a further downgrade of its sovereign rating.
"It is by far the biggest problem he has faced since coming to power," Gerald L. Curtis, a visiting professor of political science from Columbia University said of the growing sense of crisis here. Referring to Japan's reformist prime minister, he added: "He is going to have a very tough struggle to regain the high ground. He kicked out the one person, who, whatever her faults, was out to reform the bureaucracy."
In a coordinated counteroffensive, Finance Minister Masajuro Shiokawa told reporters this morning that the yen's fall was "a little bit rapid." Heizo Takenaka, minister for economic and fiscal policy, responded to Mr. Koizumi's sinking popularity, saying: "I don't think the public wants the government to ease up on the existing structural reform plans." 
Alluding to the dropping popularity ratings, Takeo Hiranuma, the minister of economy, trade and industry, told reporters: "I think it is a temporary phenomenon and will recover as soon as we proceed with the structural reforms which the people have supported."
Mr. Koizumi, who has only a small faction of supporters in Japan's Parliament, has governed largely on the strength of high popularity, generally in the 70 percent to 80 percent range through last weekend.
But on Wednesday morning, hours after he fired Ms. Tanaka, telephone operators at the ruling Liberal Democratic Party headquarters were deluged with 10 times the normal volume of calls, with 80 percent strongly against the firing of the foreign minister. Little sympathy was shown for Vice Foreign Minister Yoshiji Nogami, who was fired along with Ms. Tanaka.
In a telephone poll taken later that day by Television Tokyo Channel 12, Mr. Koizumi's approval rating was at 55.6 percent, down 30 points from 85.6 percent recorded three months earlier in a poll by the same broadcaster. This poll also had his disapproval rating jumping to 34.8 percent. Of respondents, 61.8 percent said he should not have fired Ms. Tanaka.
In the shuffle, Hiroshi Oki, an Liberal Democratic member of parliament, is to become environment minister, returning to a post he held in 1997.

 CORRECTION:
An article in some copies last Friday about the appointment of Japan's new foreign minister, Yoriko Kawaguchi, misstated the economics degree she received from Yale. It was a master's, not a doctorate.

CALPINE SAYS HIGHER COSTS CUT INTO ITS QUARTERLY PROFIT

BYLINE:  Reuters 

 BODY:
 Calpine, an independent power producer in California, said yesterday that its fourth-quarter profit had fallen because of higher costs and lower power prices. It said it had scaled down power plant construction plans because of soft industrial demand and the weak economy. Calpine also said it would take further steps to strengthen its balance sheet and shore up its creditworthiness. Calpine said it had about $1.8 billion of cash on hand. The company said its profit fell to $111 million, or 26 cents a share, on sales of $1.72 billion. A year earlier, the company earned $135 million, or 45 cents a share, on sales of $1.1 billion.

HEADLINE: Bank of China's Mounting Problems 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
Tawdry details of lax banking practices at China's most prominent state bank, the Bank of China, have been accumulating on both sides of the Pacific in the last month, their weight leading recently to the dismissal of one of China's most influential bankers.
 First came a report from China's National Audit Office, which found that $320 million of bank funds had been diverted from several branches of the bank through "unlawful loans, off-the-books business and the unlawful granting of letters of credit and issuing bank bills." 
 Days later, American bank regulators said an investigation begun in 1999 had turned up the same kinds of irregularities at Bank of China's United States operations. The bank was fined $20 million in the case.
But these official findings appear to have just been the tip of the iceberg. Details of questionable lending and business practices have been spilling out in a cluster of lawsuits in the United States. 
According to court documents and lawyers involved in the suits, officers of the bank's New York office made large loans to politically connected customers with no credit history or collateral and to shell corporations existing only on paper. Some of the loans apparently were meant to pad the bank's client roster, while others were meant to serve Beijing's political ends, the papers say. 
In a separate case, four people were arrested in Hong Kong recently in connection with what police in Kaiping, China, said was a scheme to launder $73 million originating at a branch there. In another, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said they were looking into whether money illegally taken from the Bank of China might have ended up in Canada. 
The unfolding troubles at the bank provide a rare look at mismanagement and corruption inside China's ordinarily secretive state-dominated banking sector. 
In part, the revelations are a sign of government efforts to clean up its banks: the Chinese government either initiated or cooperated with all the recent investigations of the bank. But they also show how far China still has to go to prepare to compete globally in the World Trade Organization, which it has just joined. A banking system run on sound business principles and sober assessment of credit, rather than politics and connections, is seen as vital. 
Bankers here said the Bank of China was in so much trouble not because it was more poorly run than its peers -- in fact, it is probably the best run of the large state banks, they said -- but rather because its extensive overseas operations subject it to the close scrutiny of foreign bank regulators. 
"Every bank in China has problems like this," said one Chinese banking expert who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Even within the Bank of China I think you can find worse abuses going on. This sort of problem is a product of the system, and unless the system changes, these kinds of problems may decrease but they won't disappear." 
The Bank of China refused to comment on any specifics of the investigations and lawsuits concerning its employees and practices. A spokesman for the bank said only that it "adheres to the strictest accounting principles in accord with international practice and will appropriately deal with cases like this one."
The inherent problem for China's big commercial banks is that they are strange hybrids, charged by Chinese law both with responding to the needs of the market and with supporting the government's "political goals."
Top officers of China's four big banks are appointed by the state, and part of every loan officer's job is handing out "political loans" with little or no likelihood of ever being repaid -- to shore up a dying state enterprise, for example, or to satisfy the demand of a powerful local official who needs cash. 
"These bankers have very close ties to the government, and the management is not appointed for professional skills but for loyalty and for links to the government or the party," said one Western banker who has worked closely with many Chinese banks. "There's a lot of lip service to commercial concerns, but in the end they're not being paid to act commercially. When you ask why they made a loan, they'll often say, 'We know it's wrong, but we were told to do this.' "
Political loans amount to a "second budget" in China, bankers say, financing pension payments and health insurance plans for cash-short state companies and other social welfare needs that have no other source of funds in China today. 
But the power -- and habit -- of doling out money with little oversight easily leads to abuses and even outright theft.
"If you're the head of a local bank and I'm a government official, and I ask for a loan, it's hard for you to refuse," the Chinese banking expert said. 
One result is that an estimated 40 percent of loans by state banks are not being repaid. Another is that small, innovative private companies often have trouble getting loans.
Before the mid-1990's, the state banks merely extended credit to state enterprises on government order, and they had little experience with standard financial practices like risk assessment, due diligence and securing collateral. Today, Chinese economic officials, many with Western educations, feel a "sense of crisis" about the banking system, but are unsure how to solve the problem, financial experts here say.
"They are trying very hard to turn their banks into commercial banks, but it's a huge task," said Bruce Murray, the Asian Development Bank's representative in China. "Old habits die hard."
Doing business the old way is what got the bank in trouble in New York, where the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a unit of the Treasury Department involved in bank supervision, began its investigation in 1999. Misconduct at the bank, the office said in a statement last month, "included showing preferential treatment to certain customers of the New York branch who had personal relationships with some members of the New York branch's prior management." Investigators said they found evidence that the bank had facilitated fraudulent letters of credit and had allowed borrowers to sell assets that had been pledged as collateral for loans.
The office and the bank settled the charges of misconduct with the $20 million fine -- half paid to the Treasury and half to the People's Bank of China, the Chinese central bank -- and with a consent decree requiring the bank to take a number of corrective steps. Among them was to cease doing business permanently with a list of eight individuals and some two dozen businesses, some of them among the bank's biggest customers in the 1990's.
The Bank of China and some of these former clients are now embroiled in a complicated tangle of litigation in New York, in which each side asserts that the other is responsible for financial improprieties.
The bank is suing some of the clients, claiming they obtained loans fraudulently. The clients are countersuing the bank, saying essentially that the bank put them up to it.
The court papers describe a climate where major customers at the branch were coddled, dined frequently with senior bank officers, and were offered privileges for themselves and their families that would drop jaws at American banks -- like advancing $50,000, no questions asked, to a customer's father-in-law.
But the favors flowed both ways, the suits say. One group of clients asserts that the bank asked them to take out loans and put the proceeds into shell companies that the branch could count as new customers to impress bosses in Beijing.
They also say they and others were solicited by the bank to help support the value of the Hong Kong dollar with money borrowed at zero interest. A year later, they said, the funds were routed back through the Cayman Islands to take advantage of favorable tax laws.
Steven L. Kessler, a lawyer who represents some of the clients in the case, said they took part merely to stay in the bank's good graces, because it had no license to trade currency itself. The clients did not learn until afterward that some aspects of the bank's plan violated American law, Mr. Kessler said.
The claims and counterclaims concerning the New York branch are endless, but the activities they describe are almost certainly not unique, experts in Beijing said.
Liang Xiaoting, a former top bank official in Hong Kong, was arrested in Beijing on corruption and embezzlement charges. Chinese investigators are cooperating with counterparts in Hong Kong, Macao and Canada in dissecting a suspected money laundering scheme.
If there is a silver lining to the gathering clouds, analysts say, it is that the Chinese government is at last showing some determination to clean up corruption, even if it involves high-ranking party figures.
Two years ago, China doubled the budget of its national auditing office, which has become increasingly aggressive in scanning the books of government units and state companies. Reports from the auditing office this year detailed illegal use of a staggering 160 billion renminbi -- about $20 billion -- belonging to state-run banks, insurance companies, health inspection stations and other organizations.
Liu Mingkang, the new head of the Bank of China, went as far as to say that the bank welcomed the imposition of the American fine, calling it "conducive to the healthy development of the branch."
In China, the most immediate public casualty has been the highly influential banker Wang Xuebing, who was dismissed as president of the China Construction Bank on Jan. 11. Mr. Wang had been president of Bank of China from 1993 to 1999, when he was transferred to the construction bank to make way for a government investigation, an official here said. He had run the New York branch in the early 1990's, and had enjoyed strong support from China's prime minister, Zhu Rongji.

HEADLINE: The View From Riyadh 

 BODY:
Saudi Arabia's normally reticent leaders have made an unusual effort in recent days to air their views about the United States and its role in the Middle East. The openness itself is welcome and some of the comments have been heartening, including the desire to strengthen the friendship between Riyadh and Washington. Unfortunately, Saudi Arabia's rulers remain reluctant to reckon with deformities in their own society that fuel the violent Islamic fundamentalism of Osama bin Laden and his followers. 
 Crown Prince Abdullah, who has all but replaced the ailing King Fahd as Saudi Arabia's paramount leader, and Prince Nawwaf, the intelligence chief, largely glossed over the serious concerns Americans now have about Saudi Arabia in interviews with The Times and The Washington Post. America's historic relationship with Saudi Arabia, so central to the energy needs of the West and the security of the oil-rich Persian Gulf, has been badly shaken by the events of Sept. 11 and subsequent revelations of the close links between important elements of Saudi society and Al Qaeda's terrorist war against the United States. 
 These problems are too important to overlook, or to deflect with the kind of polemics the two men offered about Israel. Washington's relationship with Riyadh will not right itself until sensitive issues concerning Saudi Arabia itself are openly addressed. These include the growth of virulent anti-American sentiment among young Saudis and the continued close links between the kingdom's economic and religious establishments and violent Islamic fundamentalist groups abroad. 
Four and a half months after Sept. 11, Crown Prince Abdullah still refuses to make the kind of clean break with violent Islamic fundamentalism that Gen. Pervez Musharraf has made in Pakistan. The prince and many other Saudi leaders seem in denial about the extensive connections between the kingdom and the events of that day. These include the Saudi passports carried by most of the suspected hijackers, the well-connected Saudi charities that funneled money to Osama bin Laden's terrorist network and the Saudi-funded seminaries in Pakistan and Afghanistan that steered students into battle on behalf of the Taliban and Al Qaeda. 
While the crown prince dismisses Osama bin Laden and his Saudi followers as "deviants" trying "to drive a wedge" between Riyadh and Washington, his half-brother, the intelligence chief, more realistically recognizes that an overwhelming majority of young Saudis now sympathize with the terrorist leader's cause. Saudis from the royal family on down are responsive to the militant teachings of the country's officially established Wahhabi sect of Islam. For at least some Wahhabi mullahs, those teachings now include support for armed jihad against the United States. 
Saudi leaders need to be more forthright in opposing those who distort religion to justify the terrorist murder of innocent civilians. As the custodians of Islam's holiest places, they can speak with great authority on these issues. They can also do a better job of making sure Saudi Arabia ceases to send mullahs and money abroad in support of violent fundamentalism. In effect, they have encouraged the training of Islamic revolutionaries who may eventually threaten their own throne. The royal family should begin reducing pressures inside the kingdom by gradually opening up a system in which no one is presently held accountable for corruption and educated professionals, women and religious moderates have no meaningful voice.

Despite millions of viewers, the Super Bowl is not quite so for Madison Avenue.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THE Super Bowl is typically the biggest event of the year for Madison Avenue as well as for football fans. This year, though, the National Football League championship game will be more "adequate" than "super," losing its usual hyperbolic luster as a result of a triple whammy: the sluggish economy, the uncertain national mood and the intense competition for advertising dollars with the Winter Olympic Games, which begin just five days after Super Sunday.
 It took Fox, which is broadcasting the Super Bowl this year, until yesterday to sell out the estimated 30 minutes of national commercial time planned during Super Bowl XXXVI. That poky pace is not unusual in a downturn, when many advertisers find it hard to pay eye-popping prices for commercials during big events when they may be taking belt-tightening steps like layoffs. 
 The average estimated price Fox is charging for each 30-second commercial, $1.9 million, means that for the first time, ad rates for the Super Bowl -- traditionally the most-watched television program of the year, with an estimated 120 million to 130 million viewers -- have declined two consecutive years. The lagging demand is a far cry from the frenzy surrounding sales in 2000, when some sponsors paid ABC as much as $2.5 million for each 30-second spot. 
"Obviously, in this environment, advertisers are watching their money carefully," said Jon Nesvig, president for sales at the Fox Broadcasting Company in New York, part of the News Corporation, "and there's some pressure against some of the higher-ticket items."
"But it's still going to be strong," he added, "if you look at historic growth rates rather than expecting that the rapid escalation would continue straight upward."
Advertising rates this year are 18.8 percent above the $1.6 million estimated average that Fox charged for each commercial the last time it carried the game, in 1999. Even with the recession, Super Bowl ad rates have climbed about 67 percent since 1997, compared with an estimated 18 percent increase in that period for commercials during prime-time entertainment programs.
Industry analysts estimate that Fox will take in more than $200 million in revenue on Sunday, including pre- and postgame commercial time as well as spots on local stations owned by the network. While many Super Bowl mainstay advertisers like the Frito-Lay division of PepsiCo and McDonald's are passing on the game, they are buying commercials before or after.
"The product line we're introducing this year, 3-D's, has 13- and 14-year-olds as the main target," said John Compton, senior vice president for Frito-Lay North America in Plano, Tex., "so a better way to deliver the message was to be on in a special episode of 'Malcolm in the Middle' that Fox picked to run after the Super Bowl."
There will be commercials for 3-D's featuring the star of the series, Frankie Muniz, and packages of the new product -- a line of three-sided snacks in flavors like Nacho Cheesier -- will appear in a scene of the episode as part of a promotional sweepstakes. The campaign is a collaboration of two Omnicom Group agencies, the New York office of BBDO Worldwide and Ketchum Entertainment Marketing.
There are also new sources of revenue for Fox to replace absentee Super Bowl advertisers like MasterCard. The newcomers include the Dockers pants brand sold by Levi Strauss & Company, H&R Block, the Universal Orlando Resort operated by Vivendi Universal and the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy.
"The Super Bowl makes a ton of sense for us," said Bill Stewart, vice president for Dockers marketing at Levi Strauss in San Francisco. "Dockers has always been an optimistic American brand, and sports programming is 'appointment TV' for the guy who loves our brand." The Dockers commercial, by the San Francisco office of Foote, Cone & Belding, part of the FCB Group division of the Interpublic Group of Companies, is to run in the second quarter, along with a spot for a sibling, Levi's jeans.
Several regular Super Bowl advertisers are back, including Anheuser-Busch, with five minutes of commercials for its Budweiser and Bud Light beer brands; FedEx; the Pepsi-Cola division of PepsiCo, with two extravagant musical spots by BBDO New York featuring Britney Spears performing Pepsi jingles of the past and present; the General Motors Corporation, promoting Cadillac; and seven movie and entertainment companies, including AOL Time Warner, MGM and Viacom.
"For the last several years, we've been pursuing what we call big, bold properties in addition to our regular media schedule," said Kim Kosak, director for advertising and sales promotion at the Cadillac division of G.M. in Detroit, "and the Super Bowl is perfect to get the message out to a broad audience." Cadillac will run two spots during the game by the Troy, Mich., office of D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, part of the Bcom3 Group, carrying a new theme, "Break through."
There are even more dot-com advertisers this year (four) than last (three), as Yahoo buys its first spot during the game and joins returnees the E*Trade Group, Hotjobs.com and the Monster.com division of TMP Worldwide. Dot-com mania was the principal reason for the feverish demand for spots in 2000, when 17 online marketers bought one-shot Super Bowl commercials.
"That's no way to build a brand," said Tom McGovern, director for sports marketing at OMD in New York, a media services division of Omnicom. "They came in with one-time-only commercials instead of incorporating the Super Bowl into an annual advertising and marketing plan. That goes against every educated media strategy."
The frenzy was, as Cole Porter would say, too hot not to cool down. Now, a network's big chill can be an advertiser's hot opportunity.
For instance, the Taco Bell fast-food chain, part of Tricon Global Restaurants, took advantage of the lower prices by buying on Wednesday a commercial in the fourth quarter, to go with one it had previously bought in the third quarter. Both are by Foote, Cone San Francisco.
Two other companies that are perennial Super Bowl sponsors, Charles Schwab and the Masterfoods USA division of Mars, had initially decided against being in the game. The lower prices, however, led them to buy some of the final spots Fox had left on Wednesday.
"It was a great opportunity for us," said Scott Hudler, a spokesman for Masterfoods USA in Hackettstown, N.J. He said the commercial, by BBDO New York, would promote the company's M&M's candy brand and run during the fourth quarter. Schwab is also to appear then.
Because of the short notice, the M&M's and Schwab commercials are not being created specifically for the game. The M&M's spot will be adapted from a commercial running in movie theaters that are part of the Screenvision Cinema Network and Schwab will repeat a spot that is to appear just before the game starts.
However, advertisers who had planned for some time to buy commercials during the game are producing special spots. Those elaborate, glitzy pitches, filled with humor, special effects and surprise endings, have made the Super Bowl the one day a year when viewers pay almost as much attention to the advertising as to the program -- and sometimes more. A survey by Eisner Communications in Baltimore found that 10.6 percent of respondents said they would watch the Super Bowl just to see the commercials.
AT&T Wireless will use the occasion to introduce a big brand-image campaign by Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide in New York, a division of the WPP Group. The goal of the blitz, which includes five commercials during the game, is to popularize the phrase "m life" as a synonym for modern-day mobility, much as Ogilvy seeded the term "e-business" in the vernacular for another client, I.B.M.
"We have a big thought, and we needed to introduce it in an impactful way," said Shelly Lazarus, chairwoman and chief executive at Ogilvy, "so we're holding it for an event all America participates in."
The campaign, "Welcome to m life," will continue into the Winter Olympics, she added, with more than 30 commercials during the NBC coverage of the Games, which begin next Friday.
AT&T Wireless is not alone in buying commercial time during both big events. Others include Anheuser-Busch, General Motors and Visa. Among those bypassing the Super Bowl to take part in the Winter Games instead are Electronic Data Systems and Volkswagen.
The NBC division of General Electric, which will cover the Winter Olympics through Feb. 24, has sold about 98 percent of the commercial time that will be available during the Games. The total revenue the network expects is more than $720 million, some of which would have probably been spent on the Super Bowl had they both not been in February.
But add the Olympics figure to the Fox take for the Super Bowl, diminished as it may be, and the total approaches $1 billion.
The ad revenue that CBS will enjoy from the Grammy Awards broadcast on Feb. 27 will further fatten that one-month advertising total.
If February had more than 28 days, it might have single-handedly brought the recovery the advertising industry has been waiting for.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE POLITICS; 
In Commercial, Elizabeth Dole Is Chastised For Enron Ties

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
In their first effort to turn the Enron collapse into an overt campaign issue, Democrats today unveiled a commercial attacking Elizabeth Dole, one of the Republicans' best-known Senate hopefuls, for attending a fund-raiser given by Kenneth L. Lay, the former chairman of Enron.
 The 30-second spot, sponsored by the North Carolina Democratic Party with financial assistance from the Washington-based Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, takes to task Mrs. Dole, the former presidential candidate who is the prohibitive favorite in the Republican primary for the North Carolina Senate seat being vacated by Jesse Helms. The Democrats have not yet chosen their Senate candidate. 
 In the advertisement, an announcer intones that Mrs. Dole said she had put her campaign on hold in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks but then nine days later flew to "a secret fund-raiser" given by Mr. Lay. "Tell Elizabeth Dole we expect the truth," the announcer says.
Mary Brown Brewer, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Dole, called it "sad that the Democrats have already resorted to personal attack ads." Ms. Brewer added, "It's this kind of bitter partisanship and reckless negativity that voters are tired of."
The commercial -- unusual at a time when both parties are still holding primary contests in North Carolina -- comes as Democrats have begun trying to use the Enron collapse to portray the Bush administration and Congressional Republicans as tied to wealthy special interests.
Ms. Brewer took issue with the Democrats' advertisement. She said Mrs. Dole flew to Houston in late September to speak to a Christian women's group, then went to the fund-raiser. She said that it was not secret and that Mrs. Dole would give all contributions from Enron, its executives or its employees to a fund for Enron employees. She said that about $5,000 raised at the Houston event came from Enron.
Until now, Democrats had largely used Enron as a metaphor and as a way of raising doubts about Republican policies.
"I think we are slowly Enronizing the economy, Enronizing the budget," Senator Tom Daschle, the majority leader, said this month, speaking about the reappearance of federal deficits.
In a Jan. 28 memo to Democrats, three prominent Democratic strategists, Stan Greenberg, James Carville and Bob Shrum, said the Enron collapse "has the potential to shape the entire political environment for 2002, impact other issues and reduce confidence in the Bush administration and the Republicans."
They wrote that polls showed that the more people heard about the company, "the more corrosive it becomes."
"This is an issue where Democrats ought to talk about right and wrong, greed and responsibility," they wrote. 
More than a dozen Congressional investigations into Enron are under way. But Democrats have been cautious until now about being too overtly political and have focused on policy. Some party strategists say they do not want to overplay their hand.
This week, after the memo surfaced, Mr. Daschle said, "The last thing we should do is politicize the scandal."
But the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is closely tied to Mr. Daschle and is in charge of preserving and increasing the Democrat's fragile majority.
James M. Jordan, the executive director of the Senate Democrat's election committee, argued that the ad "fundamentally is not about Enron. It's about her campaign's lack of honesty and about politics as usual."
He said the commercial would run for at least 12 days in major media markets in North Carolina and on cable television in Washington "so the Doles can watch the ad in their home at the Watergate."
Mrs. Dole's primary residence is in Washington along with her husband, Bob. Democrats have accused her of being a carpetbagger though she grew up in North Carolina. She recently took title to the North Carolina house where she grew up and her mother still lives.
Three Democrats are also in a primary battle for Mr. Helms's seat: Erskine B. Bowles, a former White House chief of staff; Daniel T. Blue Jr., a state representative; and Elaine F. Marshall, the secretary of state. Republicans in Washington say that if Mr. Bowles wins the primary, they are prepared to use the Clinton administration's own ties to Enron against him. 
Enron was a major donor to the Democratic National Committee in the Clinton years. Mr. Lay played golf with Mr. Clinton and stayed overnight in the White House. 

CORRECTION-DATE: March 15, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on Feb. 1 about a Democratic television commercial that attacked Elizabeth Dole for having attended a fund-raiser given by Kenneth L. Lay, the former chairman of Enron, misstated a connection between him and President Bill Clinton. While they played golf together, records reviewed by a Clinton spokesman show that Mr. Lay did not stay overnight in the Clinton White House. A reader's e-mail reported the error to The Times a few weeks ago; this correction was delayed by an editing lapse.

HEADLINE: Managers and Unions Extend Talks on Jersey Journal 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD LEZIN JONES 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
The fate of The Jersey Journal, the daily newspaper that has been struggling to survive sharp losses in advertising revenue and readership, went down to the wire here tonight as union leaders and the paper's management discussed ways to keep The Journal open with layoffs and budget cuts.
 The three unions that represent the paper's 154 employees had faced a Friday deadline to agree to cutbacks, but the talks continued late tonight as both sides decided to extend the deadline to Sunday night. 
 Word that the talks were continuing were an upturn in a roller coaster of a day for the employees of the 135-year-old Journal, the lone survivor of the suburban newspaper wars in Hudson County. The publisher had told union and city officials in the morning that the paper would print its last editions on Saturday. 
The negotiations began on Jan. 2, when the paper's owners announced that within 30 days they would have to slash the paper's budget -- a plan that union leaders said included laying off half of the staff -- or the paper would close.
But talks between management and the Newspaper and Mail Deliverers' Union broke down on Wednesday, and this morning, the paper's publisher, Scott Ring, said that the impasse had led to a decision to shut down The Journal.
"The position taken by the N.M.D.U. forces us to close The Jersey Journal following the publication of Saturday's newspaper," Mr. Ring wrote in a letter to Ron Leir, the president of Local 42 of the Newspaper Guild, which represents the paper's editorial staff.
Mr. Ring also sent a letter to Mayor Glenn D. Cunningham of Jersey City, informing him of the decision.
But in a late-afternoon meeting with Representative Robert Menendez, leaders of the delivery workers' union indicated that they were willing to continue negotiations and told Mr. Menendez that lawyers for both sides were meeting.
Mr. Menendez would not discuss the specifics of the talks, but said that the delivery drivers' union was upset with a management demand to dismiss drivers regardless of seniority, a move that would incur some savings for the paper.
Tonight, Newspaper Guild members voted 28 to 1 to accept an agreement proposed by their leaders and management, which calls for layoffs and a raise for those who remained, said Christina Joseph, vice president of the local.
Earlier today, several Journal reporters gathered outside the paper's five-story brick offices here and commiserated under gray skies and light rain about the prospect of the paper's closing.
Ms. Joseph, 28, one of the younger reporters, started at The Journal a few years ago, after her very first reporting job at The Montclair Times, a weekly paper. Ms. Joseph, who covers Hoboken, said she began sending out resumes weeks ago and already had some interviews lined up.
"I've been here three and a half years, so maybe this was the kick in the pants I needed," Ms. Joseph said.
Sally Deering, who writes a humor column, said she too was interviewing, but not for newspaper jobs. "Big, high-paying jobs, not low-paying like what I'm leaving here," she said.
A veteran photographer, M. Kathleen Kelly, who won three awards last August from the Society of Professional Journalists of New Jersey, said she would try to make ends meet by doing freelance work. None of the papers in New Jersey are currently hiring staff photographers, she said.
The mood at the newspaper was understandably somber, but staff members remained focused on their jobs. Asked whether she would be able to write an article knowing that she might be unemployed in a few days, Ms. Joseph replied, "I just did."

HEADLINE: A Merciful War 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
One of the uncomfortable realities of the war on terrorism is that we Americans have killed many more people in Afghanistan than died in the attack on the World Trade Center. 
 Over the last couple of months I've tried to tabulate the Afghan death toll. My best guess is that we killed 8,000 to 12,000 Taliban fighters, along with about 1,000 Afghan civilians. 
 So what is the lesson of this? Is it that while pretending to take the high road, we have actually slaughtered more people than Osama bin Laden has? Or that military responses are unjustifiable because huge numbers of innocents inevitably are killed? 
No, it's just the opposite.
Our experience there demonstrates that troops can advance humanitarian goals just as much as doctors or aid workers can. By my calculations, our invasion of Afghanistan may end up saving one million lives over the next decade.
Ever since Vietnam, the West has been deeply squeamish about the use of force -- particularly European and American liberals, who are often so horrified by bloodshed involving innocents that they believe nothing can justify it. But Afghanistan shows that guns and bombs can save lives as much as scalpels and IV tubes do. 
Look at the numbers. In each of the last few years, without anyone paying much attention, 225,000 children died in Afghanistan before the age of 5, along with 15,000 women who died during pregnancy or childbirth. There was no way to save those lives under the Taliban; indeed, international organizations were retreating from Afghanistan even before 9/11 because of the arrests of Christian aid workers.
But now aid is pouring in and lives are being saved on an enormous scale. Unicef, for example, has vaccinated 734,000 children against measles over the last two months, in a country where virtually no one had been vaccinated against the disease in the previous 10 years. Because measles often led to death in Afghanistan, the vaccination campaign will save at least 35,000 children's lives each year. 
"You're going to see an immediate jump" in Afghanistan's health statistics and school attendance, says Mark Malloch Brown, the head of the United Nations Development Program. But he adds that truly building the country up will be a hard slog over 10 or 20 years.
Of course, the gains depend on stability in Afghanistan, and that is not guaranteed. But if the West lives up to its obligations to help Afghanistan, and not abandon it as we all did a decade ago, then the potential savings in human lives are staggering.
Heidi J. Larson of Unicef says that if all goes well, child and maternal mortality rates will drop in half in Afghanistan over the next five years. That would mean 112,000 fewer children and 7,500 fewer pregnant women dying each year. 
Likewise, a desperate rush to train 20,000 new teachers and open new schools means that some 1.5 million Afghan children will be able to enroll in elementary school when the term begins next month -- more than double the number of children who were in school a year ago.
Denunciations of the American bombing in Afghanistan pop up regularly in the United States and even more boldly in Europe and the Muslim world. A Pakistani columnist, Humayun Gauhar, described the war in his country's typically subdued prose: "The stench of Afghan flesh, the sweet smell of their children's blood (garnished lightly with one dead American) has overpowered the quest for prime target Osama bin Laden." 
Yet these critics seemed less exercised by the much larger number of preventable deaths in Afghanistan from routine ailments. I've sat in mud huts with parents sobbing as their children died of diarrhea, and trust me: Their grief is every bit as crushing as that of parents who lose children to bombs. 
Working from United Nations figures, if Afghanistan eventually improves just to the wretched levels of neighboring Pakistan, that would mean 115,000 fewer deaths a year of children under the age of 5, along with 9,600 fewer women dying in pregnancy each year.
All this underscores a simple truth, and enough time has passed since Vietnam that we should be able to acknowledge it: Military intervention, even if it means lost innocent lives on both sides, can serve the most humanitarian of goals.

HEADLINE: FORUM IN NEW YORK: PARTY; 
Billionaire? Supermodel? You're Not Invited

BYLINE:  By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
Heidi Klum, the blond supermodel perhaps best known for her ability to display the charms of the Victoria's Secret Miracle Bra, stood in a crowd of bankers, diplomats, Nobel Prize winners and executives at Brasserie on Wednesday night, marveling at the roster of parties accompanying this year's World Economic Forum, held for the first time in New York. 
 There are so many, she said, some so exclusive that even she might not be invited, like the private Elton John concert for 200 guests sponsored by Lehman Brothers tonight at the Four Seasons restaurant. 
 Ms. Klum turned to her publicist, Desiree Gruber, and asked: "Well, are we going or not?" 
"No," Ms. Gruber said, her mouth set in grim resignation. "We haven't been invited." 
Ms. Klum looked crestfallen. 
This is the World Economic Forum, New York City version, where the level of exclusivity has been ratcheted up several degrees from what were already soaring levels when the conference was held in Davos, its quiet Swiss home for the past 32 years. 
In New York, parties are not celebrations but competitive events to be judged not only by venue and expense, but by celebrity wattage and the size of the paparazzi mob waiting wolfishly on the doorstep. Because the city offers so many spectacular places for hobnobbing, and because it is the home to so many glittering people already, the forum this year is the occasion for more competitions than the winter Olympics. 
But there are more than 2,500 people attending the forum, so not everyone can be invited to everything. And the jockeying for invitations -- not to mention the battles for a lunch reservation at Le Cirque 2000 -- has begun in earnest, among a crowd that includes few people used to hearing the word "No."
Call it the W.E.F. Smackdown. 
Sir Elton was paid a fee of $1 million, according to an executive who helped to plan the event, and one Lehman banker said it was worth it.
"Considering the fees investment bankers get, we will recoup that in one deal," the banker said. 
The billionaire financier George Soros was host of a party with Klaus Schwab, the Swiss business professor who created and rules over the World Economic Forum, on Wednesday in honor of "social entrepreneurs" -- that's philanthropists, not climbers. When told of the Elton John extravaganza -- seated dinner and a serenade by Sir Elton -- his eyes widened in disbelief.
"I wasn't invited," Mr. Soros said. "Then again, the traffic is so bad I don't want to go anywhere."
Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International and a repeat Davos veteran, said that the expectations for overly grand parties were raised because of the conference's location. (He will attend his company's Super Bowl party on Sunday, at the Rainbow Room, which is going in head to head competition with McKinsey & Company's Super Bowl party at the Four Seasons.) 
"New York is sort of a 2.2 gigahertz town compared to Davos, which is a 66 megahertz town," he said, using a computer analogy. "One is very fast, and one is very slow." 
Dr. Hubert Burda, the chairman of Burda Media, which has its headquarters in Munich, played host to the Brasserie party, which besides Ms. Klum attracted the actress Kirsten Dunst, who next stars in "Spider-Man"; Geraldine Laybourne, chairwoman of Oxygen Media; Herbie Hancock, the pianist; and Elie Wiesel, the Nobel Prize winner. A half-dozen young women in black cocktail dresses and red lipstick danced around the room handing out disposable cameras so the guests could photograph one another.
Gordon Gould, the chairman of Upoc, a service that allows subscribers to exchange text and voice messages on a mobile phone or pager, said that Upoc would be especially useful at this Forum because subscribers can send messages to hundreds of people at a time about all the famous people. 
"At this Davos, it's all about celebrity-spotting," he said. "When someone sees a celebrity it affords them a bit of social currency, so they want to let other people know. Even here."
After Ms. Dunst took his picture, Mr. Gould posted some of his own celebrity sightings from the party, including "Heidi Klum in slinky black dress discussing politics at W.E.F. party at Brasserie."
Then he nodded toward a group of German businessmen.
"Where else are they going to see something like that?" he said. 
Yesterday afternoon, dozens of last-minute phone callers to Vivendi Universal, people who were not attending the conference, sought -- in vain -- to get invitations to the concert at the Waldorf-Astoria to which Jean-Marie Messier, Vivendi's chairman, invited conferencegoers. 
The concert was produced by Quincy Jones and Phil Ramone. Scheduled performers included Lauryn Hill; Branford Marsalis; the sitarist Ravi Shankar and his daughter, Anoushka, already an icon of the painfully hip; and Bono of U2, fresh from his plenary panel "On Hope" with Queen Rania of Jordan, Charlie Rose and Emeritus Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu. 
But the talk was centered less on the concert and more on the evening's potential as a symbolic coming-out party for Mr. Messier, as he continues to reshape the former water utility into a global media company. In December, Vivendi announced a $10.3 billion deal for the movie and television businesses of USA Networks. 
Last night, under tight security, about 400 people attended the party at the Four Seasons held by Douglas N. Daft, the chief executive of Coca-Cola. Its share of media and political celebrities included Rudolph W. Giulani, Senator John F. Kerry, Paula Zahn of CNN and Tom Brokaw of NBC News.
Tonight, a party at "21" to be held by Robert and Steve Forbes has attracted lots of R.S.V.P.'s, including several from people who were not invited, said Monie Begley, a spokeswoman for the Forbes brothers. 
"That is the oldest trick in the party book," Ms. Begley said. "You call up and say you're coming, when in fact you haven't been invited." She offered a blunt New Yorker's assessment of the potential crashers' chances: "I don't think so!"
A similar response came from Bill Ahearn, a spokesman for Lehman Brothers, when asked who was on the Lehman guest list for the Elton John dinner. "I can't reveal that," he said. "Everybody else who wasn't invited will get mad at me." 
He added, however, that Ms. Klum, the supermodel, was welcome to try. 
"She can call me any time," Mr. Ahearn said. "I don't control the guest list. But she can call me."

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
In a Difficult Year, Readers Rally to Help the Neediest

BYLINE:  By AARON DONOVAN 

 BODY:
Despite an economy battered by the first recession in a decade and the deadliest terrorist attack in history, this year's annual appeal for The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which ends today, has generated more money for New York's poor than any previous appeal in the fund's 90-year history.
 The fund has so far received $9 million. The final total is expected to grow in the coming weeks as gifts made this week are counted. The total has grown by more than 80 percent since the 1996 appeal, far exceeding the rate of inflation and the prior rate of the fund's growth. 
 "Such an increase would be gratifying in the best of times," said Jack Rosenthal, president of The New York Times Company Foundation, which administers the fund. "It's even more so now."
This year's campaign began in November, amid fears that the enormous amount of charitable donations for those affected by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, including donations to a special fund set up by The Times that has raised $51.4 million, would mean less money for the Neediest Cases Fund. For months, the watchword among officials at the charities the fund supports was "charity fatigue."
"Our mood was one of concern, mixed with understanding," said Donna A. Santarsiero, executive director of the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, one of the seven local charities supported by the fund. "We were very concerned because we rely so much on The New York Times Neediest Cases campaign to help the thousands of people we're able to help, the most vulnerable people in the city. On the other hand, there was an understanding that there was such an outpouring of generosity and people were probably too strained to give more."
Indeed, the first two months of the appeal seemed to prove that such fears were well founded. By Christmas Day, the fund had received 24 percent less than it had by the same point in the previous year, and every indication was that the trend would continue. And if donations continued at that early pace, by the campaign's final day the fund would have recorded the largest year-to-year decline ever.
But when The Times reported this fact, readers from around the country took note.
"Thank you for your efforts," wrote Peter Fribley of Madison, Wis., who said he had lived in New York from 1956 to 1960 and started thinking more about New York recently because he worked as a Red Cross chaplain at ground zero. He gave $25 on Dec. 31. "I plan to send more," he wrote. "I grieve that the fund is running behind."
Those who had never given or had not given in years took out their checkbooks and mailed a donation. Those who had given gave again. 
"Although I and my husband have already sent our annual donation to the fund, I was so distressed to read how far behind last year's donations this year's are running, we decided to send an additional donation," wrote Hermine Levine of Spring Valley, N.Y., along with her Christmas Day contribution of $100.
Accountants at the fund reported a remarkable surge in donations. In the six business days from Dec. 31 to Jan. 8, the daily amount given never fell below $120,000. By the end of the surge, the fund had received more than $1.7 million and for the first time was higher -- albeit just slightly -- than at the same point in the previous year's appeal.
Such an unexpected jump in donations is seldom seen in an annual campaign in which giving patterns remain largely similar from year to year. "It usually slows down in January," said Alicia A. Erickson, the accountant who keeps track of money given to the fund. "But this year donations picked up in January, even though they had been slower than normal through December."
Since the surge, the pace of giving has stayed ahead of last year's. On Jan. 15, the amount recorded surpassed the total amount given in last year's campaign, which raised just a shadow more than $8 million, a record at the time. 
The fund has continued to grow steadily for two and a half weeks. Now, many believe that the Sept. 11 attacks, rather than draining away scarce charitable dollars, may have increased the amount people gave to charity over all.
"Charity fatigue was transformed into charitable concern," said Philip Coltoff, executive director of the Children's Aid Society, another agency the fund supports. "The 9/11 giving provided an opportunity for so many people who perhaps were not givers before to see the wonderful response and rewards that come from helping others. They gave generously with 9/11, and because they didn't want to see more harm and more hurt and more victims, they gave generously again."
This year's appeal began on Nov. 4 with an article describing a night in the life of Robert Tucker, a homeless man who slept in Pennsylvania Station and aboard subway trains. In the months since, Mr. Tucker has moved into a single-room-occupancy building on the Upper West Side.
The Times expects to report the final returns of this year's appeal later this month. As charities report that they are helping more people in need because of higher joblessness, there will be more resources with which to address those needs in the coming year. "The generosity was enormous during probably the most difficult months our city has ever known," Ms. Santarsiero said. "We're both relieved and in deep gratitude for the extraordinary generosity of Times readers."

HEADLINE: FORUM IN NEW YORK: THE MEETING; 
Economic Forum Draws Rich, Powerful and 'Spoiled'

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

 BODY:
The World Economic Forum got under way in earnest last night, as rich and powerful representatives of more than 100 countries gathered at the Waldorf-Astoria to hear a panel of good-deed-doers, celebrities and even a queen reflect on whether there is still hope for hope itself in a post-Sept. 11 world -- and on what the world's haves owe its have-nots.
 "I am a spoiled-rotten rock star," Bono, the Irish singer who has campaigned against AIDS and for debt relief for poor countries, told some 2,500 participants in the opening session of the five-day gathering of movers, shakers, deep-thinkers and deal-makers. "I drink champagne, and I'll eat the cake. But there is a sense that if this is just a talking shop, it's a little close to Marie Antoinette." 
 Instead, Bono said in an hourlong panel discussion that also included former Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa and Queen Rania of Jordan, there was "a desire for the need to believe that the developed world is really interested in the developing world, and we have to prove that." The audience -- listening on headsets in French, German, Spanish, Russian, Japanese, Chinese and Arabic -- exploded in the warmest applause of the session.
In fact, this elite retreat normally held in the Swiss ski-resort town of Davos opened its inaugural session in New York with much self-conscious discussion of two themes: the aftereffects of devastating terrorist attacks, and the complaints of knots of sober protesters outside in the rain on Park Avenue that the newly global economy has left out millions of people.
Over and over, conference organizers and participants agreed that globalization could not be stopped, and that "whoever disengages themselves from it, loses," as Kaspar Villiger, the president of the Swiss Confederation, put it in his opening remarks. But Mr. Villiger also said that two-thirds of the world's population had yet to reap the benefits, and that "in order to solve worldwide problems, we need to harness the growth potential of globalization."
For her part, Queen Rania told her panel's moderator, Charlie Rose, that "there is a special mood in the world right now, when there is a global moral consciousness" that can be a force for good. But she added, "There is a danger of a bipolar world, a subliminal segregation of us and them, and that is a very dangerous view."
There may be things that have gone wrong in the world, the queen said, but she added pointedly, "I can tell you that Islam is not one of them." She said that the religion was completely consistent with modernity and social justice, and that the challenge for the world community was to find a way to do something "on the ground" to address root causes of violence and tension, like poverty.
Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York indulged in much good-natured tourism promotion, suggesting that the conference's founder and chief organizer, Klaus Schwab, resist Swiss entreaties to return to Davos in future years. But they, and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, also thanked Mr. Schwab in emotional terms for bringing the conference to New York in a sign of solidarity (and in search of world-class security) after Sept. 11.
"You have already helped us demonstrate to the world that New York is not only alive and well, but that its spirit is even stronger than it was," Mr. Giuliani said, adding, "Spend a lot while you're here!"
While New York tends to take such big events in stride, and while the Waldorf has been home to luminaries from Herbert Hoover to Cole Porter, the sheer eclecticism of this conference's guest list takes the cake. A book of "participants" as thick as the desktop edition of the Oxford English Dictionary weighed down the briefcase given to every arriving attendee yesterday, listing names from the actor Ossie Davis and the supermodel Naomi Campbell to Senator Joseph R. Biden of Delaware and James D. Wolfensohn, the president of the World Bank.
The postmaster general of the United States, John E. Potter, took a break from the specter of anthrax in the mails to work the crowd. The secretary general of NATO, Lord Robertson, held a session with reporters to insist that the North Atlantic alliance remains relevant, despite its lack of a major role in the war against the Taliban, and the actor Ron Silver was soaking up the policy talk and preparing for a more informal seminar, on "How to Become Somebody Else," with his fellow actor Warren Beatty and the directors John Singleton and Michael Mann on Friday night.
Richard Meier, the prize-winning architect of the Getty Center, waited for an elevator, as did Muhammad Yunus, the managing director of the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh, which makes micro-credit loans to the rural poor. Faces famous and anonymous alike waited in lines for over an hour to pick up the Compaq pocket personal computers issued to all attendees, so they could receive personal e-mail and schedule updates, and sign up for conference sessions.
Samuel C. Johnson, the retired patriarch of the Johnson's Wax family of Racine, Wis., waited in line, chatting amiably of his plans for a screening of "Carnauba: A Son's Memoir," a documentary about his family's re-creation of his father's 1935 seaplane trip to Brazil to hunt for wax. 
And this was surely the only convention in New York this week where it was possible to hear a young woman in an elevator, chic as a star of "Sex and the City," ask a friend: "Hi. How did the 'Bridging the Divides' session go? I didn't get to it."

HEADLINE: Public Education In Private Hands 

BYLINE:  By William C. Kashatus; William C. Kashatus is a historian for the Chester County Historical Society in West Chester, Pa., and author of "A Virtuous Education: William Penn's Vision for Philadelphia's Schools."

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA 

 BODY:
The cradle of American liberty, which championed education for all children, now finds itself in a situation that generations of its educational reformers never would have anticipated. Philadelphia's public schools are broke, the State of Pennsylvania has taken them over, and everyone expects they will soon be run by a private company, Edison Schools Inc.
 Most Philadelphians hardly wanted it this way. But after years of financial trouble in the schools and declines in school performance, the city -- despite its historic and proud tradition of public education -- has been forced to try something radical. 
 When William Penn founded Pennsylvania in the 1600's as a society dedicated to the Quaker ideals of religious toleration and participatory government, he realized that the success of his vision would require what he called a "virtuous education of youth." He established a Friends Public School system in Philadelphia that was unique for its time: it provided a universal education for all children, rich and poor, to the age of 12; and all were required to be educated. Families that could pay tuition were expected to do so, but poor children attended free, with Quaker philanthropy providing support. Community-supported education -- which became tax-supported in the early 19th century -- has been part of our earliest heritage.
This is not to say that the public schools were always without problems. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, politicians and businessmen of 24 ward boards controlled curriculum, hiring and budgets. The subsequent reform of centralization brought bureaucratization that could be rigid and stifling. And by the 1960's, the city schools, like other school systems elsewhere in the country, were weakened by urban problems of white flight, increasing crime rates and greater poverty.
Even so, the district was still able to balance its budget until the early 1990's. Then Pennsylvania changed its school financing formula, no longer tying funds for districts to their poverty levels and tax bases. Philadelphia was the district hardest hit by this change, even though most of its schools, overcrowded and with a largely poor or working-class enrollment, had become temporary way stations for the disadvantaged before their entry into the work force or the unemployment line. Meanwhile, private, parochial and magnet public schools served students from largely white, advantaged backgrounds and had better resources.
After a long funding battle with the city schools superintendent, David Hornbeck, who had finally threatened to close the schools in midyear for lack of operating money, state legislators enacted a law allowing Pennsylvania to take over the district's schools. When Mr. Hornbeck resigned in 2000, the city abolished the office of schools superintendent and divided the position's responsibilities between a chief executive, who handled finances, and a chief academic officer. At the same time, the state hired Edison Schools as a consultant to examine the district's finances and academic performance.
In December 2001, the state announced it intended to take over the district and give Edison a significant role in governance. Outraged, the chief executive resigned. Mayor John Street refused to turn the district over to the state, and angry students and teachers protested. Only when the state agreed to let Mr. Street appoint two members of a five-member state commission taking charge of the schools did he agree to a city-state partnership.
What will happen next? How will the school system be governed? Who will provide social services in the schools? What role will Edison and privatization play in the future of these schools?
Despite the rocky transition, this experiment may actually reinvigorate Philadelphia's long tradition of public education. The test will be whether the new partnership can increase academic achievement and parental involvement, improve student discipline, reduce class size, and make financing more equitable.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
Inflation Steps Up Its Pace in Europe

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
Inflation in Europe accelerated for the first time since last May, an estimate released today showed, making it more difficult for the European Central Bank to nudge economic growth by reducing interest rates.
 The European Commission said that consumer prices in the 12 nations that use the euro currency jumped 2.5 percent in January from a year ago. Much of the gain stemmed from higher food prices and higher sales taxes and, to a lesser extent, from price increases linked to the euro changeover on Jan. 1. 
 Economists and central bankers, however, say that the higher prices are being driven by one-time events. Food prices jumped because of bad weather across southern Europe, for example. And in Germany, which accounts for about a third of the euro zone's economy, the government pushed ahead with tax increases.
The bad news is that the price increases come just as Germany's biggest unions are taking an unusually hard line in demanding higher wages. IG Metall, which represents manufacturing workers throughout Germany, is pushing for wage increases of 6.5 percent and has already been exchanging combative words with industry groups.
The increases are also politically embarrassing, because at least some of them are a result of companies raising their prices amid the confusion of converting from 12 national currencies to new euro notes and coins. European leaders have insisted that the euro changeover would not lead to higher prices, but almost any shopper can point to some product or service that became more expensive right after the new money hit the streets on Jan. 1.
Statistically, economists say, the euro changeover was much less of a culprit than bad weather and taxes. 
In Italy, which suffered from drought and cold weather, food prices jumped 1.1 percent, accounting for most of Italy's rise in inflation. In Germany, which released provisional data on Thursday, lettuce prices alone soared 75 percent. Germany also raised its environmental tax on gasoline by 3.4 euro cents a liter (nearly 12 cents a gallon) and raised taxes on electricity, insurance and cigarettes.
"Apart from a few areas like restaurants and hotels, you haven't much impact from the euro changeover," said Jean-Francois Mercier, an economist with Schroder Salomon Smith Barney in London. 
European countries are showing modest signs of recovering from the global slowdown, with business confidence up slightly. But the European Central Bank has been much more cautious than the United States Federal Reserve in reducing interest rates to stimulate investment and growth. The biggest reason for that stance has been the fear of higher inflation, which the central bank wants to keep below 2 percent a year.
Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank, has cautioned for some time that prices will probably jump, but has also stressed that the broader inflation trend is still headed downward, to below 2 percent.
Even if that proves correct, however, the central bank is unlikely to open the monetary spigots again until the downward trend resumes.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Markets Edge Downward as Investors Wait and Watch

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks slipped yesterday as investors pocketed gains from two big winning sessions and pondered nagging questions over the strength of the anticipated economic rebound and the general soundness of corporate accounting. 
 "There are numbers indicating we are coming out of a recession and things in the economy are improving, but I think most people are sitting back and saying, 'I need more proof,' " said George Rodriguez, senior vice president for equities at Guzman & Company. "Some investors are putting off stock decisions because they can't afford to be wrong. They have been burned." 
 The blue-chip Dow posted a pair of triple-digit gains in the previous two days after solid earnings from companies like the consumer products giant Procter & Gamble, and a more hopeful economic outlook from the Federal Reserve.
But investors are edgy after a market surge late last year raised concerns over high valuations, and after the collapse of Enron raised questions on the reliability of financial statements.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 12.74 points, or 0.13 percent, to 9,907.26. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index fell 22.79 points, or 1.18 percent, to 1,911.24. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 8 points, or 0.71 percent, to 1,122.20.
"The mood is cautionary, a little bit unsettled," said Donna Van Vlack, director of trading at Brandywine Asset Management, which oversees nearly $8 billion. "There have been so many incredible disasters lately, like with the accounting stories, that people want to err on the side of caution and be a little bit light."
For the week, the Dow added 0.7 percent, the Nasdaq lost 1.4 percent, and the S.& P. 500 eased 1 percent. Year to date, the Dow is off 1.1 percent, the Nasdaq has dropped 2 percent and the S.& P. 500 is down 2.3 percent.
The government announced yesterday morning that unemployment fell in January for the first time in eight months. But the report also said that companies cut their payrolls by an unexpectedly large 89,000, signaling that an economic recovery may be slow to gather steam. The jobless rate fell to 5.6 percent from its six-year high of 5.8 percent in December.
The main reason for the decline in the jobless rate was an exodus of nearly one million Americans from the pool of those considered to be in the labor force. This can happen when people without jobs stop looking for work and are no longer counted as unemployed.
Stocks seesawed early in the day amid the flurry of economic data, including the mixed jobless numbers, a jump in a gauge of manufacturing and a rise in consumer sentiment. The economic data have been improving of late, but some economists are forecasting only a mild economic recovery.
"The pace of the recovery just doesn't look that robust, and given valuations where they are, the market is really in need of earnings for support, and that's a few quarters away," said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief investment adviser at PNC Advisors.
UAL, the parent of United Airlines, dropped $1.27, to $13.43, after posting a quarterly loss that was up sharply from a year ago. The airline beat expectations even though its revenues plunged after Sept. 11.
The biotechnology sector got a lift from Amgen, which rose $2.38, to $57.88. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown raised its rating on Amgen to strong buy from buy after the biotechnology company received early approval of Neulasta, a longer-acting form of Amgen's immunity-enhancing drug Neupogen. --------------------

Treasury Prices Rise
Treasury securities rose in price yesterday after news of the fall in the monthly payrolls data for January persuaded bond investors that the economy was still too weak to allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.
Data on consumer sentiment, construction spending and the manufacturing sector were largely in line with expectations, also tending to confirm the view that signs of a firming economy were still muted.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 14/32 , to 100 5/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.98 percent from 5.04 percent. 
The 30-year bond rose 19/32 , to 99 24/32 , while its yield fell to 5.39 percent from 5.43 percent.

PERSON: Joyce De Ginatta 

HEADLINE: THE SATURDAY PROFILE; 
The Industrial Evangelist of Ecuador's Revival

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador 

 BODY:
OH come on, Pepe," Joyce de Ginatta cajoles Jose Cordero, president of the congress, while discussing banking reforms on a cellphone as her chauffeur speeds her to her office. Then she calls Carlos Julio Emanuel, the country's finance minister, wooing him shamelessly: "You are my favorite minister. You know you are my cuchi-cuchi." 
 Since the late 1990's, Ms. de Ginatta, 62, an affluent importer and factory owner, has been browbeating officials in her campaign to modernize Ecuador's economy. Nobody, from congressmen to cabinet ministers to President Gustavo Noboa, has been spared. 
 She is credited with almost single-handedly pushing Ecuadorean leaders two years ago into abandoning the ailing sucre for the dollar, giving this tiny Andean country what it had long craved: stability. The reform has helped to turn around a country that, like Argentina today, was afflicted by economic freefall and with protests in the streets.
Few would blame her if she now chose to relax by the pool of her elegant home with her 12 grandchildren. But Ms. de Ginatta says her work is far from finished. She now has a list of other fiscal reforms she wants the government to adopt.
Putting in 15-hour days, the executive with the unmovable blond pompadour darts across this bustling port city to meet with officials and captains of industry, her phones ringing constantly.
In a country long known for its chaotic politics and spendthrift ways, Ms. de Ginatta has become a champion of careful fiscal management. She says her goal is for Ecuador to continue growing while avoiding the kind of economic crisis that has befallen Argentina, which after years of linking its peso to the dollar has sharply devalued its currency while defaulting on a $141 billion public debt.
"I've been obsessed with one thing -- a long-range plan for our economy," she said.
THAT obsession came to Ms. Ginatta from her experiences in business, a world in which she landed by accident. After she went to a conservative Catholic high school, her father would not allow her to attend college in the United States. He feared, Ms. de Ginatta recalled, that living in a socially liberal country would change her personality.
Instead, at 17, Ms. de Ginatta married the owner of a steel importing company in Guayaquil, started a family and settled down.
Her life might have continued that way, she said, but then her husband became ill. Little by little, she began taking on more responsibilities at the company. Inexperienced and in her early 20's, Ms. de Ginatta found the going tough. 
In Ecuador, it was rare for a woman, let alone someone so young, to be running an important company. At business meetings, she would almost always be the only woman. Invariably, she heard criticisms or belittling comments. "We were in the caveman era," she recalled.
But Ms. de Ginatta, who later separated from her husband, said the barriers motivated her. She started to read economic journals. She carefully watched world commodity markets, learning when it was best to buy imported materials. Her confidence grew. She began to restructure a company known for the poor quality steel it sold. She modernized, then began to import other home construction materials: floors, tiles, bathroom fixtures, siding.
Ms. de Ginatta moved on from that to found a line of Home Depot-style hardware stores. At age 30, she decided to attend college, and she earned a business degree. All the while, she was raising three children.
"I think when a woman takes over a company, it always begins with some sort of crisis," Ms. de Ginatta said. "And I think if I had not had that crisis, I would not have been able to get where I have gone in my life."
By the 1990's, Ms. de Ginatta was not content simply to run her companies. As head of a business federation that was deeply concerned about a worsening economy, Ms. de Ginatta began to ponder the country's needs. She began asking herself, in personal terms, what the circumstances were that had permitted her businesses to thrive.
The answer was that in the 1970's and 1980's, when her companies grew, the sucre was strong. She could "plan long-term, tell clients what prices would be long-term," she explained.
It quickly became apparent, Ms. de Ginatta said, that Ecuador needed the same conditions because people across this country of 12 million had started losing faith in the sucre.
"We did not know how to set prices since we did not know what the value of the sucre would be the next day," recalled Luis Santos, who sells tiles to home construction firms.
The problem was especially severe for companies like Cristobal Orrantia's chain of electronics stores, where customers were unable to pay for expensive electronic goods on credit. Four hundred employees, 30 percent of his work force, were laid off, and he had to close several stores, Mr. Orrantia said.
ACROSS the country, there was a rush on dollars as Ecuadoreans tried to unload sucres. Many people sold their businesses. Ms. de Ginatta unloaded her most important companies.
Certain that the answer was dollarization, Ms. de Ginatta set out with her message. Her energy and raspy voice soon became familiar to television stations and newspapers, and she relentlessly sought out everyone from small-business men to banana tycoons. She wrote economic reports that were published in newspapers or mailed off to government ministers. She recruited economists to her cause. Some opponents called her crazy, and a few said the country would be giving up its sovereignty by dropping the sucre. 
But by the spring of 1999, the country was paralyzed by strikes and the president had ordered a partial freeze on bank withdrawals, much like in Argentina today. Ecuadoreans decided a drastic solution was needed.
"The first time I heard of dollarization, I heard it from Joyce," said Mr. Santos, the owner of the tile store. "And after she explained it, I knew it was the right path." Over the past two years, dollarization has helped revive Ecuador's economy. In 2001, the the growth rate shot up 5.4 percent, the highest in Latin America, and inflation dropped to 22 percent from 91 percent the year before. Unemployment fell and investment increased.
Of course, dollarization is no miracle cure. Many economists note that Ecuador's rebound owes much to the country's largest export, oil, which enjoyed high prices in 2000. And under the bright surface of the economy, serious problems remain: an archaic banking system, shoddy tax collection and state-owned enterprises that sap resources.
Still, Ms. de Ginatta can't help but crow about the turnaround, saying she predicted dollarization would take Ecuador "from the end of the train to the front."
She heartily recommends the approach for Argentina, which for a decade linked its peso to the dollar at a value of one to one but avoided dollarization. "Oh, I think they will do it," Ms. de Ginatta said. "They will do it when they see how stupid they have been."

HEADLINE: Pataki Says He Won't Sign Bill on Lights That Dim Sky 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki said today that he would kill a bill that would reduce, over time, the light that obscures the stars over cities and highways. He said the measure would have cost the state and local governments too much to enforce and carry out.
 Mr. Pataki's decision not to sign the bill immediately drew fire from environmentalists and members of the International Dark-Sky Association, a nationwide organization of astronomers, environmentalists and others who say unnecessary outdoor lighting has robbed most Americans of a natural wonder: the stars. 
 By refusing to sign the bill, the governor effectively vetoes it under New York's legislative rules: a bill sent to the governor on the last day of the legislative session dies in 30 days if it is not signed. 
The veto came after seven months of negotiations between the bill's sponsors and Mr. Pataki's counsel; the lawmakers tried to amend the bill to satisfy the governor's objections. Last week, the bill's sponsor in the Assembly, Alexander B. Grannis, introduced a number of amendments to change requirements that the governor had found unpalatable.
In a veto message, Mr. Pataki said the bill's goals were worthy but too expensive for local governments to carry out in the current recession. He also said the bill was too restrictive for local officials making decisions about outdoor lights to deter crime and illuminate roads. Finally, he said the passages making it illegal to erect lights that bother neighbors were too broad and poorly crafted. 
"The governor wanted to fix the bill, but there were just so many flaws," said Mr. Pataki's chief spokesman, Michael McKeon. "We could also come back to this in a way that meets the goals, but this bill just had too many problems." 
Mr. McKeon added that the governor did not have an alternative bill to offer.
Had it been signed, the measure would have compelled the state and local governments to gradually replace streetlights and other outdoor lights with lights that focus light downward rather than letting it escape toward the sky. It also would have made it a misdemeanor to put up lights that bother neighbors and would direct the state to designate darkness preserves where outdoor lighting would be restricted.
Proponents of the bill said the new lights, known as full-cutoff luminaires, would save money on energy in the long run. Critics, led by former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, said the bill would cost cities and towns millions of dollars, since the full-cutoff lights would have to be spaced differently from the prevailing style, known as cobra-heads, because the light hangs below the fixture.
Mr. Giuliani asserted that the city would have to double the number of streetlights it replaced each year, at an additional cost of $20 million annually. Many town supervisors and small-city mayors also bristled at the extra work their police departments would be asked to do, writing tickets for "light trespass." The utilities in upstate New York, which own many streetlights in rural areas, also opposed the legislation.
The governor said in his veto message that the proposed law would have spawned lawsuits. The owners of a house next to a state highway, for instance, could have sued the state if the streetlights' glare flooded their property, he noted. Prisons could be sued because of the bright floodlights around them, he said.
Environmentalists, however, asserted that most of Mr. Pataki's objections were baseless. The bill only required lights to be replaced when they were worn out, and full-cutoff lights cost about the same as other kinds, they said. The amendments would have exempted governments from the light-trespass provision and would have let local officials ignore the rules if they provided a valid reason in writing to state officials.
Mr. Grannis and other Democrats said some version of the bill is likely to be approved again this year in the Assembly, where the Democrats have a majority. More and more environmental groups, astronomical societies and naturalists have signed onto the idea in the last six weeks.
But the bill may have a harder time passing the Republican-controlled Senate this year, as the state is wrestling with a budget shortfall caused by September's terrorist attack, aides to the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, said.
Senator Michael A. L. Balboni, a Long Island Republican who sponsored the bill in the upper house, said several of his colleagues who voted for the bill last year had recently expressed worries about the cost. 
"All the governor's objections are actually a way of saying this is not an appropriate time for this kind of measure," Senator Balboni said. "I can't fault the governor for recognizing the change in circumstances. I think it's going to be hard to get through the Senate this time."

HEADLINE: Goodyear to Replace Some Truck Tires 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: AKRON, Ohio, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company has offered free replacements for about 200,000 light-truck tires of the same model involved in 31 tread- separation-related accidents that killed 11 people, the company said today. 
 The offer covers 15-seat passenger vans and ambulances and will resolve a 15-month investigation of 21 million Goodyear Load Range E tires by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, an agency spokesman, Rae Tyson, said. 
 "We believe, based on what Goodyear has told us, that this will address the problem," Mr. Tyson said. 
With the investigation closed, no findings will be released, he said. 
The tires to be replaced were sold under more than 50 labels, including private store brands. The 16-inch tires were used on 15-passenger vans and ambulances from model years 1996 to 2000. 
The replacement offer was limited to a portion of Goodyear Load Range E tires because of a government warning last year that 15-passenger vans had an increased risk of rolling over under some conditions. 
Goodyear said it was not admitting any tire defect. It said tread separation could be caused by a number of outside factors, like under-inflation, an overweight load or contact with a curb.

HEADLINE: Study Puts Finland First, and U.S. 51st, in Environmental Health 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
A new study of 142 countries has found that Finland ranks first in the world for its environmental health and the United Arab Emirates ranks last, with the United States coming in at 51.
 The top five countries were Finland, Norway, Sweden, Canada and Switzerland. The five worst were Haiti, Iraq, North Korea, Kuwait and the Emirates. 
 The United States ranked behind Botswana (15) and Cuba (47), but ahead of Germany (54), Japan (62) and Britain (98).
The study found that although economic wealth does not necessarily correlate with a healthy environment, the level of corruption within a government does.
That is, the more corrupt the government, the less likely it is to pay attention to the environment. 
The study also found considerable variation among countries that were at the same level of industrialization and economic development. 
And it found that no country got good grades in every category.
It was conducted by the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy and the Center for International Earth Science Information Network at Columbia University for the World Economic Forum, being held in New York this week. Much of the commentary in the report focuses on the lack of reliable data in most countries, a challenge to experts in their efforts to set a baseline of information for future evaluations, to be conducted annually.
The study took into account 68 variables -- including how a country responds to water and air pollution, how it protects land, whether its government is corrupt and how seriously it takes global climate change -- to measure environmental "sustainability," or likely environmental quality of life over the next generation.
"No country is on a truly sustainable path," the study concluded. "Every country has some issues on which its performance is below average."
Daniel Esty, director of the Yale Center, attributed the United States' midlevel ranking to inadequacies in controlling greenhouse gases and reducing waste, offset by great success in controlling water pollution. 
"It's an interesting question for a country that is so good in some respects, why that global-scale issue has not been given more focus and produced better results," Mr. Esty said.
He said the study was intended to help countries become more rigorous in making environmental decisions.
"Some in the business community take climate change seriously," he said, "but others fear it's an issue created by a set of extreme environmental groups. If they saw the data and the picture of reality that the data presents, they might be willing to take the problem seriously."
He said that Cuba and Botswana ranked higher than the United States because they did not have as much industry and therefore as much stress on their environments. "It's not necessarily better to be in Botswana than it is to be in the United States," he said. "But there are some issues that are more serious in the United States and we can ask if we're taking those as seriously as we need to."

HEADLINE: Economy Shows Healing Signs As Recession Is Still Wheezing 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT and DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
The pace of layoffs clearly slowed last month, the government said yesterday, adding to growing evidence that the recession that began in March could be drawing to a close.
 But the economy still lost 89,000 jobs in January, in a sign that it remained weak and that any recovery was likely to be uneven, economists said. Manufacturers continued to reduce their payrolls, although at a slower rate than last year, and the sprawling service sector added workers for the first time since August. 
 The official unemployment rate fell to 5.6 percent from 5.8 percent in December, but economists called the drop a mirage. With the labor market still deteriorating, more people stopped looking for work and thus did not count as unemployed. The proportion of Americans with jobs, 62.6 percent, fell to its lowest level since 1994. 
"We're on the verge of recovery," said Bruce Steinberg, the chief economist at Merrill Lynch, "but the recession hasn't loosened its grip quite yet."
Two other reports yesterday indicated that the economy remained weak, despite recent signs of improvement. Consumer confidence was slightly lower last month than the monthly poll by the University of Michigan had initially suggested, although it remained higher than in late 2001. A survey of manufacturing executives showed that that sector was still shrinking in January, but no longer at the rapid rate of last year.
Forecasters and investors had expected the data released yesterday to be somewhat stronger, and the Dow Jones industrial average closed almost unchanged, down 12.74 points, to 9,907.26.
In Washington, President Bush said the jobs report showed that the economy remained soft. He reiterated his call to Congress to pass a stimulus package. "We've still got problems," Mr. Bush said. "Too many people aren't working. There's not enough job creation."
At its meeting earlier this week, the Federal Reserve, citing signs of economic improvement, decided to hold its benchmark interest rate steady for the first time since December 2000. The Fed had lowered the rate 11 times over the last year to encourage businesses and consumers to spend more money. 
Most economists expect the recovery to be relatively tepid because corporate profits remain weak and consumers, who continued to spend rapidly last year, have little pent-up demand for new items.
With only moderate growth, the unemployment rate will probably rise to at least 6 percent this year, forecasters say. That would be lower than at the end of every other recession in the last 30 years but much higher than 3.9 percent, the level it fell to in late 2000.
"This is not an environment where it's going to be easy to get a job," said Bruce Kasman, a senior economist at J. P. Morgan Chase. "You will see more discouraged workers."
The Labor Department said that 924,000 people dropped out of the labor force in January. Although analysts do not doubt the trend, they said that the number was far too large to be credible and probably reflected a problem in the government's seasonal adjustments.
"There are three times of the year when you pay very little attention" to big swings in economic data, said Daniel S. Hamermesh, a labor economist at the University of Texas, "and that's June, September and January."
Since last March, companies have cut 1.8 million jobs as many executives have come to realize that sales and profits will be lower than they had forecast. Government agencies have made up for some of the losses, expanding their payrolls by 350,000 workers over the same period. But the public sector shrank by 5,000 jobs last month, when budget cuts by state and local governments outweighed the federal government's recent expansion.
With hourly wages flat and the length of the workweek down, average weekly earnings for nonsupervisory employees fell $1.46 in January, the biggest decline in the current downturn. The typical worker made $496 a week, or not quite $26,000 over a full year.
In the early months of the recession, when manufacturers and technology companies were the main enterprises cutting their budgets, an unusually large number of laid-off workers held college degrees or were highly paid. But as the recession has become more broad based, particularly after Sept. 11, most of the newly unemployed have been lower-wage workers. That continued last month.
Still, the report yesterday contained many signs that the economy was starting to recover from the huge job losses that began last summer and accelerated after Sept. 11. 
The 89,000-job decline in payrolls was less than one-third the size of the average drop during the final four months of 2001. The service sector added 56,000 jobs, its first increase since August. Manufacturers cut an additional 89,000 jobs, about two-thirds of their average in recent months.
Perhaps the clearest sign of a change, although still a tentative sign, came among temporary-staffing companies, which have laid off almost 20 percent of their employees since September 2000 as their corporate clients scurried to reduce costs. Last month, these companies cut just 3,000 jobs, the smallest monthly number since the reductions began 16 months ago.
"We're not quite at the end of the process" of corporate belt-tightening, Mr. Kasman said. "But we're getting closer."
Consumers' level of confidence seems to reflect the mixed prognosis for the economy. In recent weeks, their evaluation of the economy's current condition has continued to worsen, even as their outlook for the near future has improved, according to the University of Michigan survey.
"When we ask about the future, there's a significant change in people's expectations in the last few months," said Richard T. Curtin, who oversees the survey. "We may have a stronger recovery than some have predicted but not the robust dreams of those who think that we'll jump back to 3.5 percent growth."
The economy grew 1.1 percent last year, down from more than 4 percent in each of the previous four years.

HEADLINE: FORUM IN NEW YORK: THE POLICE; 
A Second Day of Waiting, And Still No Major Protests

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM 

 BODY:
Like characters in a world drawn by Beckett, police officers waited and waited and waited some more yesterday for protesters who for the most part never came.
 Outside the Waldorf-Astoria the officers stood in a drowsy drizzle, talking in small groups about the weather and the Super Bowl. In front of Starbucks and Gap stores around the city, they sipped coffee and stood silent sentry. 
 And in Brooklyn, at the once-shuttered brig at the old Brooklyn Navy Yard, where the police had set up a center in anticipation of processing hundreds of arrests, dozens of officers were idle. 
In fact, the second day of expected protests at the World Economic Forum, a gathering of corporate and other leaders meeting at the Waldorf through Monday, was largely uneventful. There were no arrests. There were no reports of vandalism. There were no large demonstrations.
"Where are they?" asked one mystified detective, shrugging her shoulders outside the Waldorf at East 51st Street and Park Avenue, where the police had set up metal barricades for an afternoon demonstration for which a permit had been granted -- but which never materialized. By 6:30 p.m., all was quiet and not one protester had arrived.
Earlier, at midday, about 40 demonstrators, some standing on a five-foot-wide redwood stump that had been brought to New York from California, gathered outside a Gap store on 54th Street and Fifth Avenue to take the clothing company to task for, they said, using sweatshop labor and exploiting natural resources. The demonstrators waved pine boughs and held aloft hand-illustrated placards that read "Stop Sweatshops" and "A Living Wage." They also beat on congas and drums as they chanted: "Slash those sweatshops. Boycott the Gap."
In the evening at a vigil at Washington Square Park a group called the Pagan Cluster drew about 200 people to a rally. At least 50 police officers stood at the ready. The group performed a ceremony, then most of the participants wandered the square handing out protest literature or Marxist newspapers, formed drum circles and sang songs. 
Also in the evening, at the Fashion Institute of Technology, a State University of New York campus at 27th Street and Seventh Avenue, about 200 mostly college-aged people arrived to attend a series of speeches held in the Haft Auditorium. A rank of police officers formed across a two-block stretch on the sidewalk in front of the school's campus, a half-dozen mounted police officers sat atop their horses and a police helicopter made low passes overhead.
But senior police officials said yesterday that they expected a much larger turnout at protests scheduled for today. With clear weather expected after two days of intermittent rain, many more people may be drawn to the streets, especially if they are off work for the weekend.
Rallies and marches are planned for today in the area of the Waldorf, and a gala was planned for tonight at the New York Stock Exchange in Lower Manhattan.
Policing marches presents a much greater challenges than a stationary protest. Some senior police officials said they feared that more radical demonstrators bent on destruction may try to take advantage of the moving group, both as a distraction that might allow them to strike elsewhere and as a screen that can cover them if they break away and wreak havoc.
"Everything is directed toward Saturday and always has been," one police official said. But he said the department had drilled and prepared for such actions and was ready.
A briefing paper detailing special instructions for police officers warned them to be alert for impromptu marches and "professional agitators." It also cautioned officers about demonstrators who "may attempt to provoke you into taking improper police action," and warned of "decoys who will get your attention in an attempt to draw you away from an area where unlawful acts are planned to take place."
The document also noted that demonstrators around the country have become increasingly sophisticated, using both bicycle messengers and "electronic communication" to coordinate their actions. "Be sure to enforce bicycle violations," it said. "Riding on the sidewalk, passing red lights, riding the wrong way on a one-way street, etc."

Protecting the Food Supply for Some High-Powered Meals at the Waldorf

BYLINE:  By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
Caviar with creme fraiche on buckwheat blinis, wood-fired foie gras on toast points and crisp black sea bass with truffled potatoes and Champagne sauce were featured on the menu for the 250 guests at Steve and Robert Forbes's nightcap at the "21" Club last night, washed down with sips of Bollinger Grande Annee and Perrier-Jouet Grand Brut. 
 But how did the guests -- chief executives and leaders of countries among them -- know that the lavender honey-glazed duck on baby white turnips was safe to eat? And just how could Steve Forbes be sure that the people serving the tartare of spicy ahi tuna topped with Hawaiian ginger did not constitute a threat by anarchists or terrorists or anyone else? 
 Diane Biederman, a spokeswoman for "21," said that all employees of the restaurant, from the executive chef to the lowliest dishwasher, go through rigorous background checks. "You should have seen the security check I went through," Ms. Biederman said. 
At the Waldorf-Astoria, every ounce of caviar, box of raspberries and case of single malts entering the building is X-rayed, said a catering executive familiar with the hotel's high-security operations. The hotel served 6,000 meals on Thursday, from lunches for presidents to dinners for Secret Service agents; as an extra precaution, most of the ingredients had been ordered in before the World Economic Forum started. 
Security is even more intense for the party planners who usually tend to the quiet dinner parties of Park Avenue. Sonnier & Castle, a catering company in New York, was engaged to provide the food, decor and service staff for two events held last night at the New York Public Library -- the chief executive of Merrill Lynch, David H. Komansky, was the host -- a cocktail party for 400 guests and a dinner party for 100. 
"Security was very intense," said Russ Sonnier, a co-owner of the catering company. He said Sonnier & Castle had to provide, at the request of the Secret Service, the full names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, home addresses and home telephone numbers for the 55 staff members hired to work the parties. 
"They ran checks on everything from the wait staff to the party rental company to the people who would be delivering the ice," Mr. Sonnier said. The Secret Service swept the library at 3 p.m., he said, equipped with devices that detect explosive residue. They also ran a team of bomb-sniffing dogs through the entire building. 
"I would say we're pretty safe," Mr. Sonnier said. 
Bill Stanton, a private investigator and corporate security expert, said that despite every restaurant's and service's best precautions, there is always a way to use a party or dinner as a way to get close to a major political figure or chief executive. 
"You have to ask a battery of questions," he said. "Are these things prepared outside the kitchen? If so, by who? Where did they get the ingredients? Is the integrity of the food and the service absolutely sterling? More times than not, the answer is no."
Mr. Stanton, who was hired to assess security by planners of one of the grand parties last evening, spoke on the condition that he not reveal which party he had worked on. 
"You always have to think, Has someone done a background check on the dishwasher? Could the dishwasher be paid off? You have to think laterally," he said. "How would someone know that the event was taking place, and would they have an inside person? Could they feasibly put together enough information to plan and target a certain person?" 
Mr. Stanton pointed out that food and terrorism are not two thoughts that together raise a lot of suspicion. Until Sept. 11, he said, even Central Intelligence Agency employees could order large boxes of pizza and Chinese food and have it delivered without any security precautions. "We really can't forget the urgency of security at a time like this," he said. 
If anything goes wrong as the guests are sipping their wine and nibbling canapes, Mr. Stanton said, the only resort is to make sure that armed security agents are on the alert and instantly available. 
"And that's why I'm carrying a gun," he said.

HEADLINE: FORUM IN NEW YORK: THE PROTESTERS; 
To Some, Marching Is Old Hat, Even if the Issues Are Not

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
It is safe to say that when thousands of protesters take to the streets later today, very few of them will be dressed as Russian babushkas. There will, however, be a few exceptions.
 Peppered throughout the youthful throng that is expected to march through Midtown, Molly Klopot and her friends will surely burst the stereotype of anti-globalization agitators -- and turn plenty of heads. Dressed in a kaleidoscope of shawls, straw hats and flowing muumuus, Ms. Klopot and the other members of the Raging Grannies will be there to show the world that hell hath no fury like an angry grandmother. 
 "We don't break windows. We don't get arrested. We just sing," said Ms. Klopot, 82, a social worker and battle-scarred trade unionist who can still summon memories of unrest in years after Sacco and Vanzetti, the Palmer Raids and other iconic episodes in American history. "Back then we always sang, even when we were getting hit over the head by police, and blood was running down our faces."
Passionate about environmental degradation and the increasing reach of multinational corporations, the Raging Grannies, which has 78 chapters around the country, are keenly aware of their public relations prowess. "People are amused by us, but they take us very seriously," Ms. Klopot said. 
The New York branch, which was formed last year by the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, has several dozen members, including women who are not yet grandmothers. (The group here is officially called Raging Grannies and Their Daughters.) 
Stephanie Fraser, 37, the mother of a 3-month-old girl, said the group served as a foil to critics, skeptics and TV commentators intent on portraying the demonstrators as privileged Gen X malcontents.
"The media tries to depict us as spoiled brats, which makes it easier to discount our message," she said. "Any creative way we can get around that stereotype helps us get our message out."
That crux of that message is pointing to poverty and inequality around the world. Like many anti-globalization advocates, the Raging Grannies say they believe that increasingly powerful corporations, embodied by the World Economic Forum, are harming democracy and human rights. 
"People need to realize that we are in a death spiral," said Premilla Dixit, 52, a filmmaker from Brooklyn. "The global corporate economy has created a very deep disconnect between the generation alive today and the one that will come after," she said. Like the woman's suffrage and labor movements of yesteryear, the Raging Grannies rely on a repertoire of familiar songs, albeit with new lyrics. One such tune, which will make its debut today, is sung to the tune of Irving Berlin's "There's No Business Like Show Business" and goes like this:
 There's no business like war business, the worst business we know.
Never mind the homeless and the hungry, Never mind the people without jobs
Nowhere can you get that special feeling than when you're piling up the bombs.

HEADLINE: City College, the Faded Jewel of CUNY, Is Recovering Its Luster and Its Achievers 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
For 30 years, City College has been maligned as the good child gone bad in the City University family, with critics saying that its shining promise was smashed by admission policies that turned the college into a lackluster remedial mill.
 But by some measures, City College, once famed nationally as the Harvard of the poor, has begun to match or beat out rivals in the City University of New York like Queens, Brooklyn, Baruch and Hunter Colleges that had been eclipsing it in recent decades. 
 The college is re-emerging at or near the top on indexes like freshman SAT scores and high school averages as a result of a pool of high-achieving immigrants; new recruiting programs that stress its strength in engineering, architecture and science; an enticing honors program; and sharp reductions in the number of less-well-prepared students.
For generations, City College, located in Harlem at West 135th Street, was a refuge for the city's poor and working-class strivers, where students excluded from the Ivies and other top colleges because of race or religion could get a top-notch education. Eight City College students went on to win Nobel Prizes, and the college produced such celebrated graduates as Jonas Salk, who developed the first polio vaccine, and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. 
But in the late 1960's, advocates of open admissions argued that too many black and Hispanic students were excluded as a result of poor preparation in failing public high schools. As a result, admissions criteria throughout the 17 campuses of CUNY were loosened and City College began to attract many of the city's poorly prepared high school students. Critics soon complained that the college's quality had declined sharply, and by the 1980's, university officials acknowledged that it was fifth among CUNY's senior colleges instead of first. 
But the most recent admissions statistics indicate that all that seems to have changed. 
"City College is now taking steps to return to those days when its reputation was a reputation of excellence," said Eugene S. Blaufarb, an assistant principal at the city's most selective public high school, Stuyvesant in Lower Manhattan, who said that more Stuyvesant students were again applying to the college.
"Not only is it a turnaround in the numbers of students who are applying," he said. "There is also a turnaround in who's applying. The kids who applied before tended to be our underachievers. Now it is our real achievers."
The top 25 percent of the applicants that City College accepted as freshmen through its regular admissions procedure from American high schools last fall tied for the highest SAT scores among CUNY's 17 campuses: an average combined mathematics and verbal score of 1,200 out of 1,600. Only Queens College matched that figure. If SAT scores for all of the regularly admitted freshmen applicants from American high schools are used, City's 1,089 average was second only to Baruch's 1,096, and up from less than 1,000 just four years ago.
To be sure, CUNY officials point out that the difference between City College and CUNY's other senior colleges on admission statistics is small and can change from year to year. But many CUNY professors who have seen these scores are startled to see how City College has begun to regain its former stature. And it has done so, its top officials stress, without sacrificing the diversity of its student body.
These figures do not include scores for economically and educationally disadvantaged students in CUNY's SEEK program (Search for Elevation, Education and Knowledge), who are admitted separately and are at all the senior colleges. But even those students are now closer academically to the regularly admitted students than they used to be. And the number of SEEK students has been cut; last fall's entering class at City College had 157 SEEK students, down from 279 a year earlier.
"We have a very, very strong student body," Gregory H. Williams, the college's new president, said on Thursday in an interview. "With the end of remediation, it has gotten much stronger this year. We're on the right trajectory." 
Some of the improvement in academic scores is clearly a result of CUNY's fiercely debated decision several years ago to improve its reputation by removing remedial courses from the curriculum of its 11 senior colleges and to direct weaker students to its 6 community colleges.
The shift has probably benefited City College more than the other senior colleges because its student body changed so much after open admissions and because the change drew so much attention. In the book "City on a Hill: Testing the American Dream at City College," James Traub described City College classrooms filled with students who did not write or speak English well. 
That book, along with a growing chorus of attacks from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and other critics, prompted CUNY's trustees to remove remedial courses from their senior colleges. The new policy, phased in over three years, took effect at City College last September.
Critics of the tighter admissions policies expressed concerns that CUNY would now be turning away those students who needed its help the most, including many poorly educated minority and immigrant applicants who did not yet have a strong command of English. 
Dr. Williams said that the academic improvement among entering students has not resulted in a change in demographics. Students in minority groups make up more than three-quarters of City's student body, he said, with the largest groups being Hispanic and black. While he acknowledged that the number of E.S.L. students -- those needing to learn English as a second language -- had decreased, he said the college was still hospitable to immigrants.
"This is not being done on the backs of E.S.L. students," he said, adding that half of City's students were born outside the United States.
While the latest SAT scores do not put City College on a par with the Ivy League, the college has begun to capture the interest of some of the city's strongest students for the first time in a long time. Many are drawn by the modest tuition ($3,200 a year for state residents), and free tuition to those who qualify for CUNY's new honors program, which also provides them with free laptop computers and covers other academic expenses. More than 200 honors applicants for next year have designated City as their first choice.
Students interested in areas where City is especially strong, like biomedical engineering and architecture, are electing City, often after being admitted to more selective campuses. "Financially, it came down to City College or Manhattan," said Asad Chaudhary, a freshman honors student at City who was also accepted at Columbia, R.P.I. and the State University of New York at New Paltz. "And Manhattan had absolutely no diversity."

HEADLINE: Rutgers President Known for Fund-Raising Resigns After 11 Years 

BYLINE:  By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
The president of Rutgers University, Francis L. Lawrence, announced today that he would resign as soon as the university's board of governors named his successor.
 Dr. Lawrence, 64, came to the state's flagship public campus in 1990, facing recession-driven budget cuts, and he will be leaving just as a new recession and new budget cuts face the university. 
 During his time at Rutgers, Dr. Lawrence has focused on strengthening undergraduate education and improving campus technology.
But from the outset, critics found Fran Lawrence, as he is best known, to be a cool and somewhat distant figure after the gregariousness and political savvy of his predecessor, Edward J. Bloustein, who spent his energy building up Rutgers as a research campus. Mr. Bloustein died of a heart attack in 1989 while in office.
In a letter to the Board of Governors, Dr. Lawrence gave little reason for leaving his job, which pays $287,000 a year. He said in a statement that, after consulting his family, he had decided that it was "time for me to plan to step down."
He added, "I will return to the faculty upon the installation of my successor."
Gov. James E. McGreevey issued a three-sentence statement this evening that began, "I congratulate President Lawrence for his stewardship of Rutgers University, particularly the successful capital campaign," and ended by saying that the governor looked forward to "a new generation of leadership at Rutgers."
As the governor noted, Dr. Lawrence has been a tireless fund-raiser during his nearly 12 years in office. Since 1988 alone, he has raised nearly $377 million of a six-year program's $500 million goal.
During his time in office, external financing of research and other academic programs at Rutgers grew to $224 million from $92 million. He said in his statement today that he would like to continue to oversee the capital campaign.
Yet Dr. Lawrence was dogged from the outset with problems with a restless and often discontented faculty. Rutgers is one of the few major state universities to be fully unionized, under the American Association of University Professors.
Faculty members shadowed his speeches looking for ammunition to use against him and in 1995 they recorded him telling a faculty meeting that "disadvantaged" students did not have "the genetic hereditary background" to do well on standardized tests.
He later said he did not know why he said it, and insisted that the sentiment was the opposite of his true feelings, but the incident provoked a firestorm of criticism from some student and faculty members demanding his resignation.
The board of governors, however, delivered a vote of confidence in the president.
Many faculty members continue to be critical of Dr. Lawrence, complaining that he cut programs he did not consider important to shift money to other areas.
Thomas J. Figueira, who is leading an effort to form a new union associated with the New Jersey Education Association, the public school teachers' union, accused Dr. Lawrence of unfairly cutting a summer program in classical languages he had founded. "He canceled an economically viable program because he didn't like me any more."
But other faculty members said Dr. Lawrence's focus on building Rutgers's technology infrastructure and on fund-raising deserved praise.
"We were an electronic cow path when he got here," said Professor Barry V. Qualls, professor of English and dean of humanities.
"The ability to attract world-class faculty, and the ability of the faculty to feel that this is a world-class institution -- those are not signs of a university that has no leadership."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 5, 2002

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about the planned resignation of Frank L. Lawrence as president of Rutgers misstated the period in which he raised nearly $377 million for the university. It was the last three and a half years, not the period since 1988.

White House Is Ordered To Keep Records of Enron
The Justice Department ordered the White House to preserve records of contacts between government officials and Enron executives over the last three years, a sign that federal prosecutors have broadened their criminal inquiry to the company's ties in Washington.
 The request, made in a letter to the White House counsel, prompted the administration to order all agencies not to destroy any records related to Enron. Page A1. 

The sister and a son of Kenneth L. Lay, the former chairman, both benefited through extensive business dealings, including contracts and investments, with the company. A1.

Stocks Flag After 2 Days of Gains
Stocks slipped as investors took profits after two sessions of advances. The economic data continued to be mixed, possibly indicating a mostly muted recovery, while investors also remained concerned about the general reliability of financial statements. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 12.74 points, or 0.1 percent, to 9,907.26. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 22.79 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,911.24. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 8 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,122.20. C3.

Ruling Threatens Argentine Banks
In a surprise decision, the Argentine Supreme Court ruled that the country's freezing of bank withdrawals was unconstitutional. Anticipating that the decision could set off a run on banks and on the peso, Argentine authorities declared a bank and currency exchange holiday on Monday and Tuesday. A4.

United Airlines Posts Quarterly Loss
UAL, the parent of United Airlines, reported a fourth-quarter loss of $308 million that included gains of $332 million, federal aid among that. Its revenue tumbled 39 percent. C2.

Delta Flight Attendants Reject Union
Fewer than a third of eligible Delta Air Lines flight attendants voted in favor of joining the Association of Flight Attendants. The vote was a sharp setback to unionization drives at the traditionally nonunion airline. C2.

White House Seeks Fuel Authority
The Bush administration is requesting broad authority from Congress to revamp the system used to set fuel-economy standards. Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta said in a letter that the current system has led to smaller, lighter cars that are responsible for more highway fatalities. C3.

No Margin Calls for WorldCom Chief
Bernard J. Ebbers, the man who built WorldCom into a giant company, owes $92 million more than his company stock is worth. But because his debts are in different ways tied to the company, it is unlikely he will be selling his stock any time soon. Part of his debt is owed directly to WorldCom, and other loans are guaranteed by the company. C2.

Inflation Rises in the Euro Zone
Inflation in countries that use the euro jumped 2.5 percent in January from a year ago. The rise makes it harder for the 12-nation group to cut interest rates to nudge growth. C2.

U.S. Promises Aid, Our Way
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill defended the administration's decision to cut off aid to Argentina, saying "they just didn't reform." Separately, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said the administration was committed to aiding the world's poor as part of an effort to assure widespread economic development. The conditional help left some bristling. A10.

Goodyear Offers Replacement Tires
Goodyear Tire and Rubber has offered free replacements for about 200,000 light-truck tires of the same model involved in 31 accidents related to tread separation. Eleven people were killed in those accidents. C15.

HEADLINE: Starting at Ground Zero 

 BODY:
The news that the developer Larry Silverstein is gearing up to break ground on a new 7 World Trade Center should be a warning bell for all New Yorkers concerned with the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan. The city-state agency created to oversee that redevelopment must finally get organized. The public's views need to be officially heard, and planners should begin working with all deliberate speed. Otherwise the city is not going to get what it really deserves -- a magnificently designed and masterly coordinated downtown Manhattan. 
 Mr. Silverstein, who was the leaseholder on the World Trade Center when it was destroyed, apparently feels that he and his architects will be the leading voices in designing what replaces it. The site of 7 World Trade Center is across the street from the towers destroyed by terrorists, and Mr. Silverstein's power to rebuild there quickly is less legally complicated than his rights over the rest of the site. But whatever he decides to do there will have a big impact on the entire area. While Mr. Silverstein promises a "spectacular" building, his ultimate goal should be a building that fits into a spectacular new plan for downtown Manhattan. 
 The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation is in the process of setting up advisory committees on what to do with the site. These panels should immediately begin providing forums for the many passionate voices concerned about downtown's future. John Whitehead, the corporation chairman, is going to have to figure out how to give these many views their rightful due, while still coming up with an inspiring and unified proposal for the area.
The sudden appearance of an array of New York politicians on the advisory panels is worrisome. Too many political egos could produce a collective mush of a design that ultimately pleases no one. Great architecture requires a great architect and a great client. When the public is the client, it is too easy to wind up with little more than a compromise. Mr. Whitehead's corporation has the difficult task of making certain these public figures are heard but that the final plan is also an urban work of art.
While the committees are thinking, the businesses that valiantly stayed in Lower Manhattan after the attack are still having to cope with the problems that come from disrupted utility connections and lack of mass transit service. Unlike 7 World Trade Center, these pieces of infrastructure must be replaced right away. The corporation should step in quickly to determine whether to restore the old clump of electrical substations at 7 World Trade Center or spread smaller stations through downtown. The corporation must find out how much money -- especially federal money -- can be used to revamp PATH, the subways and other transportation links. There are now numerous transit proposals drifting around the city, some temporary and modest, others elaborate ones that advocates have been dreaming about for years.
Somewhere in the middle is a solid plan from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey that makes it possible to restore the area's transit in stages. The Port Authority is to begin working immediately on a temporary PATH connection to New Jersey that can be completed within two years. Later the builders could construct underground walkways stretching eastward from the World Financial Center across to a subway transit center at the Fulton Street station. This plan would try to replace the tangle of tunnels and stairways at Fulton Street with a more workable transit hub.
Mr. Whitehead's group needs to juggle many tasks at the same time -- the infrastructure must be mapped out and financed, Mr. Silverstein must be brought into the fuller picture and the public must be allowed to have its say before it is too late. The outcome should be a dramatic monument to the vibrancy of the city, a whole downtown plan far more powerful than the sum of its many parts.

HEADLINE: In New Blow to Peso, Argentine Court Voids Bank Freeze 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
In a surprise decision that pushes both the financial system and the wobbly peso closer to collapse, Argentina's Supreme Court ruled today that a freeze on bank withdrawals, imposed two months ago to prevent nervous depositors from cleaning out their accounts, was unconstitutional.
 President Eduardo Duhalde has warned that local banks do not have enough assets on hand to meet depositors' demands. Anticipating that the court's edict could set off a run on banks, the central bank tonight declared a bank and currency exchange holiday for Monday and Tuesday. 
 In a brief nationally televised speech tonight, Mr. Duhalde said that the court's decision was "very serious" but gave no indication how he intended to respond. 
"I know that a lot of people may be happy today, supposing they will go to the banks and get their money back," he said. "No one should be fooled," he added, warning that Argentina "is at risk."
Speaking of the bank freeze, Mr. Duhalde declared: "I've said since the first day that this is a time bomb that has to be disarmed, and carefully, so that it doesn't explode. If this bomb goes off, not only will those with deposits and accounts not be able to get their money. The whole Argentine system of production will be affected."
Mr. Duhalde had been expected to announce an economic stimulus plan over the weekend in an effort to break out of the economy's paralysis. The presentation of his plan was canceled today.
In its ruling, the court said that the bank freeze, originally ordered by former President Fernando de la Rua two weeks before food riots and street protests forced him to resign, was "unreasonable" and constituted an "annihilation" of the principle of private property. Depositors, it said, "have been the victim of injury to their patrimony" since they originally deposited their money under "a set of rules that guaranteed immutability."
The decision came exactly one month after Mr. Duhalde was sworn in as president, promising amid the worst economic crisis in Argentina's history that he would make this a "normal country" again. Today's ruling generated considerable new uncertainty in an economy that is already at a virtual standstill because of doubts about its direction. 
Finance officials are concerned that if depositors regained access to their accounts, they would immediately rush to convert their pesos into dollars, forcing the the government to abandon the official exchange rate of 1.4 pesos to the dollar and unleashing a steep devaluation. 
Mr. Duhalde's first action as president was to abandon the decade-long policy of linking the peso to the American dollar at a one-to-one rate. But he has repeatedly equivocated on how to lift the freeze on bank deposits, which had been in place for a month when he took office.
Loath to anger ordinary Argentines, Mr. Duhalde initially ordered that all dollar debts be converted into pesos at a rate highly favorable to debtors, which would have meant billions of dollars in losses for banks. But then, when foreign creditors and banks threatened to walk away from Argentina, Mr. Duhalde decided that dollar deposits should also be transformed into pesos, at a rate less advantageous to account holders.
"It's an extremely complicated situation," lamented the government's minister of production, Jose Ignacio de Mendiguren, in an interview today that reflected the government's sense that it has no options. "You touch one thing, and another goes out of balance. You touch that, and something else falls out of equilibrium."
At the same time that Mr. Duhalde has been vehemently blaming the banks for Argentina's misfortune, he and other officials have tried to rebuild their frayed ties with foreign creditors, which were severely strained when Argentina went into default on $141 billion in public debt at the end of December.
In a visit to Washington this week, Foreign Minister Carlos Ruckauf met with Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell as well as officials from the International Monetary Fund.
Argentines' growing fears have prompted them to wait in long lines outside banks and currency exchange houses in recent days in hopes of buying dollars in spite of unfavorable rates of exchange.
By most estimates, only 10 percent of Argentina's 36 million people have money deposited in the banks. But it is precisely that middle and upper class that must begin spending again so that the economy can be reactivated. With most of their money locked up in the banks, however, middle-class Argentines have been too frightened -- or too angry -- to spend anything.
According to a study published this week by Fundacion Mercado, an economic analysis group, only 1.8 percent of Argentine families generated any savings in January and no more than 1.7 percent had plans to buy durable goods. "That is the equivalent of eliminating both those items from the economy," the group said.
Car dealers say that January was their worst month in 40 years, with only 3,000 vehicles sold in the entire country, compared with nearly 29,000 in the same period two years ago and 19,000 last year. 
Businesses selling much cheaper goods appear to have been just as hard hit. During the 1990's, many of them shifted from selling locally made products to imported goods, but now find themselves sitting by helplessly and watching their inventories diminish with no chance to replenish them.
At an office supply and computer parts store here, salesmen are down to their last meager stocks of ink cartridges, computer disks and paper punches. Normally, those items are imported either from the United States or neighboring Brazil, but after Argentina's foreign debt default lines of supply have dried up and sales dropped from $500,000 a month before the recession to one-tenth of that figure.
"No banks are willing to give anybody in Argentina any credit right now, and I can't get dollars out of an account to pay in advance," said Gustavo Tozzo, the store's manager. "We're stuck."

HEADLINE: New Orleans, Amid Revelry, Makes Time to Vote Today 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
They cannot intrude upon the fantasy world of a Mardi Gras parade without defying a local taboo against Carnival campaigning. They can barely claw onto the airwaves without being engulfed in a fog of news about the most carefully guarded Super Bowl in history.
 So a huge field of candidates who want to run this slightly ungovernable city have had a hard time making their voices heard before Saturday's mayoral primary election, which ends less than 24 hours before the football championship. Politics here has always been as much theater as policy, but this year the audience is otherwise engaged. According to the polls, nearly a third of voters have yet to decide on a candidate from among the 15 jostling to succeed Mayor Marc A. Morial. 
 The field mushroomed in October after Mr. Morial's bid to bypass term limits in search of a third four-year term was defeated by the voters. Some of the candidates are linking themselves to his continued popularity, while others are distancing themselves from his reputation for patronage. But even the clear front-runner, Richard J. Pennington, the police superintendent, has only about 20 percent of the vote, most polls have found. So a runoff on March 2 between the top two vote-getters in the nonpartisan primary on Saturday is considered a certainty.
Most of the tussle has been for the No. 2 spot, and the insurgent candidate now considered most likely to get it is C. Ray Nagin, an executive with Cox Communications, which operates the local cable television system. Mr. Nagin won endorsements from The Times-Picayune and the popular political and cultural publication Gambit Weekly by promising to move away from the patronage that has perennially filled municipal jobs and contracts here.
"The city and state have a reputation for being pretty free-spirited," Mr. Nagin said in an interview today as he tried to shake hands with actual voters among the football throngs on the streets. "It's not like people offer you bags of cash in dark alleys, but I think we need to change the nature of politics here by being more customer- and business-friendly."
That approach has propelled him out of the pack in recent weeks and into the front ranks. For years, the city was preoccupied with a high crime rate, but during the tenure of Mr. Morial and Mr. Pennington, murders and other felonies have dropped sharply. Mr. Pennington continues to campaign on that accomplishment, but the race has turned more on economic issues.
"The city is getting smaller, and voters are increasingly concerned about its future," said Edward Renwick, director of the Loyola University Institute of Politics. "We're down to one Fortune 500 company, and many businesses have left the city. People want to hear what the candidates will do about it."
Mr. Pennington says crime reduction and a new emphasis on education will strengthen the city's economy. "I always felt that before you could have economic development, you had to have a safe city," he said. "Now that we have that, we can concentrate on bringing businesses back to the city."
Mr. Nagin, on the other hand, has proposed selling or leasing Louis Armstrong International Airport and using the revenue to rebuild decaying infrastructure and create jobs.
Another candidate, State Senator Paulette R. Irons, has been the most explicit in tying the shrinking of the economy to municipal patronage; she promises to revamp the city's contracting system completely. But her standing in polls dropped after she said she understood the nature of crime in the city because her brother had been murdered. It turned out he had been shot by the police while robbing a supermarket.
A few classic traits of New Orleans politics have not been drowned out. A grocery produce manager on the ballot as Manny (Chevrolet) Bruno says he will have no friends to pay off because he has no friends.
And the negative advertising and campaigning that might be unsettling elsewhere are expected here, particularly because it is often unclear who is paying for telephone messages that bash various candidates. Mr. Nagin, who like Mr. Pennington is black, is often portrayed on the telephone as a tool of the white business community in this predominantly black city, but among the most vicious things said about him is that he personally raised cable television fees.

HEADLINE: Economic Forum Is New York's Gain 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Bereft, Swiss Town Pines for Jet-Set Movers and World-Class Shakers" (news article, Jan. 31):
 Before the famous globalization meetings, Davos, it seems, was "just another Swiss ski resort." 
Well, not quite. Davos was the town station where patients and visitors disembarked to travel the short distance to the tuberculosis sanitarium in Thomas Mann's "Magic Mountain," published in 1924. 
 Since the novel was published, and for a long time thereafter, "Davos" evoked Mann's novel in the minds of Europeans and, later, Americans as well.
And in that novel, while there may be no exact parallels to the globalization meetings and the unruly protesters, Mann's book is full of high politics, loaded with heated and weighty political debates about European history that both globalization defenders and their opponents might find interesting today.
Of course, one wonders what Mann's characters (and Mann himself) would say about McDonald's and street clashes, but that's another story.

HEADLINE: FORUM IN NEW YORK: WORKSHOPS; 
Where McDonald's Sits Down With Arab Nationalists

BYLINE:  By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

 BODY:
When critics assail the World Economic Forum as a gathering of tycoons and rulers, what they imagine is probably not Jack Greenberg, the fatherly chairman and C.E.O. of McDonald's, sitting alongside Amr Moussa, the often strident secretary general of the League of Arab States, debating the sources of global anger.
 But there they were today, in one of the better attended panel discussions, as the 2,500 participants at the Waldorf-Astoria went into their second day of workshops, lunches and private powwows. 
 The views of Mr. Greenberg and Mr. Moussazap were hardly surprising or radical. Mr. Greenberg defended his global chain of fast-food restaurants, which are often singled out by antiglobalization demonstrators, as "a model of how a corporation has to behave -- through dialogue, facts and solutions." Mr. Moussa said there were "deep grievances" against the policies of the United States in the Middle East, Africa and other parts of the world. 
But there was significance in the very fact that the forum -- known to its regulars as Davos, after the Swiss resort where it has always been held before -- focused several of its workshops, panels and lunches on the rising opposition to the globalization of business. 
Such emphasis on a concern that government and corporate leaders now frequently confront reflected the organizers' effort to give their critics a voice. An impressive security cordon around the Waldorf-Astoria demonstrated the immediacy of that concern, though only one lonely protester braved the chilly drizzle across Park Avenue from the hotel today.
"Davos is always a crash course on what's new in world trends and world thinking, and the fact that it's jumbled, that you feel confused, is part of the process," said Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, author of "Commanding Heights: the Battle Over the World Economy," and one of the panel leaders. 
"For a couple of years," he went on, "Davos was dominated by the global financial crisis, then two years ago it was the New Economy. Now, after major demonstrations at major economic meetings in the past year or two, there are these profound questions about globalization -- how does it work? What it is? What is its impact? For me, the amazing thing in a way is that there is so much passion about a word that has five syllables, about an abstract concept. Much of the debate about globalization doesn't really stop to say what is globalization."
That was a point made by several speakers, and addressed by some. "We still don't know what we mean by globalization, or what we want it to mean in the future," argued Felipe Fernandez Armesto, a professor at Oxford University, at a discussion of the future of antiglobalization. "The antiglobalization coalition is even looser than the coalition against terrorism. Some object to modernity, some to capitalism, some to excesses of capitalism. It is not against globalization, but against process bias -- rich versus poor, north versus south, west versus east."
Back at the "global anger" panel, Zaki Laidi of the Centre d'Etudes et de Recherches Internationales in France, developed the theme further. The reaction, he said, was not against globalization, but specifically against capitalism, against the rich and against the United States. The perception was that globalization is reducing the creation of goods while creating private wealth; that the process is biased against the poor; and that its agenda is shaped by the United States, by the major industrialized countries, by the World Trade Organization, without any tolerance for alternative prescriptions.
Finally, Mr. Laidi said, there was resentment against the United States as the only superpower, "which so influences the world while its own population has no interest in the world."
That theme -- that the United States uses its great wealth and power solely in its own interest -- surfaced repeatedly in various discussions. Michael J. Wolf, of the international consulting firm McKinsey & Company, suggested that the attacks on McDonald's or Starbucks outlets often occurred as a reaction to a perceived invasion of American culture to the detriment of local culture. "The media is a carrier of values," Mr. Wolf argued. "A show about rich people in New York and Los Angeles is incendiary to a lot of people."
The discussion was not all one-sided. Mr. Greenberg, who appeared to hold a special cachet as a spokesman for globalization because of the symbolism that McDonald's outlets have acquired around the world, said he knew that what he was about to say might be deemed provocative, but that "oftentimes the perception about global anger is somewhat different from the reality." 
As an example, he recalled the fiery 1999 World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle, where protesters went on a rampage and, among other things, vented their antiglobalization anger on a McDonald's. In the time that it took almost 2,000 protesters to damage property, Mr. Greenberg said, more than 175 million customers were served in McDonald's restaurants around the world.
Mr. Laidi went further, suggesting that responsibility for the failures of globalization were shared between rich and poor, because less developed countries were unable to put aid to good use. "The transfer of money from north to south is obviously part of the solution," he said, "but in many cases it is solving nothing, because there is a misuse of resources. This is a real problem, a real concern."
At yet another panel -- this one on "Who's Afraid of Globalization?" -- Davos organizers released a poll taken in 25 countries, rich and poor, that found a slim majority in poor countries agreeing that they benefited from globalization. The most negative reactions were in countries that have been hit hard by financial crises, like Indonesia or Argentina. The strongest support was in the United States and other developed countries, and it grew even stronger after Sept. 11.
Several analysts raised the notion that the terror attacks had changed attitudes toward globalization. One of them, John Gray of the London School of Economics, even suggested that "9/11 spelled the end of globalization." Ernesto Zedillo, a former president of Mexico, dismissed this as "hysterical." The attacks only demonstrated that "we need more globalization, not less."

To the Editor:
Re "The Great Divide," by Paul Krugman (column, Jan. 29):
 I strongly disagree with the idea that Enron's fall was bigger than the events of Sept. 11. 
Enron was about thousands of people who lost their jobs and their fortunes. It was also about some cowboys in Texas trying to play business, which is placing the focus on corporate governance and impartial accounting. Sept. 11 was about several thousand people who lost much more than that. 
 We sympathize and empathize with those who lost what they did in both events, but one must ask what is more important: money and a job, or your life?
I think that the effect on our economy, national self-confidence and overall well-being was shaken more by Sept. 11 than by selfish and underhanded business tactics. By comparing the two, Mr. Krugman seems to trivialize the significance of that day.

HEADLINE: Auto Sales Shrank 5.1% In January 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
Auto sales in the United States fell 5.1 percent in January compared with the month a year earlier and shrank even further from the strong sales at the end of last year as the enthusiasm for generous deals began to wane and the rental car industry continued to face problems. 
 But the decline was less than many analysts and economists had feared, and some say 2002 could be better than expected. 
 By January, all of the Big Three had retreated from the interest-free financing deals they had offered after Sept. 11. Those deals drove industry sales to the highest monthly level ever in October. Incentives took a different form, with General Motors offering $2,002 in rebates on its vehicle lineup and the Ford Motor Company offering rebates up to $2,500. Still, the end of interest-free financing was expected by many to bring steep declines. 
"Everyone was waiting for the cliff to fall off of," said Diane Swonk, an economist at Bank One. "Instead of going to a 15-million-unit pace, we could have easily seen sales drop to 13 million units," she said, adding, "The auto industry will surprise a lot of people this year."
Ford officials went further, proclaiming an end to the recession while cautioning that the pace of recovery might be modest. 
"What is particularly encouraging at this juncture is that so many economic indicators are improving at the same time," said Jarlath Costello, Ford's senior United States economist, citing gains in consumer confidence and stronger orders for capital goods. 
Ford raised its expectations for industry sales this year to 15.7 million cars and light trucks, including sport utility vehicles, pickups and minivans, from 15.2 million. In January, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales was 15.8 million, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank, a data service in Southfield, Mich.
"Given the fact we're in the middle of a recession and a hangover from zero-percent financing, the numbers are pretty good," said David Healy, an auto analyst at Burnham Securities. 
Still, there was some sobering news. The Lear Corporation, a big auto supplier based in Southfield, Mich., said today that it would cut 6,500 jobs. And Ford, G.M. and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler all lost more market share to foreign competitors.
The sales declines at the Big Three were worsened by a steep falloff in sales to the rental car industry, which has suffered since Sept. 11 because it does much of its business at airports. In November, ANC Rental, which operates the Alamo and National rental car chains, sought bankruptcy protection. Last month, the company said it would close nearly 200 Alamo sites. 
Ripples from the fallout in the rental industry could be seen in sales of passenger cars at the Big Three. At G.M., overall sales fell 13 percent, but G.M.'s light truck sales rose 10 percent while car sales fell 34 percent. At Ford, where overall sales declined 10.4 percent, car sales fell 17.5 percent while light truck sales fell 6.3 percent. But the company, which announced a turnaround plan last month, said the drop was something of a relief.
"We expected our sales to be down in the range of 15 or 20 percent," said George Pipas, Ford's sales analyst. 
At Chrysler, sales fell 9 percent, which was not as bad as some analysts feared after the company made an ominous warning earlier in the week that it was increasing spending on incentives because of a disappointing January. 
If the overall market was a pleasant surprise, the Big Three domestic automakers continue to come under pressure from Asian and European manufacturers. At Toyota, which ranks fourth in sales in the United States, sales rose 7.1 percent as it continued to gain on Chrysler, the smallest of the Big Three. Sales at Honda fell 1.5 percent, while sales at Nissan rose 9.6 percent, helped by a redesigned Altima sedan. Volkswagen sales rose 6 percent, and sales at B.M.W. were up 16.2 percent. 
Those sales gains came with far less spending on incentives than was the case with the Big Three, and foreign car are helped by exchange rates that are highly favorable. 
"The pricing environment has not substantially lessened," Mr. Pipas of Ford said. "It's still very intense. I expect that to remain difficult, and it's one of the challenges we face, we all face, in this coming year and for years to come."

HEADLINE: ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: EX-CHIEF'S FAMILY; 
Son and Sister Of Enron Chief Secured Deals

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA and KURT EICHENWALD 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
The sister and a son of Kenneth L. Lay, the former chairman and chief executive of the Enron Corporation, benefited from extensive business dealings with Enron, according to public records and interviews with family members and people close to the Lays.
 The ties included Enron contracts with companies controlled by Lay family members and investments in companies in which family members had substantial holdings. 
 Over the last three years, Mr. Lay and his son Mark, 33, invested about $1 million in two privately held technology companies. Months after the deals, Enron signed contracts with both of them and invested in one of the companies. 
In 1997, as a shareholder group was complaining about such ties, Enron acquired a company co-owned by Mark Lay that hoped to go into the business of trading paper and pulp products. Kenneth Lay knew at the time that Mark Lay and an energy company Mark controlled were targets of a federal criminal investigation of suspected bankruptcy fraud and embezzlement, Mark Lay said.
As part of the deal, Enron hired Mark Lay as an executive with a three-year contract that guaranteed him at least $1 million in pay over that period, plus options to purchase about 20,000 shares of Enron. 
In addition to the dealings with Mark Lay, Enron for years has used the services of a Houston travel agency co-owned by Kenneth Lay's sister, Sharon Lay. According to public filings, the agency, Alliance Worldwide, has booked more than $10 million in revenue from Enron, representing over half of the firm's business.
Mark Lay and Sharon Lay said that nothing improper took place in any of the transactions. All required disclosures on Enron's dealings with family members were made, they said, adding that Kenneth Lay did not use his influence to award Enron contracts to companies with family ties. Enron declined to comment, and Kenneth Lay and his lawyer did not return phone calls.
No charges were brought against Mark Lay in the criminal investigation, which came to an end last year after the United States attorney in Tyler, Tex., decided not to pursue the case. Mark Lay, who left Enron last year to enter a local Baptist seminary, paid nearly $315,000 to settle a related civil case, without admitting to any wrongdoing.
"I walked into a snake's nest," the younger Mr. Lay said in an interview this week, describing the business affairs that led to the criminal investigation. "I trusted the wrong people and ended up in a transaction that everybody decided was wrong." 
Legal experts said there were no clear violations of securities laws in the Lay-Enron dealings. But critics said the transactions were further examples of how top officials of Enron entangled themselves in a pattern of conflicts.
"This only underscores our concern about the self-dealing that permeates the board at Enron," said Bill Patterson, director of the office of investment at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which estimates that its member unions' pension funds lost $1 billion in the Enron collapse.
Enron first mentioned dealings with Lay family members in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the mid-1990's. 
Mark Lay left a low-level position at Enron in 1992, went to work at an energy trading company and then struck out on his own in 1994. After that, the records show, three successive small companies he owned or worked for did business with Enron.
One company was Bruin Interests L.L.C., a natural gas company that had a contract to store billions of cubic feet of natural gas in Enron's underground storage tanks. Bruin, which also did consulting work for Enron, traded and speculated in natural gas; Mark Lay was a co-owner.
Bruin later acquired a stake in R&C Petroleum, an East Texas energy company, after it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March 1994. The company was quickly restructured, but continued to pile up huge losses.
Later that year, a court-appointed trustee for R&C's creditors filed a civil suit against Bruin and several other companies, contending that Bruin and its affiliates engaged in a series of complex transactions with one another that allowed the companies to hide R&C assets and siphon money away from the bankrupt company and its creditors. They charged the R&C management team, including Mark Lay, with embezzling more than $1 million.
"They were hiding assets and stealing assets," said Cindy Scarbrough, an accountant who followed the case with her father, one of the early investors in R&C. "They had all these partnerships and shell corporations, and they would charge transportation costs that were way above normal."
Mark Lay said that he was not involved in the scheme, insisting that his partners in the R&C venture manipulated him and stole the profits. People who worked with Mark Lay said that the lawyers arrayed against R&C focused on him in the litigation because he was the son of the wealthy chairman of Enron.
"I was just 25 years old," Mr. Lay said, "and I trusted the wrong people." Like Mr. Lay, several of his associates in R&C paid to settle civil litigation without acknowledging wrongdoing.
Mr. Lay said his father was "supportive" throughout the episode; it was on his father's advice, for example, that he hired a lawyer from Vinson & Elkins, the law firm that represents Enron.
Robert Crist Vial, a lawyer for one creditor in the R&C bankruptcy case, said in-house Enron lawyers monitored some of the legal proceedings.
"I know and will swear under oath that Enron attorneys attended some of these hearings for him," Mr. Vial said. "I asked them why they were there, and they said, 'Ken Lay is Enron, and this is the man's son.' "
Just months after the civil suit was settled in 1996, and while the criminal investigation remained active, Enron acquired another company owned by Mark Lay, the Paper and Print Management Corporation. Mr. Lay and his partner, another former Enron employee, hoped the company would be a pioneer in the business of trading paper and pulp products, but it had not signed up a single client when Enron acquired it.
Rather than pay a purchase price, Enron gave Mark Lay and his partners three-year, $1 million pay packages. Enron also agreed to pay a division of the Southern Company, another large energy company, $1 million to drop its investment in Paper and Print.
The deal seemed to pay off for Enron; within 18 months of acquiring Paper and Print, the division generated about $20 million in operating profit, Mark Lay said. 
Paper and Print had itself been spun off from another Houston company for which Mark Lay had done consulting work: the United Media Corporation. United Media at one time did about $1 million a year in graphics business with Enron, creating graphic illustrations for executive presentations, according to people who worked at the company. Mr. Lay said that he had no role in the Enron contracts.
More recently, Mark and Kenneth Lay -- like Enron -- turned their attention to the Internet. In May 2000, the two men invested about $500,000 in an Internet start-up called EterniTV, a company that provides video services over the Web. 
Four months later, Enron, which had ambitious plans at the time to build a broadband distribution and trading business, signed a contract to help EterniTV deliver its content. 
Officials at EterniTV said there was no connection between the investment and the contract. "It's pure coincidence that we used Enron," said Jonathan Kirk, chairman and co-founder of EterniTV, which is based in San Francisco.
In December 1999, in an early round of financing, Kenneth and Mark Lay invested close to $500,000 in EC Outlook, a Houston company that develops supply chain management software, Mark Lay said. The two men then recommended the company to Enron, which invested in a later financing round in September 2000 with VenRock Associates, a venture capital fund created by the Rockefeller family. 
In February 2001, EC Outlook said, it signed a licensing agreement with Enron to use its software.
John C. Coffee Jr., an expert in securities law at Columbia University, said it did not appear that Enron was required to make disclosures related to the technology deals.
"It's not a classic conflict of interest," he said. "It may simply be illustrative of the kind of backscratching, incestuous relationships that occur in the business world. And it could have ripened into a conflict of interest."
Enron's disclosures of its dealings with Sharon Lay's travel agency and a consulting agreement with Mark Lay's Bruin Interests prompted shareholder complaints at a union meeting in 1997. The company defended the deals as proper.
Ms. Lay said that her company won the contract as Enron's lead travel agency through competitive bidding. 
"There are some who thought it was only because of my relationship to Ken that we got the contract and that's far from the truth," Ms. Lay said. "It's unfortunate that you can be put at a disadvantage because of a relationship."
For now, Mark Lay, who has worked off and on at Enron for much of the last decade, is taking a break from business. In 1995, when the R&C episode was in full bloom, he said, he paid a visit to the Second Baptist Church in Houston, where the minister was preaching about Daniel's survival in the lion's den.
"That gave me a true appreciation of what a true faith in God meant," Mr. Lay said.
Last year, after serving as president of Enron Investment Partners, a unit of Enron that invested in minority-owned businesses in the Houston area, he enrolled at the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Houston.
"I think God impressed on me that's where he wanted me," Mr. Lay said.

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Saturday about business dealings between the Enron Corporation and the sister and a son of Kenneth L. Lay, the former chairman and chief executive, included an incorrect paraphrase of remarks by the son, Mark Lay, about a criminal investigation into one of his companies. Mark Lay said that he thought the inquiry had concluded in 1995, not that he and his father knew there was an investigation in 1997. The investigation continued until 2001, according to lawyers involved in the case.

HEADLINE: State of the Enron 

BYLINE:  By FRANK RICH; E-mail: frankrich@nytimes.com

 BODY:
I had just finished crying over the tragic news that President Bush's mother-in-law had lost $8,000 on her Enron stock when another heartbreaking story sent me reaching once more for the Kleenex. There on the "Today" show this week was the sobbing figure of Linda Lay, Ken's wife, telling America the most rending tale of dispossession since the Yankees stole Tara from Scarlett O'Hara.
 "Other than the home we live in, everything we own is for sale," said Mrs. Lay. "There's nothing left." Given that her husband has received some $200 million in compensation from Enron since 1999, and that he (as she explained) was kept in the dark about his own company's shell games, the message was clear: The Lays are the biggest victims of the entire scandal, bigger victims by far than those grandstanding employees who complain of having lost pensions in the piddling five, six or seven figures. 
 As if the Lays' predicament is not upsetting enough, the "Today" show left us wondering if the second-biggest victim of Enron's collapse may be the Holocaust Museum Houston, whose representative came on-screen along with various clergy and Lay offspring to testify to the family's beneficence. If the Lays are broke, you had to ask, is it only a matter of time before the Holocaust is consigned to the Houston memory hole along with the Astrodome? 
I'd still be weeping as copiously as Linda Lay had I not subsequently read in The Wall Street Journal that she and her husband still owned 18 properties in Texas and Colorado, only two of which are up for sale, and that Ken Lay still owned $10 million in non-Enron stocks. Thankfully, others are lending emotional support to the couple in my stead. After ministering to Mr. Lay, Jesse Jackson likened him to Job.
Linda Lay's "Today" performance was coached by a freelancing alum of Hill & Knowlton, the wonderful p.r. folks who have made Americans fall in love with such past clients as the Tobacco Institute, the Teamsters and the Church of Scientology. Perhaps Mrs. Lay hoped she might rev up the nation's sympathy for her man, who rolls out his hear-no-evil, see-no-evil, speak-no-evil defense when testifying before Congress on Monday. But what lingers instead is her colossal arrogance. Just as Ken Lay misled his own employees about the sinking financial health of his company, imploring them to buy more stock while dumping his own, so Linda Lay takes us all for dupes, ready to be sold another bill of goods while she and hubby plot their next escape to Aspen. She didn't even identify which of the Lay sons was the target of a criminal investigation for bankruptcy fraud and embezzlement.
This is why Enron may be as much a cultural scandal as it is a business and political scandal. It is, as one friend puts it, as if a window had opened and revealed the way it all really works. What we see is a world in which insiders get to play by one set of rules -- entree to Enron side partnerships that could turn minimal investments into millions overnight -- while the unconnected and uninitiated pick up the bill. And it isn't necessarily illegal. All manner of creative accounting schemes took root in the corporate loophole land that was protected from reform in the 90's by such inquisitors-come-lately as Joseph Lieberman and Billy Tauzin, both recipients of accounting-industry largess. It's going to be easier for the Feds to nail mid-level scapegoats, especially those operating shredding machines, than to prove that a Ken Lay or Jeffrey Skilling had felonious intent. 
Nor is this culture limited to one party or one company. Terry McAuliffe, the Democrats' chairman, has called Enron "simply outrageous" and declared that his "heart goes out to the employees and shareholders who were victimized by a web of greed and deceit." Now we learn that he parlayed a ground-floor $100,000 investment in the Bermuda-based, Beverly Hills-situated telecom company Global Crossing into $18 million and cashed out well before Global Crossing went belly-up this week, after having never turned a single yearly profit. We are to believe it is Mr. McAuliffe's business acumen that landed him on that ground floor in the first place, not the buddy network he cultivated as chief fund-raiser to his president, Bill Clinton. "If you don't like capitalism," said Mr. McAuliffe in defense of his windfall, "move to Cuba or China."
I wonder if Mr. McAuliffe's heart goes out to a schoolteacher who, having lost more than $120,000 in Global Crossing, told The Times this week, "I don't know how the management of this company did so well while small shareholders did so poorly." Gary Winnick, Global Crossing's chairman and a Clinton-McAuliffe golf partner, walked away with $730 million.
Perhaps that benighted teacher should go back to school and study the bipartisan gospel of both Mr. McAuliffe and our Treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, who has cited Enron's swift rise and fall as a natural phenomenon "of the genius of capitalism." Under their tutelage, she would learn how Thomas White, the Bush administration's secretary of the Army, could legally exit with more than $10 million of proceeds from an Enron division that, according to his colleagues, overstated its profits by hundreds of millions on Mr. White's watch (he was vice chairman) and has since tossed overboard most of its employees.
President Bush believes that his impressive stewardship of the war will make these stories go away, and so he chose not to mention the word Enron during his State of the Union address. But the country gets the picture now, and the more Dick Cheney tries to defend the secrecy of his energy policy task force, the more he sounds as arrogant and disingenuous as Linda Lay. No less an authority than John Dean has declared of Mr. Cheney's stonewalling that "not since Richard Nixon stiffed the Congress during Watergate has a White House so openly, and arrogantly, defied Congress's investigative authority."
For all the vice president's lofty talk of the principle of executive branch confidentiality, The Times's Don Van Natta reports that the administration had no qualms about releasing an avalanche of records from the Clinton White House. Mr. Cheney has even violated his sacrosanct principle of confidentiality about his own meetings when it suits him politically. As The Los Angeles Times reported last August, the task force did depart from its pledge of secrecy once, when officials paraded a group of renewable-energy experts before White House reporters after their meeting with Mr. Cheney. How cynical can you get? That show meeting took place on the day before the energy plan was sent to President Bush. In reality, environmentalists had about as much serious access to the secret deliberations over Bush energy policy as common stockholders did to the secret partnerships at Enron. 
Since we already know that Enron did have repeated meetings with the Cheney task force, what is he covering up? Logic dictates there must be some bombshells among the non-Enron names, starting with any from the vice president's former (and now imperiled) employer, Halliburton. Equally revealing are the names of those he rebuffed. This week Dianne Feinstein, the senior senator from California, revealed that her three requests to meet personally with either the president or the vice president during her state's energy crisis were denied even as the administration greeted Enron executives bearing wish lists.
Like Linda Lay, the Bush administration asks that we take its ethical purity on faith. In defending the energy task force, Ari Fleischer went so far this week as to invoke the founding fathers on behalf of clandestine administration dealings with oil company executives. "The very document that protects our liberties more than anything else, the Constitution, was, of course, drafted in total secrecy," he said. Never mind that the names of those drafters, unlike the modern-day patriots meeting with Mr. Cheney, were not kept secret. These days freedom's just another word for nothing left for Enron shareholders to lose. 
POSTSCRIPT: After my previous column, Mr. Fleischer called me to say that I had been unfair to Lawrence Lindsey, the administration's chief economic adviser, when I wrote that during a Jan. 12 appearance on CNN he had not mentioned overseeing an October administration review of the impact of Enron's travails. Mr. Fleischer says that Mr. Lindsey was doing exactly that when he spoke on CNN of his staff "monitoring the energy markets." I guess I didn't notice because I was too busy wondering why Mr. Lindsey, a $50,000-a-year Enron adviser as recently as 2000, would have been connected to any such review.

HEADLINE: Sharon Said to Meet Secretly With 3 Aides to Arafat 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel met here secretly this week with three Palestinian leaders acting as emissaries of Yasir Arafat, Palestinian officials said.
 It was the first time Mr. Sharon had met with any Palestinian official since winning election as prime minister almost a year ago. His office declined to comment on the matter. 
 The meeting did not appear to portend an imminent breakthrough to negotiations. Both sides were said to have restated their clashing views. Also, in an interview published today by the newspaper Yediot Ahronot, Mr. Sharon said he would urge President Bush in a meeting next week to sever ties with Mr. Arafat. 
"Boycott him," Mr. Sharon said, summarizing his message to the president. He said he would urge that Mr. Bush "not hold any contacts with him and not send any delegations to him."
Mr. Bush has not so far met Mr. Arafat, and refused even to shake his hand when the two passed close to each other at a United Nations meeting in New York last fall.
But Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, Mr. Bush's special envoy for the Middle East, has met the Palestinian leader, most recently on a visit this month, before a fresh wave of violence.
Palestinian officials said tonight that Mr. Sharon sent an envoy to Mr. Arafat on Tuesday to set up the meeting with top deputies to the Palestinian leader. The meeting reportedly took place in Jerusalem on Wednesday night.
The Palestinian officials at the meeting were Ahmed Qurei, the speaker of the Palestinian parliament, and Mahmoud Abbas, a top leader of the Palestinian Liberation Organization. Both men, known respectively as Abu Ala and Abu Mazen, are regarded as advocates of negotiations rather than violence. Khaled Salam, an economic adviser to Mr. Arafat, also took part. 
Palestinian officials said the delegation had demanded an end to Israeli military operations in Palestinian-controlled territory and the carrying out of plans to return the antagonists to the negotiating table.
The Israel radio reported that the meeting had focused on stopping violence. Mr. Sharon has repeatedly said he would permit no negotiations while fighting continues.
Mr. Qurei has been meeting frequently with the Israeli foreign minister, Shimon Peres, to hammer out a plan for resuming negotiations. But Mr. Sharon, expressing skepticism about their talks, has said he must approve any agreement.
Mr. Sharon was likely to draw severe criticism from his political right for even speaking to representatives of Mr. Arafat. But news of the meeting was first reported by the Israel radio at the beginning of the Jewish Sabbath, during which newspapers are not published in Israel and politicians generally fall silent out of conviction or deference to the religiously observant. 
Mr. Sharon's domestic critics were thus denied a platform for 24 hours. In the meantime, the gesture toward peace was likely to receive wide international attention.
The prime minister has been seeking to isolate and put pressure on Mr. Arafat diplomatically and militarily in order, he says, to prompt him to crush militant Palestinian organizations. Israeli Army tanks are stationed on Palestinian-controlled territory within 100 yards of Mr. Arafat's compound in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Israeli forces have blocked Mr. Arafat from leaving Ramallah for two months now.
In the interview with Yediot Ahronot, Mr. Sharon said, "I don't think that we have exhausted all the pressure."
In an interview published on Thursday by the newspaper Maariv, Mr. Sharon said he was sorry Israel did not kill Mr. Arafat when it had a chance in Lebanon 20 years ago. But in speaking of the current impasse, he told Yediot: "We pledged not to harm Arafat physically. Nor did I set as a goal expelling him from here."
Politicians to his right are urging that he take even more aggressive action against Mr. Arafat. 
Today, in an op-ed article published in Maariv, Benjamin Netanyahu, the former prime minister and Mr. Sharon's chief rival, scorned the notion of any "central members" of Mr. Sharon's government "speaking with the Palestinian Authority."
"Arafat's regime must be toppled, and it must be done immediately," he wrote. A majority of Israelis, 54 percent, believe that Mr. Arafat himself should be toppled, according to a poll published today in Maariv.
Polling here shows that the public overwhelmingly approves of aggressive actions against the Palestinian Authority. But a plurality also supports more aggressive efforts toward peace.
Yediot described Mr. Sharon as amused by a poll showing that 70 percent of Israelis wanted him to deal severely with the Palestinians, while 70 percent also wanted him to give up the West Bank and Gaza Strip. "So what should I do?" the paper quoted him as saying.
Recent polls suggest that support for Mr. Sharon is softening somewhat. Today's Maariv poll showed his public approval rating at 48 percent. In the poll, 37 percent approved his handling of security, and 18 percent approved of his handling of "socio-economic matters." The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.

HEADLINE: Communities Built on Steel Fear Its Collapse 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WHEELING, W.Va. 

 BODY:
For decades, steel making has meant fat paychecks and steady jobs for thousands of families in the Ohio Valley towns that stretch north from here.
 But now there is fear, bordering on panic, that the hometown steel company that has brought middle-class prosperity could be at death's door. That company, the Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation, has filed for bankruptcy, and its managers and workers say that the blast furnaces, rolling mills, foundries, coke ovens and galvanizing shops -- as well as a way of life -- could go under any day now unless Washington rushes to the rescue and somehow limits low-cost imports. 
 "It would be devastation, absolute devastation up and down the valley," said Charlie Stock, a Wheeling-Pitt worker. "I'm 50 years old, 32 years in the mills, with just a high school education. What am I going to do? I don't think there's much demand for a blast furnace keeper." 
Such fears are being heard in Ohio Valley towns like Beech Bottom, Follansbee, Steubenville and Mingo Junction and throughout steel country, where more than two dozen steel makers have filed for bankruptcy over the past four years. Tens of thousands of steel workers fear that they may soon lose their jobs, their anxiety heightened by the recent decision by one of the largest steel companies, LTV, to shut down, throwing 7,500 employees out of work across the Midwest. These workers, many in their 50's, are left with a few months' health insurance and dismal prospects.
At Wheeling-Pitt, workers and management have long blamed each other for the industry's woes, but they agree on one thing, that President Bush must do something soon to prevent other steel makers from suffering LTV's fate. Now that a federal commission has found that low-priced imports have improperly hurt the industry, they want him to impose tariffs of 40 percent on foreign steel.
While the Bush administration has often professed free-trade beliefs and a dislike of tariffs, the steel industry has one big factor working in its favor. Many mills are in West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio, swing states that played a major role in the 2000 presidential election and could make the difference again.
Many West Virginians say that if President Bill Clinton had granted the import relief that they are seeing from President Bush, Vice President Al Gore would have won West Virginia and that would have given him the presidency.
"It hurt Gore badly" said Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, a West Virginia Democrat and a champion of the steel industry. "The political implications of not doing anything are huge. We're talking about all these people going from $48,000 a year, a big salary here, to zip. No health insurance. No salary. No future. No hope."
Joe Smarella, who has worked for 38 years in Wheeling-Pitt's 80-inch rolling mill, said that he comes from a family of Democrats -- his grandfather worked in the mills for 40 years and his father for 43 years -- and that he voted for President Clinton twice. But Mr. Smarella admitted that he was so angry about the Clinton administration's resistance to higher steel tariffs that he voted for Mr. Bush in 2000.
"I got smacked once or twice," Mr. Smarella said. "That's it for me. I'm not going to let them smack me a third time."
This is a region with long memories. The workers remember that President Clinton visited Weirton Steel in West Virginia, right after he was nominated in 1992, and promised to stop foreign steel from being dumped at rock-bottom prices. The workers also remember that Dick Cheney visited Weirton on the eve of the 2000 election and pledged that the Bush administration would keep the steel industry strong.
If anything, the industry has grown weaker since Mr. Bush's election. One of the historic giants of the industry, Bethlehem Steel, has filed for bankruptcy. Steel prices have dipped to $200 a ton, the same price as 20 years ago. Wheeling-Pitt, a unit of WHX, has lost more than $300 million since it filed for bankruptcy reorganization 14 months ago.
There are many reasons for the steel crisis: the recession, low steel prices, high wages, old blast furnaces, a surge in steel imports after the Asian economic crisis in 1998, the rapid growth of mini-mills that make steel from scrap, and the colossal liability that steel makers face for health insurance and pensions for retirees.
The retirees are both a burden and a weapon. With four times as many retirees as workers -- 600,000 compared with 150,000 active workers, the industry is barely able to finance the health insurance and pensions for the retirees. But those 600,000 retirees and the 400,000 spouses and other family members who share in their benefits represent an even more powerful voting bloc than those still working. The retirees are flooding the White House with postcards because they want Wheeling-Pitt and other steel makers rescued to safeguard their health insurance and pensions.
Wheeling-Pittsburgh's roots go back to 1852, with the opening of a nail factory along the Ohio River -- the steel towns on the west bank are in Ohio, those on the east bank are in West Virginia. In some communities along the Ohio, 40 percent of the families send someone to the mills each day. Supermarkets, auto dealers, bars and gas stations also depend on steel dollars.
"The steel industry is critical to the existence and well-being of our community," said Anthony Paesano, mayor of Follansbee, W.Va., a town of 3,000 that obtains more than 20 percent of its taxes and school budget from Wheeling-Pitt's operations. "Everybody is worried, and everybody is waiting for the president of the United States to act."
The Bush administration has not tipped its hand on what it will do. But administration officials say that if they grant import relief, the industry must consolidate. With this in mind, U.S. Steel, the nation's largest steel maker, has floated a plan to acquire Wheeling-Pitt and three other companies and to close several inefficient plants.
Wheeling-Pitt was ready to close its doors two weeks ago, but after some frantic negotiations, the governors of Ohio and West Virginia, investors and the United Steelworkers of America came up with $27 million to keep the company running. In an unusual move, the union at Wheeling-Pitt agreed to a 27.75 percent pay cut for several months. All this maneuvering saved the jobs of the company's 4,100 workers, at least for a few more weeks.
"If Mr. Bush says no relief on imports, the next day I'm shutting this company down," said James G. Bradley, Wheeling-Pittsburgh's chief executive. 
Saying that imports have badly undercut prices and destroyed profitability, Mr. Bradley argued that high tariffs were needed to lift prices and nurse domestic steel makers back to health.
But many experts say granting the tariffs would only delay the extinction of the nation's steel dinosaurs.
John Casey, a steelworker wearing a Pittsburgh Steelers jacket, had little patience for that attitude.
"We've lost the textile industry," Mr. Casey said. "We've lost the consumer electronics industry. Is the steel industry going to go the same way? And if it does, what's going to be left of the middle class?"

HEADLINE: Bush Seeks to Revamp System for Auto Fuel-Economy Standards 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
The Bush administration asked Congress today for broad authority to revamp the nation's regulation of fuel-economy standards, but it is unclear whether it wants to set more lenient standards or increase the fuel efficiency of the nation's auto fleet. 
 The request was made in a letter from Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta to Congress and came as the Senate Commerce Committee prepared to make proposals on the current system. 
Under corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE, standards, each automaker's annual fleet of new cars must average 27.5 miles a gallon, and new light trucks must average 20.7 miles a gallon. 
 "The current CAFE system has created an incentive for manufacturers to produce smaller and lighter cars," Mr. Mineta wrote, adding that studies show that lighter vehicles can be more dangerous than heavier ones. Mr. Mineta proposed setting various guidelines within different weight classes and allowing companies to trade fuel-economy credits. 
The auto industry had been pressing the Bush administration to take the matter out of the hands of the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats. By contrast, the auto industry successfully worked to keep the matter out of the Transportation Department's hands when it was controlled by the Clinton administration. Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the CAFE hearing, said recently that he took a dim view of "forum shopping" and appears intent on raising fuel- economy standards. 
Leonardo Alcivar, a spokesman for the Transportation Department, said that Mr. Mineta's letter "is a clear declaration that the administration is committed to a significant improvement in fuel efficiency."
But environmental groups continue to be skeptical and say the administration's intent is to delay any action on the fuel standards, which have not been raised significantly since the 1980's.

HEADLINE: Amtrak Sets Austerity Plan And Seeks Aid 

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
Facing mounting debts, Amtrak announced a sweeping austerity plan yesterday while threatening to end legendary long-haul passenger routes like the Empire Builder if Congress does not provide $1.2 billion in financing next year. 
 To cut costs, Amtrak will eliminate 1,000 union and management jobs, about 4 percent of its national work force. It will also defer station improvements and limit the refurbishment of rail cars to urgent repairs. Ticket window hours at 73 of the least-used rail stations in the nation will be shortened, while spending for advertising, marketing and research will be reduced. 
 Over all, Amtrak hopes to save $285 million this year. But the cost of repairing stations and thousands of miles of track keep mounting, and Amtrak -- which lost $1.1 billion last year -- will remain in the red. 
In making the announcement today, the company's president, George D. Warrington, abandoned efforts to reach operational self-sufficiency by the end of this year, a goal mandated by Congress. By asking for $1.2 billion in the federal budget that President Bush will introduce on Monday, Mr. Warrington made it clear that he thought the railroad could not run properly without subsidies. He issued an ultimatum to Congress and the White House: Provide enough money or Amtrak will systematically end most of the long-haul passenger service that only Amtrak provides. Routes like the Chicago-to-Seattle Empire Builder and the Crescent, which links New York and New Orleans, would disappear as soon as October. 
"Corporate profitability is not compatible with the operation of long-distance trains, which by their nature are and always will be unprofitable," Mr. Warrington said. "Policy makers need to decide what kind of passenger rail system America needs, how much the system requires in capital and operating support and how the government will pay for the system."
Amtrak's moves will sharpen the debate over the railroad company, a government corporation formed in 1971. Ridership has increased steadily over the last few years, but the economic downturn has cut into the railroad's income by as much as $120 million, Amtrak estimates. Adopting additional security measures after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks cost $16.5 million. 
Sept. 11 highlighted the importance of a national rail system providing an alternative to air travel. For its part, the Bush administration is pressing for a thorough reassessment of passenger service in the United States.
Amtrak's Congressional authorization expires before the end of the year, and Congress is divided over reauthorizing the system, which carried more than 23 million passengers last year. Members of Congress from the Northeast and the Pacific Coast, where high-speed rail service is heavily used, continue to support Amtrak. In much of the rest of the country, where trains run infrequently and ridership is low, the railroad is often seen as a waste of money. 
In recent months, both the General Accounting Office and the Amtrak Reform Council, which Congress established to keep an eye on Amtrak's finances, have concluded that Amtrak has no chance of weaning itself from subsidies. 
Thomas A. Till, chairman of the council, said the government should pay to upgrade the nation's railroad tracks and bridges and maintain them. But in a report scheduled to be delivered to Congress on Feb. 7, the council will recommend that about 400 miles of track in the Northeast Corridor be taken from Amtrak and financed directly by the government. The council will also suggest that private operating companies be allowed to compete with Amtrak. 
Amtrak officials have argued that the council's actions have hurt the railroad. Mr. Warrington said lenders walked away from $52 million in financing for equipment and services after the council issued its finding on Amtrak's ability to become self-sufficient. 
Railroad unions also opposed the council's actions. A federal judge yesterday denied their request for a temporary restraining order to prevent the council from presenting its restructuring plan to Congress on Feb. 7.

HEADLINE: Budget Would Cut Medicaid Payments 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
President Bush's budget would rein in the growth of Medicaid by reducing payments to public hospitals and by cracking down on state efforts to obtain extra federal money to finance health care for the poor, administration officials said today.
 The administration says it is "closing loopholes" and curbing "abusive practices" that states have used to expand Medicaid without putting up all the state money required by federal law. 
 But state and local officials and members of Congress of both parties have objected to the administration plan. They said the cutbacks, expected to save $9 billion over the next five years, would harm Medicaid recipients and aggravate fiscal problems plaguing most states. 
Two Republican governors, Jeb Bush of Florida and Rick Perry of Texas, have joined Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and the House delegations from New York and California in protesting the administration's plan. 
The United States Conference of Mayors, the National Governors' Association and the National Association of Counties said they would urge Congress to block or postpone the cuts, which are to be made in a new regulation that takes effect this spring.
The president's budget, to be unveiled on Monday, assumes that the federal government will save the $9 billion by reducing Medicaid payments to public hospitals in at least 31 states. State officials said they would lose one-fourth to one-half of the special payments they now receive for public hospitals.
In 1991, the first Bush administration tried to crack down on schemes used by states to maximize their federal Medicaid money, and President Bill Clinton continued the effort, over objections by governors and mayors. The new restrictions go beyond those imposed by Mr. Clinton.
Federal officials said they were stepping up efforts to recover what they regard as overpayments to the states.
The administration is now demanding, for example, that Missouri return $1.6 billion paid to the state in the last seven years. It contends that the state is imposing an illegal tax on hospitals to cover the state's share of Medicaid.
Dana Katherine Martin, director of the Missouri Department of Social Services, said the state was resisting the federal demand.
"The money," Ms. Martin said, "has allowed us to cover many people who were previously uninsured. If we had to return the money or repeal the tax, it would jeopardize health care for more than 850,000 people who are poor or disabled."
Missouri, like most states, is caught in a financial vise. Medicaid costs are soaring, and the number of Medicaid recipients has increased, but state revenues have declined because of the recession.
Federal officials said President Bush would not propose any significant cuts in payments to hospitals under Medicare, the health program for the elderly. But they said the cutbacks in Medicaid were needed to prevent abuse by some states.
Gary B. Redding, commissioner of the Georgia Department of Community Health, said the timing of the cuts in Medicaid "could not be worse." 
Mississippi says it will lose $40 million a year, or 29 percent of the special Medicaid payments distributed each year to 21 public hospitals. Arkansas expects to lose $20 million, or half its allotment.
New Jersey says that University Hospital in Newark will lose $59 million a year, or one-third of its payments, as a result of the new federal policy.
San Francisco General Hospital expects to lose $10 million a year. 
Senators Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, and Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi, have introduced a bill to delay the cuts for a year. Representative Nathan Deal, Republican of Georgia, has offered a similar bill in the House.
Medicaid is financed jointly by the federal government and the states, while the federal government raises or supplies all the money for Medicare. Federal spending on Medicaid grew 11 percent last year, to $130 billion. The increase was driven, in part, by spending on prescription drugs, which rose 19 percent.
Under the existing Medicaid rules, which took effect just 10 months ago, states can pay public hospitals up to 150 percent of what would be paid for the same services under Medicare. The new Bush administration policy will lower the ceiling to 100 percent.
Larry S. Gage, president of the National Association of Public Hospitals, said the higher payments were justified because public hospitals had higher costs. Many of their patients are uninsured, he said. Also, he noted, many public hospitals run costly special services like trauma care and burn units.
Bush administration officials say public hospitals do not keep all the extra federal money, but kick back some to state governments, which can use it for education, highway construction and other purposes unrelated to Medicaid. While acknowledging abuses in the past, state officials insist that all the Medicaid money is now used for health care.
In the last few days, administration officials have announced several proposals to help people obtain health care, including income tax credits for buying private health insurance. 
Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University, said: "The insurance proposals may help some people over time, but that's speculative. By contrast, the Medicaid cuts will have an immediate adverse effect on states' ability to cover low-income working families."
In justifying the new rule, Thomas A. Scully, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said, "The federal government is effectively paying more than its share of state Medicaid expenditures."
The new policy, Mr. Scully said, will "restore the appropriate balance between the federal government and states."

HEADLINE: ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: A UTILITY DEAL; 
Enron's Havoc Spills Over To a Utility In Oregon

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

DATELINE: SALEM, Ore., Feb. 1 

 BODY:
Enron, desperate for cash, hopes to raise $1.4 billion by selling its electric utility here in a deal that the utility's biggest industrial clients say enriches executives at the expense of customers big and small. 
 Electric rates would remain high here, corporate and consumer critics said, because the money for this deal would carry high junk-bond interest rates and require rapid repayment both to investors and to lenders led by Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse First Boston. 
 The sale would also impose costs that would, in effect, force the average customer to lend the company $260 interest free, indefinitely, according to a group of industrial energy users; the buyer of the utility disputes that estimate.
Since Enron bought the utility, Portland General Electric, five years ago, electric rates in the Portland area, which had been among the lowest in the country, have risen to among the highest. The terms of the sale of the utility to a smaller local utility, Northwest Natural Gas, will mean high rates for years, critics say. 
As such, Portland businesses and residents are now counting themselves among the victims of Enron's collapse. The troubles at Enron have already cost many of the 2,800 employees of Portland General their life savings, because their retirement savings were in Enron stock.
Enron's Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing is likely to cost Portland General customers an average of more than $500 each in excess payments already made that the utility eventually would have had to refund, according to a consulting firm, Regulatory and Cogeneration Services of Vancouver, Wash.
An alliance of companies like Intel, BoiseCascade, Georgia-Pacific and Fujitsu, as well as advocates for residential customers, say the damage could spread. Businesses say that the high electricity rates will discourage business investment and further retard the economy in Oregon, where the unemployment rate of 7.5 percent is the highest in the nation. 
Opponents of the sale, which was announced last May, passionately made their points Tuesday in a hearing by the Oregon Public Utility Commission. 
Many details of the deal, including its impact on customers and the size of the executives' bonuses, are unknown because Enron sealed most of the documents it filed with the utility commission. 
Melinda Davison, a lawyer for major industrial customers, waved a large sealed envelope at the hearing and said that inside were details of the bonuses. She obtained those documents as a party to the case but was not permitted to disclose their contents. "There are more dollars in this transaction for P.G.E. executives than for ratepayers," Ms. Davison said. "P.G.E. executives get paid first and customers get benefits years from now."
Bonuses to retain important executives are common in mergers, but keeping them secret is unusual.
John Ambler, an Enron spokesman, described the sale of Portland General as a change of strategy, rather than a sign of desperation. Enron, he said, "got involved in Portland General Electric to better understand the utility market, as it appeared there would be opportunities in an environment of deregulation." But, he continued, "as time went on, P.G.E. was not as important to Enron."
"While the returns were good with P.G.E.," he added, "our cash could be better placed in other areas.'
Executives of both utilities said customers would receive some immediate benefits from the deal. Pamela Lesh, a Portland General vice president, said that rates would drop at the end of this year, though not by as much as major customers and consumer advocates wanted. The biggest benefits will come beginning about 2008 to 2010, once debt from the deal is paid off, she said. 
"The industrial customers and the consumer advocates are complaining because this deal will save costs through synergies and they want to benefit right away, not in eight years," she said. 
Bruce DeBolt, the Northwest Gas chief financial officer, said that rates would not be any higher because of the merger. But Northwest Gas shareholders, he said, would benefit substantially from the leveraged buyout.
Enron, which bought Portland General in 1997, has been trying to sell it at least since November 1999. Usually, the sellers in such deals receive payment in shares of the acquirer, an arrangement that would have little effect on a utility's customers. But Enron has been seeking to sell Portland General for cash -- reflecting, local critics say, its deteriorating financial condition.
The deal has come under fire from both corporate customers and consumer groups who say its terms would violate longstanding principles of utility rate-making law by putting the burdens on ratepayers and giving virtually all the benefits to the gas utility's shareholders. 
"Because of Enron, Oregon ratepayers are seriously in harm's way," said Dan Meek, a lawyer for the Utility Reform Project, a consumer group.
Higher rates over the long term will shrivel new investment by companies that come here to obtain cheap power, said Ms. Davison, the lawyer for big electric customers. Intel has already announced a halt to its multibillion-dollar expansion in the Portland area until rates come down. 
At the hearing Tuesday, no ordinary citizens, or Oregon journalists, observed the two hours of testimony, parts of which were also missed by Commissioner Lee Byers, who arrived late and repeatedly nodded off. 
The hearing was filled with stories of the damage witnesses said Enron brought, of the lost retirement savings of utility linemen because of the collapse of Enron's stock, of the bonuses for executives and of the added burdens that customers said they would suffer. Any deal would be subject to a bankruptcy court's approval. 
Edward A. Finklea, a lawyer representing big gas customers, said it was unfair for customers to wait years before sharing in the benefits of merging the local gas and electric utilities. He belittled the benefits that the utilities promise immediately and over the first eight years, saying they amount to $3 annually for each customer "or about enough to heat a house for one day." 
Several witnesses warned that if business conditions worsen, or exceptionally mild weather prevails, the combined company would have trouble paying back the $1.4 billion in debt. Then the company would have to raise electric and gas rates further to avoid bankruptcy, they said. 
Enron plans to sell Portland General for $1.4 billion in cash, $250 million in a special class of stock and the assumption of more than $1 billion of debt by Northwest Natural Gas. The debt burden would lower the combined company's credit rating to junk-bond status until the beginning of 2006, Mr. DeBolt said. 
The deal would force customers to pay an additional $188 million in "phantom taxes" over six years, according to Energy Advocates, which represents major natural gas customers in Portland.
Phantom taxes occur when utility customers pay rates that assume the company pays higher taxes than it actually does. Because the merged utility here would pay reduced taxes, as it deducted its high debt payments, electricity and gas rates would include what amounts to a forced loan from customers to the utility at zero interest.
These loans would average $260 a customer and last for at least six years, according to calculations by Don Schoenbeck of Regulatory and Cogeneration Services, who said he relied on public documents from Northwest Natural Gas.
The average of more than $500 that each Portland General customer has already paid in phantom taxes almost certainly will never be repaid because of Enron's bankruptcy.

HEADLINE: FORUM IN NEW YORK: THE MEETING; 
2 Top Officials Offer Stern Talk On U.S. Policy

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM and DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
The two highest-ranking members of President Bush's cabinet, both attending the World Economic Forum at the Waldorf-Astoria, declared yesterday that the United States was committed to defining its own solutions to some of the toughest international problems, even if that angers some allies.
 Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill told world business and government leaders yesterday that the Bush administration cut off aid to Argentina late last year because "they just didn't reform," while Secretary of State Colin L. Powell warned that the United States would "go after terrorism wherever it threatens free men and women," even if that meant taking on "evil regimes." 
 While the statements themselves were hardly surprising, they were delivered in an unvarnished fashion to an international audience that reacted with a mix of apprehension and disagreement.
During a panel on Afghanistan, a senior State Department official, Richard N. Haass, said that the scheduled six-month presence of an international peacekeeping force around Kabul was "clearly inadequate" and that the force, to which America is not contributing troops, might have to stay as long as two years. The force may have to be expanded, he added, to as many 25,000 troops spread around the country. It now numbers fewer than 5,000, clustered around the capital. 
Mr. O'Neill's blunt message about Argentina came in a lunchtime speech to an audience that included financiers like George Soros, who was once a major investor in the country, the chief executive of Boeing Corporation, Philip A. Condit, and diplomats and business executives from around the world.
It amounted to a comprehensive defense of the administration's decision to end International Monetary Fund emergency aid to Argentina, where default led to the fall of the government, rioting and chaos.
Mr. O'Neill said he was pained to see the images of people being killed or injured, but said it was ridiculous for America's "plumbers and carpenters to pay for someone's bad decisions" in managing economies.
On terrorism, Secretary Powell was equally tough. "We must not step back from the challenge presented by rogue regimes, evil regimes, as the president put it" when he singled out Iran, Iraq and North Korea in his State of the Union address on Tuesday. "And we must make sure that we have the patience and the perseverance to see this campaign through to the end," he said.
But both men tried to balance their stern messages with suggestions that the United States was also prepared to address global poverty, and the root causes of terrorism, in new ways. Mr. O'Neill said he wanted the United States to issue more grants to developing nations, and fewer loans that the countries have little hope of repaying. He said he was worried that the pattern of lending money to such nations, and then declaring partial debt forgiveness, bred cynicism and sent the wrong signals to developing nations.
At the same time, Secretary Powell said, "terrorism really flourishes in areas of poverty, despair and hopelessness, where people see no future." So the United States and its allies must also fight world poverty, he said, adding, "We have to show people who might move in the direction of terrorism that there is a better way." But the cabinet members' messages on intractable problems prompted considerable skepticism and wariness among traditional American allies from Western Europe to Latin American. At a lengthy session in the morning on new directions for American foreign policy, several participants noted that the leaders of the hijacking teams on Sept. 11 were neither poor nor uneducated, and they suggested that even a new focus on economic development in the Middle East would not ease the hatred of America.
Latin American diplomats noted that while Mr. O'Neill was correct in blaming Argentine politicians for failing to rein in their spending and stabilize their economy, the United States has not been actively involved in finding a solution. Argentina's new government remains in considerable chaos as it seeks a strategy that would get the economy running again and give the I.M.F. reason to restore aid.
For the year he has been in office, Mr. O'Neill has often expressed his dissatisfaction with the strategic direction of the I.M.F., which he believes has encouraged a culture of dependency with its repeated bailouts of debtor nations. He has a similar view of the World Bank, which he wants to redirect toward improving the productivity of poorer nations.
"Over the last 15 years the temptation has been to rush in with a fire- station crew and dump money on the rest of the world," he said. "I don't think that's O.K." He said the United States should not partake in a strategy of sending cash to countries that made "mistake after mistake."
He also said the concept of "contagion," the spread of economic troubles from one nation to the next, is "man-made phenomenon." In fact, while contagion was widespread in the Mexican crisis of 1995 and the Asian crisis of 1997 and 1998, Argentina's troubles have stayed inside its borders.
Nonetheless, he said, he went along with a strategy, set up by the outgoing Clinton administration, of agreeing to large loans for Argentina in return for its promises to finally bring some discipline to its budget. "We approved $40 billion, which is still a lot of money," he said. "Then $20 billion more in the spring. And by the summer they needed more."
By this fall, however, the administration had decided that Argentina was not delivering on its promises, and cut off the flow. Since then Mr. O'Neill has faced two contradictory criticisms: Some say he waited too long to shut off the spigot, others say that the decision to cut the I.M.F.'s aid triggered the rioting that has caused violence and a few deaths.
But Mr. O'Neill went to some lengths yesterday to indicate that the administration was not being heartless, and he said he thought Americans would support larger foreign aid budgets if the United States "can demonstrate that we know what we are doing and raise standards of living." 
He made no mention of the fact that the administration quashed a World Bank plan recently to get major industrialized nations to commit themselves to much larger foreign aid budgets over the next five years.
Aid was much on the minds of attendees at the session on Afghanistan, including Foreign Minister Abdullah. (He uses one name.) 
Mr. Haass, the director of policy planning for the State Department, said that security was the paramount challenge that must be met for a stable Afghanistan to grow. He noted that there were "tens if not hundreds of thousands," of Afghans with arms and alliances to various warlords, and said the interim government must find ways to demobilize such forces perhaps by putting some to work on drug eradication programs or road-building, and integrating others into a national army.
But all that will take time, and some participants could not help expressing a certain pessimism. Kieran Prendergast, undersecretary general of the United Nations for political affairs, said that "military victory for the coalition looks more assured than victory on the peace front." He noted that the government is still short of money to pay basic operating costs and salaries, then added, "The Afghans still need bread today even more urgently than they need cake tomorrow."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE MILITARY BUDGET; 
BUSH SEES BIG RISE IN MILITARY BUDGET FOR NEXT 5 YEARS

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
In a military buildup rivaling that of the Reagan era, the Bush administration will call for increasing the Pentagon's yearly budget by $120 billion over the next five years, to $451 billion in 2007, according to Defense Department documents.
 By the end of the five-year period, spending to buy weapons and other military supplies alone would swell to $99 billion a year from $61 billion this year. Spending on personnel, operations and research programs would also grow, but not as fast. 
 Mr. Bush's proposal would spend about a quarter of a trillion dollars more on the military over the next five years than if the Pentagon budget simply increased at the rate of inflation. That growth would come at the same time that Mr. Bush's tax cut, worth $1.35 trillion over 10 years, gradually phases in. 
Details of Mr. Bush's proposal are to be presented formally to Congress on Monday, but the documents describing the proposal began to circulate in Washington today and their details were provided by industry and Congressional officials.
Mr. Bush has already said that he would propose a $48 billion increase in Pentagon spending for next year alone, pumping money into building new fighter jets and high-tech munitions, raising troop pay and expanding health care benefits. The increase over current Pentagon spending would be about 12 percent, the largest such increase in 20 years.
But spending growth of that magnitude, if approved by Congress, would also create a ripple effect that would probably lock the Pentagon into major budget increases for many years as more big-ticket weapons reach the assembly line and entitlement programs like health care for military personnel expand, military experts said. 
Indeed, Mr. Bush's plan would increase Pentagon spending by about 30 percent through 2007, a pace that is only somewhat slower than President Ronald Reagan's military buildup between 1981 and 1985, the largest ever during peace time.
"By historical standards, this is a big increase," said Steven Kosiak, a budget analyst with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, an organization in Washington that studies military policy. 
Though the combination of tax cuts and increased military spending would likely aggravate the budget deficit and create pressure on Congress to restrain domestic spending, many senior Democrats on Capitol Hill said they expected to support Mr. Bush's plan as long as the war on terrorism continues. 
Those Democrats and their aides contend that with Mr. Bush's approval rating at above 80 percent, and with public support for the war running high, opposing military spending would be a political blunder.
"The president will get largely what he asks for in this area," said Senator Kent Conrad, a Democrat from North Dakota who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. "We're at war, and when the president asks for additional resources for national defense, he generally gets it."
Representative Ike Skelton, a Missouri Democrat who is the ranking minority member on the House Armed Services Committee, said the Pentagon budget "will pass at the size the president has asked for," though he said Congress might try to shift money around within the president's proposal. 
"The question is not whether it's the right amount of money," Mr. Skelton said. "The question is how do you spend it. The priority has to be taking care of the troops and their families, because they are the basis of our quality military."
Under the plan Mr. Bush will present to Congress on Monday, Pentagon spending would rise to $379 billion next year. The plan also calls for spending $16.8 billion on Department of Energy programs, principally maintaining the nuclear stockpile, bringing total military spending to $396 billion. 
In a proposal that has caught bipartisan attention on Capitol Hill, Mr. Bush has also called for creating a $10 billion contingency fund for the war on terrorism, which would allow him to spend money on military operations without seeking prior approval from Congress. 
Congress historically has resisted efforts by presidents to usurp the power of purse, and senior lawmakers in both parties have expressed skepticism about Mr. Bush's contingency fund proposal. 
Senator Conrad called the contingency fund "highly questionable." He said that Congress historically has opposed giving the president "a pool of money that's not for any designated purpose."
But aides to several senior Democrats said that rather than trying to eliminate the contingency fund, Congress might simply allocate the $10 billion to other military programs, particularly ones that directly benefit their districts. 
Though some of the proposed $48 billion increase next year would help pay for the war in Afghanistan, most of it would go toward improving pay and benefits for troops, rebuilding equipment and reversing what Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld has called the Pentagon's "procurement holiday," which followed the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
The part of the budget dedicated to buying weapons and supplies would increase by $7.6 billion, to $68.7 billion, an amount that was considered disappointing by some military contractors. By comparison, President Reagan raised procurement spending by more than $20 billion between 1981 and 1982, as measured by inflation-adjusted dollars. 
Still, Mr. Bush's plan pleased many senior military officers. It would provide $475 million for the Crusader mobile howitzer and $910 million for the Comanche reconnaissance helicopter, Army programs that last year were considered in grave danger of being killed. 
The plan also calls for spending $5.2 billion, a $1.3 billion increase, to buy 23 F-22 Raptor stealth fighter jets, the Air Force's top budget priority. And it proposes to nearly double spending on a surveillance satellite system, known as Space Based Infrared Systems-High, to $815 million. The program, which will be an important component of a missile defense shield, has been over budget and behind schedule. 
The plan proposes keeping research and development on missile defense level at about $8 billion. 
The budget proposes to sharply increase spending on a number of programs that Mr. Rumsfeld contends would "transform" the military into a more lethal, light and agile force. It would spend $1 billion to develop or speed up production of unpiloted aircraft, including the Predator and Global Hawk, which helped spot targets in Afghanistan.
The proposal would also allocate $1 billion to begin refurbishing four Trident submarines so that they can fire conventional Tomahawk cruise missiles rather than nuclear-tipped missiles. Military planners say the plan would greatly increase the Navy's ability to strike in-land targets with great precision.
The plan calls for spending $1.1 billion to expand production of laser- and satellite-guided bombs, which were the weapons of choice in Afghanistan. 
But the procurement budget did not grow as much as many military officers and military contracts had hoped, largely because of sharply rising costs for entitlement programs and maintenance operations. 
As has already been mandated by Congress, the budget would increase military base pay by 4.1 percent and improve off-base housing allowances. And health care spending would rise sharply to pay for a new program that extends military health care benefits to retired career military personnel.
One part of the procurement budget that has already generated disappointment is the shipbuilding account, which calls for building five ships next year, including $2.6 billion for a DDG-51 destroyer and $2.4 billion for a Virginia-class submarine. 
Advocates of shipbuilding on Capitol Hill say the Navy needs to build eight or more ships a year to prevent the fleet from falling much below its current level of about 310 ships.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: SECURITY; 
U.S. and Britain Agree on Expanding the International Security Force in Afghanistan

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
Top officials in Britain and at the State Department have endorsed the idea of expanding the international security force in Afghanistan, which is now restricted to Kabul and limited to 5,000 soldiers.
 The British foreign secretary, Jack Straw, said today that Hamid Karzai, the leader of the interim government in Kabul, had presented persuasive arguments for enlarging the force and extending it into other areas of Afghanistan. With the country riven by feuding warlords and gunmen who have switched allegiances regularly during the last 23 years of war, a growing number of Western experts have made similar recommendations. 
 "Our position is that Karzai makes a very strong case for it," said Mr. Straw, who was in Washington for consultations with senior Bush administration officials. "The issue is the practicality of it." 
At the World Economic Forum in New York, Richard Haass, a senior State Department official, said the security force might have to be expanded to as many as 25,000 troops, deployed across Afghanistan. Mr. Haass added that the six-month term for the current international force, now under British command and endorsed by the United Nations Security Council, was "clearly inadequate." He said an appropriate term might be as long as two years.
The Bush administration, however, has not yet decided whether to endorse such an expansion. If the force is enlarged, officials said, the United States will provide indirect military support. But President Bush has indicated that he has no intention of sending American troops as peacekeepers.
An expanded force, the thinking goes, would discourage violent clashes and help Mr. Karzai's government extend its authority throughout Afghanistan while reconstruction gets under way and until an Afghan army is established.
Afghan leaders believe that the force should be deployed in four cities outside Kabul, in the following order of priority: Mazar-i-Sharif in the north, Kandahar in the south, Herat in the west and Jalalabad in the east, Mr. Straw said.
Even if foreign governments agree there is a need, it is not clear that they have the will to provide the additional forces.
Britain has sent 1,500 troops to Afghanistan to join the force, but is planning to turn over command to Turkey by the end of April. Citing other commitments, Britain plans to reduce substantially the number of its troops in Afghanistan. 
Turkey wants the United States to finance the troops it would use in the force and is concerned about the financial and strategic implications of deploying outside of Kabul.
American officials are not offering peacekeepers, but are considering ways to help maintain an expanded force, like flying the troops to Afghanistan, providing intelligence and offering assurance that it will evacuate any forces that are in danger.
It is not clear exactly how many troops would be needed if the force expands. Some experts say 10,000 to 20,000; a retiring United Nations envoy, Francesc Vendrell, talked last week of up to 35,000. Even the limited force now in place has built up slowly: only 3,000 soldiers of a planned 5,000 have been deployed so far.
The United Nations approved a mandate for the force only for Kabul, a limitation that said more about the apprehensions of the nations contributing troops than the security needs on the ground. At the insistence of the French, deployment was limited to six months, a provision American officials never believed was realistic.
The main purpose of the troops, formally known as the International Security Assistance Force, is to ensure that the Northern Alliance does not have disproportionate influence in Kabul. But Kabul is the safest city in Afghanistan, and the peacekeeping force has done nothing to provide security in the rest of the county.
The Bush administration has agreed to provide military training and take other steps to help Afghanistan establish a new army. But the United States Central Command has yet to send a team to assess requirements.
"There is a clear need for an international force to provide security during the transition to a professional Afghan security force," said Barnett R. Rubin, a professor at New York University and a specialist on Afghanistan. "These things are complementary, not contradictory."
Mr. Straw discussed the security force with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell on Thursday in Washington.
Some Pentagon officials are skeptical that an expanded force is needed, but the Defense Department has not taken a formal position, officials say. State Department officials have been swayed by the argument that the troops will encourage stability.
Recently, French troops chanced upon two rival groups of warlords whose men were about to do battle, according to American intelligence. Seeing the French troops, the rival militias decided not to fight. 
"We are moving toward a decision," a senior Bush administration official said. "I think we will come to the conclusion that an expanded force is desirable and should be supported by the United States."
Mr. Straw said: "We want to see a stable Afghanistan. And the best people in Afghanistan are saying you can get that stability by having an outside force in certain of the areas."

 LAZY B
Growing Up on a Cattle Ranch
in the American Southwest.
By Sandra Day O'Connor
and H. Alan Day.
Illustrated. 318 pp. New York:
Random House. $24.95.
 The stark and isolated high desert of the American Southwest "was no country for sissies, then or now," Sandra Day O'Connor and her brother, Alan Day, write in this engaging memoir of growing up on their family's cattle ranch, 250 arid square miles that straddled the Arizona-New Mexico border along the Gila River.
And it goes without saying that Sandra Day O'Connor was no sissy, then or now. Raised in a house without electricity or running water, 35 miles from the nearest real town, she rode horses since before she could remember and counted the ranch's cowboys as her best childhood friends. Her ambition was to be useful to them as they went about their work and to prove to her father, a demanding and somewhat austere perfectionist, that she could do her part.
To Eastern, urban sensibilities, her early life is not only exotic but nearly impossible to reconcile with the Sandra Day O'Connor the public knows: the prim and button-down onetime president of the Phoenix Junior League, at home at formal dinners and on country club golf courses, who grew up to become the first woman on the United States Supreme Court and a central player there for more than 20 years now.
"Lazy B" -- the name her grandfather, H. C. Day, gave to the ranch he established in 1880 -- makes no explicit attempt to reconcile the two Sandra Day O'Connors. Its ambitions are more modest: to paint a loving but cleareyed portrait of a distinctive and vanished American way of life. Both O'Connor and her brother, who stayed on the ranch and managed it for much of his career before subdividing and selling it in 1993, tell their story through anecdotes and sketches rather than extended reflection, with only incidental references to their adult lives.
But like Jimmy Carter's well-received memoir of his rural Georgia boyhood, "An Hour Before Daylight" -- which this book resembles much more closely than it does the only other memoir to be published by a sitting Supreme Court justice in modern times, William O. Douglas's "Go East, Young Man" -- Lazy B" provides a palimpsest of the adult author. (It is evident that O'Connor, rather than her brother, is the principal author of "Lazy B"; the first-person narrative is all hers, while "Alan" is the third-person subject of his adventures.) In this, it transcends the boundaries of its form to suggest, if not expose, rich veins that a future O'Connor biographer, or perhaps the justice herself, might someday mine.
Like Jimmy Carter, Sandra Day was the first-born child of parents who, while deeply rooted in soil that they worked with their own hands, had a wider world in mind for their children. Carter's parents cultivated his interest in attending the United States Naval Academy and preparing for a military career that would take him far from home. Harry Day, thwarted in his own desire to attend Stanford University by his father's premature death, transferred that ambition to his older daughter, who graduated from Stanford and from its law school, where she placed third in her class (to William H. Rehnquist's first).
O'Connor's parents in fact placed such value on getting her properly educated that beginning in the first grade at 6, she was sent to El Paso to live with her maternal grandparents during the school year in order to attend a private girls' school. Published interviews with family members in recent years indicate that this arrangement was the source of great unhappiness for the young girl, but she passes over that quickly here with the comment, "I was always homesick when away from the ranch." This is, after all, the story of life on the Lazy B, not of Sandra's painful acculturation to city life.
Sandra Day O'Connor, born in 1930, and Jimmy Carter, born in 1924, shared other childhood influences. Both were the product of families that, while richer in land than in cash, held unchallenged local positions of social and economic leadership. Both had mothers who were powerful personalities and, given the constraints of their time and place, free spirits. Carter's mother, Miss Lillian, a public figure in her own right during her son's presidency, had progressive attitudes on race. Ada Mae Wilkey Day, who eloped with O'Connor's father because her urbane parents disapproved of the harsh ranch life that marriage to Harry Day would bring, retained a thirst for culture and adventure that led her to subscribe to The New Yorker and Vogue and to design family vacations that included a voyage to Cuba on a banana boat.
Like Jimmy Carter, who spent some of his richest childhood hours with his family farm's black employees and tenants, Sandra Day learned enduring lessons from the Lazy B's cowboys, of whom some were illiterate but all were dignified, purposeful and successful, by their lights and hers. Of Rafael Estrada, known as Rastus, a Mexican-American who could not read but who could identify nearly all the cattle, some 1,000 head on the ranch, she writes, "He knew he was very good at what he did, and he demanded a high standard from those around him." Rastus "was dealt what many would say was a poor hand in life -- he was small, crippled, fatherless, a minority race in his birth land," the portrait concludes, but "he played the hand he was dealt like a master." From Rastus "we learned the contentment of doing the best you can with what you have."
Of Jim Brister, another ranch cowboy and sometime rodeo competitor who did his best and never blamed anyone else when he lost, she writes: "If he won, that was fine. If he didn't, that was all right too. You get the job done, or you don't. We learned from Jim that there were no excuses, only results."
Strong as these figures were, they -- and Sandra and Alan themselves -- all moved in the shadow of "the boss,"+ "the patriarch," Harry Day, who inherited a vast but nearly worthless property and through unremitting labor made it a success. He demanded "total loyalty from his employees and his children." Passing his many tests was the goal. He called Sandra away from a Nancy Drew mystery one summer day so she could watch him shoot a suffering calf whose hindquarters had been gnawed by a coyote.
She was so eager to please, and he was so stingy with his approval, that some episodes are painful to read. Sandra offered to bring lunch to her father and crew, who were branding calves on a remote part of the ranch. In the middle of nowhere, the old Chevy pickup got a flat tire, and Sandra, then 15, struggled for an hour in the summer heat to loosen the rusty lug nuts and change the tire. It was well past lunchtime when she finally arrived. "You're late," her father said. She explained about the tire. "You should have started earlier," he said. "You need to expect anything out here."
She writes: "I had expected a word of praise for changing the tire. But, to the contrary, I realized that only one thing was expected: an on-time lunch. No excuses accepted."
But she leaves no doubt that she counts herself lucky. She grew up with a lasting love for the land and for the harsh landscape where windmills stood out as "kind, benevolent friends" and "we were bit players indeed." "This is our church," her father exclaimed, indicating the landscape around them in answer to her question why the family never went to church on Sundays. She and her siblings gained a perspective rare in modern times on their family as a working unit. "How many young people see their father leave for the office but don't really know what he does for a living?"
And she received an education the value of which became clear only years later. The cowboys' semiannual roundup "had been an all-male domain" before she began to take part. "Changing it to accommodate a female was probably my first initiation into joining an all-men's club, something I did more than once in my life. After the cowboys understood that a girl could hold up her end, it was much easier for my sister, my niece and the other girls and young women who followed to be accepted in that rough-and-tumble world."

HEADLINE: The Trouble With Self-Esteem 

BYLINE:  By Lauren Slater; Lauren Slater is a psychologist. Her memoir, "Love Works Like This," will be published by Random House in May.

 BODY:
 Take this test:
1. On the whole I am satisfied with myself.
2. At times I think that I am no good at all.
3. I feel that I have a number of good qualities.
4. I am able to do things as well as most other people.
5. I feel I do not have much to be proud of.
6. I certainly feel useless at times.
7. I feel that I am a person of worth, at least the equal of others.
8. I wish I could have more respect for myself.
9. All in all, I am inclined to feel that I am a failure.
10. I take a positive attitude toward myself.
 Devised by the sociologist Morris Rosenberg, this questionnaire is one of the most widely used self-esteem assessment scales in the United States. If your answers demonstrate solid self-regard, the wisdom of the social sciences predicts that you are well adjusted, clean and sober, basically lucid, without criminal record and with some kind of college cum laude under your high-end belt. If your answers, on the other hand, reveal some inner shame, then it is obvious: you were, or are, a teenage mother; you are prone to social deviance; and if you don't drink, it is because the illicit drugs are bountiful and robust.
It has not been much disputed, until recently, that high self-esteem -- defined quite simply as liking yourself a lot, holding a positive opinion of your actions and capacities -- is essential to well-being and that its opposite is responsible for crime and substance abuse and prostitution and murder and rape and even terrorism. Thousands of papers in psychiatric and social-science literature suggest this, papers with names like "Characteristics of Abusive Parents: A Look At Self-Esteem" and "Low Adolescent Self-Esteem Leads to Multiple Interpersonal Problems." In 1990, David Long published "The Anatomy of Terrorism," in which he found that hijackers and suicide bombers suffer from feelings of worthlessness and that their violent, fluorescent acts are desperate attempts to bring some inner flair to a flat mindscape.
This all makes so much sense that we have not thought to question it. The less confidence you have, the worse you do; the more confidence you have, the better you do; and so the luminous loop goes round. Based on our beliefs, we have created self-esteem programs in schools in which the main objective is, as Jennifer Coon-Wallman, a psychotherapist based in Boston, says, "to dole out huge heapings of praise, regardless of actual accomplishment." We have a National Association for Self-Esteem with about a thousand members, and in 1986, the State Legislature of California founded the "California Task Force to Promote Self-Esteem and Personal and Social Responsibility." It was galvanized by Assemblyman John Vasconcellos, who fervently believed that by raising his citizens' self-concepts, he could divert drug abuse and all sorts of other social ills.
It didn't work.
In fact, crime rates and substance abuse rates are formidable, right along with our self-assessment scores on paper-and-pencil tests. (Whether these tests are valid and reliable indicators of self-esteem is a subject worthy of inquiry itself, but in the parlance of social-science writing, it goes "beyond the scope of this paper.") In part, the discrepancy between high self-esteem scores and poor social skills and academic acumen led researchers like Nicholas Emler of the London School of Economics and Roy Baumeister of Case Western Reserve University to consider the unexpected notion that self-esteem is overrated and to suggest that it may even be a culprit, not a cure. 
"There is absolutely no evidence that low self-esteem is particularly harmful," Emler says. "It's not at all a cause of poor academic performance; people with low self-esteem seem to do just as well in life as people with high self-esteem. In fact, they may do better, because they often try harder." Baumeister takes Emler's findings a bit further, claiming not only that low self-esteem is in most cases a socially benign if not beneficent condition but also that its opposite, high self-regard, can maim and even kill. Baumeister conducted a study that found that some people with favorable views of themselves were more likely to administer loud blasts of ear-piercing noise to a subject than those more tepid, timid folks who held back the horn. An earlier experiment found that men with high self-esteem were more willing to put down victims to whom they had administered electric shocks than were their low-level counterparts.
Last year alone there were three withering studies of self-esteem released in the United States, all of which had the same central message: people with high self-esteem pose a greater threat to those around them than people with low self-esteem and feeling bad about yourself is not the cause of our country's biggest, most expensive social problems. The research is original and compelling and lays the groundwork for a new, important kind of narrative about what makes life worth living -- if we choose to listen, which might be hard. One of this country's most central tenets, after all, is the pursuit of happiness, which has been strangely joined to the pursuit of self-worth. Shifting a paradigm is never easy. More than 2,000 books offering the attainment of self-esteem have been published; educational programs in schools designed to cultivate self-esteem continue to proliferate, as do rehabilitation programs for substance abusers that focus on cognitive realignment with self-affirming statements like, "Today I will accept myself for who I am, not who I wish I were." I have seen therapists tell their sociopathic patients to say "I adore myself" every day or to post reminder notes on their kitchen cabinets and above their toilet-paper dispensers, self-affirmations set side by side with waste.
Will we give these challenges to our notions about self-esteem their due or will the research go the way of the waste? "Research like that is seriously flawed," says Stephen Keane, a therapist who practices in Newburyport, Mass. "First, it's defining self-esteem according to very conventional and problematic masculine ideas. Second, it's clear to me that many violent men, in particular, have this inner shame; they find out early in life they're not going to measure up, and they compensate for it with fists. We need, as men, to get to the place where we can really honor and expand our natural human grace."
Keane's comment is rooted in a history that goes back hundreds of years, and it is this history that in part prevents us from really tussling with the insights of scientists like Baumeister and Emler. We have long held in this country the Byronic belief that human nature is essentially good or graceful, that behind the sheath of skin is a little globe of glow to be harnessed for creative uses. Benjamin Franklin, we believe, got that glow, as did Joseph Pulitzer and scads of other, lesser, folks who eagerly caught on to what was called, in the 19th century, "mind cure."
Mind cure augurs New Age healing, so that when we lift and look at the roots, New Age is not new at all. In the 19th century, people fervently believed that you were what you thought. Sound familiar? Post it above your toilet paper. You are what you think. What you think. What you think. In the 1920's, a French psychologist, Emile Coue, became all the rage in this country; he proposed the technique of autosuggestion and before long had many citizens repeating, "Day by day in every way I am getting better and better."
But as John Hewitt says in his book criticizing self-esteem, it was maybe Ralph Waldo Emerson more than anyone else who gave the modern self-esteem movement its most eloquent words and suasive philosophy. Emerson died more than a century ago, but you can visit his house in Concord, Mass., and see his bedroom slippers cordoned off behind plush velvet ropes and his eyeglasses, surprisingly frail, the frames of thin gold, the ovals of shine, perched on a beautiful desk. It was in this house that Emerson wrote his famous transcendentalist essays like "On Self-Reliance," which posits that the individual has something fresh and authentic within and that it is up to him to discover it and nurture it apart from the corrupting pressures of social influence. Emerson never mentions "self-esteem" in his essay, but his every word echoes with the self-esteem movement of today, with its romantic, sometimes silly and clearly humane belief that we are special, from head to toe.
Self-esteem, as a construct, as a quasi religion, is woven into a tradition that both defines and confines us as Americans. If we were to deconstruct self-esteem, to question its value, we would be, in a sense, questioning who we are, nationally and individually. We would be threatening our self-esteem. This is probably why we cannot really assimilate research like Baumeister's or Emler's; it goes too close to the bone and then threatens to break it. Imagine if you heard your child's teacher say, "Don't think so much of yourself." Imagine your spouse saying to you, "You know, you're really not so good at what you do." We have developed a discourse of affirmation, and to deviate from that would be to enter another arena, linguistically and grammatically, so that what came out of our mouths would be impolite at best, unintelligible at worst.
Is there a way to talk about the self without measuring its worth? Why, as a culture, have we so conflated the two quite separate notions -- a) self and b) worth? This may have as much to do with our entrepreneurial history as Americans, in which everything exists to be improved, as it does, again, with the power of language to shape beliefs. How would we story the self if not triumphantly, redemptively, enhanced from the inside out? A quick glance at amazon.com titles containing the word "self" shows that a hefty percentage also have -improvement or -enhancement tucked into them, oftentimes with numbers -- something like 101 ways to improve your self-esteem or 503 ways to better your outlook in 60 days or 604 ways to overcome negative self-talk. You could say that these titles are a product of a culture, or you could say that these titles and the contents they sheathe shape the culture. It is the old argument: do we make language or does language make us? In the case of self-esteem, it is probably something in between, a synergistic loop-the-loop.
On the subject of language, one could, of course, fault Baumeister and Emler for using "self-esteem" far too unidimensionally, so that it blurs and blends with simple smugness. Baumeister, in an attempt at nuance, has tried to shade the issue by referring to two previously defined types: high unstable self-esteem and high well-grounded self-esteem. As a psychologist, I remember once treating a murderer, who said, "The problem with me, Lauren, is that I'm the biggest piece of expletive the world revolves around." He would have scored high on a self-esteem inventory, but does he really "feel good" about himself? And if he doesn't really feel good about himself, then does it not follow that his hidden low, not his high, self-esteem leads to violence? And yet as Baumeister points out, research has shown that people with overt low self-esteem aren't violent, so why would low self-esteem cause violence only when it is hidden? If you follow his train of thinking, you could come up with the sort of silly conclusion that covert low self-esteem causes aggression, but overt low self-esteem does not, which means concealment, not cockiness, is the real culprit. That makes little sense.
"The fact is," Emler says, "we've put antisocial men through every self-esteem test we have, and there's no evidence for the old psychodynamic concept that they secretly feel bad about themselves. These men are racist or violent because they don't feel bad enough about themselves." Baumeister and his colleagues write: "People who believe themselves to be among the top 10 percent on any dimension may be insulted and threatened whenever anyone asserts that they are in the 80th or 50th or 25th percentile. In contrast, someone with lower self-esteem who regards himself or herself as being merely in the top 60 percent would only be threatened by the feedback that puts him or her at the 25th percentile. . . . In short, the more favorable one's view of oneself, the greater the range of external feedback that will be perceived as unacceptably low."
Perhaps, as these researchers are saying, pride really is dangerous, and too few of us know how to be humble. But that is most likely not the entire reason why we are ignoring flares that say, "Look, sometimes self-esteem can be bad for your health." There are, as always, market forces, and they are formidable. The psychotherapy industry, for instance, would take a huge hit were self-esteem to be re-examined. After all, psychology and psychiatry are predicated upon the notion of the self, and its enhancement is the primary purpose of treatment. I am by no means saying mental health professionals have any conscious desire to perpetuate a perhaps simplistic view of self-esteem, but they are, we are (for I am one of them, I confess), the "cultural retailers" of the self-esteem concept, and were the concept to falter, so would our pocketbooks. 
Really, who would come to treatment to be taken down a notch? How would we get our clients to pay to be, if not insulted, at least uncomfortably challenged? There is a profound tension here between psychotherapy as a business that needs to retain its customers and psychotherapy as a practice that has the health of its patients at heart. Mental health is not necessarily a comfortable thing. Because we want to protect our patients and our pocketbooks, we don't always say this. The drug companies that underwrite us never say this. Pills take you up or level you out, but I have yet to see an advertisement for a drug of deflation.
If you look at psychotherapy in other cultures, you get a glimpse into the obsessions of our own. You also see what a marketing fiasco we would have on our hands were we to dial down our self-esteem beliefs. In Japan, there is a popular form of psychotherapy that does not focus on the self and its worth. This psychotherapeutic treatment, called Morita, holds as its central premise that neurotic suffering comes, quite literally, from extreme self-awareness. "The most miserable people I know have been self-focused," says David Reynolds, a Morita practitioner in Oregon. Reynolds writes, "Cure is not defined by the alleviation of discomfort or the attainment of some ideal state (which is impossible) but by taking constructive action in one's life which helps one to live a full and meaningful existence and not be ruled by one's emotional state."
Morita therapy, which emphasizes action over reflection, might have some trouble catching on here, especially in the middle-class West, where folks would be hard pressed to garden away the 50-minute hour. That's what Morita patients do; they plant petunias and practice patience as they wait for them to bloom.
Like any belief system, Morita has its limitations. To detach from feelings carries with it the risk of detaching from their significant signals, which carry important information about how to act: reach out, recoil. But the current research on self-esteem does suggest that we might benefit, if not fiscally than at least spiritually, from a few petunias on the Blue Cross bill. And the fact that we continue, in the vernacular, to use the word "shrink" to refer to treatment means that perhaps unconsciously we know we sometimes need to be taken down a peg.
Down to . . . what? Maybe self-control should replace self-esteem as a primary peg to reach for. I don't mean to sound Puritanical, but there is something to be said for discipline, which comes from the word "disciple," which actually means to comprehend. Ultimately, self-control need not be seen as a constriction; restored to its original meaning, it might be experienced as the kind of practiced prowess an athlete or an artist demonstrates, muscles not tamed but trained, so that the leaps are powerful, the spine supple and the energy harnessed and shaped.
There are therapy programs that teach something like self-control, but predictably they are not great moneymakers and they certainly do not attract the bulk of therapy consumers, the upper middle class. One such program, called Emerge, is run by a psychologist named David Adams in a low-budget building in Cambridge, Mass. Emerge's clients are mostly abusive men, 75 percent of them mandated by the courts. "I once did an intake on a batterer who had been in psychotherapy for three years, and his violence wasn't getting any better," Adams told me. "I said to him, 'Why do you think you hit your wife?' He said to me, 'My therapist told me it's because I don't feel good about myself inside."' Adams sighs, then laughs. "We believe it has nothing to do with how good a man feels about himself. At Emerge, we teach men to evaluate their behaviors honestly and to interact with others using empathy and respect." In order to accomplish these goals, men write their entire abuse histories on 12-by-12 sheets of paper, hang the papers on the wall and read them. "Some of the histories are so long, they go all around the room," Adams says. "But it's a powerful exercise. It gets a guy to really concretely see." Other exercises involve having the men act out the abuse with the counselor as the victim. Unlike traditional "suburban" therapies, Emerge is under no pressure to keep its customers; the courts do that for them. In return, they are free to pursue a path that has to do with "balanced confrontation," at the heart of which is critical reappraisal and self- -- no, not esteem -- responsibility.
While Emerge is for a specific subgroup of people, it might provide us with a model for how to reconfigure treatment -- and maybe even life -- if we do decide the self is not about how good it feels but how well it does, in work and love. Work and love. That's a phrase fashioned by Freud himself, who once said the successful individual is one who has achieved meaningful work and meaningful love. Note how separate this sentence is from the notion of self. We blame Freud for a lot of things, but we can't blame that cigar-smoking Victorian for this particular cultural obsession. It was Freud, after all, who said that the job of psychotherapy was to turn neurotic suffering into ordinary suffering. Freud never claimed we should be happy, and he never claimed confidence was the key to a life well lived.
I remember the shock I had when I finally read this old analyst in his native tongue. English translations of Freud make him sound maniacal, if not egomaniacal, with his bloated words like id, ego and superego. But in the original German, id means under-I, ego translates into I and superego is not super-duper but, quite simply, over-I. Freud was staking a claim for a part of the mind that watches the mind, that takes the global view in an effort at honesty. Over-I. I can see. And in the seeing, assess, edit, praise and prune. This is self-appraisal, which precedes self-control, for we must first know both where we flail and stumble, and where we are truly strong, before we can make disciplined alterations. Self-appraisal. It has a certain sort of rhythm to it, does it not? Self-appraisal may be what Baumeister and Emler are actually advocating. If our lives are stories in the making, then we must be able to edit as well as advertise the text. Self-appraisal. If we say self-appraisal again and again, 101 times, 503 times, 612 times, maybe we can create it. And learn its complex arts.

Deals and Discounts

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH SIANO 

 BODY:
 In periods of peak demand, logic tells us, discounts are not to be found. But as the Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City approach, some prices are dropping as demand hasn't quite met expectations. For those still undecided on a trip to the Games (the opening ceremony is Friday, the finale Feb. 24), here are a few more incentives.

CLOSE-OUT ON CONDOS -- Many condos in the Deer Valley and Park City area were originally priced so high, there were no takers. Now, Deer Valley Lodging, which represents more than 500 condo and homeowners in those resorts, says that some two-bedroom condos within walking distance of Olympic sites are available starting at $104 a night per person, based on four to a unit. There are minimum-stay requirements (three nights), but these are being eased, too. Information: (800) 453-3833 or www .deervalleylodging.com.

REAL-TIME PRICE CUTS -- At the Games' Web site, www.saltlake2002.com (also the place to look for remaining tickets), the listing of available hotels and condos is updated regularly, and you can watch as some rates go down. During the week of Jan. 20, for example, the Crystal Inn Brigham City, about 40 miles from Salt Lake City, went from a range of $195 to $295 a night for a four-night minimum to $145 to $245 (not all Olympic dates are available). The Powder Ridge condos in the same area fell from a range of $275 to $500 down to $99 to $139, with some days unavailable. For those who don't mind a 120-mile drive, the Econo Lodge Wendover dropped from $120 to $90.

BUS FARES DROP -- The Salt Lake Organizing Committee set up the Mountain Venue Express, a network of bus routes throughout the Olympic region, to reduce traffic during the Games. But at $20 round trip, the original ticket price didn't have enough takers. So, because of concern over gridlock on certain peak competition days, the committee cut the price to $5, for those who make reservations at (866) 566-4428, and some dates are sold out. Anyone who bought $20 tickets will be refunded the difference. Besides reducing traffic hassles, the bus system may render a rental car unnecessary, a savings in itself.

OLYMPIC AERIALS -- Getting from your hotel to the competition sites is one thing. Getting from your home to Salt Lake City is quite another challenge. To help, the Web site Orbitz.com, set up by the major United States airlines, says it has round-trip fares to the city during the Olympic period starting at $251 from New York, $159 from Los Angeles, $211 from Washington and $316 from Chicago. These are for the period Feb. 9 to 13. Sample fares from Feb. 21 to 25 start at $249 from New York and $349 from Washington. These fares, available as of Jan. 28, are limited; some conditions apply.

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 2-03-02; 
Can Do

BYLINE:  By Michael Berube; Michael Berube is the Paterno Family Professor of Literature at Pennsylvania State University.

 BODY:
On Jan. 8, my 10-year-old son, Jamie, became undisabled, thanks to the Supreme Court.
 Jamie has Down syndrome and will be "disabled" for the rest of his life. But he can brush his teeth by himself, thus performing what the court calls one of the manual "tasks that are of central importance to most people's daily lives." As it happens, the vast majority of humans did not consider tooth-brushing to be of central importance to their daily lives until rather recently in human history. Be that as it may, Jamie can brush his teeth, as could Ella Williams in the case of Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, who was therefore considered not disabled enough to qualify for protection under the Americans With Disabilities Act. 
 Of course, the Supreme Court is not really about to challenge Jamie's status as disabled -- not in Toyota, nor in either of the two disability cases on which it has yet to rule. But then again, if Jamie had performed just slightly better on his first state-mandated cognitive test in 1997, he would have spiked out of the category of "educable mentally handicapped" and into "learning disabled" -- where he would not have qualified for some state services. The cutoff was a score of 70 on an I.Q.-like exam, and bless his heart, Jamie had doodled after drawing parallel lines in one part of the test even though state law explicitly stipulates -- it really does -- that the lines have to be parallel for two-thirds of their length. Fortunately, the state does not yank Jamie's in-class support aide every time he discovers a new cognitive skill, like an aptitude for multiplication (which was this year's surprise).
There's no denying that "disability" is a labile category. What's less clear is that the extraordinary instability of disability is both a promise and a threat: it can give shelter and solace to people with mental illness just as easily as it can consign people with high blood pressure or mild cerebral palsy to a stigmatized identity with which they do not want to identify. For in an important sense the disabled can indeed become undisabled, every time a deaf person sits down to read or a wheelchair user takes the elevator; so, too, can the able-bodied become disabled -- not only because of falling anvils and chronic diseases, but also because of new legal and medical interpretations of ordinary human conditions. Think of that annoying co-worker who is no longer merely "annoying" but now "obsessive-compulsive"; the bouncy 7-year-old now with a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. And think of how you might respond to your own sudden redescription: perhaps with "Thank God I'm not crazy -- I just have a disability" or with "But this doesn't mean I'm disabled, thank God."
So let's try brushing our teeth with the other hand for a moment. What if people with mild disabilities were included under the A.W.D.A.? People with easily correctable disabilities -- including Antonin Scalia, who famously took off his glasses during oral argument in 1999 to question whether he had a disability according to the broad reading of the law. People with often imperceptible disabilities, from M.S. to AIDS? People with "mock" disabilities, like the suburbanite teenagers haggling over extra time to complete the SAT? People with temporary disabilities, including me for the six weeks I had Bell's palsy, the two years I took antidepressants -- during which I never, not once, wanted to think of myself as disabled?
And why stop with mild or temporary disabilities? Why don't we read the A.W.D.A. as covering potentially disabled Americans, all 280 million of us?
Legally, the result would be a mess: each of us might qualify for different amounts of "extra time" on the LSAT, entire parking lots might be parceled out by minute degrees of physical disability. But philosophically, as a thought experiment, it might change the way we think about "civil rights" as something that pertains only to clearly marked identities. For nothing could be more obvious, or more elusive, than the recognition that any of us might someday identify as disabled. The A.W.D.A. is unique among civil rights laws precisely in this respect, in that its constituency is potentially universal. People who will never benefit from affirmative action or Title IX might someday be protected by the A.W.D.A. -- and that's why the courts have to keep beating back the law, lest it turn into a law that applies to every mother's child.
The lability of disability may be too frightening to think about -- and too compelling not to. For every time the Supreme Court restricts the scope of the law, the court reminds us that the scope of the law needs to be actively restricted, by constant reinterpretation. It's easy to be skeptical of a term so amorphous, especially in a culture where lawsuits are among the primary modes of social interaction. And it's easy to complain about this or that court decision, or about the fact that so many intractable cases wind up in court at all. But perhaps the society in which judges are repeatedly required to determine what counts as a "major life activity" -- and which people are therefore "disabled" -- is a reflexive society, and good because it's reflexive. Such a society contradicts itself: it contains multitudes, and it holds out the promise of imagining new social contracts in which an ever-greater range of human variations and idiosyncrasies, from Down syndrome to dyslexia, are incorporated into the body politic. We the potentially disabled people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union. . . .

HEADLINE: MUSIC; 
Bringing Hope for Early Music

BYLINE:  By JAMES R. OESTREICH 

 BODY:
AS the once thriving early-music scene in New York becomes an ever smaller pond, what is needed, some think, is a big fish. Questioned about the shrinkage several years ago, some in the field bemoaned the lack of a charismatic leader like John Eliot Gardiner in London or William Christie (alas, an expatriate American) in Paris.
 Prominent conductors have occasionally applied: Trevor Pinnock, from London, as the founding music director of the short-lived Classical Band more than a decade ago, and the venerable Gustav Leonhardt, from Amsterdam, as the founding music director of the New York Collegium three years ago. But both proved fleeting figureheads, barely involved in the day-to-day, long-term process of planning, cultivating, building, nurturing, refining. 
 "I'm not sure charisma is my main specialty," Andrew Parrott said recently with just the right self-effacement. Yet he arrives as the collegium's new music director with a heavy load of hopes if not necessarily expectations on his shoulders. Mr. Parrott, 54, an Englishman who has had great success with his Taverner Consort, Choir and Players since 1973 and with the London Mozart Players since 2000, certainly has the qualifications for the job. What remains to be seen is the level and duration of his active involvement in New York. 
Mr. Parrott, who conducted a concert in each of the collegium's first three seasons, makes his debut as music director on Friday evening at the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, with a performance of Bach's "St. John Passion" that promises to raise eyebrows. For openers, the work itself has been deemed controversial in recent years for what many perceive to be anti-Semitism contained in St. John's text and enhanced in Bach's score. All of this figured in a book by the musicologist Michael Marissen, "Lutheranism, Anti-Judaism and Bach's 'St. John Passion' " (1998), which tended to exculpate Bach, and the work now often comes accompanied by a symposium airing the issues fully.
The collegium will deal with the matter in a preconcert lecture. For the rest, Mr. Parrott counts on the listener to make the necessary distinctions and allowances.
"The best warning against anti-Semitism is to know that our forefathers were guilty of it," he said, referring to his own father, who, as a boy in London in the 1920's, joined friends in mocking their counterparts from the Jewish school across the street for the way they looked. "With hindsight, he was desperately ashamed, but to pretend that it never happened is much more dangerous.
"Similarly, in Bach's time, the anti-Semitism was absolutely standard. It's not that Bach was more anti-Semitic than everybody else. It's that Germany was. Most countries were, at that time, and the New Testament is, and those two things feed each other. To rewrite history is far more dangerous than just understanding it sensibly. So we will be performing what Bach wrote and what represents 18th-century thinking. And that does not in any way imply that I subscribe even to any Christian doctrine in it, let alone an anti-Semitic one."
For his part, Mr. Parrott will make the evening only more contentious by using the vocal soloists to perform the choruses as well, singing one voice to a part. The practice stems, if not from Bach, from research, explications and performances by the nettlesome American musicologist and conductor Joshua Rifkin over the last two decades, insisting that Bach's own "choruses" were generally mere agglomerations of soloists. The idea has made relatively little headway among academics and performers of early music, and it still spurs heated debate.
But Mr. Parrott has embraced it wholesale, advancing the cause in his book "The Essential Bach Choir" (2000) and in his recordings of recent years. In addition to exploring the history himself, he began to experiment with reduced forces of his own.
"The more I did it, the more blindingly obvious it became that this was so much easier musically, so much more natural," he said. "A lot of people will cynically think you've done it for economic reasons, and that is so superficial a view. If it were done for economic reasons, it backfired hugely, because in the Bach year, 2000, I wasn't asked to do one single performance of Bach in Britain.
"Meanwhile, the so-called experts have been complacently spewing out the standard objections and stifling the debate. I'm not telling people that they must only do it that way. I'm just saying that if we're interested in musical history, let's get it right, and the scholars are the people who should be doing that. They've hidden the evidence that is there -- and it is right out there -- from the public. They've pretended that it's a subject incapable of resolution. It's incapable of resolution only if you don't deal with it."
In broader matters as in this one, limited numbers seem to hold no terrors for Mr. Parrott. On a visit to New York (postponed from September because of the terrorist attacks) to meet with Dorothea Endicott, the collegium's executive director, and finalize plans for next season, he took issue with this reporter's suggestion of last year that not even the most ardent authenticist would advocate meager period-size audiences for early music.
"Actually, I do like the idea of period audiences," he said. To Ms. Endicott, who was present, he added, "That's the last thing you want to hear me say."
Indeed, another of the complaints of those early-music professionals several years ago was that economic pressures in New York are such that large audiences -- and thus, large, often inappropriate halls -- are needed for any ambitious performing institution to succeed. Mr. Parrott calls that a self-fulfilling prophecy.
"What I'm not interested in is putting immaculately proportioned small formations in big venues or unsympathetic venues," he said. "That does nobody any service, merely to get larger numbers. I just think one has to find venues that are appropriate to the music, have forces that are appropriate to those venues, cost it accordingly and find ways of making it work. It's just a different equation."
Mr. Parrott readily acknowledges that for every 100 people who like going to the opera, there may be only one person interested in hearing, say, Baroque music done really well. Still, he adds, if early music could command even a hundredth of the budget of either the Metropolitan Opera or the New York City Opera, it might well flourish.
"New York has a lot of talent that has not been properly tapped," he said. "All that's needed is the opportunity to develop. What New York lacks in the Baroque field, the period-instrument field, is just the sheer opportunity. So many good people from the States have gone to Europe and are the backbone or have been crucial ingredients in what, from here, some people look at with envy. What we need to do is not import foreign talent but simply create the opportunities sensitively and sensibly to develop what is already here and, of course, build audiences to support it financially."
Mr. Parrott's speech conveys vibrant energy and urgency in its rapid pace, as syllables, words and ideas tumble over one another, and incisive intelligence in its articulateness. All those qualities will be needed to breathe life and purpose into a group that has shown flashes of brilliance amid expanses of bare competence or mediocrity, and into the early-music scene here generally.
The New York Collegium, a small period-instrument band with chorus, was founded in 1999 by Michael Feldman, who also founded the St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble in 1974 and oversaw its evolution into the thriving Orchestra of St. Luke's, then left it in 1995. Even before the collegium's first concert, he espoused grand visions in The New York Times: "I'd like to jump over the Classical and early Romantic repertory and have a second organization, called the Romantic Orchestra Project, that would begin with the 1840's and move up through Wagner."
It is questionable whether any of the more established groups in Europe that have tried such an audacious leap, like Roger Norrington's London Classical Players, have succeeded. One thing is sure: they at least got good before they went big.
"That's not realistic," Mr. Parrott said of the Romantic imperative. "It wasn't realistic then. First you've got to put in the hard work to do this repertory really well."
Mr. Feldman resigned in June 2000, and Ms. Endicott took over the next month. Last year, she signed Mr. Parrott to a three-year contract.
What may be a more realistic hope for the collegium now is recordings, at least small-scale ones, since Mr. Parrott has been widely recorded, and he continues to work even amid the current chaos of the classical-record business. But funds must first be raised, and Mr. Parrott has no interest in the likes of Vivaldi's "Four Seasons." He wants to find a real need in the recorded repertory and fill it.
"Parrott is the most original thinker among conductors of Baroque music," said Nicholas Kenyon, the director of the BBC Proms in London and an avid follower of early music around the globe. Mr. Parrott slowly rose to a lofty position in a crowded field in London. Here he starts at the top. But then, so did Mr. Pinnock and Mr. Leonhardt.
 MR. PARROTT was born in Walsall in 1947 to a not particularly musical family. His father was a local businessman; his mother went back to school in midlife and became a teacher. He experimented with many instruments early on "with greed and huge arrogance," he said, and he learned to play several. But he had settled on keyboards by the time he reached Oxford to study music, mainly history and theory.
There, although actual music-making was not part of the curriculum, he began conducting concerts, starting with a program of Tudor music, "because that was what I was meant to be studying, and I had no idea what it sounded like," he said. He also took up singing, "because it made conducting easier," allowing him to demonstrate phrasing by example. Then came the Taverner group and a busy career as a performer. He has not composed much.
"I feel a failure in that if I had been an 18th-century musician, I'd have been a composer," he said. "I have not found a way to do that in my musical life, though I've made tentative, small steps by arranging and doctoring other composers' music."
Mr. Parrott, who lives in Stanton St. John on the outskirts of Oxford with his wife, the soprano Emily van Evera, and their daughter, expects to conduct half of the collegium's four or five programs a season. He originally hoped to open next season with Monteverdi's 1610 Vespers, but that has been put off, probably until 2003-4. Wisely, one suspects, Mr. Parrott intends to concentrate on developing the strings before getting embroiled with exotic brass instruments. He will therefore start the season with Handel's "Israel in Egypt" in November and end it with Biber's Easter Mass in the spring of 2003.
Beyond that, he intends to keep exploring for new finds, new adventures. His real specialty, he said, is making life difficult for himself.
And others, evidently: "I'm learning," Ms. Endicott chimed in.
Greed again, in Mr. Parrott's summary: "I am in this business because I am selfish and greedy, musically, to learn more." When he does, you may be sure, he will pass it on with his typical brimming enthusiasm. Here's hoping that he can engender the same in the collegium players and singers.

To the Editor:
Re "Downtown Theaters Enter a New World" by Stephen Fife Jan. 6 :
I was elated to see Mr. Fife's article about the consequences of the Sept. 11 attacks, but I became dismayed because TriBeCa Performing Arts Center was not mentioned. 
For 18 years we have staged world-class entertainment in our two theaters (923 seats and 262 seats) while also supporting local emerging writers, choreographers, directors and composers. We find our sustenance and purpose within our community of artists and residents; therefore our tickets are affordable and our season includes not only dance, jazz and individual artists, but also family and schooltime series.
The tragic attack of Sept. 11, just four blocks to our south, was witnessed by our staff and by dancers arriving for a morning rehearsal. It was almost four weeks before we were able to return to our facility. Rescue squads used our theaters to eat, sleep and store equipment.
As with all businesses in our neighborhood, the economic devastation was severe. Our rental income ceased as companies could not enter the frozen zone. Box office income and rental income fell 95 percent as people believed that we were closed or that the neighborhood remained unsafe. Not including staff and administrative losses, we experienced a deficit of more than $275,000 in expenses and lost revenue.
 We have joined our neighbors and local organizations in efforts to rebuild and reclaim the vitality we once enjoyed. On Oct. 20, as part of the Come Back to TriBeCa Festival, we presented a full day of free theater. However, we had to cancel our dance series, a musical revue and several schooltime and family shows. We continue to face the obstacle of letting people know we are operational.

HEADLINE: Open House 

BYLINE:  By VIRGINIA GROARK

 BODY:
THE brand-new single family houses that sit on a stretch of Division Street in New Haven would satisfy the dreams of many Americans, with their manicured lawns, fenced in lots and sparkling new windows.
 So it shouldn't be surprising that last summer when the city held an open house to show off the three-bedroom homes, nearly 60 people put their names on a waiting list to buy one. 
 But there was a problem. The city, as part of its affordable housing program, only expected to build 11 more, for a total of 20.
Thanks to $7 million in state funding that became available in December, New Haven officials may have a new solution for some of the families on the waiting list. The city plans to use the state money to leverage another $38 million in financing and embark on a program to rehabilitate or build 330 homes in various sections of the city. The goal is to increase homeownership in a city where rental units account for 70.4 percent of the occupied housing stock. The idea is rather simple. People who own are more apt to maintain their property and care about their neighborhood. 
"It makes people more invested in their properties," explained Robert Solomon, the interim executive director of New Haven's Housing Authority. 
Across Connecticut and the country, governments are offering incentives to encourage people to buy homes as a way to revitalize neighborhoods. Even the federal Section Eight program, which has long been used to help low-income people pay rent, is being revamped so people can use the money for mortgages, Mr. Solomon said.
In cities like Bridgeport and Stamford, housing projects like the notorious Father Panik Village and Southfield Village are being torn down, in part, to make way for homes that people can buy. In Hartford, renovated buildings in former blighted neighborhoods are attracting suburbanites into the city. 
Private groups are doing their part, too. Yale University is entering the fifth phase of its successful program that offers incentives to its employees to purchase homes in New Haven.
In the past six months, Connecticut has placed an increased emphasis on attracting moderate-income people to cities with the hope of rebuilding a middle-class population that fled urban areas in the second half of the 20th century. During that time, the state has not only released $7 million in bond money to New Haven, it launched the Urban Rehabilitation Homeownership Program to entice people of all income levels to buy homes in the same urban centers where they work. 
"The governor recognized that unless you make a city a place that people want to live, work and play, it's not going to be successful," said Chris Cooper, a spokesman for Gov. John G. Rowland. "So you need to have middle-class families. You need the stability of home ownership that is necessary for family living."
Henry Fernandez, New Haven's economic development administrator, estimated that the program could boost annual property taxes by $2,000 to $4,000 per house, which could bring up to an additional $1.3 million in taxes to the city. The houses could also benefit the immediate surrounding areas as well. 
"Obviously, if you get rid of any blighted houses on a street, the property values for all of the houses on the street go up," Mr. Fernandez said.
"We have been able to build over the last four years several hundred units of housing, but it's almost all been rental houses and it's almost all been income restricted," he said. "What's unique about this funding is that it will actually be focused on home ownership without income limits."
While the goal is laudable, there are some potential pitfalls, said Douglas Rae, the Richard Ely professor of management at Yale University.
"Where it causes trouble is where we reach too far and encourage people who don't have a steady enough flow of income at a high enough income level to become a homeowner," he said. "And as a result they end up unable to meet the extraordinary expenses that always arise at one point and another in the life of a house."
Such financial issues have raised some concerns for Teresa Flowers of New Haven, a 30-year-old single mother of two who put her name on a city waiting list for a home. A 911 operator, Ms. Flowers said she would like to pay a mortgage rather than rent, but she thinks she needs to save more money.
"My money just isn't what it should be or maybe I don't think it's what it should be in order to start the process," she said. "But when I feel that I'm ready then I will go for it." 
The time commitments that are attached to several of the programs have raised questions for Gloria Sesler, a 57-year-old New Haven resident who works as a food service aide at Yale.
"I don't know if I'm going to stay here that long," said Ms. Sesler, who is thinking of moving to Georgia. 
But for others, like Sheila Thompson, who bought a new home in New Haven's Newhallville section, buying a house was a dream come true.
"I thought I was going to cry," said Ms. Thompson, a native of New Haven who had renting an apartment in West Haven before she bought the house.
Ms. Thompson and her husband, Richard, bought one of the nine completed houses on Division Street that make up the Thomas E. Holmes Estates, a city affordable housing program available to people whose incomes are 80 percent of the city median, which is about $50,810 for a couple. The stretch of well-maintained, newly shingled houses looks like a page out of suburbia. But just around the corner, boarded up houses serve as a reminder that this is an urban center. 
City officials, however, hope it won't stay that way for long. That neighborhood is one of the areas where the city is considering using the $7 million in state bond money to rehabilitate homes, said Regina Winters, executive director of New Haven's Livable City Initiative. 
The idea behind the housing program, called the Innovative Housing for an All America City, is to attract people with moderate incomes to purchase homes, Ms. Winters said. 
"We discovered that what's really going to bring strength to some of our neighborhoods is some variety in terms of income levels," she said. "And so we want to create mixed income communities. We have the funding to support the lower-income home buyers. We wanted funding that could support median and moderate home buyers."
That same concept prompted the state to launch the Urban Rehabilitation Homeownership Program last summer. The program encourages people who work in one of 16 urban centers to purchase homes in the same city where they are employed. As an incentive, they can qualify for as much as $35,000 to rehabilitate the properties through a zero-interest loan that is forgivable after five years.
The program was enough to entice Lucy McMillan to move from an apartment in West Hartford to her hometown of Middletown, where she works. Ms. McMillan and her fiance, Ed McKeon, purchased a 1884 Queen Anne Victorian in the city's downtown and used the $35,000 from the state program and another $30,000 from the state historical commission to convert it from a two-family into a single-family home.
The state program also helped her get a 5.6 percent interest rate on her mortgage. As part of the program, her employer chipped in $2,500 to cover closing costs and other expenses.
"It's a big benefit to him because now I'm here early every day," she said, laughing. 
She moved from West Hartford into her new home a few days before Christmas. On Dec. 25, she and her fiance used their new six-burner stove to cook breakfast for 18 people.
"It was great," she said. 
She has also met many of her neighbors, including one man who shovels everyone's sidewalk when it snows and another who gave her a cord of wood for her newly installed fireplace. 
"I've never felt such a sense of community so immediately," she said. "It's a good sense of neighborhood." 
Likewise, Christine Moses has already bonded with her future neighbors, even though she hasn't yet moved into Hartford's Frog Hollow neighborhood where she bought a townhouse. One neighbor gave her a tour of her home. Another was host of a neighborhood meeting earlier this month. 
Ms. Moses, who has been renting an apartment in West Hartford, bought a three-bedroom townhouse in the Mortson Street-Putnam Heights redevelopment project, an $11 million public/private program. Though the area used to be full of blighted houses, Ms. Moses, who is Trinity's College media relations manager, is thrilled to be moving there.
"I have renewed faith in the city and that's what really motivated me to do this," she said.
She also got a good deal. The townhouse cost $99,000 and she only had to make a down payment of 3 percent. CitiMortgage gave her a $4,500 grant for closing costs, and she gets a tax break. The property taxes are $300 a year for the first five years. Over the next five years they will gradually be increased to the full amount.
"My mortgage is going to be less than my rent," she said.
While some may be nervous about making a long-term commitment to certain urban areas, Ms. Moses has confidence in the neighborhood.
"It's a neighborhood that's been decimated by crack and drugs for 15 years, but I think with the activism and the people who are going to care about their property, this neighborhood stands a very good chance of turning around," she said.
Vera Maximin had a similar feeling when she bought a home at the site of the former Father Panik Village housing project in Bridgeport. The 29-year-old mother of two grew up in the housing project before her family moved to Norwalk to escape the drugs and crime.
When it came time to buy a house, someone suggested that she consider the duplexes for first-time homebuyers in the Pembroke Redevelopment Area, which replaced Father Panik. At first, she balked. But when she saw them, she changed her mind.
The house cost $91,000, but Citibank gave her a $6,000 loan that is forgivable if she lives there for five years. That reduced the price to $85,000. Then another bank gave her $1,000 to cover closing costs.
Her mother, Helen Hall, didn't want her to buy the house at first.
"When she found out, she said, 'What is wrong with you. Are you crazy?' " Ms. Maximin recalled her mother saying. "She could not believe it. She told me she didn't want to go see it. She didn't want to look at any houses near there."
It wasn't until after she had already moved in that Ms. Maximin convinced her mother to visit her new home. 
"When she actually saw it, she was impressed by what they did," she said. 
Ultimately, her mother helped decorate Ms. Maximin's home. She even comes and stays with her two or three time a week.
Collin Vice, the executive director of the Bridgeport Housing Authority, estimated that the city had received more than $46,000 in additional property tax revenue from homes like Ms. Maximin's in the Pembroke Redevelopment Area.
Owning a home not only gave Ms. Maximin, who works at United Way, a sense of pride and accomplishment, it helped her break into a new field: real estate. Her home includes a rental unit, and she has used the revenue from it to purchase another investment property in Bridgeport with five rental units.
"You can attribute that to the house," she said, "because that was really a door opening for me."

HEADLINE: DINING OUT; 
Aerie, With View, Courtesy of J. P. Morgan

BYLINE:  By M. H. REED 

DATELINE: SOUTH SALEM 

 BODY:
ALMOST a century old, the magnificent mansion that J. P. Morgan had built as a gift for his minister and friend William Rainsford seems to take on a richer burnish with every passing year. The view from this hilltop aerie reaches far to the west, a spectacular sight, especially at sundown.
 The grand staircase and a luxuriously proportioned main room as well as attractively furnished smaller spaces make Le Chateau an elegant backdrop for catered group events -- weddings, business meetings, anniversaries and such. Whether you're dining there in a group of 200 or as a couple, service is warm and superb. 
 Ambience and service in place, food preparations could use refreshing. On recent visits, a notable number of entrees suffered from careless timing, some from poor workmanship. Perhaps because of his youth, Marc Uhrik, most recently Le Chateau's sous chef and now its executive chef, lacks the experience and finesse of an old master. The dining rooms were surprisingly empty. One can say that it's the slow economy or post-holiday malaise or the effect of Sept. 11. But when some other comparably appointed and priced places are doing brisk business, the reason may be the kitchen. 
Appetizers were the most successful course. Two of these small dishes and a salad would make up a fine meal. Among the pleasers were three jumbo shrimp grilled to succulence, and mild-smoked salmon rolled cleverly into three triangles and served with tangy horseradish cream and fresh toast brought tucked into a dinner napkin. A special offering of lobster with crab meat was generous, fresh and luscious. Artful seasoning was all that was needed to bring up the flavors of lump crab meat (napoleon) layered with chopped tomato and mango, a bed of greens bright with fresh basil. 
Although wrapped in heavy phyllo, shreds of tasty duck mingled with soft onion and apple proved mouth-watering. But a plate of grilled portobello cap, vegetable spring roll (which could have been fried in fresher oil) and goat cheese seemed to be a collection of whatever was around, rather than a combination of complementary flavors. A small dice of lovely port aspic festooned a slender slice of slippery foie gras (cold), pricey at $21; and mesclun salad had a subtle scent of pear, sliced almonds providing crunch. Easy on cream but heavy on salt, leek and potato soup arrived barely warm.
The best of the entrees was perfectly roasted rack of lamb, a mighty portion of five chops. Almost as good was crisp-skinned roasted duck, although it came with an odd-flavored cake of sweet rice, fruits and nuts. In general most entrees, while ambitious, were created without much passion. Ordered rare, a skewed cut of Chateaubriand (for two; $68) arrived cooked dry; overly pungent Roquefort cheese-crusted fillet of beef, bloodless with overcooking; heavily salted lobster sauce overwhelmed big chunks of lobster with tiny shrimp; the surface of salmon was hardened in spots, as though long exposed to refrigerated air; decent Chilean sea bass was baked dry; and lingonberry sauce failed to rehydrate the dense meat of pheasant.
Two desserts were a delight: refreshing and creamy hazelnut semifreddo, an artful assemblage with hazelnut madeleines and a disk of chocolate; and cold peach cheesecake souffle. Avoid hot souffles; those we tasted were too loose, and chocolate lacked flavor as well. Apple "ravioli" bore a leaden, impenetrable dough crust, as did chestnut "package," both missing the point of what dessert should be.
A three-course dinner averages $55 without drinks, tax and tip.

HEADLINE: Satire, Unlimited 

BYLINE:  By DICK AHLES

 BODY:
WHEN the historian Stephen Ambrose was accused of plagiarism, the Web site SatireWire headlined its page, "Ambrose Calls Plagiarism Charges 'Much Ado About Nothing.' "
 The charges were nothing more than "the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune," said the Branford-based Web site devoted to satirizing the day's news. 
 The SatireWire report further said that Mr. Ambrose was about to publish a book of poetry entitled "Leaves of Grass" and included an excerpt from the first poem, "The Fall of the House of Usher:" 
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
A stately pleasure dome decree,
I think that I shall never see
A poem as lovely as a tree."
At about the same time, SatireWire was also reporting: "Ailing retail giant Kmart today announced it would not have to declare bankruptcy after an audit conducted by its newly hired accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, found no records of company finances whatsoever. Andersen executives did not return several messages." 
SatireWire gets to the rest of the world via the Web from a two-room office, one flight up from the Waiting Station coffee shop, on the Branford town green.
There are three names on the masthead, the editor in chief Treat M. Warland, the oligarch, Andrew Marlatt, and the chief copy editor, Calista Littlenod.
Andrew Marlatt is a real person and the owner, operator, editor and editorial staff of SatireWire. He said the fictitious Treat M. Warland remains on the staff, but the fictitious Calista Littlenod had to be let go as a consequence of the dot-com collapse in 2000.
In a page "About SatireWire," Mr. Marlatt notes that his site, www.satirewire.com, "has been making fun of the International Monetary Fund since December 1999.
"Well, not just the I.M.F. Also clams." He calls his home base in Connecticut "the heart of Silicongregational Alley" and said his satire is aimed primarily, but not exclusively, at the New Economy.
Mr. Marlatt, 40, grew up in Atlanta and graduated from the University of Georgia. He was a newspaper reporter in Georgia and at The Bridgeport Post before it became The Connecticut Post. But he left daily newspaper work upon concluding that "newspaper people are interesting and fun but they can get bitter, and when my wife noticed I was beginning to sound like by more bitter newspaper friends, I decided it was time to do something else."
Something else was free-lance writing, which began with a feature on the radio personality Don Imus of Southport for Connecticut magazine and included assignments from publications as varied as The Hartford Courant, New York magazine, Fortune, Wired and Internet World.
It was while doing stories for the latter two that Mr. Marlatt became enthralled by the Internet and the New Economy.
"I went to conventions, got to know lots of people and became convinced it was possible to get funding and start a Web site, which he did in December of 1999 "when things were still great."
SatireWire is a free site and, said Mr. Marlatt, "well worth that price." He does, however, allow his readers to pretend they are paid subscribers and make donations to support his publication. Some actually do, but Mr. Marlatt cannot or will not say how many or how much.
He does say it is possible to make a comfortable living as a satirist but again, he will not say how comfortable his living is. He carries ads from an advertising space company that places them on different sites and sells SatireWire baseball caps, mugs and T-shirts. There is no marketing department.
Mr. Marlatt said that the financial success he has achieved with SatireWire was considerably enhanced by a book deal. After starting SatireWire, Mr. Malatt heard from a literary agent who liked his work and suggested a book. There were others who made the same suggestion and Mr. Marlatt picked Daniel Greenberg, who is also the agent for The Onion, another humor site on the Web.
The book, which satirizes New Economy Web sites and publications, is called "Economy of Errors." It will be published in June by Random House's Broadway Division and by Macmillan in London.
Mr. Marlatt had taken some time off last summer to work on the book "when Sept. 11 happened."
"I started doing pieces two weeks later but nothing seemed right," he said. "We were hearing people say we'd never laugh again, that irony was lost forever but that was nonsense. We've got to laugh and we are laughing again."
To underscore that point, Mr. Marlatt said, "there's President Bush and the pretzel." The president had his run-in with the pretzel the same Sunday two of his cabinet members revealed they had rejected calls for government help from the troubled Enron Corp., but had not bothered to inform Mr. Bush.
SatireWire combined the stories with this result: "Two Bush cabinet members today admitted they received several phone calls from the President as he choked on a pretzel but said they never considered intervening to stave off the President's collapse, nor informing First Lady Laura Bush."
Secretary of the Treasury Paul O'Neill confided, "I didn't think it was worth running across the street to tell the First Lady. I don't tell the First Lady every time somebody calls me."
As the Roman satirist Juvenal observed 20 centuries ago, "It is hard not to write satire."

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH

 BODY:
NEARLY seven decades ago Alfred J. Roach, a cocky boxer from Harlem, bounced into Stillman's Gym in Manhattan, certain that the older, thick-waisted, slow-moving fighter throwing jabs into the air in the opposite corner would offer little opposition to his own welterweight ambitions. 
 Mr. Roach, billed as Battlin' Al, took quite a shellacking that day. Years later, recalling the drubbing in his memoirs, "Fire in My Belly" (Wolfhound Press, Dublin, 1998), he recalled that his opponent became a welterweight champ a few years later. The thrashing he delivered ended Mr. Roach's brief career in the ring but did not take the fight out of the streetwise future entrepreneur. 
 "In places like Harlem you were in a fight every day," wrote Mr. Roach, now 86. "You had to fight back. I couldn't run. Like my dad, my legs were too short. So I had to learn to fight."
Today, having had a remarkably diverse career -- he has been, among other things, a fireman, waterfront cargo checker, securities salesman, brewery company executive, and electronics manufacturer -- he is fighting again, this time on behalf of American Biogenetic Sciences, the Copiague company he founded nearly 20 years ago.
The company needs a strong defender these days. Although it had been honored as one of Long Island's fastest-rising high-tech companies in terms of 2000 revenues by Deloitte & Touche, it lost $1 million in the third quarter last year. (The division that had produced most of the prior year's revenues had been sold in June.)
But the global scientific network Mr. Roach had created as a pipeline for biotech innovations was still intact, and he continued to fly around the world, meeting with the scientists and researchers under contract to American Biogenetic in countries like China, Russia and Israel. 
Last November, as public concern about anthrax and bioterrorism seemed to peak, Mr. Roach returned from a trip to Russia, and on Nov. 26, the company announced a 10-year agreement with Russia's Ministry of Health and its Agricultural Academy that would allow American Biogenetic to sell the rights to dozens of vaccines that Mr. Roach said had been in use in Russia and elsewhere for years.
The list, which stretched to eight closely typed pages, included vaccines for anthrax, smallpox and botulism, as well as for measles and certain strains of herpes. It also listed many vaccines intended for veterinary use. 
Almost immediately, Nasdaq officials halted trading of the company's stock, which jumped from 38 cents a share to 73 cents a share on Nov. 26, and asked the company to provide more information about the Russian deal. A company spokesman said it was cooperating with the inquiry.
It was a decided stumble for Mr. Roach, who had previously gained an international reputation as a sure-footed global negotiator.
Last week, Mr. Roach acknowledged that at the time of the November announcement, the contracts with the Russians had been negotiated but not yet been signed. In fact, the last of the contracts was not signed until Dec. 27, he said. 
On Jan. 8, the company voluntarily delisted its common stock on the Nasdaq exchange so that it could begin trading the next day in the over-the-counter market. A company spokesman said there was no timetable for relisting on Nasdaq, where stock in many of the country's leading high-tech companies is traded. 
Wayne Lee, a Nasdaq spokesman, said that it was the exchange's policy not to comment on issues dealing with specific companies.
Losing access to Nasdaq investors represents a serious setback for what had been, and might be again, one of Long Island's most promising companies. In the last 10 years, American Biogenetic had raised over $75 million in stock sales. 
Although Mr. Roach himself is not a scientist -- in fact he did not finish high school -- he built American Biogenetic largely by creating a global scientific network, then harvesting the discoveries of researchers scattered around the globe. 
Mr. Roach says that the company does not intend to bring the vaccines to market itself, a process that could take 10 years and many millions of dollars. Rather, it intends to sell licenses to other companies to develop the vaccines. 
Raymond S. Firko, a lawyer who specializes in international vaccine development and regulation, said that licensing or importing a vaccine from Russia or one of the former Soviet states was highly unusual. "I've never heard of a Russian vaccine coming here," said Mr. Firko, a partner in Mintz Levin Cohn Ferris Gorvsky & Popeo, a Manhattan law firm. "Japan and Europe, yes. But Russia is not in harmony with our regulatory system. You would need a long process for licensing the vaccine through the Food and Drug Administration. You would have to do clinical trials. There would be questions about quality control." 
Mr. Roach said he was convinced the Russian vaccines were both safe and needed in this country, and he added that the World Health Organization had used the Russian smallpox vaccine widely in the 1970's. 
It is not the first time Mr. Roach has gone to bat on behalf of Russia, whose scientists play a major role in his research network. He has publicly advocated integrating Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union into the world economy and believes that Russian scientific accomplishments can be shared among people around the world. 
Until last year, when he accepted a plaque from Deloitte & Touche naming American Biogenetic as the fastest-growing Long Island high-tech company for 2000, Mr. Roach was perhaps better known in international scientific circles than he was in local business circles. Some of that changed when the white-haired octogenarian delivered a videotaped message to a room filled with men and women young enough to be his grandchildren. By some accounts, the speech left the audience hopelessly charmed.
"It was a stunning speech," said Peter Goldsmith, the chairman of the Long Island Software and Technology Network. Mr. Goldsmith recalled waiting 30 minutes to congratulate Mr. Roach because the line of well-wishers was so long. "He's 86, but he acts like he's 40," Mr. Goldsmith said. "There were all these young people in the room, and here he is walking slowly, with his big mop of white hair. I tell you, people loved him."
Adam Weisman, the Deloitte partner in Jericho who organized the Fast 50 recognition program, said that American Biogenetic's recent fortunes illustrate the fast rate of change in the high-tech world. "To be strong in technology you have to be able to weather the bad times as well as the good times," he said. "The test of a successful company is over time."
Mr. Roach said: "I would like to be remembered as the man who got the vaccines here and prevented the disaster that could take place. I don't believe that the danger of bioterrorism is over."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 10, 2002

 CORRECTION:
The L.I.@Work column last Sunday, about a company that has contracted to sell the rights to Russian-made vaccines, misspelled the surname of a lawyer who cautioned about the regulatory obstacles to the use of such vaccines in the United States. He is Raymond S. Fersko, not Firko.

HEADLINE: Trinity's New Leader Has Neighbors in Mind 

BYLINE:  By VIRGINIA GROARK

 BODY:
THE small seacoast town of Durham, N.H., has long been dominated by the University of New Hampshire. After all, when school is in session, the student enrollment matches, if not exceeds, the town's population.
 So when Richard H. Hersh served as vice president for academic affairs for the university in the 1980's, it became increasingly apparent to him that someone from the university needed to foster a better relationship with the community. With the university's consent, he ran for a seat on the town council and won. 
 Given his interest in public policy, it may not be terribly surprising that Mr. Hersh would run for political office. But Mr. Hersh said he is no politician. Instead, his short-lived political career demonstrates this 59-year-old academic's belief that an educational institution should be involved with its community. 
That mindset should come in handy now that Mr. Hersh has been named Trinity College's 19th president. In the past decade, the small liberal arts school has earned national acclaim for its participation in an ambitious urban redevelopment project that has helped revitalize its surroundings. It is an effort that Mr. Hersh hopes to continue.
"I think we will be involved every bit as much probably because I enjoy it and probably because I think there really is no ethical choice in the matter," he said. "We are only as good as the community can be around us." 
Mr. Hersh, the former president of Hobart and William Smith Colleges, was elected Trinity's next president by its board of trustees on Jan. 25, capping a 10-month search to replace Evan S. Dobelle.
Mr. Dobelle, who left Connecticut last summer to become president of the University of Hawaii, made a significant mark both on Trinity and Hartford. During his six-year tenure, he committed Trinity to a $250 million neighborhood redevelopment project around the college campus that included the Learning Corridor, a 16-acre educational complex. He helped persuade world-renowned architect Frank Gehry to design the yet-to-be-built Connecticut History Center and was a prime mover in bringing the 1996 presidential debate to Hartford. 
Months after he left Connecticut, Mr. Dobelle is still talked about. Even Eddie Perez mentioned Mr. Dobelle in his inaugural address when he was sworn in as Hartford's mayor in December, thanking him for "making a small dream a big reality." Mr. Hersh, who first met Mr. Dobelle, when he was president of Hobart and William Smith, said that his predecessor set a new standard. But while Mr. Hersh said, "he ain't no Evan Dobelle," he believes he is up to the challenge.
"Well of course there are big shoes to fill, but the issue is not to jump in the same shoes," Mr. Hersh said. "The issue is to get your own pair. And I have to get shoes that will help me run faster than Evan."
He's been on this racetrack before.
From 1991 to 1999, Mr. Hersh served as president of Hobart and William Smith, a liberal arts college in Geneva, N.Y., where he earned the reputation of being a stellar fund-raiser, but was comfortable enough with the student body that he attended fraternity Halloween parties in costume. Known as a visible president, Mr. Hersh was not immune to controversy, but earned a "really good review," which concluded that he "had the potential to be one of the best college presidents there is," according to Susan Henking, associate professor of religious studies. 
"He's the kind of guy who before he has breakfast in the morning he has three good ideas," she said. 
And he has a long tradition of community work, a quality that made him attractive as a candidate, said Thomas S. Johnson, chairman of Trinity's board of trustees and the search committee. 
When Mr. Hersh was a professor of education and a department chairman at the University of Toledo, he was involved with the urban teaching corps program there. At the University of Oregon, where he was an associate dean for teacher education and a professor before he became dean of the graduate school and associate provost for research, he was involved with the development of a technology park and ran unsuccessfully for the board of education.
And when it became apparent that someone needed to bridge the gap between the University of New Hampshire and its host town, Durham, he ran for the town council, going door to door in the neighborhoods. 
Mr. Hersh left Hobart and William Smith in 1999 to follow his wife, Judith C. Meyers, to Connecticut, where she was hired to be executive director of the Child Health and Development Institute of Connecticut. The two had had a commuting relationship when he first became president of Hobart and William Smith and didn't want to do that again, he said. 
So in 1999, they moved to Connecticut, at first looking at houses in the greater Hartford area. When they failed to find something, they bought a house in Hamden that was once owned by the inventor Eli Whitney.
When Mr. Dobelle learned that Mr. Hersh was moving to Connecticut, he called him and asked if he would be involved in the Learning Corridor. So for about a year, Mr. Hersh, who has researched what makes some schools more effective than others, worked as an educational consultant to the project. 
In the process he met Mr. Perez, who was then head of the Southside Institutions Neighborhood Alliance where he helped oversee the project. The two worked together and when it came time for Trinity's search committee to call Mr. Hersh's references, they contacted Mr. Perez.
"I think he's going to be good for Hartford and good for the region and good for Connecticut and will continue the great tradition that Trinity has had for the last decade of community engagement and academic excellence," said Mr. Perez who hopes to introduce him to city, state and community leaders. "I think he'll hit the ground running." 
While Mr. Hersh is committed to community involvement, he is clearly focused on Trinity's academic mission. A strong supporter of liberal arts education, he hopes to help Trinity obtain an identity that will separate it from other liberal arts colleges of its size. Though he noted that "it's not like there's anything wrong" at the school, he said the school needs to demonstrate why someone would come to Trinity rather than another school.
"It seems to me we don't have an answer to that question," he said. 
The school already has an advantage in that it is one of the few "first rate liberal arts colleges" that are located in a city, he said. And, he noted, in the past decade the college has "raised to a fine art what it means to open the doors of a campus and reach out as opposed to take in."
A pizza lover, Mr. Hersh said he has not sampled any of the capital city's offerings, but he is looking forward to moving there. A member of the 1966 United States rowing team, he is eager to row on the Connecticut River. He is a fan of the cultural institutions, like the Bushnell, and thinks the city has wonderful architecture. But don't expect him to run for mayor of Hartford.
"No. No. No," he said, smiling. "I think Eddie is fantastic."

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: 'WTC: Monument' at Historical Society; 
Trade Center As History

 BODY:
How could we have known we would miss them?
 There is no point in romanticizing the World Trade Center; the twin towers were disliked by many New Yorkers for what seemed to be a colossal banality. 
Yet in the wake of their shocking destruction has come an insatiable hunger for images, information and history. 
 Some of that history -- two four-foot models, as well as photos and films documenting construction -- was lost along with the towers. But an exquisitely detailed seven-foot-high model, built 31 years ago by Minoru Yamasaki & Associates, the architects of the center, survived in the hands of the Octagon Museum, which stands in front of the American Institute of Architects headquarters in Washington.
That model is a highlight of "WTC: Monument," which opens Tuesday at the New-York Historical Society, Central Park West and 77th Street. The show also features a nine-foot-square model of Lower Manhattan, built between 1968 and 1970, to trace the development of downtown -- a theme that is especially relevant. "The cataclysmic change is going to demand a fast-forward examination of how the city evolves into the 21st century," said Carol Willis, director of the Skyscraper Museum, which is presenting "WTC: Monument." The show runs through May 5 as part of the society's "History Responds" project, collecting and interpreting material related to the Sept. 11 attack.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Roosevelt, N.J.; 
A New Deal Enclave Friendly to the Arts

BYLINE:  By JERRY CHESLOW 

 BODY:
BORN as a Great Depression-era utopian cooperative for unemployed Jewish New York City garment workers, Roosevelt, N.J., looks pretty much as it did when it was started by the United States Department of the Interior in the late 1930's. Its streets meander around hills and stream beds, and most of its houses back up to green belts or woods, including the sprawling, 5,600 acre state-owned Assunpink Wildlife Management Area to the south. 
 Of the 334 homes in the 1.8-square-mile Monmouth County borough, 200 are the original Bauhaus-style structures, which resemble low-slung concrete bunkers and have so much steel rebar reinforcement in their walls that cordless telephone reception is obstructed. "Although our housing lots are a half acre," said the planning board chairman, Ralph Seligman, 79, a 50-year resident, "the woods give us the feeling of infinite privacy." 
 Roosevelt has just a handful of commercial buildings, the largest of which is the Worker's Aim Cooperation Association Building on North Valley Road. Constructed as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal in 1936, it started as a garment factory that was owned and operated by the homeowners. That structure has since been subdivided into artists' studios and nonpolluting industrial businesses. 
The town's two gasoline stations, which closed long ago, remain eyesores. There are no traffic lights, virtually no crime, no police and little traffic on internal roads. The one store is Rossi's Deli on North Rochdale Avenue, next to the post office, where residents collect their mail because no letter carriers are assigned to Roosevelt. Residents do their grocery shopping in neighboring towns. The closest major mall is the Freehold Mall 12 miles to the southeast.
"When referring to Roosevelt institutions, we use the word 'the,' -- as in 'the' school, 'the' store, 'the' post office -- because there is just one of each," said the mayor, Michael Hamilton.
The only town in New Jersey on both the National and State Registers of Historic Places in its entirety, Roosevelt was originally named Jersey Homesteads. It was one of 34 municipalities started by the federal Subsistence Homesteads program, an experiment that gave workers cooperative ownership over local farms and factories. In 1945, after President Roosevelt's death and long after the government had sold off the factory and farms, the borough renamed itself Roosevelt to honor F.D.R.
"The economic experiment was a failure, but what developed was a tightly knit social fabric," said the borough historian. Arthur Shapiro, who has lived most of his 63 years in Roosevelt.
"The original residents were all Eastern European Jews, and the minutes of the first borough council were even taken in Yiddish," Dr. Shapiro said. "Within weeks of its founding, there were already 36 organizations. School friends became like brothers and sisters, and we all still keep in touch 50 years after we graduated."
Mel A. Adlerman, 70, owner of the Adlerman Agency in nearby Monroe and one of the original settlers in Roosevelt, says that many home buyers in the town are children of the first residents, returning to their roots. Currently, only three houses, all in the Bauhaus style, are on the market. They range in price from $124,900 to $142,900. Mr. Adlerman said he had a waiting list of half a dozen people seeking homes in town.
The Bauhaus-type houses were built in two styles: detached and semidetached, with the connection between houses being at the garages. "These homes typically sell for between $95,000 and just under $150,000," Mr. Adlerman said. "Price is determined by whether the house is detached or semidetached and whether it has been updated or expanded." 
Roosevelt also has about two dozen geodesic dome houses that were built in the 1970's, when there was a dome factory in town. They sell for between $125,000 for a small two-bedroom model and $175,000 for an upgraded three-bedroom unit. A two-bedroom, two-bath dome house sold in October for $149,900. There are also several dozen small ranches, colonials and bilevels in the Lake Drive section that go for about $135,000 to $150,000. Larger four-bedroom colonials built on four-acre lots during the 1990's along Eleanor Lane, named for the former first lady, can go for as much as $250,000, according to Mr. Adlerman. 
The only multifamily project is Solar Village, a 21-unit low-income senior-citizen housing development on Valley Road, that is heated by solar energy. 
Among the newer residents is Lois Hunt, a retired opera singer who has several family members in town. In 1997, she moved from Oyster Bay on Long Island, into one of the original structures. "I moved for family, but I love the community," she explained in a recent interview. "It's one of those places where everyone knows and speaks to one another. And there are many artists and musicians, which makes this a highly cultured place to live."
THE central focus of the borough is the 105-student Roosevelt Elementary School for kindergarten through sixth grade. The entire borough attends its graduation ceremony, and its meeting rooms are used practically every night for community functions.
In the school foyer, next to an eight-foot-long green dragon painted by a first grade class, is one of the largest frescos in the United States -- the Ben Shahn Mural. It was painted by Shahn and his wife, Bernada Bryson, in 1937 under a grant from the Works Progress Administration, an agency that created employment during the Depression. The mural chronicles the history of immigration, labor reforms and the New Deal. Among the historic figures depicted in the painting are Albert Einstein and the labor organizer John L. Lewis. 
The average class size is 14, and the school has a full-day kindergarten and after-school care. There is a state-of-the-art 16-station Macintosh computer laboratory, every classroom has Internet access and there is one computer for every 2.2 students, compared with a state average of one for every 5.9 students. 
"We are like a private school, only we also have to meet state mandates," said the chief school administrator, Dale Weinbach.
Graduates of Roosevelt Elementary go on to middle school at the Melvin H. Kreps School and Hightstown High School, both in nearby East Windsor. On the 2000 College Board tests, the latest year for which data was available, students at the 1,187-student Hightstown High scored a combined verbal and mathematics average 1,044, compared with a state average of 1,012. On the 11th grade High School Proficiency Test, a statewide standardized test that measures reading, 89 percent of Hightstown High students showed proficiency in all subjects, which was four points above the state average. 
After painting their mural, the Shahns remained in Roosevelt and attracted other artists, including Jacob Landau and David Stone Martin. They, in turn, attracted singers, poets and playwrights, forming the core of an artist colony, which remains active today. Mr. Shahn is buried in the tiny Roosevelt Cemetery. Bernarda Bryson and their son Jonathan continue to live and work in Roosevelt. A large bust of F.D.R. by Jonathan Shahn stands outside the elementary school.
According to Professor David Brahinsky, treasurer of the Roosevelt Arts Project, which stages monthly events at the school or Borough Hall, about 40 accomplished artists, poets and writers currently reside in Roosevelt. The next event is a classical music performance by a local group called the Ellarslie Trio at Borough Hall next Saturday at 8 p.m. Contributions of $6 for adults and $4 for seniors and students are requested to support the program.
Roosevelt's small-town intellectual atmosphere comes at a hefty price. Its property tax rate is the highest of Monmouth County's 53 municipalities. Its water system is the original one built by the Department of the Interior and, according to Mayor Hamilton, the water tower is too small and the pipes are old. 
The tax rate has split the town between those favoring development and those favoring preservation of open land. Roosevelt has about 620 acres of farmland, mainly at the northern end of town, just off Monmouth County Route 571. The 2000 election, which brought Mayor Hamilton to power, ousted a Borough Council that had passed legislation to allow a developer to build a development of 266 homes for people age 55 and older on 260 acres. The current council reversed that action and is being sued by the developer, U.S. Home, a unit of the Lennar Corporation.
Spearheading the preservationist camp is Fund for Roosevelt, an environmental organization started in 1999 to purchase farmland and place it under the protection of the state's Farmlands Preservation Program, which prohibits development but allows farming on the land. Dr. Rodham E. Tulloss, president of the Fund for Roosevelt, says his organization has raised $77,000 in donations, then leveraged that money with state and county grants to purchase and protect 241 acres, most of which has been resold to farmers, except for the development rights. 
One council person who was unseated was Rose D. Murphy, who had served for 10 years. "Not only are our taxes too high, but we have failing infrastructure, and pay an extra $125 per month for water and sewer" beyond the taxes, she said. "Our water plant is in need of upgrading. Housing for senior citizens would have meant an expanded tax base without increasing our school taxes. In the current climate, when there is just no grant money out there, we need new ratables or our taxes will make living here unaffordable for many people."
Mayor Hamilton countered: "It would have changed the feeling of community and extended family. We have an integrated social fabric and that kind of development would have nearly doubled our population and impacted on sensitive environmental areas."

EINSTEIN: The labor leader David Dubinsky, longtime president of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, fervently opposed the construction of Jersey Homesteads (later renamed Roosevelt) as a cooperative for Jewish garment workers. The local historian, Arthur Shapiro, said that Dubinsky felt the cooperative would be a "runaway shop," meaning it would difficult for the union to control. So the organizers of the town asked Albert Einstein to persuade him to change his mind, but apparently he was not immediately successful. At the end of a visit to the site, Dubinsky is reputed to have told Einstein: "When it comes to physics, you are the professor. When it comes to coats and suits, I'm the professor."

Office Vacancy Rates Climb in Fairfield County

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
OFFICE vacancy rates in Fairfield County have climbed markedly in recent months, with different real estate companies estimating the current rate at 10.6 percent to 16.5 percent. Well below the 22 to 36 percent of the early 90's recession, the current rates are still a significant jump from the 6 to 8 percent that prevailed in 2000. 
 Only a smattering of leasing resulted from the destruction of the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, with the flood of workers from displaced companies mainly going to Midtown Manhattan, the city's other boroughs and New Jersey, areas where many employees already lived. But local realtors say Fairfield County is doing as well as the rest of the country and better than the technology centers of Boston-Cambridge and northern California. 
 Dominated by the financial services sector, primarily in Stamford and Greenwich, Fairfield's office market has been affected more by the floundering stock market and economic recession that produced downsizing of area companies and a flood of space returned as sublets. 
"Longer term, we'll see benefit," said Al Mirin, senior vice president at CB Richard Ellis. "Short term, folks with space in New York have leases. As they come up, they may well relocate or more likely decentralize." Rents, he said, are flattening. "Nobody's lowered their asking rate, but deals include tenant improvements and maybe a month or two of free rent." Alluding to the annual rent per square foot, he said, "You may still be in the mid-$30's but getting more for it."
It is a widely held view among county real estate executives that a "diaspora" of secondary corporate offices in the suburbs may well be the wave of the future. Ed Tonnessen, executive vice president at Albert B. Ashforth Inc., commercial realtors in Stamford, agrees that decentralization is a popular notion, but, he said, "I haven't seen a lot of evidence yet, and I'm not sure that corporate America has determined what it's going to do."
With the exception of two major leases by American Express and Citigroup Asset Management, rentals here related to Sept. 11 fall into the small-space category of 4,000 to 8,000 square feet. And whether they are disaster-related or not, subleases are driving the current market. 
Companies that took too much space, fearing they would be locked out of room to expand, "are cutting back on employees and jettisoning space," Mr. Tonnessen said. And, he said, "subleases are where price declines start, impacting owners' prices."
"We need earnings and job growth," he continued, "and time for companies to require additional space in a recovery. A sign of a bottom is the reduction in the supply of sublet space, but the market is still adding it." More than 435,000 square feet was returned to the market countywide in the fourth quarter of 2001 alone, bringing the total of available space to nearly 6 million square feet out of more than 43 million square feet countywide, according to statistics compiled by Insignia/ESG, Cushman & Wakefield and CB Richard Ellis.
"We were driving rents north of $45 a square foot in Stamford," said Michael Siegel, executive managing director at Insignia's Stamford office. "Buildings were purchased on the upside, Now, landlords may encounter difficulty justifying rents, and they recognize that there may be a drop. Some companies might still consider taking some of the blocks of sublet space, breaking up their Manhattan concentration, deciding not to be in one location." 
American Express, which negotiated the first and largest Sept. 11-related deal, took a 10-year lease on 195,000 square feet at 400 Atlantic Street in Stamford when its headquarters in the World Financial Center was rendered uninhabitable. It will move most of those employees back to the repaired headquarters in April, said Molly Faust, company spokeswoman, but it will retain part of the Stamford space. "A lot of their senior people live in the area," said Scott Landis, head of the Landis Group, owner of the fully rented 510,000-square-foot building. "They are committed to keeping space here permanently -- if there is such a thing as permanence."
Citigroup Asset Management, which has had 145,700 square feet at 100 and 300 First Stamford Place for several years, took another 145,285 square feet after losing space for 1,300 people at 7 World Trade Center. By midyear, it will add 1,100 employees to the 350 in Stamford now. "We have no plans to go back to New York," said Brenda Sniffen, Citigroup's facilities manager in Stamford.
Greenwich, traditionally impervious to economic fluctuations, has the highest vacancy rate in the county, between 16 and 20 percent, depending on which real estate company tally is used. The reason, said John Goodkind of Newmark & Company Real Estate in Greenwich, is the 350,000 square feet put on the market at Greenwich American Center, or about half of the building, the first corporate campus in the state, built for the American Can Company in 1969. 
"Subtract that building and Greenwich vacancies would be in single digits," Mr. Goodkind said. "Greenwich picked up several small tenants in financial services and telecommunications after Sept. 11. They went into Greenwich Plaza, Pickwick Plaza and Steamboat Road, paying rents of $60 to $90 a square foot. The town has become a small-tenant market for financial services and hedge funds. No longer are big tenants clamoring to be here." 
AMONG the major leases unrelated to Sept. 11 is one of 104,000 square feet taken at the Davis Companies' 33-acre Wilton office park, formerly Perkin-Elmer's headquarters at 40-60 Danbury Road, by the Ryan Partnership. AIG Financial Products took 65,000 square feet. "We were 88 percent leased while we were renovating," said David P. Fiore, senior vice president of the company's Connecticut properties. "Since opening last October we are 96 percent leased," he said. Rents are in the low $30's on 10-year leases.
A second Wilton campus changed hands on Dec. 31, when the Louis Dreyfus Property Group sold 10-20 Westport Road to TIAA-CREF a major teachers' pension fund, for $140 million. One building, No. 10, was built in the 70's, and No. 20 was completed last summer and put up for sale in September. The buildings have a total of 529,000 square feet and sold for $264.65 per square foot. Both buildings were designed by Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo & Associates, and both are fully rented. "We saw an opportunity to build a Manhattan-style quality office building where it was needed," said David J. Friedman, northeast regional vice president of the Dreyfus Property Group, "and we're very happy with the results."
Buildings have been selling for record prices, said Jeffrey Dunne, senior vice president of investments at CB Richard Ellis. Last August his company sold Greenwich Financial Center for J. P. Morgan Fleming Asset Management to H. B. Nitkin for $26.7 million, or $353 a square foot. "We have 20 written offers for a portfolio of four office buildings on the Post Road in Westport," Mr. Dunne said. "The demand is strong because the returns to real estate investors are increasingly attractive, given the poor performance of the stock market and low yields on bonds and money market funds." 
Sept. 11 had an indirect influence on a decision by Xerox to stay in Stamford when a property to which it considered moving was taken by a company displaced in the disaster. Xerox's headquarters at 800 Long Ridge Road has been for sale since late last March. Built to accommodate 630 people, it currently has only 350. 
Xerox owns the 25 acres on which the 255,000-square-foot building stands and Stamfex Associates of Manhattan owns the building, which it bought from Xerox in a lease-back arrangement in 1984. The two entities are cooperating in marketing the land and the building together in a range of $50 million to $60 million. Stamfex is seeking tenants for half to two-thirds of the building, said Kara Choquette, a Xerox spokeswoman, "and we will occupy the rest, generating cash on the sale of the land and reducing our costs to the space we actually use." 
Eastdil Realty in New York has been the broker for Dreyfus and Xerox. "It says something for the area and the asset," said Douglas L. Harmon, Eastdil broker, "that a number of large institutional bidders like TIAA showed up for the Dreyfus sale." 
Christopher P. Bruhl, executive director of Sacia, the Southwestern (Connecticut) Area Commerce and Industry Association, takes a cautious view of companies leaving Manhattan. "The economic health of the New York Metropolitan region is what assures the economic health of lower Fairfield County," he said. "Companies can move around within the region -- what's important is that they stay in the region, not go to North Carolina. The future of the region over the next three years will be determined as thousands of large and small leases expire. Technology has made it possible to be almost anywhere. Will companies renew, depart, disperse? And if they disperse, to where?"

HEADLINE: Where Does the Orchestra Go From Up? 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CORCORAN 

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
THE musicians wander onto the big stage in ones and twos, then take their places and tune their instruments or just stand around chatting. They are wearing jeans and sweatshirts and running shoes. It's almost 10 on a Thursday morning in January, and Prudential Hall, the grand five-tiered wedding cake of an auditorium that has been the symphony's principal home for the past five seasons, is dark and empty except for the business onstage.
 This is Rehearsal 2 in Week 2 of the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra's Winter Festival. The musicians are about to tackle three fiercely difficult late works of Richard Strauss, from the great dying gasp of German Romanticism. But nobody seems greatly upset when Susan Stucker, the general manager, steps onstage to deliver bad news: Zdenek Macal, the orchestra's music director and the guiding spirit behind the Strauss festival, is down with flu, as he has been all week, and won't be able to conduct either of today's rehearsals. The concert is tomorrow night. 
 Instead, it falls to Mark Laycock, the associate conductor, a tall man in a blue turtleneck, to coax this music out of the orchestra. He strides to the podium and says a few words about the nostalgia and longing he hears in Strauss's "Metamorphosen," a dense, subtly modulated work for 23 string parts (arranged here for 46 players). The musicians listen politely, Mr. Laycock brings down his baton in a fluid motion, and the Strauss begins.
This is the midpoint of the New Jersey Symphony's 79th season. To say it has come a long way since its first concert, at the Montclair Art Museum on Nov. 27, 1922, would require a level of understatement utterly foreign to the language of symphony program notes.
It has survived virtual homelessness, labor-management strife and several near-death experiences, not to mention constant competition from much better-known and better-financed orchestras in New York and Philadelphia for audiences and musicians. Today it ranks near the summit of the American orchestral landscape, if not quite in the class of powerhouses like the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra.
Its annual budget is in the top 30 (out of 1,800 nationwide), according to the American Symphony Orchestra League, a nonprofit service organization for orchestras, and Jack McAuliffe, a vice president of the league, says its reputation is climbing.
"As a statewide orchestra, New Jersey is on the cutting edge," he said. "It's taken that role seriously and honed it beyond what any other statewide orchestra has done." 
It has won a Grammy and an Ascap award. It enjoys a balanced budget, a growing endowment and a level of cooperation between musicians and management that astounds outsiders -- and even some of its veteran players, who remember much worse times. Its new hall, in the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in downtown Newark, is widely envied for its lustrous appearance and pinpoint acoustics. The hall is also credited with quadrupling annual subscriptions, putting the orchestra on a sound financial footing after decades of struggle.
How the New Jersey Symphony got to these peaks is one story. Whether it can remain there -- and keep climbing -- is another. 
Its most immediate challenge is to find a replacement for the much-admired Mr. Macal, who announced a year ago that this would be his last full season as music director. A longer-term challenge, though no less pressing, is to find ways to ride out economic storms like the current recession and to expand and diversify its audience.

A Sense of Collegiality
"Don't slow down before that note, for the love of God!" a horn player is shouting at Mr. Laycock. "There's no ritard there. You're making something that's very difficult almost impossible."
By this time the orchestra is rehearsing the Symphonic Fragment from "Josefs-Legende," a flashy, undeservedly obscure work that Strauss adapted from an early ballet score in 1947, two years before his death. This will be the showpiece number that ends the weekend concerts, and while the orchestra played it once before, some years ago, it is so far outside the standard repertory that it feels unfamiliar to everyone. 
If the associate conductor is taken aback at this outburst, he doesn't let on. He apologizes for misreading the many-staffed score and adds, "I really appreciate all your input." At this, the musicians applaud him by stamping their feet (they can't hold instruments and clap at the same time), and the tension evaporates. The moment illustrates the collegiality that is usually the second thing anyone talks about when you ask what makes the New Jersey Symphony different from all other orchestras. (The first, always, is the new hall.) 
"We've brought the musicians into everything: the budget, the executive committee, the music-director search committee," said Dr. Victor Parsonnet, a prominent heart surgeon who has been the symphony's chairman for 10 years. "There's nothing we're doing that doesn't involve them. That makes for a very happy group."
Such language could be public-relations gauze, of course, coming from a board chairman. But it finds echoes everywhere. "When I went to my first meetings with the symphony in '98, I was waiting for a war to start," said Les Blasi, president of Newark Local 16 of the American Federation of Musicians, the union that represents the orchestra members. "But everyone was talking about mutual needs and desires and ways of moving ahead. I thought it was just talk, that it would break down into yelling and screaming. It never happened. I was amazed." The musicians' current three-year contract carries through next season.
Darryl Kubian, a violinist who is chairman of the orchestra committee, the players' official link with management, calls the orchestra "a rarity -- a very big extended family," and for this he gives much of the credit to the board, especially Dr. Parsonnet. "He was the first to recognize musicians as people," Mr. Kubian said. "His attitude was: 'Listen, I'm a surgeon. It takes a lot of skill, but I couldn't do what these musicians are doing. They should be treated with respect.' "
The current 76-member orchestra is a mix of newcomers and veterans, some of whom well remember the bad times. Robert Wagner, 46, now the principal bassoonist, joined the symphony just out of the Juilliard School in 1979. In 1980 the orchestra ran out of money and had to cancel an entire season. Mr. Wagner cobbled together a living, then rejoined the orchestra for 1981-82, having taken a pay cut from $10,000 to $7,600. "I'd just bought a car and a bassoon," he said. "I sold the bassoon."
Today the pay is respectable for an orchestra in the top 30 -- a base salary of $42,000 for the symphony's 36-week season. Many musicians supplement their wages by teaching and by playing in chamber groups and other orchestras. "It's nowhere near the Philharmonic or the Met," Mr. Kubian acknowledged (those orchestras pay at least twice the New Jersey Symphony's yearly salary, for a 52-week season), "but as far as a living weekly wage goes, it's starting to approach something that's plausible."

Back From a Financial Abyss
The 1980-81 washout was the symphony's worst reversal on the way to financial respectability, but far from the last. It tends to be forgotten that when Gov. Jim Florio took office in 1990, in the teeth of a nationwide recession, he not only raised taxes but also cut spending. The State Arts Council, which contributed more than a third of the orchestra's annual budget, slashed that contribution nearly in half. 
"The symphony was in a really bad financial place," said Lawrence Tamburri, who has been its executive director since 1991. "We had a choice: cut our way out of the problem, or try to raise money, raise our artistic standing and grow our way out of the problem." 
It actually did some of both, canceling some concerts and persuading the musicians' union to accept salary cuts while trying to raise the orchestra's visibility and bolster its fund-raising. By 1993-94, however, it had maxed out its credit and was on the edge of bankruptcy once again.
Then its luck turned. Part of it was the rapidly expanding national economy, which took pressure off the state budget. Part of it was the newfound respect between musicians and management, which resulted in a mutual willingness to work together and make concessions. And part of it was what seemed to many at the time like a hopelessly quixotic effort to revive Newark's sad, wasted downtown: the construction of a $187 million Performing Arts Center on the site of an abandoned hotel.
For the first 75 years of its existence, the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra lived everywhere and nowhere. Viewed as a statewide orchestra, it had no principal home. It still gives regular concerts in six halls outside Newark -- in Englewood, Morristown, New Brunswick, Princeton, Red Bank and Trenton -- but before the Performing Arts Center the nomadic life defined its existence. 
"The working conditions were probably toughest of any major American orchestra," said Hugh Wolff, the charismatic young conductor who was its music director from 1985 to 1992. "You can hardly imagine how difficult it was to get an ordinary day's work done. I look back with a certain kind of fondness at the guts we all had." 
The orchestra toured all the locations, playing half a dozen concerts over two weekends. It rehearsed in high school auditoriums. The old Symphony Hall in Newark was particularly depressing. "It was a dank, dark place," Mr. Wolff remembered. "If it was windy the roof would rattle, and if it was raining it would leak. When we played loudly you could see little flecks of dust come down." 
Downtown Newark was a forbidding place, and musicians and concertgoers parked their cars in lots ringed by barbed wire. In 1985 a cellist was almost killed when a backstage elevator malfunctioned and she fell into the shaft.
In hindsight, it's obvious that the orchestra badly needed a permanent home, and that the new Performing Arts Center was a godsend. From the vantage point of near-bankruptcy in 1994, however, it looked more like a bargaining chip in the orchestra's life-or-death negotiations with the state. "Without the symphony, PAC was going to be an empty building," said Dr. Victor J. Bauer, the board's vice chairman and treasurer. "There was a compelling mutual interest in our being around when it opened."
The state saw the point. It made a one-time grant of $3 million to the symphony, almost wiping out the deficit and guaranteeing that it would play at the opening-night concert in October 1997. 
Prudential Hall and its principal tenant were an instant triumph -- New Jersey's real power couple of the late 90's -- and since then the orchestra has never looked back. Almost literally: "I hate to talk about the mess we were in before," Dr. Parsonnet, the chairman, said in an interview last month. "It's an old story -- almost not pertinent anymore."
As the state heads into another round of deep budget cuts, those travails may be more pertinent than the orchestra likes to acknowledge. But the string of successes that began with that opening night has clearly left it in the best financial shape in its history, recession or no. In November 2000, it began a drive to raise its endowment tenfold, to $35 million from $3.5 million. It has received contributions and pledges of $21 million toward the new goal -- though like virtually every other arts organization, it took a beating last fall when donors redirected their giving to Sept. 11 charities.
"It's inevitable there are going to be cycles," Mr. Tamburri said. "But while orchestras can go through difficult times, there's a demand for them. People rally behind them."

A New Level of Refinement
Word of Zdenek Macal's weeklong illness has filtered out, and as concertgoers take their seats in Prudential Hall for the Friday night Strauss concert there's a buzz of disappointment at the prospect that he won't be on the podium. So when he bounds onstage, wan but dashing, his long black coattails and mane of hair flying behind him, the applause has an extra measure of brio. 
Mr. Macal -- Maestro to his musicians, Denny to his friends -- is in his ninth and final season as full-time music director. His hiring was another piece of good luck.
When Hugh Wolff left after the 1992-93 season to take over the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, the management turned to Mr. Macal, then director of the Milwaukee Symphony, as "artistic adviser" while it looked for a permanent replacement. As he has since told it, he liked being close to the center of the musical world -- his apartment overlooks Lincoln Center in Manhattan -- and he liked the challenge of taking the New Jersey Symphony to the next artistic level, in its own new hall. So he decided to remain, and was appointed music director in 1993.
Musicians and audiences have fallen for him in a big way. "I'm very drawn to his unbelievable commitment to the music," said Kelly Hall-Tompkins, a 30-year-old violinist in her third year with the orchestra. "Day after day he comes to work with the same commitment to the spirit and joy of making music." In the orchestra seats at Friday's performance, a subscriber, Lourdes Armada of Tenafly, who teaches music in the Montclair public schools, called his conducting "exquisite." 
Mr. Macal is not unduly shy about accepting such praise. Born 66 years ago in Brno, Czechoslovakia, he got out of Prague just ahead of the Soviet tanks in 1968 and became a peripatetic guest conductor, appearing before scores of orchestras before taking the directorships in Milwaukee and then New Jersey. Now, he says, he has decided to ease up a bit, in part to scale back the demands on his wife, Georgina, who has had health problems. A year ago he stunned the musicians by announcing that the 2001-02 season would be his last as full-time music director, though he will have emeritus status for the next two seasons and conduct a Dvorak festival in 2004.
"I prefer to leave in the peak," he said in a recent interview, still under the weather but warming to his subject in buoyant, slightly fractured English. "If I look back, I reach everything I wanted and even more. 
"Artistically the level is much higher than when I came," he said of his musicians. "When I arrived, they were basically good, but not technically polished or balanced. I spent my first few years cleaning up technical problems, rhythmical things. Now I don't worry about technical problems. They play at a totally new spiritual level."
Even his predecessor, Mr. Wolff, accepts that verdict, despite the implied criticism of his tenure. "We often got the level of refinement that Denny likes to talk about, but not always," he said. "Remember that we worked under severe financial constraints. I offer no excuses for the occasional night when personnel changed and we hadn't all rehearsed together. There was a rough and ready atmosphere that the orchestra had to outgrow."
There is nothing rough or ready about Friday night's Strauss concert. Entrances are precise, the ensemble playing is silken, and the music shines with emotion -- especially in a transcendent performance of Strauss's "Four Last Songs," with the soprano Alessandra Marc, which ends the concert's first half on a chord so hushed and death-haunted that the hall is utterly silent for several long moments before anyone applauds. 
Mr. Macal's conducting manner is exuberant and athletic, with huge, sweeping gestures and tiny, precise ones, like a minute flutter of the left hand to indicate a trill. ("Not many conductors do stuff like that," Eric Wyrick, the concertmaster, said afterward. "It all does mean something -- a little sheen that might not have been there before, a subtle gesture with the elbows and hands that creates extraordinary warmth.")
Clearly the musicians will miss him. But they also sound energized by the task of finding a successor, a task in which they will be closely involved as members of the search committee. A dozen or so guest conductors, many young and up and coming, will lead the orchestra over the next two seasons. Some of those concerts will be widely seen as auditions for a permanent music director. The mantra, repeated by musicians and staff members in half a dozen interviews, is "Everyone's a candidate and no one's a candidate."
There is even a chance that nobody will succeed Mr. Macal, at least in the traditional sense of an autocratic music director who is fully identified with the orchestra yet spends much of his time conducting elsewhere.
"You're never going to get a music director who does everything," said Mr. Wagner, the first bassoonist, "but the idea of a music director who's around 6 to 10 weeks is not the best model. What kind of commitment do you have to the inner workings of an orchestra and community if you have so little contact?"
Backstage after Friday's concert, with a clutch of admirers hanging on his words, Mr. Macal seems far from thinking about such things. His deep-set eyes are still bloodshot from the flu, but he is elated, still thoroughly wired to the music he's just conducted. So are the musicians filing out the stage door.
Outside, the night is cold and bright. The Performing Arts Center gleams like a Christmas package, and the Newark skyline shimmers overhead, benign and apparently untroubled. From this vantage point, it's possible to imagine that the city has finally turned a corner. Clearly its orchestra has.

HEADLINE: Some Not-Too-Subtle Advice On Etiquette for Job Hunting 

BYLINE:  This article was reported by Abby Ellin, Alice Feiring, Melinda Ligos, Marci Alboher Nusbaum and Patrica R. Olsen. 

 BODY:
Did you hear the one about the accountant who squashed a bug in a job interview? Or the woman who wrote a letter to a prospective boss that began, "Dear Blah Blah?" Or the aspiring lawyer who went to interviews in tennis whites?
 No, they are not jokes. They happened. And they hold a lesson for job seekers in these difficult economic times: it really does matter how you behave in those friendly chats with would-be employers. They will notice your indiscretions and probably hold them against you. 
 Of course, some stories told by hiring managers about the gaffes they have witnessed are so outlandish that the garden-variety goofs committed by most people seem harmless by comparison. Even so, they are only extreme infractions of the basic rules of job hunting. Here is an unscientific list of dos and don'ts.

Turn Off the Cellphone
"We've had a lot of candidates blow interviews because of cellphone usage," said Anne Maxfield, president of Project Solvers, a Manhattan staffing firm. She recalled a senior-level candidate who checked in with the receptionist, sat down, called his mother and began "a loud conversation about how he had just gone to the dentist to have his gums trimmed." When a manager finally greeted him, the applicant said, "I'll be with you in a few minutes."

Don't Play With the Boss's Stuff
Alan Towers, president of TowersGroup, a Manhattan public relations firm, interviewed a woman who struck him as intelligent and poised. When he escorted her back to the reception area, he noticed the furniture had been rearranged.
"I thought maybe the cleaning lady or a secretary had done it. When she asked me how I liked it, I realized with a shock that it was her doing," he said. "She was a take-charge individual, but there are limits. My last words to her were: 'We'll call you.' "

Show Good Manners
Anthony P. Carnesi, owner of Profitability Consulting in Manhattan, was surprised by the disheveled appearance of a woman he was interviewing. Even so, her resume was impressive, and he kept an open mind.
Until she plopped her canvas bag on its side on a table, that is, and a large water bug scurried out. "I was shocked, but she reached out and slammed her hand down right on top of the little critter," Mr. Carnesi said. "I was impressed by her swiftness. She then wiped her hand on the napkin that her coffee cup was on, turned to me and continued answering my question as if nothing had happened." But something had: She had just blown her chance to get the job.

Check Correspondence for Errors
A candidate for an editorial assistant's job at Food & Wine magazine wrote thank-you notes to both editors who had interviewed her. But her carelessness did her in; she forgot to insert the name of one of the editors in her form letter.
"On one letter she got the name right," said Dana Cowin, Food & Wine's editor in chief. "The other letter was written to Dear Blah Blah. The woman who got the Blah Blah was really insulted."

Know How to Listen
David Moore, chairman of Sonostar Ventures, a venture capital firm in Millwood, N.Y., recalls a prospective employee's 40-minute monologue about himself. "He hardly came up for air," Mr. Moore said. "At the end of the meeting I said, 'Do you have any questions for us?' He said, 'No, I think you've answered all of my questions.' But he hadn't asked any. This is not the kind of person you want around."

Dress Appropriately
When he was at the Harvard Business School in 1980, before the era of casual dress in the workplace, Mr. Moore and the five law students he lived with often compared notes about their job searches.
One morning, a housemate came downstairs in a tennis outfit and announced he was going to an interview. "He said, 'I go to all my interviews dressed like this. Hey, this is who I am; if they don't like me, they won't hire me,' " Mr. Moore said. "To the best of my knowledge, no one ever did."

Don't Flirt in Interviews
About a year ago, Mr. Moore was interviewing a woman dressed in a sexy black dress for an executive assistant's position and wondered why she started talking about all the times she had gone out to dinner with her former boss.
"But then it became clear that she was not opposed to reproducing that situation in another job," he said. "It was clear this wasn't a path I should go down."

Watch What You Eat
Mark Sirota, an associate general counsel with Reader's Digest in Pleasantville, N.Y., was taken to lunch in 1983 by several partners of a white-shoe law firm seeking to fill a summer associate's position. He kept to simple fare -- until he ordered chocolate truffles in a bed of whipped cream covered with chocolate sauce for dessert. As he pressed down on the first truffle with a spoon, it flew off his plate.
Mr. Sirota sat motionless while the waiter pulled out the table to clean up the mess, then joked about the need to observe job candidates at lunch "to make sure we won't embarrass the firm in front of clients." The lawyers laughed politely. Mr. Sirota didn't land the job.

Know What the Job Is
Janet Lee, fitness director at Fitness Magazine in Manhattan, remembers trying to get a job as a summer intern at the Federal Reserve Bank in Washington when she was studying accounting in college.
She was asked in an interview what she hoped to do. "Well, I really don't like working with numbers," she replied. She realized her goof immediately and tried to talk her way out of it, to no avail. "Since then, I've definitely polished my interviewing skills," she said.

Do Your Homework
Fred Neurohr, a researcher for the Nassau County Youth Board in Hempstead, N.Y., tells this story about a job interview he had at Publishers Clearinghouse, the mailer of sweepstakes offers. To break the ice with the interviewer, he asked, "Is Ed McMahon around a lot?" Getting no answer, he persisted. "Have you met him?" Meeting more silence, he tried again. "I bet he's a trip at the holiday party." Only then did his interviewer reply, "He works for the competition."
Oddly enough, he got the job, going on to become Publishers Clearinghouse's head researcher. He later discovered that most Americans mistakenly associate Mr. McMahon with Publishers Clearinghouse.

Don't Lie
And if you do, admit it. Ms. Cowin of Food & Wine magazine remembers a man who acknowledged his claim to have a college degree was not exactly right.
"And I said, 'You either have a degree or not.' Finally, he said he almost got the degree, falling one credit short." She hired him anyway because of his terrific work. "What made the difference is that he admitted it," she said.

Check Your Zipper
It may be the stuff of jokes, but it happens. Ask Linda Gilleran, a principal consultant for Hewlett-Packard in New York. She left an interview for an associate's position at Lazard Freres, the investment bank, some years ago thinking she had made a great impression.
Once outside, she said, "I looked down to find my fly wide open with just the fluttering silk of my underwear between me and the world." She didn't get the job.

An Empty Store Gathers Cobwebs, Not Developers

BYLINE:  By GEORGE JAMES

DATELINE: MONTCLAIR 

 BODY:
FOR years, Hahne's department store was a prestigious anchor for the downtown business district. But 12 years ago, it became yet another retail victim of the malling of New Jersey.
 Now, the vacant two-story building with its flaking white-washed 1950's facade and boarded-over display windows is an anchor all right, many say, only it's one that is dragging the area down. 
 "The building is just kind of deteriorating," said Joe DeFrance, who has watched the changes from the window of his hair salon, Esthetica, across South Park Street ever since Hahne's closed in 1989. "They ought to do something about it. Everyone has the same feeling about that." 
Something was done, or so it seemed -- several times -- but always to no avail.
The on-again, off-again plans for the building at South Park and Church Street, a block from Bloomfield Avenue, the main thoroughfare of the old downtown, perpetually struggling for vitality, has created in many minds a negative image that goes against the grain of a township that likes to see itself as a cosmopolitan enclave in a suburban setting.
Montclair's 39,000 residents, many of them transplanted New York professionals, artists, writers and theater people, take pride in the town's racial diversity, grand old houses, quaint specialty shops and eclectic restaurants. It has Montclair State University, the Montclair Art Museum, several well-established theater groups and several movie houses -- when most towns are fortunate to have one -- that show their share of art films that cineastes usually would have to travel to Manhattan to see.
There have been proposals to turn the old Hahne's into a medical mall bustling with physicians and health and fitness tenants, a minimall, a hotel, a performing space, an office building with retail space. The deals always fell through.
The most recent wrinkle -- a plan for residences with retail space on the first floor -- sees the landlord, Center Montclair Associates, suing the developer, Pinnacle Communities Ltd. of Millburn in Superior Court in Newark. The landlord claims that Pinnacle, which was to buy the property, is in default in making payments. And so one more proposal is in jeopardy.
For many residents here, having a white elephant at the west end of a trendy block on Church Street with Soho-like restaurants and chic antique and clothing stores just won't do.
"It's hard to measure in dollars and cents," said Terence J. Reidy, the township manager, speaking of the effect the ill-fated site has had on foot traffic, the viability of adjacent stores and lost municipal revenue.
Mr Reidy added: "There is also a psychological aspect. The Hahne's building had stood as this marvelous anchor in the community before it closed. Now, it's a symbol. When it stands vacant for so long, people say, 'Oh my God, why can't this get done?' "
Like many people, Mr. DeFrance's next-door neighbor, Todd A. Edelson, a physical therapist and partner in Montclair Physical Therapy Associates, wonders why.
"Well, 12 years is a long time, I think, for a building not to sell, especially with the way the economy was in the 90's," said Mr. Edelson, whose window also faces the store. "It's hard for me to fathom."
Hahne's, (pronounced Haynes), was founded in Newark in 1858 by Julius Hahne, a pocketbook maker, and eventually become known as a New Jersey version of high-quality Manhattan stores. In 1937, Montclair became the site of its first branch.
By the 1980's sales began going flat, partly because of the proliferation of malls. In 1986 May Department Stores Company of St. Louis bought the chain. Hahne's went downscale, sales worsened, and in January 1989, May announced that all nine Hahne's stores would close.
In 1994, Center Montclair Associates, a group of investors, bought the 114,000-square-foot building. One partner, William Brach, a lawyer, said chronic lack of parking was part of the trouble in attracting renters. "We had interest but it did not occur, and a major reason was the lack of parking. It's just horrendous," Mr. Brach said.
Last February, the township decided enough was enough and declared the Hahne's site an area in need of redevelopment -- a designation under state law that requires that the owners develop the site or sell it to a developer with an acceptable plan. It also gives Montclair the authority to take over the property.
A consultant has drafted a redevelopment plan for Montclair -- including Hahne's -- that is to be presented to the planning board for review on Feb. 11.
Last August, the council passed a resolution that authorizes the addition of a $6 million parking deck -- directly tied to any development of Hahne's -- that would add 350 more spaces to a nearby lot.
"Developers are going to have an obligation to provide parking," Mr. Reidy said.
The sale of the building to Pinnacle is "ambiguous" at this point, said Mr. Brach of Center Montclair, which, he added, plans to file papers against Pinnacle next week. "We want them to fish or cut bait," hre said.
Ron Ladell, vice president of business development for Pinnacle, would only say: "We look forward to developing the Hahne's building in Montclair. We think we will be able to develop a first-class mixed-use facility at that site."
But Mr. Reidy put it like this: "If everything falls apart, the town is in the position of stepping in and making something happen. We are really serious about getting this property developed."

HEADLINE: LOVE & MONEY; 
His Thoughts About Her Earning Their Keep

BYLINE:  By ELLYN SPRAGINS; Ellyn Spragins is a freelance writer in Maplewood, N.J. Her column about money's influence on relationships appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: loveandmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
LAST month I asked husbands whose wives outearned them to speak up about this apparently taboo topic. More than a hundred did, often in long, sometimes-emotional e-mail messages. Ceding the major breadwinner role to your wife is no big deal, a very big deal and everything between.
 Some men cited the issue as a major factor in a fragile marriage or in the breakup of one, while others expressed amazement that a higher-earning wife could possibly cause problems in this day and age. Plenty felt ambivalent, mostly comfortable with taking a back seat to their wives. But often they said they were lonely, both in the company of "normal" men as well as in the throng of women waiting to pick up their children from school. 
 The happiest seemed to be those who felt that their own contributions to the marriage were fully valued. Steve Miller, who teaches broadcast journalism at Rutgers University, is the primary-care parent for two daughters. His wife is a vice president at a computer company.
"Do I deserve to earn more money than Jane? Absolutely not," Mr. Miller said. "Who receives the more valuable compensation? I feel that I do. Do we both make significant contributions to the economic structure of our family and our relationship? Absolutely."
It helps if husbands and wives have taken turns being the high earner. Peter Carpenter, a former management executive at the Alza Corporation, a pharmaceutical research company in Mountain View, Calif., decided to give up his six-figure salary in 1990 to devote himself to nonprofit work. His wife, Jane Shaw, the chief executive of Aerogen, a pulmonary drug delivery company in Sunnyvale, Calif., now earns 450 times as much as he does.
"We both recognize that our true wealth is not represented by our tax returns; we also get a lot of 'income' from what I do, it is just not denominated in dollars," Mr. Carpenter said. Still, he admits that it was not easy giving up the trappings of conventional male success. Worse, initially his male colleagues thought that he could simply no longer compete in the corporate world.
Strangely, some men, after energetically proclaiming their pride in their wives and their indifference to traditional roles, asked to have their names withheld. Hmmmm. One of these, a man who works in New York and earns more than $100,000 a year, said, "Although her compensation more than doubles mine, I don't feel that my ego needs protection or that my self-confidence would slip if our W-2's were no longer private."
I thought that talking to his wife would clear things up. In a way, it did: they don't really agree on how reconciled they are to her big paycheck. He may say he's proud of her, but she notices that he doesn't appreciate the long hours she puts in.
"He likes me to be home when he's there," she said. And she confessed that she was frustrated with his moderate ambitions: "He doesn't have that same drive that I do." His response: "How much is enough? Why take on more responsibility, work more hours and enjoy life less?"
Some men like being home when the children return from school, and they cook family dinners, do house and yard chores and administer massages when needed. These are the men who, after weighing the price their children would pay for a two-career household, sometimes decide to become nonworking, stay-at-home fathers. 
Most men who wrote shoulder this role by default, because they entered parenthood as the lower earner. A few couples mutually decided that the husband was temperamentally better suited to be the chief nurturer. Either way, children -- or the prospect of children -- seem to heighten whatever insecurities and conflicts lie just beneath the hard-won equilibrium of unequal incomes.
One young husband, a lawyer, is married to a higher-earning doctor who wants to delay having children until he makes enough for her to stay home with them. "What my wife wants is for me to be more aggressive, take a second job and really push myself," he said. "I have no problem with pushing myself, but I am not that aggressive of a person."
ANOTHER couple, both lawyers, started the marriage with the husband earning more but after a move to Los Angeles from New York, the wife's income shot ahead. Her fortune was delicious to both -- until they began a family. "When we started having kids, she wanted the luxury of not having to work. There was a lot of resentment that she was carrying the weight," the husband said. That resentment, as well as other conflicts, led the couple to divorce after 12 years of marriage.
Some men who wrote declared, a bit smugly, that couples struggling with the fact that the wife made more money should look elsewhere for the root of their marital problems. That may be good advice. But after hearing from so many men and women, I wonder. I've come to think that a wife's big paycheck is like a large, intrusive, annoying question mark, prodding both partners to work harder at defining themselves and their roles than they otherwise would have needed to do. 
What is "being successful"? What do I really value in this relationship, anyway? What are we trying to accomplish in our life together? Yes, they're hard questions. The answers can be even harder.

Workers Find Retirement Is Receding Toward 70

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
THE Enron scandal has many people rushing to rid 401(k) plans of ill-advised investments. But the uproar overlooks another shortcoming in the nation's retirement system. People forced to finance their pensions with their own savings are now facing a new retirement age. While their parents stopped working at 65, the children are finding that they must stay on the job until their late 60's or early 70's if they want to live as well in retirement.
 That calculation is just beginning to roll off the spreadsheets of the nation's economists and pension experts. We all knew, without Enron, that too many 401(k) plans were overinvested in the sponsoring company's stock. We knew, also without Enron, that most people do not voluntarily save enough, and what they save is often not invested wisely. The rising stock market papered over these shortcomings. But now that the boom is gone, and the hubris with it, the inevitable bottom line of a 401(k) system -- postponed retirement -- is surfacing. 
 "There are not yet enough studies to pinpoint the new retirement age, but it is probably between 68 and 70," said Annika Sunden, an associate director of Boston College's Center for Retirement Research. 
Ignoring such talk, people in their 40's still look forward to retirement in their early 60's, pollsters say. But reality is already different. Forty percent of the people who have saved for their retirement and are now 67 are still on the job, Ms. Sunden reports, compared with only 20 percent of the 67-year-olds with company-financed pension plans. 
The 67-year-olds were in their mid-40's when Congress, in the late 1970's, authorized tax-deferred 401(k) plans. And without their knowing it, their retirement years changed. With that legislation, the nation began a gradual shift from a private-sector pension system financed by the employer toward a system financed mainly by employees. The employer-financed pensions, combined with Social Security, produced a retirement income at age 65 equal to nearly 60 percent of a typical worker's preretirement pay, according to various studies. The employee-financed system is a distant second. Added to Social Security, the earnings from 401(k) savings produce a typical pension, at age 65, that is less than 50 percent of preretirement pay.
How to close the gap? Teresa Ghilarducci, an economist and pension expert at the University of Notre Dame, offers a back-of-the-envelope calculation. Let's say you are nearly 65. Your income is $50,000, having risen gradually from $30,000. Your 401(k) savings are $33,600, which is right at the median for people in the 55-through-64 age group, according to the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finance. 
Social Security, in this example, provides nearly 40 percent of the preretirement income. The return on the 401(k) contributes an additional 4.7 percent, assuming the savings earn 5 percent above the inflation rate, or roughly 7 percent today, which is more than most 401(k) plans are earning. Given this math, raising the retirement age is looming as the route of least resistance to closing the gap between the 60 percent of preretirement income that many parents received when they stopped working in the 1970's and the pensions that will go to their children, now in their 60's.
Here another variable enters Ms. Ghilarducci's calculation. Life expectancy for 65-year-old Americans is 84 years, up one year since the 1970's. To collect 60 percent of preretirement income through age 84, people will have to continue working, and saving, to age 69.5. "You lose 4.5 years of leisure," Ms. Ghilarducci said, "but you gain a year of life expectancy, so the net loss is 3.5 years of leisure."
There is another, more equitable solution. Companies have invested much more in the pension plans they have financed than they contribute to 401(k)'s. Prodded by Congress, they could contribute more to 401(k)'s, and maybe shave a year or two off the emerging retirement age. 
Raising 401(k) retirement income through fatter company contributions would soften some of the present inequality. Only the upper end of the work force earns $75,000 or more, which is roughly sufficient, economists say, to save enough to finance, at age 65, a pension equal to at least 60 percent of preretirement pay.
In the absence of such solutions, Americans are revising their retirement age. From World War II until the mid-1980's, they retired at ever younger ages. And then, as 401(k) plans gained acceptance and people stayed healthy longer, the trend gradually reversed. Company-financed plans guaranteed a monthly check for the rest of a retiree's life; the 401(k)'s do not.
"That is causing people to think," said Sara Rix, a policy adviser at AARP, an organization of people over 50, "that maybe if I work a couple of years longer, I'll be O.K."

Welfare Memories

BYLINE:  By LYNNELL HANCOCK; LynNell Hancock is the author of "Hands to Work: The Stories of Three Families Racing the Welfare Clock," published in January by William Morrow.

 BODY:
IN the long, fiery debate over public aid for the poor, there are two distinct sides. One faction holds that welfare creates a permanent class of idle dependents. Others counter that government aid is a compassionate necessity as long as poverty exists. This political rift played out in a dramatic personal way a few weeks ago for the city's new welfare commissioner.
 Commissioner Verna Eggleston of the Human Resources Administration was quoted in news reports as saying her mother cobbled together four jobs to raise her seven children in a Bronx housing project. Welfare, she said, may have consisted of little more than surplus cheese, and public assistance was part of their family life for only one year, maybe two. 
 The commissioner's mother, Dorothy Eggleston, quietly corrected her daughter, saying she needed welfare's help for nearly two decades so she could pay the rent. When her husband abandoned the family more than 40 years ago, Dorothy Eggleston, a former housecleaner, turned to the city's welfare system to help keep her family together. "I wasn't making enough to take care of my kids," she said. A nursing degree, financed by public aid, gave her the skills to escape poverty.
This mother-daughter misunderstanding is a reminder of how political rhetoric has clouded our understanding of aid to the poor. 
The daughter's version squares with the Giuliani administration's rigid assumption that anyone shackled to the dole for more than a few months would inevitably sink into indolence. The way out of poverty was to take a job quickly -- any job, no matter how poorly it paid.
The mother's story supports the belief that most welfare recipients require skills-building government help to rise out of poverty. Dorothy Eggleston needed long-term help and higher education to guide herself and her children into decent jobs. The assistance did not corrupt her character.
This ambivalence toward government aid is as old as the century. When my grandfather lost his railroad job in the Depression, he tried to avoid the shame of government relief as long as he could. His wife and two daughters took in laundry in their southern Illinois town. His six sons picked blackberries and sold them door to door. "I never accepted charity in my life," Grandpa Hancock would say defiantly, "and I'm not about to start."
But piecemeal work was not enough to feed his large brood. So Grandpa finally signed on to help build a public school with the Civil Works Administration in exchange for a federal paycheck. It was called relief then, not welfare, and practically the whole town of West Frankfurt was signing up.
My father, then a teenager, would often point with pride to the large brick structure his dad helped create. As an adult, he came to understand that government had an obligation to help people in his family's position. It was simply the most humane option.
The Giuliani administration returned the welfare system to an era in which suspicion of the poor replaced compassion for people down on their luck. Today, a person who turns to welfare is bounced from fraud office to finger-imaging appointment, from menial workfare assignment back to the welfare center, often before receiving cash assistance.
Mothers with children as young as 3 months must work up to 35 hours a week at a Work Experience Program assignment or risk losing aid. They work in exchange for their benefits, not for wages. Instead of building great public works, most workers sweep streets or clean buildings. There is little time to train for better jobs or get more education. 
Dorothy Eggleston could not have raised and educated her family as she did under these conditions. Five years is the lifetime limit for welfare. Higher education is rarely an option.
Commissioner Eggleston takes over this system at a tough time for the city. She does not have the luxury of managing the $5 billion welfare system during the prosperity her predecessor enjoyed. The lines at emergency food centers are growing. Welfare rolls are climbing. Unemployment is rising. The city lost more than 100,000 jobs after Sept. 11 alone. Thirty thousand people seek places in the city's shelter system every night. 
Ms. Eggleston could be one of those rare city officials whose life story provides hardscrabble inspiration for the people she serves. The city's former child welfare commissioner, Nicholas Scoppetta, gained credibility because he was once a foster child. Fiorello La Guardia was better trusted to lead the ethnic stew of New Yorkers out of the Depression because of his working-class Jewish-Italian background.
Commissioner Eggleston would do well to embrace her own life story. Her tale can inspire and transform the welfare system into one that assists, rather than punishes, the people who reluctantly seek its help.

Some Beautiful Minds Talk About Acceptance

BYLINE:  By FELICIA R. LEE 

 BODY:
AT first blush, it would seem it is one thing to suffer from a mental illness as an acclaimed mathematician at Princeton University, and another as a New Yorker without special gifts. This, after all, is a city in which the most visible schizophrenic people are subway pushers or homeless beggars.
 But the 20 people standing outside the Cobble Hill Cinema in Brooklyn the other day, all with some form of mental illness, had just seen "A Beautiful Mind," the new film about the mathematician, and they felt a connection. They liked the movie because they thought it got things right and made one of their kind lovable and triumphant. 
 "Did anyone not like it?" teased Danny Frey, a thin young man with big brown eyes who is the editor in chief of New York City Voices, a newspaper for mental health advocates. There were a few giggles from the members of the group, who were on an outing sponsored by the Brooklyn Peer Advocacy Program, a self-help program that operates from space around the corner on Baltic Street.
After the movie, as a light rain fell, the little group walked back to the program's offices to discuss what they had seen. Sitting around a table in a dour beige room with an orange linoleum floor, they resembled passengers on a random subway car: diverse in dress, speech, race and manner. Some were married, others single. Some had jobs, others were too ill to work. The peer advocacy program is a program of the Baltic Street Mental Health Board, which offers an array of services for the mentally ill. 
"I don't think too many marriages survive mental illness," was the only criticism from a woman named Eva, who appeared to be in her 50's and wore her hair in a topknot.
"Not at all," agreed Jean, a lively 26-year-old from the Tremont section of the Bronx. "There are some good women out there." Jean said he did not have a job these days, but added that his mother and his girlfriend were supportive. 
Stephanie, 49, who lives in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, has bipolar disorder and works as a senior peer advocate for the advocacy program, piped up.
"They told me I'd never work again," said Stephanie, who has thick glasses and an intense manner. "We have to keep believing we can be inspired by others." 
"A Beautiful Mind," starring Russell Crowe as John Forbes Nash Jr., is a critically praised but sanitized version of the life of the eccentric mathematician who won a Nobel Prize in economics in 1994 for work done decades earlier. Some mental health advocates see it as a breakthrough film, both because of its accuracy and because it offers a positive image. 
It is estimated that there are 100,000 to 250,000 people in New York with chronic, serious mentally illness. 
As gay people have learned, there is a price for coming out of the closet. But there may be a bigger price for staying put. New Yorkers tend not to know the names of friends, neighbors or colleagues who take lithium as well as they know the name of Andrew Goldstein, the schizophrenic homeless man who was convicted of pushing a woman in front of a subway train, killing her, three years ago.
"Our biggest problem is stigma," said Marvin Spieler, chairman of the Baltic Street Mental Health Board, one moviegoer. Mr. Spieler, a white-haired 57-year-old who acknowledged that he was initially reluctant to tell his neighbors in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, that he suffered from schizophrenia, added, "It could be like diabetes, when you just go to the doctor."
But more mentally ill people are coming out of the closet, calling themselves "consumers" and lining up professional allies like Dr. Ralph Aquila, director of Residential Community Services Psychiatry at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center and an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University. 
"This movie takes on a rich debate about how to treat people, how to understand," Dr. Aquila said. "This takes it front and center into popular culture, to the outer boroughs."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
Forecast of Future Is No Substitute for Past and Present

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
HARVEY L. PITT, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and senior Bush administration officials are talking up plans for big changes in disclosure requirements for public companies.
 The proposals seem alluring. But the cure may be worse than the disease. 
 In the wake of Enron's collapse, Mr. Pitt and like-minded officials have a theory. They say corporate balance sheets and historical profit-and-loss statements are too easily manipulated and are no longer much use to investors. Who has time to look at a 10-Q anyway? What really matters to Wall Street is the future cash flows a company will produce. 
So, they suggest, companies should produce much more information about their projections for the future. If, along the way, they wind up disclosing less information about the past, who cares?
In the broadest sense, Mr. Pitt is right. Investors buy stocks for the future, not the past. But he has miscalculated what Wall Street does well, and what it does badly.
Investors and analysts are best at getting a picture -- not an exact estimate, but a picture -- of a company's worth versus its competitors, based on its financial results and other data, like its reputation.
That is why, for example, Southwest Airlines is worth more in Wall Street's eyes than the rest of the airline industry combined, even though it is only the seventh-largest carrier. Southwest's record and solid labor relations give investors confidence that it will continue to prosper more than weaker rivals.
But neither investors nor executives are good at projecting a company's profits in any given quarter or year. There are simply too many variables.
By forcing companies to disclose more information about their internal growth projections, the S.E.C. risks creating an environment where companies face even heavier pressure to meet those projections. That atmosphere will foment more abuses of accounting rules.
"The idea of basing an investment decision on the hoped-for results of an interested management seems to me a broken reed," said James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer. "The world got along fine with balance sheets on a date certain and income statements and less leverage."
The S.E.C. should worry about fixing disclosure rules, which have worked reasonably well for two generations, said Arthur Levitt, a former chairman of the commission. Mr. Levitt said he thought that oversight of accounting rules was the agency's weakest link. As chairman, he was largely rebuffed when he tried to force accountants to give up lucrative consulting work for companies they audited.
Now, in the wake of Enron, four of the five major accounting firms have said they will do exactly that. But Mr. Levitt said the S.E.C. should go further, with tighter oversight of the accounting profession and independent financing for the board that sets accounting rules, a board now financed primarily by accounting firms and companies. He would also like to see Wall Street analysts more clearly disclose if they own stock in the companies they recommend.
THE S.E.C. can take other immediate steps. It could force insiders to disclose instantly and electronically when they traded their companies' stock. It could tighten the rules on partnerships so companies had less room to move debt off their balance sheets.
Since the 1930's, investors have learned how to use balance sheets and profits to value companies. The process is not perfect, but it works.
It will continue to work as long as investors get the information they need, and that should be Mr. Pitt's priority. He would do well to remember that predicting the future is impossible, and stick to getting a clear picture of the past and present.

HEADLINE: Running in Place 

BYLINE:  By KELLY CROW 

 BODY:
Everywhere in Brooklyn eventually slopes up to Sunset Park. The neighborhood, along the Brooklyn waterfront, north of Bay Ridge, is the borough's highest point. The people who live here can stand on almost any street corner and watch the postcard view unfurl, with the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to the south, the New Jersey shoreline to the west, and on to jagged Manhattan.
 But for all its height, Sunset Park falls squarely in the middle of the city's economic divide, teetering between rich and poor. New York's median family income, according to the latest Census figures, is $48,206. In a three-block pocket southeast of Green-Wood Cemetery, the median family income is $48,214. Although individual incomes vary, the area offers the city's closest match to middle class. 
 A middling income may seem to offer a decent living, and families who earn as much can also be found in mannerly neighborhoods like Unionport in the Bronx and Corona in Queens. But the economy is suffering, and so are families in the middle. 
To fully understand the strain is to walk the streets of a working-class neighborhood like Sunset Park and feel its texture. Here, candy-colored row houses sit among sedate brownstones, and mariachi music wafts from windows. Nearly 2,000 people live in this pocket, and Fifth Avenue is their shopping strip, with clothing stores filing down one side and travel agencies lining the other. Above the rooftops, men fly pigeons.
These families rebuff the notion that there is money enough for their needs. Lately, they've begun dropping tap lessons and even postponing surgeries, whittling shopping lists and moving in with relatives. (Three-bedroom apartments here regularly rent for $1,600.) 
Many people here also know the storied, immigrant history of Sunset Park, how generations of Norwegians, Puerto Ricans and Chinese have been rewarded for spending carefully. But now in this time of recession, coming up on its first anniversary, many wonder if tough choices at the bakery and the grocery will be enough to make do. And if life on the economic bubble is hard, they can only imagine the difficulties for half a city below. Even as the economy seeks to steady itself, scenes from a recent week reveal how one neighborhood tries not to slip. 
Every weekday about 2:30 p.m., Elizabeth Donate stands alongside other mothers waiting in the asphalt schoolyard of Public School 94 at 51st Street and Sixth Avenue. The bell to collect their children rings at 2:50, and so they pass the intervening minutes talking about church and husbands and children. 
"My 13-year-old is going on 21, but he doesn't understand," said Ms. Donate, 35. She wore sweatpants and a windbreaker and she rubbed her bare hands in the cold. "My sister gave him a Game Boy Advance for Christmas and now he's asking for more games. And he wants Jordan shoes, but I can't afford to pay $80. I have to save. I take him and his little brother to Payless, and sometimes I get attitude. But what can I do? I've got to do things little by little."
Ms. Donate, who is of Polish descent, is married to Angel Donate, an easygoing Puerto Rican who lost his warehouse job of eight years last January. The family had to move into the basement of his mother's apartment on Sixth Avenue. He found a $23,000 job at another warehouse in June, and the couple has been saving ever since to buy a house on Staten Island.
For now, she said, the monthly household budget breaks down as follows: $240 in rent to his mother, $480 in groceries, $30 in subway tokens for Mr. Donate, and $1,200 in savings for the house. The two boys have state-provided health care, but the parents do not. The children no longer have an allowance, and the family has no phone. Angel eventually plans to get a cellphone for $40 a month, but now they use the pay phone at the corner bodega. They rent movies, and eat a lot of macaroni, rice and beans. 
Ms. Donate once loved to eat at a cafe called George's Restaurant at Fifth Avenue and 58th Street, but she hasn't been there in months. Her wedding anniversary is Feb. 22; she said she's saving to splurge on a dinner at Red Lobster. 
Just then, the bell rang, and soon her youngest, Matthew, made his way through the crush of children. She gave him a hug and grabbed his hand. With a cheerful nod to a few women, she started walking home, five blocks away.
"I see these other moms in the neighborhood every weekend, and they're walking, just like me," she said. "I think they're not going out on Saturday night, either."
Grace Baptist Church rises one block from the elementary school on Sixth Avenue. Sunday morning services are held in its sanctuary of mahogany pews and creamy stained glass. But business meetings, like the one held on a recent Sunday, are relegated to a low-ceilinged hall downstairs. 
Perhaps to ease the transition, or to encourage some of the church's 220 members to linger for an afternoon of financial reports, several church workers had prepared ham-and-cheese sandwiches, coffee and Kool-Aid. 
In the back, near the nursery, stood Fernando Villamil, 29. He nibbled on a sandwich while his two daughters, 4 and 6, ran circles around his legs. His 1-year-old son, Fernando, waddled past him, mouthing a toy. Mr. Villamil patted his son's head but kept his eyes on the stage. He wanted to concentrate on the discussion about the church budget. An additional $800 would be needed this year for office supplies, but the senior pastor promised to cut $500 from his gas allowance.
Lately, Mr. Villamil, originally from the Dominican Republic, has also been taking a closer look at his own financial situation. He makes $40,000 a year as a network administrator with the Metropolitan Jewish Health System. His wife, Vanessa, used to make $36,000 as a teacher, but she is staying home this year with the children. 
So, he pays $800 for their two-bedroom apartment around the corner on 51st Street. Their one car, a Saturn, is long paid off. He parks it free on the street. He also scouts for the cheapest gas station. (Right now, it is the Shell station at 65th Street and Sixth Avenue.)
More recently, other changes have been made. The two girls take tap and ballet lessons once a week instead of twice. That cut the price in half, to $100 a month. He also canceled his cable service and gave the television set and the video game to a friend.
"You wouldn't believe how much we read now," he said.
Sometimes he misses meals in restaurants, but he says he doesn't mind eating at home. These days, when the children beg to go to the movies, he and his wife take them to children's museums or ice skating rinks instead.
"It's cheaper for the whole family," he said, "and it's good for them."
At one time or another, almost everyone in this corner of Sunset Park finds himself in the Pioneer Supermarket on Fifth Avenue. Lillian Hui, 16, and her mother, Helen Moy, shop here weekly. They live with a grandmother in a first-floor apartment in Brooklyn's Chinatown, three blocks away. Their monthly grocery budget is $100.
The other day, Ms. Moy selected a cart after glancing at the sales posted in the window: Axelrod yogurt, three for $1; Hungry Jack waffles, 10 for 99 cents. 
Half an hour later, she found her daughter in the dairy section and they reviewed the contents in the cart: one loaf of white bread, one bag with four bagels, one box of on-sale waffles, three on-sale yogurts and one package of frozen buffalo wings.
"All of them are 99 cents each," Ms. Moy said.
Her daughter smiled. "Except the wings."
"Those are only $1.88."
"Mom loves chicken wings." 
In the optometrist's office a few blocks away, Nancy Glassman was trying to mask the outrage in her voice. Dr. Glassman, 38, used to work at Morgan Stanley on Wall Street, but for the past five years she has shared this practice with her father, Leonard. She emerged from an examining room after prescribing glasses to a 42-year-old Dominican man. He suffered from alternating exotropy, a condition that gave him a chameleon-like ability to focus both eyes separately but never in sync.
Her anger stemmed from his condition. "He should've had surgery as a child," she muttered. "Twenty years he's been in Brooklyn, and I'm his first eye doctor. It's not right."
Dr. Glassman sometimes sees little to applaud in this neighborhood except its people. She understands that crime is down and rents are up, but her world is one of delayed surgeries and unaffordable remedies. Many of her families do not qualify for Medicaid, but neither can they pay for private insurance. If anything, the sluggish economy and layoffs have actually pushed more of her patients onto the Medicaid rolls. She considers this a mixed blessing.
Still, she continues to give away eyeglasses. She puts new lenses in old frames. She discourages patients from getting contacts, which are more costly than frames, less durable and more likely to be lost. 
"All the teenagers want contacts, but I won't hardly give them out anymore," she said. "It's hard, though. I've got to go in now and convince an 18-year-old to get glasses, even though his parents will probably be relieved." 
She ducked once more into her examining room. Minutes later, she leaned out, no longer ruffled. "He already had glasses," she said, with a sheepish smile. "And he treated them well, so I relented."
Joe Pena has often told neighbors the story of his Mas Que Pan Bakery, how he and his father, Jose, opened during the 1990 recession. Businesses to the left and right closed, but theirs survived.
"We made it solely because we had no payroll," Mr. Pena said. "I have six brothers and sisters and six aunts and uncles here, and for a long time we were an extended family business."
Today, the weekend lines are long for 75-cent espressos and 25-cent doughnuts. The teenage girls in red aprons working behind the counter are still Penas: Julissa, Erika, Elizabeth and Jackie. But they are paid $5.75 an hour, and are allowed to work only after school and on weekends.
Still, Mr. Pena has noticed some unnerving changes. Last summer, one of his sisters got laid off at AT&T and soon after a cousin lost a job at Goldman Sachs. By summer's end, morning traffic at the bakery had slipped 30 percent, about $200. His $1,200 utility bill had also doubled. 
He talked with his father, and in September they began bracing for his second recession. They sold some equipment and raised the refrigerator temperature from 36 degrees to 40 degrees. They affixed sleep timers to other units. Three months ago, they introduced a dollar menu to sell croissants, coconut bread and conchas.
So far, the trimming has lowered bills and kept customers. But Mr. Pena has already decided that, if the economy worsens, he cannot cut prices further. He would either have to stop paying his sisters to work for him or rent out the store he has owned since 1993. 
"In this neighborhood, we're feeling the pinch," he said. "I hear people talk. I hear complaints. Then I go to the bank, and I do the same thing."
It is difficult to hear anything over the surge of hair dryers at the tiny Low-Price Unisex Salon on 55th Street, especially on a Friday afternoon. Haircuts are $10 there, and recently, nine women with wet heads and flushed cheeks were wedged inside the narrow pink shop. Paubla Liriano, the Puerto Rican owner, carried the scissors, and, usually, the conversation.
"Years ago, there was a lot of welfare, but now we all want to work," Ms. Liriano said. 
A 49-year-old Dominican native named Carmen spoke up. "We also want credit but it's hard to get credit in these Fifth Avenue stores now," she said. "They tell us to make more money, to make more than $40,000."
The price of milk and cheese has gone up, Juana Gomez said from beneath her bubble dryer. Rents have too, Ms. Liriano added. Five years ago, her basement apartment rented for $600 a month. Today, it is $900.
Setting down her scissors and grabbing a hand-held dryer, Ms. Liriano said, "You know, most people here send money back home, but many are sending back less because we have less." 
Last year Carmen sent $400 a month to her family in the Dominican Republic. In January, she sent $100. The lasting impact on her family is still murky; for now, her family is buying fewer staples like cereal, juice and milk, which are expensive on the island. If the recession lasts much longer, she and other women might have to send even less. 
Ms. Liriano turned off her blow dryer. The tiny room fell into a rare quiet.
"The neighborhood is good, I think," she said firmly. "We don't have as many gangs or drugs. But we are paying for that. It's expensive to be here."
All nine customers nodded.
The tension in this patch of Sunset Park extends even to the basketball courts at Sixth Avenue and 54th Street, although the teenage regulars rarely speak of it. On a recent Saturday, Spanish was shouted on two courts, Mandarin on a third and nothing on a fourth. The players on the fourth court were four black and Latino youngsters and Shuang Jian Zhu, 15. Jian Zhu has kind eyes and the fuzzy beginnings of a first mustache. He shot well, and his friend, Ying Wu, 14, grinned from the sidelines.
Suddenly, Jian Zhu stopped and watched as a lanky mix of high schoolers sauntered onto his court. Seconds later, he picked up his ball and walked away. Ying Wu followed in silence.
"It's not always nice here," Jian Zhu said as he sat on a nearby bench, tightening his shoelaces. "People curse at me and ask for my ball. Two months ago, they scared me so I said I would call the police. It worked. I kept my ball."
Jian Zhu took the ball in his hands. It was a Spalding stamped with black Chinese characters. His mother had paid $30 for it in China, where she still lived with Jian Zhu's sister. For the past two years, Jian Zhu has lived in Sunset Park, near Eighth Avenue, with his 70-year-old grandparents. Money has become tighter since his arrival, he said, and his grandparents are unemployed. 
What that means to Jian Zhu, though he never said as much to the court bullies, was this: if he lost his ball, he was not likely to get another. So he is careful. His family cannot afford extras this year.

HEADLINE: Notes from Salt Lake City; 
Tiptoeing Out to Meet the World

BYLINE:  By Katharine Biele; Katharine Biele writes frequently about Utah politics.

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY 

 BODY:
As Salt Lake City whips its citizenry into a fraternal frenzy for the 2002 Winter Olympics, there is no loss of irony in the rallying cry, "This is the Place." But the place for what?
 Some 150 years ago, Brigham Young led a small group of Latter-day Saints -- the Mormons -- from persecution in Illinois to a barren lake bottom in Utah. "This is the place," he intoned as they entered a valley that would give them peace and freedom from everyone else. This week, Young's descendants will welcome a world the church's founders once feared, eager to take Utah into the mainstream and onto the world stage. The problem is that Utahans can't seem to agree on what mainstream means and are worried that they will end up mostly mortified and exhausted from two weeks of cultural probing by the world's media machines. 
 In this Mormon-dominated state, known for its healthy lifestyle and its moral proscriptions, the Olympics is all about a big gamble. Salt Lake City is not like Los Angeles or Atlanta, big cities where the Olympics became part of a multifaceted urban experience. Salt Lake is the mildly diverse capital of a monolithic and largely rural conservative state. The last few years have brought outdoor malls and French cuisine, but also the purchase of a downtown square by the Mormon Church, which declared it off limits to loiterers, smokers and sin in general.
People here are used to defending a squeaky-clean, if peculiar, image, but our city's leaders hope to go one better. Both the governor and Salt Lake City's mayor insist that this will not be the Mormon Olympics. This is about Utah and business and sports, they say. Even the church itself has politely told its members to back off from their missionary zeal. Still, there's plenty of reason for stage fright. The Olympic bribery scandal pretty much showed the Salt Lake organizers as hypocritical bumpkins who managed to spend a lot of money giving some influential people a good time. And, of course, this is a city where polygamy has become the name of a beer.
Even the Salt Lake Organizing Committee has been poking fun at our cultural quirks. One pin being sold by Olympic-gewgaw marketeers depicts green Jell-O as the state's favorite food. There are pins showing Mormon missionaries on bicycles, a pin of the "Mormon people mover" (a minivan, a reference to the abundance of children here) and a "super seagull" pin recalling the miracle in which gulls saved the pioneers' first crops by feasting on crickets.
While we Utahans have our inside jokes, it's another thing to see our idiosyncrasies sent up by satellite hookup to every continent. Polygamy is a case in point.
Not too long ago our governor, Mike Leavitt, spoke nostalgically of his polygamist ancestors. That was before the polygamy discussion went uncomfortably global when Governor Leavitt's brother began prosecuting Tom Green, a high-profile and media-savvy fundamentalist with five wives.
Although polygamy is no longer allowed within the Mormon Church and the relatively few polygamists who live here have splintered off on their own, that hasn't stopped the wisecracks or the beer sales. A local ski resort did a couple of polygamy spoofs on billboards. And a local brewery -- not the official Olympic beer maker -- markets Polygamy Porter with the slogan "Why Have Just One?" The stunt has boosted sales and invited censure since the Mormon Church does not condone the use of alcoholic beverages.
So it actually showed a great deal of political brass when Salt Lake's mayor, Rocky Anderson, sought to soften the drinking laws. There have been some concessions, but Salt Lake won't be the kind of party town the mayor had hoped our visitors would find.
As the opening ceremonies approach -- after years of venue construction and road improvements -- it's too late to be anxious about our image. Some already prophesy the hideous aftermath of this giant party: dirt, debts and recession. The excitement here is palpable, though.
Utah will alight on the world stage like a slightly awkward debutante at her first dance. Or it will hit the top of the embarrassment meter and go back to being a wallflower at the party. The challenge now is to silence the wayward polygamists, keep transit running, feed the masses and proselytize only when spoken to.

HEADLINE: URBAN TACTIC; 
Have Pen, Will Grovel

BYLINE:  By TARA BAHRAMPOUR 

 BODY:
LAST June, Brett Forrest, a 28-year-old freelance writer, walked into the West 15th Street offices of Gear magazine and pitched a tent along with large signs reading, "You owe me $3,865." He had written two articles for the magazine for which he had never been paid. It worked: after eating peanuts inside the tent for an hour, Mr. Forrest received his check.
 That strategy might not work for everyone. But it underlines a truism among freelancers these days: as print and online magazines look less like solid institutions and more like falling dominoes, those who rely on them for their livelihood are left scrambling. 
 Perhaps nowhere is this scramble more obvious than in New York, the nation's media capital, where freelancing for magazines and newspapers is as common as screenwriting is in Los Angeles. The city's prominence in the industry only grew in the 90's, with the explosion of content-producing Web sites, many centered in Silicon Alley. 
But then the Internet frenzy slowed and the economy faltered. Moreover, in the past year alone, several major magazines based in New York City have folded, some of them relatively new and some in business for more than a generation: George, Mademoiselle, Working Woman, Lingua Franca, Brill's Content, The Industry Standard and, most recently and most notably, Talk magazine.
Supporting yourself as a freelance writer has never been easy, but with these successive blows, the lot of New York freelancers has substantially worsened.
Even at surviving magazines, freelancers say, editors are taking longer to get back to them and are relying on staff writers for work they once farmed out. Articles that are assigned out tend to be shorter and less lucrative.
Last summer, Ellen Ullman was the technology editor for Working Woman, which had just celebrated its 25th anniversary. Then, in August, it ceased publication. Ms. Ullman had freelanced in the past, but when she returned to it, the market had changed.
"Two years ago, I was turning down work," she said. Now, "I'm eating ramen noodles. I'm 35 years old, and it's like I'm back in college." These days, she said, even getting an assignment is no guarantee: she handed in one article on a Monday and the magazine, a Time Warner publication, folded on Thursday. She did receive a kill fee, a payment that is guaranteed even if an article does not run. But, she said, "It's hard when you're counting on a thousand bucks and you get $250."
Although there are no hard statistics on how many freelance writers live in New York, Mediabistro.com, an organization that arranges parties, panels and training for media professionals, has an invitation list of 70,000 people, and counts 350,000 visits to its Web site a month. Most of its subscribers live in New York, and many were swept up in the Internet frenzy.
"It looked like it was never going to end," said Laurel Touby, the site's founder. "The Internet made media people more valuable than they had ever been. It created the equivalent of a million daily newspapers."
Those newspapers required editors, writers and copy editors, many of whom lost their jobs as online sites foundered.
"I am getting besieged by e-mails and phone calls as never before," Ms. Touby said. "Senior, senior people; deputy managing editors who lost their jobs and went freelance. They can't make a living, they're distraught, they have families to feed. This is their livelihood. It's frightening." At a recent party, one woman approached her in tears. "She sounded suicidal," said Ms. Touby. "She was over 35, saying, 'What do I do? Where do I go?' "
Amid gallows humor about waiting tables or going into public relations, freelancers care coming up with coping strategies.
"We're going to have to stop relying on the magazines we're used to; we now have to go back to trying new ones," said Alix Strauss, who has freelanced in New York for five years. "There's a million new magazines -- a magazine for eating sushi off naked people, a magazine for Christian cats and the people who own them. You just have to decide whether you want to write for them. And of course they're not going to give you the $2 a word" many established writers are used to.
As freelancers are forced to reassess their standards, magazines are able to raise theirs. Mark Cohen, a deputy editor for Men's Journal, says he now has the luxury to be choosy. Last year, he said: "There were people I would encourage to send ideas, people whose copy needed a lot of work. I frankly don't have to do that anymore. People I couldn't get to do assignments before are now doing them for less money than I paid a year ago."
Malcolm Venable, a freelancer who graduated from Columbia University's journalism school last May, said he had not gotten to the point where he would take less money for an assignment. But he is worried.
"I just started out, and I was doing O.K. for a minute," he said. Now, "a lot of people that I made contact with just aren't there." He may temp or tend bar while he waits out the slump.
It is a slump that some in the industry see as a kind of media-Darwinism, a deep freeze that will kill off some freelancers but leave others with more room to thrive.
"It's going to be the hardcore ones who are ready to starve in order to do this work," Ms. Touby said. "It's putting all the pretenders out of it. All the people who thought it was a glamorous, sexy industry are going to be shaken out."
DAVID WALLIS, chief executive of featurewell.com, an online marketplace for new and previously published articles, agreed. "One of the unintended benefits of tough times is we're going to see more of a meritocracy," he said. "The better writers will succeed at the expense of the lesser ones."
In the meantime, he said, writers should reconsider their attitudes about their work. "It's been seen as almost sullying the profession to talk business, to see words as products and editors as clients," he said. "They need to market themselves more aggressively and not be afraid to talk money." 
At the same time, he said, as individual magazines seem more vulnerable, writers should "maybe think twice about taking that 5,000-word assignment right now and putting all their eggs in one basket."
Freelancers say they are confident the industry will bounce back, and that even online journalism remains a viable option.
"The dust hasn't settled," said Lynn Harris, who has freelanced for 12 years. "There was a heady magazine gold rush. With the closing of Talk, there's a fear now that they're going away." But she sees a distinction between the industry's "old war horses" and its "little fancy ponies."
"If we just wait it out and write ad copy at night, it's going to be fine," Ms. Harris predicted.
One freelancer, Mark Boal, said the current climate was actually good for his business. Mr. Boal, who was once on staff at Brill's Content and who has freelanced on and off for six years, said that recently he had found it easier to sell hard-hitting articles. "As the Dow seems to be going down," he said, "the demand for serious investigative work is going up. I imagine that hardship somehow clarifies priorities."
Besides, Mr. Boal added, referring to a recent New Yorker business column, "All the great magazines started in recessions."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/Elizabeth R. Bramwell; 
Bramwell Growth Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
TECHNOLOGY was the holy grail for growth investors several years ago. Elizabeth R. Bramwell, who runs the $200 million Bramwell Growth fund, does not ignore the high-tech world, but she now emphasizes growth in homelier areas, like retailing.
 "Christmas sales were better than anticipated, and historically the first quarter is good for retailing," Ms. Bramwell said from her office in Midtown Manhattan, "especially as we come off two years of unusual economic conditions." 
 Bramwell, a large growth fund, lost .6 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, compared with a 5.8 percent loss for its sector and a 3 percent drop in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, according to Morningstar Inc. It lost 17.5 percent in the 12 months through Thursday, compared with losses of 27 percent for its group and 16.2 percent in the S. & P. 500.
Ms. Bramwell, 61, is chief executive of Bramwell Capital Management, which runs more than $600 million for institutions and in the Bramwell Focus and Growth funds. She started the Gabelli Growth fund in 1987 and managed it until early 1994, when she left the Gabelli Group.
Ms. Bramwell selects the fund's 60 to 70 stocks primarily from among American companies, relying on research by Wall Street and her own firm and industry conferences, followed by talks with company management.
"We look for top-line revenue and sales growth and, ideally, expanding profit margins through operating leverage," she said.
Ms. Bramwell keeps an eye on the economy, she says, because price-to-earnings multiples are inversely related to inflation and interest rates. Both of the latter should stay quite low, she said, adding, "The first half of this year should be tough, but things should start improving in the second half and then look pretty good in 2003."
She generally prefers to look at per-share earnings growth over Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which is favored by many money managers as a measure of corporate performance. 
"Ebitda misses a company's opportunity for expanded earnings growth from falling interest expense or decreasing tax rates," she said.
Over all, the portfolio's companies have an estimated capitalization-weighted per-share earnings growth rate of 17 percent over the next two years, versus 8 percent for the S. & P. 500 companies, she says.
Currently, she sees opportunity among companies with market capitalizations from $10 billion to $20 billion, the lower end of the large-cap range. "They have more liquidity than small-cap and midcap companies," she said, "but they're not so big that their growth rate is compromised by their size." The weighted median market cap of the fund's companies is $32 billion, compared with $61 billion for the S. & P. 500.
Ms. Bramwell prefers companies where the price-earnings ratio equals the estimated 2003 growth rate, but she's willing to pay up to 50 percent more. When she expects consistent earnings growth, she will continue to hold shares even as the multiple approaches two. She reviews shares for sale as valuation increases, or a company loses market share or its finances deteriorate.
The fund has annual expenses of 1.53 percent, compared with 1.46 percent for its group, Morningstar said.
In the retail sector, Ms. Bramwell has been buying shares of the Walgreen Company, the discount drugstore chain in Deerfield, Ill. She first bought shares in August 1994 at $4.77, adjusted for stock splits; the stock closed Friday at $35.54. "Management is continuing to expand, replace old stores and plow back retained earnings into improving operations," she said. "And with the demise of Kmart, and problems with others in the industry, Walgreen is likely to benefit from redirected consumer traffic." She expects earnings growth of 17 percent a year, on average, for the next three to five years.
In October, she began buying shares of the Tenet Healthcare Corporation, in Santa Barbara, Calif., which manages acute care hospitals. She paid $58 a share; on Friday, they closed at $63.31. Tenet, which has a market capitalization of $21 billion, should benefit from higher hospitalization rates as the population ages, Ms. Bramwell said. Management has been reducing and refinancing debt, decreasing interest expense and bolstering earnings. She expects long-term average annual earnings growth of 20 percent.
She also favors Affiliated Computer Services, in Dallas, with a market cap of $6.2 billion, which provides corporations with technological resources. 
"After Sept. 11, everyone has put more emphasis on storage and security," which are among the company's specialties, Ms. Bramwell said. "Affiliated has a very strong pipeline of new contracts." 
Affiliated management is particularly effective at cost control, she said. She expects earnings growth of 20 percent a year in the next three to five years. She first bought shares in November for $93 each; on Friday they closed at $94.20.

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES; 
Reassessing a Tactic When Its Momentum Begins to Slow

BYLINE:  By MARK HULBERT; Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a newsletter based in Annandale, Va. His column on investment strategies appears every other week. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
EARNINGS momentum strategies have been losing steam, though it is too early to count them out.
 The strategies favor the stocks of companies whose earnings are growing most rapidly, while shunning or even selling short those whose earnings are contracting the fastest. All exploit the tendency of investors to respond slowly to new information. 
 Rather than reacting immediately to a strong earnings report, for example, investors often bid up a stock gradually. Those who use earnings momentum strategies can make a profit by reacting more quickly. The profits have been large enough and enduring enough to impress skeptical academics. 
Recently, however, the strategies have struggled. According to research by Ford Investors Services in San Diego, stocks with the highest earnings momentum had one of their worst years in 2001, not only relative to the market but also relative to strategies based on other popular stock selection tools, like the price-to-earnings ratio, dividend yield or relative strength. In the last three years, stocks with the highest earnings momentum lagged the market by more than they have over any other three-year period since 1974.
The editors of the investment newsletters that I monitor differ over what accounts for the recent struggles of these strategies.
One hypothesis focuses on the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation FD, which took effect in 2000. Regulation FD requires companies to release material information publicly, rather than privately to Wall Street analysts. Some newsletter editors think that Regulation FD reduces the market's reaction time to earnings information and therefore the profitability of earnings momentum strategies.
Many finance professors are skeptical about this hypothesis. Academic research suggests that deep-rooted psychological factors cause investors to react slowly to new earnings information. These factors have nothing to do with how companies communicate. For example, investors develop attachments to stocks they love and revulsion to those that have lost them money. They assimilate contrary information slowly, whether that information comes from an analyst or directly from the company.
In another hypothesis, earnings momentum strategies simply do not work in economic downturns. The rationale is that in boom periods, positive earnings momentum genuinely signals growth prospects. In downturns, companies that buck the trend tend to be the best defensive players, a trait that is admirable in a recession but that may have nothing to do with how well a company performs over the long term.
I am also skeptical of this hypothesis because there is no evidence suggesting that investors' reaction time becomes speedier in a downturn. In fact, the data suggest otherwise. Over the last 27 years, according to Ford Investor Services, there were four other years besides 2001 in which earnings momentum strategies lagged the average stock -- 1984, 1995, 1997 and 1999. The economy grew in all four of those years.
There is another explanation why earnings momentum strategies have languished: It may be that so many advisers and investors have started to use earnings momentum strategies that they have begun to kill the goose that lays the golden egg. This is the likely fate of any strategy that becomes too popular, and it is consistent with data showing that these strategies have found it tougher in recent years.
But it is premature to conclude that this is the case for earnings momentum. Given the strategies' stellar long-term record, it will take many more years of mediocre performance to persuade statisticians that this recent experience is not an exception. Since the alternative is giving the boot to every strategy as soon as it stops working, an approach that we know does not work over time, the intelligent bet in the meantime for followers of earnings momentum strategies should be to stick to their guns.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Erratic Lately"Betting on earnings momentum has paid off over the last few decades, but the strategy has stumbled in recent years. Graph shows the difference in performance between the 1,000 largest stocks and 200 of them with the greatest earnings momentum from 1975-2000. (Source: Ford Investor Services)

HEADLINE: After Sept. 11: Getting the Jobless Back to Work 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As "Help for Those in a Wave of Joblessness" (Home Front column, Jan. 27) noted, an estimated 100,000 jobs have been lost since the World Trade Center attack. What most people do not know is that much of the money for job-training programs like the one run by the Consortium for Worker Education comes from the American public. 
 In addition to cash payments to victims and their families and grants for other services like mental health counseling, the September 11th Fund gave a $430,000 grant to the consortium to assist those who lost their jobs as a result of the attack. 
 It's an invaluable service that has helped thousands of New Yorkers get back on their feet.

From Anxiety toHints of Confidence

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
Fears that murky accounting practices could lead more companies down the road to bankruptcy threatened to outweigh a series of better-than-expected economic reports last week.
 After Global Crossing filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday, concern heightened about accounting practices at the PNC Financial Services Group, Tyco International, Cendant and the Williams Companies. 
Worried that accounting problems could portend more Enron-like collapses, investors sent the broad indexes to their lowest levels since November. 
 The market rebounded on the announcement of a rise in gross domestic product for the fourth quarter and on the Federal Reserve's decision not to cut interest rates. The central bank said the economy had begun to show modest signs of recovery. Consumer confidence and orders for durable goods also rose. 
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 67.18 points, or 0.7 percent, to 9,907.26. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 11.08 points, or 1 percent, to 1,122.20. The Nasdaq composite index fell 26.46 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,911.24. The yield of the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond fell from 5.07 to 4.98 percent. SHERRI DAY

Hear the One About . . .?

BYLINE:  By Paul Zielbauer 

 BODY:
ENRON has spawned a new lexicon. Gov. James E. McGreevey, criticizing New Jersey Republicans' handling of budget numbers, used a new term: "Enronize," meaning "to hide fiscal shortcomings through slick financial legerdemain and bald-faced lies." 
Here are more. 
 * Enronic: when a high-flying, seemingly invincible person or entity goes down in flames (figuratively speaking). 
 * N. Ron Hubbard: L. Ron's secret twin brother, founder of the Church of Bankruptology.
* Enronica: cheap souvenirs, like Enron stock certificates. 
* Enrontia: the burning desire to shred things.
* Enronymous Bosch: the company's landscape architect.
* Enronomania: the political and economic fallout of the company going bust, particularly thick in Washington (where Bush is headquartered), Houston (where Enron is headquartered) and Chicago (where Arthur Andersen is headquartered). 
* Enrontropy: the principle that a corporation's greed is directly proportional to how many lives its failure would ruin. Paul Zielbauer

HEADLINE: Correspondence/Touring Somalia; 
When All Else Fails (Like the State), Take the Drug Flight Into Town

BYLINE:  By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya 

 BODY:
ONE clear sign that a state has failed is that no one asks for your passport when you fly in. There will, though, be someone demanding a $25 or $50 "customs fee" -- the representative of whatever warlord controls the dirt landing strip.
 There are five such "airports" serving Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, not counting the real one, which has been closed for years. The easiest way in is on a drug flight. 
 There are regular flights in from Nairobi for United Nations aid workers, but they're expensive and require United Nations permission and 72 hours notice. There are flights for European Union aid workers; they are free, but journalists get bumped first. 
Then there are khat flights. On a Saturday afternoon last month, I called Bluebird Aviation, a charter agency. They gave me the cellphone number of Abdulkadir M. Sofie, a khat exporter -- in the United States, one might say smuggler or drug lord, but khat is legal in both Kenya and Somalia.
Khat (pronounced somewhere between "cat" and "chat" and short for catha edulis) is chewed while green for a coca-leaf sort of high that speeds up your heart, clears your sinuses and makes you jumpy and a little euphoric -- but still able to drive or shoot as straight as is normally required in Somalia.
Like coffee, it grows in Kenya's Meru mountains, but is picked at night and rushed to Nairobi to fly at dawn, before the leaves dry out.
Mr. Sofie asked if I was a "gentleman" -- meaning that, if he agreed to forgo hauling three bales weighing about what my luggage and I did, would I be at Nairobi's Wilson Airport with $300 at 6 a.m.?
I said I was. To make sure, he picked me up himself at my hotel at 5:30.
I have never seen an airport in Africa service an airline so efficiently. Men in ties swarmed around six newish-looking Czech 25-passenger planes, climbing on the wings to pump in gas, overseeing the loading of khat and Somalis. A Red Cross plane, virtually ignored, slunk off down the runway.
My photographer and I were the only ones the Kenyan authorities put through emigration formalities. A television producer later suggested that I had been racially profiled. After all, she asked, who's the most likely threat: the Somali toting home a 100-pound bag of Kenyan rice, or the white American with the satellite phone who might call in an airstrike from the offshore fleet trying to make sure that Osama bin Laden doesn't slip into Somalia?
We got the only row of seats on the plane, braced by 70 khat bales giving off eau de yard waste. "Perfume," enthused Mr. Sofie. In lieu of an in-flight snack, I nibbled some, expecting a bit of a buzz. But there was nothing. (I was later set straight by Mohammed Abdi Nouh, 46, a roadside khat-seller. To get high, I would have to chomp up two fistfuls, at least $4 worth -- which gives some idea of what a drain khat is on an economy where most people live on less than $1 a day. His clients were doctors and teachers, he boasted. He was a goldsmith and ashamed of selling khat to live, but Somalia is now too dangerous for women to wear gold jewelry in public.)
A T the dirt landing strip, we were met by Faisal Ahmed Abdulle, 32, a translator from the Shamo Hotel. He was, like many Somalis on the streets, missing half an arm. He lost it, he said, to an American bomb on Oct. 3, 1993, in the Black Hawk Down battle, which killed 18 Americans and about 1,000 Somalis in downtown Mogadishu. He said he was just in the neighborhood, but a Somali journalist said Mr. Abdulle had been a bodyguard for the warlord Osman Ali Atto back then, and might have been working that day.
Behind us, a pickup with 12 young men with AK-47's fell in for the drive to the hotel.
"They are good boys, all good boys," Mr. Abdulle reassured us. One, named Galil, later told me he was a freelance journalist, but being a gunman paid better, at $4 a day. Far from being a conventional thug, he had a sweet smile, sometimes helped translate and on a hot day offered to treat me to a watermelon slice from a street vendor.
"You personally mean nothing," Matt Bryden, Somalia coordinator for the War-Torn Societies Project research institute in Nairobi, had explained as he warned me to expect my hotel's airport shuttle to come with a fire team. "If you're staying at the Shamo, your gunmen are from Mr. Shamo's clan, or allies. The other militias in Mogadishu know that if Mr. Shamo loses a guest, his hotel suffers, so his gunmen will come after them."
That almost happened three days later, when we were nearly cut off by a pickup equipped with an anti-aircraft gun and carrying a gang rumored to have recently killed a money-changer with $30,000 in his safe. Presumably, the gang was trying to kidnap us for ransom. Mr. Abdulle swung into a camp of the provisional government's fledgling army, talked 10 overexcited soldiers out of shooting us for racing past their checkpoint, and slipped us out a rear entrance near our hotel. No soldier or policeman would chase the gang, another translator told me, but the money-changer's relatives might.
We left soon after on another khat flight.
S OMALIA wasn't always like this, explained Yusuf Hassan Isaq, a reporter for the BBC Somali Service. A return to Islam, so feared by the West, is how decent people have protected themselves in the Mad Max world of warlord battles and extortion that has prevailed since 1990. Attendance at mosques is way up. The hawala banks hire people with conservative religious beliefs in the hope that they will be more honest. Businessmen have asked clerics to form sharia courts and have hired gunmen to protect them, since there are no judges or police.
In the time of Mohammed Siad Barre, who flipflopped from being a pro-Soviet dictator to being a pro-American dictator during the years from 1969 to 1991, women served in the army and wore pants and short skirts. Now, they are not allowed to work at hawalas except as cleaners, and virtually all are veiled from brow to ankle, as much to lower the risk of rape by displaying modesty, as to display piety. However, the veils are stunning and their faces can be seen.
The self-imposed neoconservative Islam of terrified Somalia is still not as brutal as the Taliban's or as Iran's was under Ayatollah Khomeini in the 1980's. Sharia courts here do not lop limbs; there are no religious police beating women in the streets. When a Somali grabs another's beard, it is a customary way to get attention during conversation.
However, the newly armed society and the newly Islamic society do have one unhappy nexus in the lawless state, Mr. Isaq said: hand grenades.
"Some women, to be safe, carry them under those veils," Mr. Isaq said. "And some men carry them in their pockets. When they pray in the mosque, they sometimes fall out and go off -- boom!"

 Re "Pension Bubble Loses Some Air" (Economic View, Jan. 20) in which Daniel Altman discusses whether legislation intended to protect 401(k) accounts from corporate failure could reduce people's incentive to save. 
 Workers, the companies they work for and the country would be hurt if the proposals, in particular efforts to limit company stock to 10 percent of a 401(k) plan, kept people from saving. Tougher restrictions could dissuade companies from offering any type of match to retirement plans of employees. Not only do the stock matches encourage saving, but they promote loyalty, or at least create an awareness of company finances.

English Town Whispers Of a Taliban Connection

BYLINE:  By SARAH LYALL 

DATELINE: TIPTON, England, Jan. 29 

 BODY:
This has always seemed to be a harmonious town. Not exactly a model of racial integration -- the whites and the Asian people keep themselves to themselves, as the English expression goes -- but a place where everyone gets along, more or less.
 Beneath the facade of tolerant multiculturalism, though, more complicated forces are at work in Tipton, which is near Birmingham in the West Midlands. Teenagers speak of fights between whites and Asians at the local high school. In town elections in May 2000, the neo-fascist, anti-immigrant British National Party drew 24 percent of the vote, one of its best showings in England. 
 While white anger was becoming more focused, a small group of young men, second-generation Pakistanis, were gradually turning away from the West. Meeting in a makeshift mosque at the end of a nondescript street, they reportedly became increasingly devout and radicalized. They took to wearing traditional dress, chastised their families for becoming overly assimilated and made bold pronouncements about going off to fight for Islam. 
At least three of them seem to have done just that. In a development that has sent waves of anger and confusion through Tipton, an economically depressed and generally sleepy spot, two friends -- Shafiq Rasul, 24, and Asif Iqbal, 20 -- were identified last weekend as being among the suspected pro-Taliban fighters held by the United States at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
A third, Ruhal Ahmed, 20, is being held in Kandahar, Afghanistan, where he has been undergoing questioning by British and American forces. Meanwhile, Munir Ali, also part of the circle of friends, is believed to have crossed into Afghanistan but has not yet surfaced.
In Tipton, the authorities are still investigating what outside forces were brought to bear on the suspects, and whether they were part of a broader pattern of recruitment among Asians in and around Birmingham. 
Meanwhile, some residents speak of a small radical Muslim sect to which the young men were said to belong, saying that it preached violence against non-Muslims. Whites who live down the road from the mosque talk in whispers about a dozen more Tipton residents rumored to have gone off to fight for the Taliban.
But Tipton is no Bradford, local officials say, a reference to one of the cities where Asian youths clashed violently with the police last summer. It has never been known as a breeding ground for extremism.
"Tipton is a multicultural, multifaith community," said Ian Binnie, the head teacher at Alexandra High School and Sixth Form Center, which Mr. Iqbal, Mr. Rasul and Mr. Ahmed all attended. 
"Relations among the different groups are harmonious," Mr. Binnie said. "This is a tribute to the tolerance of the people of Tipton." 
Still, it is not the easiest place to live. Tipton is part of the borough of Sandwell, a cluster of six towns in the center of the Black Country, which takes its name from the black smoke that used to spew from its factories. Now, the factories are closed and the jobs that were a way of life for the first generation of immigrants from the Asian subcontinent are gone. In Sandwell, unemployment stands at about 19 percent, and many families live on less than $150 a week.
Figures from the 1991 census show that 9 percent or so of the population of 38,000 people is white and that the nonwhites tend to come from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. They also tend to live in a low-income housing project on the seedier side of Alexandra Park. The Pakistani residents, in particular, retain close ties with their families back home, and arranged marriages are common.
It is here that the three suspects lived with their families, went to school together and played together on a local soccer team. It is here, neighbors say, that their discontent began to take root and find a focus in Islamic radicalism.
"He was fascinated by Arab suicide bombers," a friend of Mr. Iqbal told the newspaper The Sun. "He talked about how brave they were and said he thought he had the guts to be one."
According to the friend, Mr. Iqbal hated living in Tipton and told him, "I want to be somebody, and not die a nobody in a dump like this."
Mr. Binnie at the high school said Mr. Rasul and Mr. Iqbal had been "involved in occasional scrapes, but nothing serious." But in 1999, Mr. Iqbal and the third detainee, Mr. Ahmed, were convicted of attacking a 16-year-old Asian youth with hammers and bottles as the youth stumbled into a fight between two Asian gangs. Fining them each about $700 and sentencing them to 150 hours of community service, the judge in the case called the assault "a thoroughly disgraceful incident."
But friends and relatives say they cannot reconcile the accusations with their perceptions of the three men. 
"As far as I'm concerned, these are three safe guys who I used to play football with," said Ala Udddin, president of Tipton United, the local soccer team. "I find it astonishing that they are under arrest, suspected of being terrorists."
The suspects' families say that the first time they heard anything about terrorist connections was when they heard the news from the British Foreign Office. 
"I just want my son to come home," Mr. Iqbal's mother, Imtiaz, said. "He is not a terrorist." 
Mr. Iqbal reportedly told his family that he was traveling to Pakistan to meet his father and prepare for an arranged marriage. 
Meanwhile, the family of Mr. Rasul also thought he was in Pakistan, studying software engineering.
Speaking to reporters at their house a few streets down from the mosque on Wellington Street, which Mr. Rasul was said to frequent, his three brothers described him as a quiet, peace-loving stockroom clerk in an electronics store who loved nightclubs and designer clothes and was thoroughly Westernized. 
An indifferent Muslim who flunked out of law school and had to be prodded into attending mosque, his brothers said, Mr. Rasul once had a white girlfriend named Shirley. He took a three-month leave from his job in mid-October, enrolling in the software course in Pakistan because it was cheaper than similar courses in Britain, his brothers said. 
The family's last contact with Mr. Rasul, they said, was when he sent an e-mail message to his oldest brother, Habib, on Oct. 25 to ask for advice on computer modules. Then there was nothing until last week, when they received a phone call from the Foreign Office informing them that Mr. Rasul was being held in Cuba. 
"At first I thought it was a prank call from one of my American colleagues," said Habib Rasul, who works as a computer specialist. "I just put the phone down and two minutes later my mobile phone rang, and it was my brother, saying Shafiq was in Cuba." 
Habib Rasul said the only explanation he could come up with was that his brother had gone to Afghanistan to help refugees and those left destitute because of the fighting.
"There are questions we still want an answer to," he said. "What the hell was he doing in Afghanistan? How the hell did he get there?"

Undiminished, That Sporting Connection Lives On

BYLINE:  By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
The love of sports, as fan and participant, is a joyful thread woven through so many of the lives that ended Sept. 11. It is also a comforting thread: the rugby star on the plane that crashed in western Pennsylvania, the Yankee lover in Rescue 1, the soccer player in the Pentagon, the golfer at Cantor Fitzgerald were bound by more than an act of terrorism. It seems fitting to celebrate their sporting lives on this Super Bowl Sunday, the holiest day of the American sports calendar.
 The sports connection was particularly pronounced among the victims of this attack because they tended to be men on the sunny side of middle age, physical, competitive, used to the quick camaraderie of the team, be it a firefighting squad or a trading desk. 
 "When you hire people at these brokerage houses, you look favorably on athletes," said Carmine Calzonetti, who spent six years at Cantor Fitzgerald, the firm hardest hit by the attack. "They're used to hard work and they're disciplined. They're used to teamwork, playing under pressure and playing hurt. They'll come to work with a stomachache.
"But most important, they bounce back. They can handle defeat, move right on. Athletes are sure they're going to win the next game, make the next trade."
Calzonetti said he had made an easy transition from the win-lose world of sports to the win-lose world of stocks and bonds. A 1969 graduate of St. John's who later coached there and was an athletic administrator, he was recruited to Wall Street in the mid-1980's by a former basketball teammate. His twin girls had just been born, and with four children he needed to make more money.
He moved to Cantor in 1993 and stayed until the end of 1999. He left because of the hours; he didn't want to miss the twins' high school lacrosse careers. Calzonetti is now the commissioner of the New York Collegiate Athletic Conference, a league of a dozen Division II schools like Adelphi, Mercy and Bridgeport. His daughters, Claire and Julia, are playing lacrosse at Stanford.
More than 650 people from Cantor are among the 2,870 dead or missing at the World Trade Center. Some of the varsity athletes among them were Mike Pelletier and Rich Stewart, who played ice hockey at St. Lawrence; Lisa Egan, a basketball player, and Don Adams, a football player, at Fairleigh Dickinson's Madison campus; Ted Luckett, a soccer player at Ohio Wesleyan; Eamon McEneaney, who played lacrosse and football at Cornell; and Christian Maltby, a swimmer at Fordham.
The National Collegiate Athletic Association News memorialized some of its athletes in a special supplement last November. They included Tyler Ugolyn, who played basketball at Columbia and worked at Fred Alger Management on the 93rd floor of the north tower; Michael Weinberg, a city firefighter who played baseball at St. John's; and Mari-Rae Sopper, a former gymnast at Iowa State who had just been hired to coach the women's team at the University of California at Santa Barbara. She was on Flight 77, which crashed into the Pentagon.
Two athletes are thought to have been among the passengers who resisted the hijackers on United Flight 93. One was Todd Beamer, a varsity baseball player at Wheaton College in Illinois. The other was Mark Bingham, a member of the 1991 and 1993 national collegiate rugby championship teams at the University of California at Berkeley.
"It's not about how how good you were as an athlete, it's about how competitive," Calzonetti said. "Being good is sometimes about genes. Competition is in the spirit. The 6-foot intramural center could be more competitive than the 6-5 Division II center who could be more competitive than the 6-10 Division I center. It's about spirit."
However separated socially, economically and professionally, Gordy Aamoth, Antonio Alvarez and Calixto Anaya Jr. shared that sports spirit. Aamoth, 32, was an investment banker at Sandler O'Neill & Partners and a member of the Creek Club in Locust Valley, N.Y., where he played golf. In his hometown, Minneapolis, the Blake School is naming its new football field in his honor. He had been captain of the team.
Alvarez, a 23-year-old immigrant from Mexico, was a grill cook at Windows on the World. His pleasure was soccer and pickup basketball near his home in Jackson Heights, Queens.
Anaya was a 35-year-old firefighter and former Marine who had re-upped for the Persian Gulf war. Among his prized mementos was the hole he had punched in the basement ceiling of his Suffern, N.Y., home celebrating the Yankees' victory over the Mets in the 2000 World Series.
Reading the "Portraits of Grief" as they came out last year, I was struck by the frequency with which family and friends found sports as a way of describing, if not defining, the loved ones they had lost. Last week, rereading the vignettes, I was moved by the diversity of those whose lives were enhanced by the sporting spirit.
Here was Karen Martin, the head flight attendant on American Flight 11. She was 40. Friends remembered how she dipped lower than most water skiing, took steeper trails snow skiing, always hit off the men's golf tee.
Here was Cmdr. William Howard Donovan Jr., 37, considered "in the pipeline," a rising star. He had graduated from the Naval Academy and had flown in the gulf war. He was one of the jocks at the Pentagon, a stalwart of the lunchtime soccer league.
Here was Ira Zaslow, a 55-year-old financial analyst for Lehman Brothers who lived for the weekends and paddleball. His eldest son, Bryan, remembered he would get up at 6 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays and go anywhere to play. He never minded replaying a disputed shot because it meant playing more.
Then there was Kenny Marino, 40, of Rescue 1, a Mets and Seattle Mariners fan whose favorite ballplayer was Ken Griffey Jr. Katrina Marino sent an e-mail message to the Cincinnati Reds with a request for Griffey to hit a homer for her husband, who would be "looking down with a big grin." Junior went long on Sept. 25, and said it was his most memorable homer. Marino's Rescue 1 teammates thought it fitting that they led the mourners out of his memorial service to the organist playing "Take Me Out to the Ball Game."

Visitors Temper Revelry and Respect Security

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
They rolled onto Bourbon Street by the thousands Friday night with their numbered jerseys and football war paint, aware that they were expected to carouse, but lacking the slightest bit of tutoring in the act, hailing as they do from the sedate streets of Boston or St. Louis.
 They would hesitate as they beheld the spectacle before them, and their question was obvious: Do you mean that we're allowed to buy sweet hard liquor from this sidewalk bar, and walk with it in the middle of the street, and scream and sing and vomit, and encourage women to remove their clothes? All right, then. Where do we begin? 
 "I figured the city would be locked down," said Craig Brabham, a programmer from suburban Hazelwood, Mo., who had heard that the Super Bowl would be the most oppressively secure ever. "I mean, I always wanted to come to Bourbon Street, but I didn't even know whether it was going to be open tonight." 
Of course it was open, and beckoning, and eagerly accepting the game's auxiliary economic benefits in exchange for huge plastic cups of beer and Southern Comfort. The French Quarter, and most of downtown, was full of stretch limousines with out-of-town plates and tour buses disgorging wide-eyed men and women knitted together with Mardi Gras beads and an intense if disoriented desire to celebrate something. They hung off second-floor balconies, and line-danced, and bayed their city's primacy to the night sky and the ceaseless river.
But Brabham was at least correct in sensing that things would be different this year. Fulfilling orgiastic desires has always been the city's great industry, and it is no accident that it has been chosen by the National Football League to accommodate nine Super Bowls, the most of any city. Never before, however, has a sporting championship been declared a National Security Special Event, with widespread street closures and thousands of imported police officers under the supervision of the United States Secret Service.
Never before has the Mardi Gras season of parades and parties been temporarily halted in midstream, the result of the Super Bowl being postponed a week because of the Sept. 11 attacks. And not for decades have these annual celebrations been burdened by the guilt-inducing presence of an overseas war and a continuing threat of domestic terrorism. This year's revelry, then, has been notably more subdued than usual, less violent and uproarious, and distinguished by an unprecedented respect for authority, which has been out in unprecedented force.
"This is nothing," said one police sergeant standing on the corner of Bourbon and Conti Streets, who said he was technically not supposed to talk to reporters. "You tell people to move on, and they do it. They're not fighting. Even if they're drunk, it seems like they're trying to stay out of trouble this year."
Ernest Watson, known universally as Doc, has seen the crowds ebb and flow as the tenor saxophonist for the Olympia Brass Band, the oldest and most distinguished of the city's indigenous jazz ensembles. Generally, he said, he would much rather play to football crowds than Mardi Gras crowds, knowing that at least a few people will be sober enough to listen to the music. 
"I guess we'll have to get used to a different tone in the city, with all this security and all this worry," he said. "I've seen this kind of thing when we're on tour in Europe, and they still like good music and still have a good time. So I think New Orleans will come through this and it will stay true."
Each neighborhood of the city celebrated according to its means, which as always in New Orleans, tend toward the extremes. At the Hyatt Regency next to the Superdome, the N.F.L.'s headquarters hotel, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue held court as desperate fans searched the crowd for the faces of well-known players. 
Two miles to the east, in the impoverished Ninth Ward where no tourist or celebrity goes, residents prepared to cheer for their favorite son, Marshall Faulk, the Rams running back who grew up in the Desire Housing Project, one of the worst public housing complexes in America. The city has torn down most of the buildings, and what remains resembles a war zone: giant holes in the brick walls, shot-out windows, missing doors. But nearby residents say Faulk hasn't forgotten them.
"He donated the team uniforms over at Carver High, where he went to school," said Michael Moody, a mechanic who was planting campaign signs for today's mayoral primary. "He's helped out with the parks, and he even gave some Super Bowl tickets to some people I know over on Feliciana Street. So tomorrow everybody here is a Rams fan."
There were no limousines to be seen. But then a city bus rolled up Louisa Street and on its side was a big picture of Marshall Faulk. He was urging his native city to buckle up for safety.

HEADLINE: FORUM IN NEW YORK: OUTLOOK; 
Foreign Executives Reject American Optimism Toward Economic Recovery

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Foreign economists and executives are much less optimistic than their American counterparts about what is ahead for the United States economy.
 That divide showed up starkly and repeatedly in wall-to-wall conversations at the World Economic Forum, whose cast of more than 2,000 prominent people has been meeting since Thursday behind layers of security at the Waldorf-Astoria. While the Americans focus on the economy's strengths, particularly the persistent consumer spending, the foreigners dwell on dwindling profits, mounting debt and the constant shrinking of corporate operations. 
 "What we have is an ordinary recession made worse by bursted bubbles, and the shakeout will last longer than the Americans seem to realize," said Kenneth H. Clarke, a Conservative member of Britain's Parliament and a former chancellor of the exchequer. 
The disagreement is more than academic. Not only the United States, but Europe, most of Asia and much of Latin America are caught in the first worldwide recession since the 1970's. In panel sessions and interviews, virtually everyone agreed that only the United States has the economic heft to lift the others out of recession. 
But economists, executives and government officials from abroad said Americans were unrealistically optimistic about how soon this would happen.
"It is not going to happen this year," said Klaus F. Zimmermann, president of the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin. "A lot was invested in high-tech equipment for the new economy and that has to be used up before investment picks up and the American economy with it."
A turnaround is not yet visible in economic data. Corporate spending on offices, factories and equipment continued to fall in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department reported last Wednesday. This cutback caused the recession and now the question is when growth will resume. While American forecasters optimistically spy the resumption of corporate spending, the companies themselves continue to shed workers and facilities, prodded to do so because they find themselves capable of producing more than they can sell.
Excess capacity played a role in the decision of Kmart, the nation's third-largest discount retailer, for example, to file for bankruptcy late last month, in preparation for dozens of store closings and thousands of layoffs. 
Still, the persistent optimism is understandable, several of the visiting foreigners suggested. "It is the collective aspiration of what Americans want to have happen, particularly after Sept. 11, and maybe it will somehow be self-fulfilling," said Baba N. Kalyani, chairman of Bharat Forge Limited, an Indian manufacturer of truck parts, whose sales are down, particularly its exports to the United States. "But I do not think the rebound will come very soon."
Stock prices worry Guillermo Ortiz, governor of Mexico's central bank. "American investors have been holding up stock prices in expectation of rising profits," Mr. Ortiz said. "Who knows if that will materialize. If it does not, you could have a pretty negative market reaction in midyear."
Europeans are particularly outspoken. "A lot of Europeans view American optimism as part of the character of the country and not necessarily reasoned analysis," said Peter D. Sutherland, the Irish chairman of Goldman Sachs International and a former top executive at BP, the British conglomerate. 
If anything, the optimism among American forecasters has intensified in recent weeks. In expectation of an imminent upturn, they have focused on a growing number of economic indicators that show an improvement from the previous month -- if not in business investment, then in consumer spending and housing.
The latest spur to optimism came on Friday when the Labor Department announced that employers had eliminated 89,000 jobs in January, down from 130,000 in December, and the unemployment rate had fallen to 5.6 percent from 5.8 percent -- mainly because thousands of unemployed dropped out of the labor force and were no longer counted.
No one at the World Economic Forum spoke more exuberantly about the American economy than Gail D. Fosler, chief economist at the Conference Board, a New York research organization. "My role is to spread a little glee," she said at a packed session on the global economic outlook. "The recovery has already begun in the United States." 
Like other American forecasters, Ms. Fosler argues, in effect, that once all the data catch up with what is actually happening today, the upturn will turn out to have started about now, nearly a year after the recession began. Ms. Fosler appeared on the same panel with the more pessimistic Mr. Zimmermann of Berlin and also with Fan Gang, director of a Chinese economic research institute, who tactfully said nothing about the United States, but declared that China's now booming economy might be headed for contraction, joining the rest of the world.
He blamed the yen, in part. Its falling value hurts Chinese exports, by making them relatively more expensive than Japanese goods. The rising value of the dollar, against the yen and other currencies, should also make Americans uneasy, several foreign experts said.
For the moment, however, the strong dollar encourages foreigners to invest their savings in the United States, in effect lending to the ever more indebted Americans. But once the dollar begins to weaken a bit, many foreign experts argue, the economy will slow, because the lending flow will be cut back and the cost of borrowing in the United States will rise.
"We are more worried about this than you are," said Jacques Aigrain, chief executive of the Swiss Reinsurance Company, headquartered in Zurich. 
Only one American economist participating in the World Economic Forum -- Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley -- openly shared the pessimism of the non-Americans, and his pessimism stood out. Mr. Roach appeared on the panel with Ms. Fosler, and he aimed most of his comments at her optimism.
She put her faith in consumer spending, the still strong housing market and her expectation that rising profits would restart investment, particularly investment in high-tech electronics gear. 
Mr. Roach, in contrast, emphasized the downward pull of heavily indebted Americans and the frequent downsizing as companies closed factories and offices and laid off workers, to shed excess productive capacity. 
At least one foreigner offered Ms. Fosler some support. "Let's not underestimate all the stimulus that the Federal Reserve has provided with its rate cuts," said Rakan El-Hoshan, managing director of the Hoshan Company, which sells office equipment in Saudi Arabia. "If there is not a recovery in America soon with interest rates as low as they are, then there is something fundamentally wrong."

HEADLINE: Downtown, It's Location, Location and Luck 

BYLINE:  By JANNY SCOTT and SUSAN SAULNY 

 BODY:
It is the great question, still waiting to be answered:
 A hole is blown in the heart of downtown Manhattan. One hundred thousand workers and thousands of residents are abruptly displaced. Tourism founders, recession settles in. Which businesses survive? Which move away or close for good? And what takes root in their place? 
 Nearly five months after the attack on the World Trade Center, the thousands of businesses in Lower Manhattan are in countless disparate states of recovering, dying and being reborn -- some flourishing, some foundering, many struggling to maintain a foothold somewhere along the rocky slope in between. 
Their different fates can be traced to a complicated mix of factors, including the nature of each business and its customers and things like location, insurance coverage, access to emergency assistance, relationships with creditors and capacity for self-reinvention.
And blind luck.
Handbags are flying out of the Coach store at the South Street Seaport -- in part because the World Trade Center mall and its Coach store are gone. Another store, 14 Wall Street Jewelers, is doing fine -- especially now that all pedestrian traffic turning off Broadway is being funneled in front of its door.
At the Regent Wall Street hotel, where they were cooking with Bunsen burners immediately after Sept. 11, occupancy has been 10 to 15 percentage points higher than a year ago. But the president, Christopher Knable, claims little credit: until recently, every comparable downtown hotel was closed.
In the worst shape are some businesses nearest the trade center, conceived in some cases to serve a population of 50,000 that is no longer there. Trapped in the frozen zone around ground zero, they languish, their future uncertain, their customers scattered or dead.
Those in better health include companies with a customer base beyond Lower Manhattan; businesses that have benefited in unexpected (and sometimes discomfiting) ways, and enterprises that in at least a few cases have struck upon ingenious approaches to adapting to a post-9/11 world.
At AST Sound, a family-owned audio and video retailer in TriBeCa, sales plummeted in the weeks after the attack. Then a neighboring landlord offered the owner, Michael Kramer, three times his current space at two-thirds his current rent. So AST Sound is expanding; last week, it moved across the street.
Mr. Kramer has landed several emergency grants and loans. He was given new office furniture and free legal help negotiating his lease. He is expanding his corporate-contracting department to handle what he hopes will be increased demand for teleconferencing and videoconferencing, an alternative to business travel, when downtown Manhattan rebuilds.
But a dozen blocks south, Vivia Amalfitano has not been able to reopen the three restaurants that she co-owns. They have been mired in the frozen zone around the trade center site for 20 weeks. She says she has failed to qualify for much emergency help -- in one case, she said she was told, because she has not managed to reopen.

Loans Carry Risks
In desperation, she has begun looking for new space. She depends on the restaurants for income, as do her parents, uncle and brother, she said. She has not applied for a Small Business Administration loan because, she said, she cannot risk putting up her house as collateral without knowing the restaurants' fate.
Halfway between Ms. Amalfitano and Mr. Kramer, geographically and otherwise, sits Allison Luongo, the 26-year-old owner of Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, a 14-month-old candy store on Chambers Street that she says lost as much as $20,000 in business in the three weeks it was closed after Sept. 11.
Business was so slow for months that Ms. Luongo remembers going next door to the barbershop and saying: "I'm not getting a haircut today. So, unless you want chocolate, we should all just pack up and go home for the day." (They did.) Business improved in December. But, she said, "we're still really on the brink."
The fate of businesses like Ms. Luongo's, Ms. Amalfitano's and Mr. Kramer's will determine the future of downtown, many think. They say that unless restaurants, retailers and service providers recover, the bigger companies, residents and tourists who fled on Sept. 11 will not return.
But there is a conundrum: unless the big firms, the residents and the tourists return, the small businesses and cultural institutions will have no customers and will fail.
"Think of a new-growth forest," said Jerrold Nadler, the congressman who represents Lower Manhattan. "A forest fire burns down a lot of old trees. As long as a sufficient base is left, new trees will grow. But if you don't have a critical mass, you will have a major disaster area for a long time.
"If too many of the small businesses are gone in April, say, then it's going to be a wasteland. Other businesses will move or fail. People won't want to move back. The biggest single factor in whether Lower Manhattan again becomes the financial engine for New York or not is whether a critical mass of our small businesses survive."
In many ways, the signs of neighborhood recovery are encouraging.
Consolidated Edison, which lost two substations in the attack, has installed 36 miles of temporary cable. Taxis are available again and most telephones work. The Statue of Liberty has reopened, only one subway station remains closed, and large firms are coming back. Delis are no longer dealing with matters like how to dispose of 400 pounds of rotting chicken.

Layoffs Take a Toll
On the other hand, there will be no PATH service to Lower Manhattan before late next year. Buses have been rerouted and much downtown traffic is jammed. Some sidewalks are a maze of barriers and barricades. Firms have returned, but they are laying people off, or like Goldman Sachs & Company, they are relocating whole departments outside the city. And the drop in international business travel has cut the flow of downtown's biggest-spending visitors.
Two malls that played a key role in the renaissance of downtown in the late 1990's, in the World Trade Center and the World Financial Center, are gone or closed. Century 21, the discount shopping mecca, is not scheduled to open until late this month. And, all in all, there are tens of thousands fewer people in Lower Manhattan every day than there were before Sept. 11.
"It's depressing to be down here," said Mary Pisarkiewicz, managing director of Pisarkiewicz Mazur & Company, a marketing communications firm. "It's sad, it's very sad. Yes, I think the area will definitely come back. But I think it's going to be a long time."
The current conditions of downtown businesses vary widely. On individual blocks, it is possible to find some storefronts shuttered, other businesses thriving, others newly reopened. But patterns are apparent. And though it is not necessarily insurmountable, the problem of proximity to ground zero is, for many businesses, the biggest hurdle.
Steamers Landing, a 12-year-old Battery Park City restaurant damaged in the attack, has yet to reopen. Its windows were broken, its exhaust system ruined, its furniture taken. Rotting food exploded in the refrigerator. Jan Fried, a co-owner, said the cleanup could not even begin until mid-November because the chaos outside made it impossible to get permission to park a trash container. 
Physical damage is only part of the problem. Sale & Pepe Fine Foods, a gourmet deli just south of the trade center that relied heavily on corporate catering, reopened in early October. But its lunch business was decimated by the departure of a half-dozen large firms that Peter Semetis, an owner and a partner, counted as clients, like American Express and Lehman Brothers.
While the N and R trains were not running, Mr. Semetis says, his breakfast trade suffered badly; there were no rush-hour crowds being disgorged from the subway station outside the store. And, he said, the express buses from Brooklyn and Staten Island that used to deposit people at a bus stop outside the deli were temporarily rerouted to Water Street.

Customers Are Ghosts
"For ground zero businesses, there's nobody to serve," said Duane Anzalone, a co-owner of St. Charlie's Restaurant and Bar, in the frozen zone, whose prospects are uncertain. Opened six months after the trade center opened, it was umbilically tied to the towers. "We're talking about probably 100 percent of our clientele gone," Mr. Anzalone said, "How do you recover from that?"
The picture is less bleak for businesses with clients elsewhere. Dr. Jeffrey R. Shapiro, a dentist with an office two blocks southeast of ground zero, says only half of his patients live or work downtown. Although he said his office suffered $150,000 in damage to computers, instruments and furnishings, he expects business to be back to normal within months.
There are also big differences in the ability of different businesses to tap the programs offering emergency grants and loans. While some owners said they had received little or nothing, Mr. Semetis said he had successfully landed a $6,500 grant, a $10,000 grant, a $39,000 grant, a $100,000 loan at 1 percent interest and a $200,000 Small Business Administration loan.
He was accepted into an assistance program that is covering half his payroll for 10 employees for 13 weeks. He has received free legal help to deal with his insurance company. Vendors have extended him credit and he is now in a Salvation Army program under which he and other downtown restaurants are paid to feed workers at ground zero.
Ms. Amalfitano, however, says she was told she was ineligible for one such program because her three restaurants had not yet reopened. Two of them are marooned on Trinity Place, where trucks line up to enter the trade center site. For another program, she was told she could apply for only one grant, not three.
Then there is insurance. Anthony Hidalgo, the chief operating officer of Intercom Online, a company that provides Internet access to small and medium-sized businesses, says the firm lost more than $1 million in revenue because of the attacks. But when he submitted a claim for about $775,000 to his insurance company, he says, he was offered $10,000.
Some businesses have found success through some measure of self-reinvention. Jim Simpson, the artistic director of a small theater company, the Flea, says he watched his theaters drop to 95 percent empty, from 95 percent full before Sept. 11. Searching for a response to the disaster, he opened "The Guys," a play about a fire captain who lost eight men in the attack and an editor who helps him write their eulogies. The shows have been selling out.

Success and Sadness
Other businesses have benefited in unintended, even disconcerting, ways. One restaurant that used to compete with Windows on the World has been busy since mid-October. "Is it true that we get a lot of business because they are not here?" said the owner, who spoke on the condition that he not be named. "Yes. Do I like to talk about it? No. It makes me sad. I wish they were still here."
In the grim early weeks after the attack, when Dr. Shapiro was dusting off dental records of dead patients for their families to take to the morgue, few people downtown did not consider, at least fleetingly, bailing out. But the expense of broken leases and unaffordable Midtown rents made the price of leaving prohibitive for many.
Lehman Brothers is among the firms that have left. It is moving 6,000 people who had been in the World Financial Center and nearby to a Midtown building it bought within weeks of the attack. The firm believed that it could not wait the year or more it could take to repair the damage to its main building downtown, according to Bill Ahearn, a senior vice president.
Others say leaving would be unseemly. They consider themselves pioneers with an emotional stake in a neighborhood they feel they once helped to build. Some admit to being torn, like the head of one organization who said the staff thinks that moving back to its offices overlooking ground zero is the right thing to do, but almost no one wants to do it.
Insisting that neither he nor his organization be identified, he said he worried about the emotional toll on employees who "saw and felt and heard things that nobody should ever have to see and feel and hear." He said he worried about the health effects of working near ground zero, and the possibility that a neighborhood that he always thought had "lousy restaurants" would only "get lousier."
In the meantime, people wait: for their loan applications to be approved, for grant money to come through, for more federal money to flow, for their insurance money to arrive, for the rebuilding to begin, for permission to reopen, for the future to feel more certain, for their customers to come back.
"If anybody asks me specifically what I need, I don't think they really want to hear the answer," Mr. Anzalone of St. Charlie's said the other day. "I need the 50,000 to 100,000 people that are gone from that area back. And I know that nobody can give me that."

HEADLINE: Hard-Pressed Parents Fall Behind on Tuition 

BYLINE:  By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
The glossy brochure was mailed late last year to the parents of students at 1,500 colleges and private schools.
 "Are you worried about having enough money to pay for tuition?" asked the brochure, which was from a company that helps those institutions manage their billing. It went on to assure parents, "We can help you now, even in today's uncertain economy." 
 In the weeks since the pamphlet went out, thousands of families from across the country have called the company, Academic Management Services, to arrange extensions on tuition bills or, in some cases, to secure low-interest loans. In December alone, the company says it received 17,000 more requests for assistance than it did in the same month a year ago, an increase of nearly 25 percent. 
The company's phone logs provide fresh evidence of the extent to which the recession is squeezing middle- and even upper-class families. After paying their tuition bills like clockwork, many are having difficulty keeping up with their payments, mindful that if they fall too far behind their children could eventually be expelled.
"People are saying that they're being laid off, their stocks are down or gone, and they're looking for ways to pay the bill," said Gina Mercer, 31, a telephone counselor at Academic Management Services, who has been working six days a week, sometimes 10 hours a day, to keep up with the demand. "They anticipated having a certain way to pay for college, and now that's all changed."
It's not just the antennas at A.M.S., based in Swansea, Mass., that are picking up such static. Analysts at Moody's, the bond rating agency, say that the number of parents across the country requesting at least a year's postponement in repaying federally financed tuition loans has doubled in the last 12 months. Financial aid officers at Rice University in Houston, who fielded calls in recent weeks from at least 10 parents who lost their jobs because of the shaky economy, say they are bracing for calls from current or former employees of Enron, among other companies, in early spring, when next year's college aid will be calculated.
Such projections, university officials said, are already being considered as the university begins assembling its budget for next year.
"We'll see a lot of middle- and upper-income folks facing unemployment for the first time in years," said Julia Benz, the director of student financial services at Rice, where half the students are Texas residents.
For many of the families calling the colleges or A.M.S., the need for such help would have been unthinkable as recently as six months ago. One of the calls that Ms. Mercer, the telephone counselor, fielded recently was from Anne Chelius and her husband, Garrett, a Long Island couple whose combined annual income of nearly $250,000 had enabled them to put their first four children through college without borrowing a dime. 
But in the days after Sept. 11, that income vanished, jeopardizing the $12,300 due on the tuition for their fifth and youngest child, Geremy, who is a junior at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. 
Late last fall, Mrs. Chelius had to close her business, which was in Lower Manhattan and supplied temporary employees to many companies in the World Trade Center. At the same time, her husband, a consultant for J. P. Morgan Chase, also in Lower Manhattan, lost his job when the project on which he had been working was moved to Tampa, Fla.
"We were almost at the end," Mrs. Chelius said of the more than 10 years in which at least one, and sometimes two, of her children has been in college. "I can see the finish line. Now I feel like I can't make it to the finish line."
On Ms. Mercer's recommendation, Mrs. Chelius, 57, and her husband, 60, borrowed $10,000 from A.M.S. through a federal program available only to parents of college students, at an interest rate of less than 7 percent. But that has still left the couple $2,300 short, and they are considering using credit cards to make up the difference.
While A.M.S. has logged nearly 1,000 calls from families directly or indirectly affected by the events of Sept. 11, the company has detected problems throughout the economy.
Another recent caller to the company's help line was Rick Rector, who lives and works in Maine, and who publishes two weekly trade newspapers that serve the technology industry. Mr. Rector's daughter Amanda is a sophomore at Wellesley College, and like the Chelius family, he had arranged with A.M.S. last summer to break his tuition fees into 12 monthly payments, which the company would then pass on to the college, for an annual fee of $55. 
But by late fall, advertising at Mr. Rector's publications had dropped so precipitously -- by 50 percent compared with a year earlier -- that he feared falling behind in his $2,000 monthly payments. So he, too, took out a $10,000 loan.
"It was prudent," said Mr. Rector, who lives in Camden, 90 miles north of Portland. "But it's never pleasant to have to borrow money."
Those parents who have gone directly to their colleges for help have not always fared as well.
Bernie Pekala, the director of student financial strategies at Boston College, said he had heard from several parents recently who said they were worried that they were about to lose their jobs and needed some relief on their children's spring tuition, which was due last month. In such circumstances, Mr. Pekala said, there is little he can do, other than waiving the $100 late fee or perhaps setting up a payment schedule.
"If a family member thinks they will be laid off," he said, "we usually can't react to that."
But those who have called to say they have already lost their jobs -- and Mr. Pekala said that there have been several dozen this winter -- have often been surprised to learn that Mr. Pekala is willing to make a deal, whether in the form of a loan or additional scholarship aid.
Mr. Pekala, who sees his job as equal parts loan officer, insurance agent and psychologist, said that other colleges -- particularly those with less wealth -- often have stricter payment policies, and are sometimes quicker to expel such students. But Mr. Pekala said he will only do so as a last resort, or if he suspects a family is not being fully honest.
"Once they become part of our community, we want them to graduate," he said. "We're here to help them reach their goals."

HEADLINE: FORUM IN NEW YORK: PARTY; 
The Other Saturday Affair at the Waldorf

BYLINE:  By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
Call her the bride who would not budge -- not for presidents, prime ministers, mayors or celebrities. 
 Nope, said Elizabeth Friedland, a lawyer. Early in September, she scheduled the celebration of her wedding to Dr. Mark Meyer, a cardiologist, for last night at the Waldorf-Astoria. 
 Despite the fact that the hotel would turn into the barricaded, high-security site of the World Economic Forum, Ms. Friedland and Dr. Meyer persisted in their original plans.
They held fast to their plans partly because they invited almost as many people as did Klaus Schwab, founder of the gathering at the Waldorf.
"Well, not quite," Dr. Meyer said on Friday. "Our party is about 550 people. And there really aren't that many places in New York where you can have that many people."
But the World Economic Forum attendees and Ms. Friedland managed to reach a detente that would make any United Nations security adviser proud. 
To accommodate the wedding, after the global health seminar scheduled for last night in the Jade Room and the "Middle-East Outlook" conversation in the Astor Salon, conference guests went down to the New York Stock Exchange for a multicultural dining and dancing extravaganza, leaving the Waldorf empty for the wedding party, which arrived from Temple Emanu-El at Fifth Avenue and East 65th Street.
The bride and groom did not have to worry that curious conference attendees -- say, the boisterous delegation from Bulgaria -- would accidentally stumble in on them.
The conference visitors at the Stock Exchange dined at buffet tables featuring food from around the world, from ceviche to spaghetti, and danced to mariachi musicians (or enjoyed classical violin quartets), in an evening intended to symbolize global unity.
The wedding guests planned to feast on a Sylvia Weinstock wedding cake large enough to accommodate 500, decorated with edible white flowers that matched those in the bride's hair. 
Ms. Friedland, who has spent much of the last four years living in Europe, had been through a string of unsuccessful relationships. Dr. Meyer had been through a string of graduate schools -- Yale Law School and Yale Medical School -- as well as, he said, "my 9 millionth blind date." 
Their first date was electric, Ms. Friedland said. "It lasted until 4 in the morning," Dr. Meyer said. Courtship was swift. Two weeks later, Dr. Meyer surprised Ms. Friedland by flying to London, where she lived, for the weekend. 
The next six months, he said, were a blur of blossoming love, trans-Atlantic plane trips and stolen weekends. 
When Dr. Meyer started interviewing for positions in cardiology, he investigated jobs in New York. He found none but he moved here anyway. 
"It was so against my grain," he said. "I have always done everything by the book. Suddenly I looked at myself and thought, 'Who is this person who is going to Europe for the weekend? Who is this man who is going to live in New York without a position?' It was surreal."
They chose February for their wedding because, the bride said, "it was pretty much the only Saturday that was available that was not the middle of summer or conflicting with another person's wedding." 
The doctor, confessing to some surprise, said he had never thought he would get married after an engagement of only five months, and then "at some point we found out that there would be this other major commotion going on in the city."
Because most of the wedding's invited guests were from out of town and were unfamiliar with New York, Ms. Friedland said she was happy to show them the city at its most vibrant.
"They're going to look at this city and think, 'Wow, exciting.' " 
Ms. Friedland, who was speaking on a mobile phone from a car, could be heard speaking to a security guard. "Hi, I'm the bride for the wedding," she said. "Right, you remember me? I'm getting married here. I don't have to show ID again, do I? I do? O.K., hold on." 
Dr. Meyer added that the enormous guest list also kept them from moving the celebration. 
"The other options for that many people weren't available until 2003," Dr. Meyer said. Judging from the tone of his voice, there could have been a convention of cannibals at the Waldorf, for all he cared. "Elizabeth didn't want to live together before we got married, and I thought, 'I'm 32 and I can't wait any longer! We're doing it at the Waldorf.' "

Yonkers Is Designated Federal Empowerment Zone

BYLINE:  By Elsa Brenner 

 BODY:
The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development has designated Yonkers, along with six other communities in the nation, a Federal Empowerment Zone. The designation entitles a zone to receive regulatory relief and tax breaks designed to promote job growth. 
 Incentives include wage credits on federal income tax, bond financing for new construction, financing for equipment purchases, tax benefits on capital gains and tax deductions for environmental cleanups, among other things. 
 The announcement was made by Assistant Housing Secretary Roy Bernardi, Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor John D. Spencer of Yonkers.
The other new zones are in Pulaski County, Ark.; Fresno, Calif.; Jacksonville, Fla.; Oklahoma City; San Antonio, and Syracuse and Onondaga County, N.Y. Twenty-eight others are already in existence.
Applicants had to satisfy a selection process that weighed population and poverty criteria and the community's strategic plan. Elsa Brenner

HEADLINE: FORUM IN NEW YORK: PROTESTS; 
At Least 38 Are Arrested, but Rally Remains Peaceful

BYLINE:  By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
It turned out to be a beautiful day for protest yesterday, with a little something for everybody. Peaceful demonstrations, catchy slogans, colorful placards, plenty of police officers -- and even a few arrests.
 Yesterday was the ballyhooed day when thousands of anarchists, socialists and just plain-old regular folks came to New York to rally against the World Economic Forum, which has brought 2,700 government leaders and corporate executives to the Waldorf-Astoria for the express purpose of "improving the state of the world." Adding to the mix were thousands of police officers assigned to keep the peace, along with untold numbers of federal law enforcement officials and armed bodyguards. 
 By early evening, an estimated 7,000 protesters had engaged in a loud but peaceful rally within earshot of the Waldorf on Park Avenue, and then disbanded. By that point, police officials said, at least 38 people had been arrested, on charges of disorderly conduct, unlawful assembly and reckless endangerment, and three officers had been injured. 
"So far, so good," Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said last night, although he added that other challenges remained. Some 2,000 guests of the economic forum were to be bused under heavy guard last night for a dinner at the New York Stock Exchange in Lower Manhattan. In addition, two more protests are planned for today and another on Monday.
People intent on protesting had been trickling into the city for days, with a few joining some early demonstrations against the five-day forum, which convened on Thursday. But organizers have always maintained that yesterday would be the marquee day for peaceful protest, although they have not denied that outbreaks of unlawful behavior were possible, from civil disobedience to the kind of property destruction that has marred other protests against economic conferences.
Yesterday morning, as guests of the forum -- at least those who did not linger at any of the exclusive parties on Friday night -- arose to choose from a breakfast buffet of panel discussions, their critics began to assemble outside. So did hundreds of police officers; for every protester's placard, there seemed to be an officer's helmet.
Then, at 9:50, two young men were hauled away on charges that they had tried to block traffic by sitting on Park Avenue, across from the Waldorf. Although charges were dropped against one of the suspects, the incident seemed to serve as the starter's pistol for the day's events: Super Saturday had officially begun.
As the sun rose above the tall buildings along the East Side, a few hundred protesters limbered up in the barricadelike pens outside the Waldorf. Tambourines chimed, cowbells rang, chants started.
"Money for jobs!" shouted a man on the back of a black Ford pickup truck, his hoarse voice amplified by speakers. "Not for war!" responded the protesters -- at least those who had not taped their mouths shut as a silent gesture of dissent. Meanwhile, hundreds of police officers stood on street corners or sat in vans, sipping coffee, waiting. There was nothing leisurely about that wait, as evidenced by the phalanx of 17 officers on horseback, directly across Park Avenue from the Waldorf.
At the same time, on 59th Street along the southern rim of Central Park, hundreds of other demonstrators had gathered in two spots: on the West Side, near Columbus Circle, and at the corner of Fifth Avenue, across from the Plaza Hotel. Police officers on bicycles darted in and out of the crowd, while dozens of others stood in clusters, watching the back-and-forth flow of young people carrying sharply worded signs.
"We're joking that their tactic must be to push us off the sidewalk," said Jeff Bale, 30, of a group called Mobilization for Global Justice.
Why had the protesters come? Mary Libby, 25, who said she worked with the homeless in Michigan, explained that she was "trying to reclaim the streets and our lives." Everything is upside down, she said, when corporate executives hire Elton John to perform at a private party at the Four Seasons, an event that took place Friday night.
She objected to paying Elton John a substantial fee to perform for an hour or two "when that money could be used to feed the homeless right outside the building they're in." 
For a while, the scene felt more like a giddy political bazaar than the staging area for imminent ideological conflict. It was a minifestival of dissent, with colorful puppets and placards bobbing in the air, drums beating out a catchy beat and people handing out leaflets that decried capitalism in general and the forum in particular. Even some in the blue arc of police officers around the scene allowed a few smiles.
The intense preparation by the Police Department may have allowed for a relaxed smile or two from its ranks. As late as yesterday morning, police officials were meeting with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to go over last-minute details, and Commissioner Kelly was planning to monitor the scene in a helicopter.
From above, he might have seen general cooperation between those in blue and those who were not. At noon, Police Chief Allan H. Hoehl and other officials huddled with several lawyers for the rally; they looked like two sets of coaches wishing each other well before a game.
Ronald L. Kuby, one of the lawyers, later said that the two sides were ironing out minor details, like whether speakers could stand on the pedestal of a statue of Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman. They were allowed to stand on the first step. "We compromised," he said.
By 1:15 p.m., most of the protesters who had assembled at Columbus Circle had joined the others in front of the Plaza, and together they began a somewhat circuitous march toward the Waldorf, where hundreds of other demonstrators were continuing to chant and poke the sky with their placards.
Near the front of the parade were several women dressed as the Statue of Liberty, draped in silver and carrying papier-mache torches. At one point, people hoisted two of the women above the crowd, in classic cheerleader formation, bringing a chorus of approval. The women in silver also delighted the crowd by forming a chorus line and singing "New York, New York."
Along the parade route, protesters stopped to photograph officers standing guard outside a Starbucks cafe, and occasionally shouted out to the people on the sidewalk, "This is more fun than shopping."
And at East 51st Street and Lexington Avenue, the parade passed a small counterdemonstration, in which people waved signs that said, "The Police Are Great, It's Terrorists We Hate," and "Seek Therapy."
But the day had its share of tension, of clashes between protester and police officer. Three people were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct at Columbus Circle; four at 47th and Lexington; two others at 52nd and Broadway. 
The most dramatic moment, however, came at 1:30 p.m., when police officers waded into the tail end of the parade, at 59th Street and Fifth Avenue, and arrested 27 people on charges of unlawful assembly and disorderly conduct. Mr. Kelly said that the police had received information that this group -- which included people who he said were carrying plastic shields and masks -- "were about to attack the police."
Debra Sweet, a spokeswoman for an activist organization called Refuse and Resist, said last night that the circumstances of the arrests were unclear. But, she said, "from reports we have, the police seemed to be extracting particular people, especially people wearing masks."
After the arrests, a few lawyers and legal assistants stood alongside a large Department of Correction bus containing some of the arrested, and tried to get their names. One young woman mouthed her first name: "L-A-U-R-A."
Another young man in custody shouted, "I think it's imperative to report that we did not do anything illegal." Then the bus pulled away.
At Grand Central Terminal, a group of about 200 protesters entered the station just after 7 p.m. and were surrounded by dozens of uniformed police officers, many of them from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. A number wore white visored helmets and heavy vests, carried riot sticks, and had gas masks and plastic handcuffs strapped to their belts. Two police dogs appeared.
The protesters clapped, sang and beat on drums, and were then surrounded by the police. After a period of tension, the protesters sat down on the floor of the terminal, but neither side made a hostile move and the air of confrontation gradually dissipated. Eventually, the demonstrators wound up gathered in small groups in the terminal, chatting or eating, as the police stood and watched, chatting among themselves.

HEADLINE: Island's Future Requires A Regional Approach 

 BODY:
Long Island's business and social agenda has become a hot political issue in recent weeks. The Long Island Association's president, Matthew Crosson, has taken some heat for suggesting that the state should do more to address housing, transportation, education and other issues on Long Island "The Island's Economic Issues," opinion, Jan. 27 .
 While each of these complex issues needs to be addressed, the underlying issue for Long Island is to find a better marketplace for ideas, information and solutions. We need to invent a process that permits us to come together, review information, discuss ideas and reach agreements. Such an approach will lead to broader coalitions and effective advocacy on behalf of our region. 
 If our political leaders, business executives and nonprofit directors work together and use a regional lens, pragmatic solutions to the challenges of affordable housing, transportation and education can be found. These issues are not partisan matters.
What would we have to do to set a regional agenda? Probably the biggest obstruction is the fragmented governmental structure with its overlapping jurisdictions.
This cumbersome public framework impedes both a sense of community at a local level and a sense of region for the Island. Parochialism, greed, jealousy and nimbyism thrive under such conditions. Over the past 50 years, Long Island has paid a heavy price for having no plan or vision -- sprawling development, the loss of open space and farms, long and tiring commutes, and increased segregation by race and income with related educational disparities.
We need to be conscious of these constraints and proactive in our attempts to grow a regional identity. Models of regional development from other parts of the country demonstrate significant results and indicate the value of engaging in such a process.
In Silicon Valley, a suburban area with similarities to Long Island, foundations, business groups and community organizations worked together to set a regional agenda. In the past five years more than $20.2 million has been raised for affordable rental housing for 3,000 families and more than $190 million has been leveraged for additional housing development through loans to developers. Silicon Valley voters twice passed a transportation bond designating a 0.5 percent sales tax for mass transit projects. This program will operate until 2036 and is estimated to have generated $6.54 billion during its first five years alone.
We are not Silicon Valley, but its results suggest that an inclusive private, public and civic regional agenda could be worth exploring. Certainly, Long Island's business and social agenda is too important not to give it a try.

HEADLINE: Discounts And Ports Close to Home 

BYLINE:  By EDWIN McDOWELL; EDWIN McDOWELL reports on real estate and travel for The Times.

 BODY:
AFTER the events of Sept. 11, the cruise industry went into a slump so serious that over the next couple of months, occupancies on cruise ships seldom reached 50 percent, compared with an average of 90 percent over the last decade, according to James G. Godsman, president of the Cruise Lines International Association. 
 Many passengers on cruises in the months just after the disaster took their trips because they had booked well in advance, and risked forfeiting all or part of their payments if they didn't show up. Since then, as the industry has struggled to get back on its feet, a number of cruise lines have implemented more flexible cancellation policies, usually at additional cost. 
 Holland America's new policy, for example, will refund up to 90 percent of the fare to passengers who cancel for any reason at least 24 hours before the scheduled departure, for a fee of 5.2 percent of the fare at booking. 
Crystal Cruises also gives travelers the option to cancel for any reason, but only until three days before departure and then for a 90 percent credit (not cash) toward any cruise within the next 12 months. The policy costs $200 a person for cruises costing up to $8,000 (with air fare), or 3 percent of fares $8,000 and above. The policies are optional and are in addition to the usual cancellation policies. 
Passengers who booked a cruise after Sept. 11 generally did so because the cruise lines lowered fares as much as 50 percent, considered their broadest and steepest discounts ever -- more so even than during the Persian Gulf war in 1991. 
As during the gulf war, the cruise industry pulled its ships from the eastern Mediterranean, and rescheduled cruises closer to home for the remainder of last year and throughout 2002. But there are far more ships, and far bigger ones, now than a decade ago and that means there will be a big increase this year in itineraries in the Caribbean, Mexico, Alaska, the Panama Canal and other ports closer to the mainland United States. 
The questions the industry is agonizing over are how many passengers will book and whether they will book if the bargain fares disappear. 
For an industry that has already lost millions of dollars because of no-shows and rock bottom fares, the questions are hardly rhetorical. During the fourth quarter of last year, the Carnival Corporation's profits dropped 40 percent from those of the same period the year before, a drop that it attributed largely to cheap fares.
The bargains included Caribbean cruises as low as $50 a night a person, Panama Canal cruises at 50 percent off for the second passenger in a cabin, and even two-for-the-price-of-one Asian and South American cruises. 
The six-day trans-Atlantic crossing early this month of Cunard's Queen Elizabeth 2 from New York to Southampton, England, the first cruise from New York since Sept. 11, included a one-way upgrade from economy or business-class air to the British Airways' Concorde for an additional $1,995, rather than the regular one-way price of about $6,000. 
With such bargains and promises of heightened security, bookings have slowly increased. Also helping are the decisions to schedule trips close to American shores and to add more departure ports within driving distance of other than the usual Florida and California ports.
Holland America says that 360 of its 450 sailings this year will be from 15 ports that are within a half-day's drive of 40 percent of North American households. And a number of cruise lines are providing bus transportation: Royal Caribbean and its sister cruise line, Celebrity, offer passengers bus service to ports in Florida, California and Texas from a total of more than 50 cities. 
This approach is not a ground-breaking one. In recent years many other cruise lines, Carnival perhaps chief among them, experimented with cruises from such cities as Savannah, Virginia Beach, Baltimore, New Orleans, Galveston, Houston and Seattle. 
But the expansion of this experiment isn't likely to overcome the losses caused by fear of flying. Cruise lines are the nation's biggest private-sector buyer of air fares, accounting for four million tickets annually, according to Michael Crye, the president of the 17-member International Council of Cruise Lines. The additional passengers traveling by bus or car probably cannot make up the deficit. 
A Lazard analysis of Carnival's recent performance, published in December, noted that during the fourth quarter of 2001, 17.6 percent of Carnival Cruises passengers flew to their ports of departure compared with 23.7 percent the same quarter the previous year. This drop cost Carnival $16 million in revenue.
For the embattled cruise industry, getting passengers on board is the most important consideration. And getting nonfliers on board means getting ships to ports near them. That is why there are so many cruises this year from ports that have been lucky to have more than a couple of cruises a year.
Holland America, for example, which began operating from Tampa, Fla., in 1982, and last month boarded its one millionth passenger there, has 19 departures scheduled from Tampa this year, compared with 8 in 2001. Celebrity Cruises is offering 19 10- and 11-day cruises to the Caribbean from Baltimore, compared with 7 last year.
Norwegian Cruise Line is offering seven-day round-trip cruises from seven ports in the United States -- including Seattle, Boston and New York -- and from Vancouver, British Columbia. Royal Caribbean and Holland America are planning weekend cruises from Seattle to Victoria and Vancouver, British Columbia. 
Carnival's Holiday will operate eight cruises from Mobile, Ala., next month, five to the western Caribbean and three to nowhere. On April 27, it will begin year-round Caribbean cruises from New Orleans. 
And Royal Caribbean will offer dozens of cruises to the western Caribbean from Galveston, on the Rhapsody of the Seas beginning in April, and from New Orleans, on the Grandeur of the Seas beginning in October.
The discounts the last four months provided a helpful lifeline to an industry that until Sept. 11 had little reason to think the good times would ever end. The cruise lines had ordered dozens of new ships in anticipation of ever-growing passenger loads, and this year 13 of them, as well as two refurbished vessels, are scheduled to join the North American cruise market. The Cruise Lines International Association said the addition of 15 ships would be the most at one time in the association's 26 years.
Even if some are postponed or delayed, as expected, the ships likely to go into service will add thousands of new berths. That in turn will exert additional pressure on prices, despite the exodus of Renaissance Cruises and American Classic Voyages, both of which halted operations after the terrorist attacks and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Renaissance on Sept. 15, and American Classic on Oct. 19. 
The drop in bookings also took its toll on two small luxury ships, Radisson Seven Seas' Song of Flower and Silverseas' Silver Wind. Both were taken out of service for all or most of this year, leaving Radisson with five ships for now, and Silverseas with three. 
Another sign of hard times was the proposed merger in November by Royal Caribbean Cruises, the second largest cruise line (after Carnival), and P&O Princess Cruises, the third largest. Both companies conceded that the proposal was partly an effort to reduce costs, with potential savings of $100 million or more a year, beginning 12 months after the merger. 
But last month, Carnival made a $6.4 billion offer for Princess, well above Royal Caribbean's $2.9 billion offer. Princess rejected it, and a court battle may ensue, but regardless of which suitor wins Princess, analysts say that there are likely to be additional mergers, although not on that scale.
With a recession, new ships and passenger expectations of continued bargains, it is anybody's guess what the rest of this year holds for the industry. But Andrew Stuart, the executive vice president of Norwegian Cruise Line, said he was heartened by how quickly occupancy increased in so short a time, exceeding the expectations of most people. 
For example, the new Norwegian Star -- which began weekly cruises on Dec. 16 from Honolulu to the other Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati in the Fanning Islands -- is already sold out through March. What's more, many of the passengers on recent cruises and those booked on the cruises in February and March are from New York and the Midwest, meaning that they are willing to fly. "What we're seeing so far has taken us by complete surprise," Mr. Stuart said.
Felicia Kantor, the leisure analyst at Lehman Brothers, said there would still be bargains around, although not like those available late last year.
"Those were important to stimulate demand, to get people back on ships and show that it was safe and still fun," Ms. Kantor said. "And now that people don't seem to be as fearful, and are starting to think about vacations, demand will probably pick up."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Feb. 3 about trends in the cruise industry misstated the period for which the Song of the Flower, a Radisson Seven Seas ship, would be out of service. Radisson expects it to resume cruises in April or May -- not at the end of this year or later.

 BODY:
1. Definitions of simplicity change with time. Somehow, for some people, the simple balloons of one's childhood become one perfect diamond in adulthood. "All I care about is diamonds and a sunburn," a socialite in 1920's Newport once remarked on the way to her "cottage," which was anything but simple, unless you think a French-style chateau on a cliff overlooking the Atlantic Ocean qualifies. The latest in "simple" diamonds? The new "Lucida" from Tiffany & Company, a square mixed cut with a high crown intended to reveal the stone's inner sparkle. 
 Not everyone is so glib about simplicity, however. The folks in the Pacific Northwest went so far as to formalize a sentiment that dates back to Buddha. Voluntary Simplicity advocates slowing down, chilling out, buying less. There are newsletters, support groups and conferences. In 1994, the Trends Research Institute of Rhinebeck, N.Y., chose Voluntary Simplicity as a top trend of the 90's. (The next year, the institute, sensing a switch in economic fortunes, listed Involuntary Simplicity.) Read Duane Elgin's "Voluntary Simplicity," reissued in 1993 by Quill/William Morrow & Company. 

2. What do kids think are some of the most "simply marvelous things" in fashion? A) Barbie T-shirt, $13, and jean skirt, $20, from Kids "R" Us. B) D & G's red sneakers with gold and rhinestones, $130. At Z Baby, 996 Lexington Avenue. C) The "heart" headband, $4, from Kids "R" Us. D) Graffiti DKNY dress, $50 (very Stephen Sprouse). At dkny.com. E) Oilily's "Poodle" bag, $52. At Oilily stores.

HEADLINE: 'Enron Professor of Economics' Has a New Ring Now 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
Before they oversaw America's biggest corporate collapse, Arthur Andersen, Enron and even Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's former chief executive, opened their wallets for academia. All three have endowed professorships -- Andersen alone has 40 to 50, mostly at its workers' alma maters, like the University of Southern California and Texas A&M. The financing of some of them is now in doubt. Even those academics whose positions are secure have found that the names now have a taint.
 Mark E. Wohar, the Enron professor of economics at the University of Nebraska in Omaha (where one company now part of Enron was based), said he was trying to find out whether the financing for his position was still there. 
 Professor Wohar said he had been subjected to "a little bit of ribbing," and had stopped using the Enron name when identifying himself.
The situation is worse at Rice University, in Enron's hometown of Houston. In June 2000, amid much fanfare, Rice signed an agreement to develop communications technology with Enron's broadband services unit. As part of a $5 million gift intended to seal the deal, Enron endowed two chairs, in e-commerce and risk management.
"As often is the case with a large pledge like that, it was going to be paid in installments," said Terry Shepard, Rice's vice president for public affairs. Officials at the university began to worry about those installments when Enron started spiraling downward.
"We intentionally kept quiet over here and didn't start asking about it or anything," Mr. Shepard said. But on Jan. 7, Enron sent a letter saying payments would be suspended.
No one has been named to the chairs. "It's our practice to wait until we get the full amount, then fund the chair, then search for the faculty member," Mr. Shepard said. Rice and Enron are discussing other uses for the money donated, he said.
Across town, at the University of Houston, the two Kenneth L. Lay professorships are on safer ground. The money for the chairs, one as yet unfilled but supposed to be in economics, came from donations in 1994 and 1995 by Mr. Lay's friends and family. But the name now carries baggage for the filled chair.
"When I came down here, this was a huge honor, because a year or so ago Mr. Lay was the No. 1 guy in Houston," said Keith T. Poole, who left Carnegie-Mellon University to take the Lay professorship in political science at Houston. "I could impress people just by telling them, 'I'm the Kenneth L. Lay professor at the University of Houston,' " he said, "but now his name is mud."
After Mr. Lay's wife, Linda, said on television that the couple had "lost everything," a friend, as a joke, sent Professor Poole an e-mail message asking, "Has Ken asked for his money back?"
Mr. Lay's donations went elsewhere. His foundation endowed a professorship in international economics at his alma mater, the University of Missouri at Columbia, in 1999. Kenneth R. Troske, the professor leading the search committee, said the name had not yet become an issue in recruiting. But even if Mr. Lay were ever convicted of a crime, for instance, the university would not be able to change the name by itself. "He would have to agree to any changes that would be made with the chair," Professor Troske said.
A name change could also become an issue for dozens of other universities if Andersen followed Enron into bankruptcy. The professorships bearing the accounting firm's name around the world are mostly in accounting, Howard S. Engle, chairman of the Andersen Foundation, said.
Florida State University has two, one as yet unfilled. "In my vision, if Andersen does go down, they'll be absorbed by someone else," said Bud Fennema, chairman of the accounting department. A name change might thus be automatic. Professor Fennema predicted that the new name would be "the PriceWaterhouseCoopersAndersen chair," or something similar. But, Professor Fennema said, "I'm an alumnus of Arthur Andersen. I would push to keep the name the same."
Partners and employees of Andersen are raising money for the newest Andersen professorship, at the University of Texas, Mr. Engle said. The company will provide a significant part of the endowment by matching its workers' donations -- that is, if the company is still around.
Because Andersen has already given all the money that is needed to Florida State, stigma and name changes are the worst of the potential problems. William Hillison, who holds one of the Andersen professorships in accounting there, said he didn't mind a little teasing from his friends. "There's got to be a little light side," he said. "I'm sure it's pretty heavy down at the company."
But Professor Poole said the potential loss of Enron's philanthropic presence was sad. "Enron put up a lot of money locally for all groups across the spectrum," he said. "The perspective from inside Houston is just shock."
Despite the teasing, he was glad to hold the Lay professorship. "It's a very nice chair, by the way."

Amtrak: Nothing Like It in the World, So Far

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA 

 BODY:
AMTRAK'S new Acela trains can dash from New York to Washington at a top speed of 150 miles an hour. Sleek and shiny, they represent the pinnacle of American passenger rail, Amtrak's defiant response to critics who say the government wasted $25 billion over the last 30 years preserving a national railroad.
 But does the Acela really show how far railroads have advanced in 30 years, or how little things have changed? When Amtrak was formed in 1971, it inherited the Metroliner, which could go 160 m.p.h. but did so only in tests, because tracks were too far gone. Three decades later, track conditions are still so poor that Acela rarely runs at its own top speed, let alone that of its predecessor. 
 Amtrak's critics, and there are many, say this is no way to run a railroad. Amtrak is a railroad created by committee, a Congressional committee, and it shows. Its mission has always been contradictory -- offer national rail service, and at the same time make money. 
"Amtrak was asked to do too many things," said Thomas A. Till, chairman of the Amtrak Reform Council, which oversees Amtrak's finances. 
Amtrak was given a monopoly over intercity rail service. But because it was underfinanced, it didn't create much of a market for new technology, so private industry largely stopped developing it. Performance declined, and passengers stayed away in droves. 
After Sept. 11, the railroad, rickety though it was, suddenly seemed to be essential to national security and an important part of an integrated national transportation system. The problem was that everybody, including Amtrak, agreed that Amtrak didn't work. 
Now, as in 1971, Congress is debating Amtrak's fate, and questions about the role of rail are on track once more. But the framework has changed. The key issue used to be how much a government should get involved in running a railroad. Now it is how far the government can stay away. 
In evaluating the issue, transportation experts are looking at recent successful efforts in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Japan to offer private companies concessions to run trains. 
They also are mindful of Britain, where, in a privatization frenzy in the mid-90's, the Conservative government allowed more than a dozen private companies to run passenger trains, as well as tracks, stations and bridges, with results just short of disastrous.
Aggressive private operating companies have lowered fares and offered special promotions that helped increase ridership to its highest level since 1947. But on-time performance declined severely, and after several deadly wrecks, fingers are pointing at Railtrack, the company that owns the rails. The tracks and bridges it took over were in worse shape than anyone knew, and Railtrack didn't benefit from the ridership growth because of the wording of the privatization contract. 
"The British experience shows that yes, there is a role for private carriers in passenger rail," said Anthony Perl, a visiting scholar at the City University of New York's Institute for Urban Systems and author of "New Departures" (University Press of Kentucky), about passenger rail policy. "But it has to be connected to a public role in providing infrastructure." 
Of course, such support is not entirely new. Railroads were among the first real symbols of American capitalist might, helping forge a vast nation. But much of that track could not have been laid without government help, especially western land grants. 
"That help was pretty much a one-shot deal," said Professor Perl -- unlike the government's continuing involvement in aviation and highways. 
For decades at the beginning of the 20th century, the railroads thrived without government support, and the passenger rail system became a world leader. But when it was time to reinvest after World War II, there were a series of government decisions to support other transportation modes. The government provided huge (and continuing) subsidies for the construction of airports, traffic control systems and the 41,000-mile interstate highway system. 
It was the bankruptcy of the Penn Central Railroad in 1970 -- the largest corporate collapse of its time, as shocking then as Enron's collapse is today -- that moved Congress to act. The freight lines, eager to wash their hands of passenger service, encouraged Congress to create Amtrak, although few people in Washington or elsewhere believed it could survive for long. 
TODAY, Amtrak carries 23 million passengers a year, a tiny fraction of those who travel by air or on the highways. In 2001, it lost $1.1 billion, making self-sufficiency by the end of 2002 -- a goal set by Congress in 1997 -- unachievable. Even Amtrak conceded that, on Friday, when it asked for $1.2 billion in next year's budget, and threatened to cut hallowed long-haul lines, like the Empire Builder, if it did not get the money.
After Sept. 11, Congress quickly intervened in aviation, setting aside $15 billion for the airlines and airports. Amtrak asked for $3.2 billion, but Congress refused to provide more than $105 million, mostly for security upgrades in century-old New York-area tunnels. 
Perhaps Congress turned a blind eye because of Amtrak's small share of passengers or because Amtrak's reputation for misspending runs too deep. But whatever the reason, the days of Congress just appropriating more money for Amtrak may be finished -- as may Amtrak itself. 
The reform council must submit a restructuring plan to Congress by Thursday. The council thinks it may be possible to allow private companies to bid on concessions to run some lines, an idea opposed by organized labor. 
The council already has made clear that, just as airports and air traffic control systems are paid for by government agencies, so too should tracks, stations and bridges be owned by government agencies. So just as the airlines are free to concentrate on carrying passengers, operating companies could make the trains run on time. 
"People are going to look back at the 1990's and see that the United States got to the point where it thought government should take a back seat in every part of economic life," said Professor Perl. "But from the point of view of transportation, it's clear that the government shouldn't be that far in the back seat."

Finding Gems of Genius Among Enron's Crumbs

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
ENRON gave off flashes of brilliance even as its financial wizardry and creative accounting spun the company out of control. These flashes could merely have been bubbles bursting, or they might have been something far greater -- glimpses of the future.
 Historically, innovative ideas are incorporated into the economic system only through a painful shakedown process. Often, these new ideas have signaled a sea change in the economic order of things, but the system often readjusted only after a brutal upheaval. 
 It's a familiar pattern. First, a profitable, socially beneficial idea appears. At the start, a few lucky people make a lot of money using the idea. Others rush in for a share of the spoils. Pretty soon, too many people with only a crude understanding of what the idea is about seek to exploit it. Then the hype becomes more important than the idea itself, until the inevitable reality-check causes this bubble to burst. Afterward, the markets are stunned -- but only for a while. The idea is incorporated, in its most useful form, into the business and financial world.
That, said Charles R. Morris, the author of "Money, Greed, and Risk: Why Financial Crises and Crashes Happen," is what could ultimately happen in Enron's case. "The business model is not a bad business model," Mr. Morris said. "The whole idea of trading energy contracts and having free markets is a really sound one."
Enron's fall could one day be viewed as one of the many fits and starts by which the modern economy has developed. In fact, much of the economy's evolution has come through revolutions, whether in technology for transportation or communications or methods of trading and financing. In the economy, where these revolutions often take the form of bubbles and panics, they have something of the two-steps-forward, one-step-back dynamic, Mr. Morris explained.
In fact, bubbles and panics have dogged -- or benefited -- the American economy virtually since its inception. Often, the exposure of a single company's problems has led to the questioning of entire industries and markets.
Yet these are not automatically good parallels for Enron. When actions by officials of the Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company and the Mercantile National Bank set off panics in 1857 and 1907, respectively, the questions that followed were more about lawbreaking and corporate connections than about whether the innovation itself was valuable.
One example of hysteria driven by innovation was the railroad speculation of the 1830's in Britain and the United States. It began when the building of a few profitable routes led to scores of companies constructing rail links in all directions.
"The first ones exploited the best, most lucrative lines," said Peter M. Garber, an economic historian who now works as a global strategist for Deutsche Bank. "They kept getting flung farther out until the traffic just didn't justify the building, and then there's a bust." The promise of many investments went unfulfilled, but more than a century later, the tracks and trains and passengers remain.
Enron was not a case of over-building, however. Its innovation was in the way it did business rather than its product. The company synthesized existing ideas from the Texas oil business, Wall Street and Silicon Valley to create an online exchange where financial bets, not assets, backed energy trades. In that way, the Enron case parallels more recent "big ideas," like leveraged buy-outs, financial derivatives and hedge funds.
Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund that imploded in 1998, may come the closest to a historical parallel. "L.T.C.M. was 100 percent a trading model that people thought was a superior one," Mr. Garber said. The company went around "collecting nickels," in the form of small inefficiencies in financial markets, until eventually "those nickels got harder and harder to come by." Finally the hedge fund lost one big bet, and crashed. But unlike Enron, L.T.C.M. wasn't taking extraordinary measures to hide what it was doing.
In Enron's early years, Mr. Morris said, its online trading platforms for energy and natural gas found deserved success. "You had a nice, middle-sized innovative business." In cases like this, he said, "the first guys make money, and they really earn it because they make social value."
Soon enough, Mr. Morris continued, Enron got carried away with its own "brand-new magic." But Enron's original contribution could well remain. Indeed, a slew of companies that mimicked Enron quickly picked up the bankrupt company's business, and even some of its employees.
David M. Dilts, director of the Management of Technology program at Vanderbilt University, saw another parallel. "It's basically the gold rush. Everybody rushes to the gold, and they'll figure out how to make money later."
Once the shake-out occurs, Professor Dilts said, there may be far fewer companies, growing at a slower pace, though the business may in fact be a sound one. He cited the auto industry, where a group of about 300 producers shrank to just a handful in the first half of the 20th century. He also brought up the payment-clearing industries for credit card charges and hospital payments, which each have only two or three major players.
But will Enron's model endure? Paul M. Romer, a professor at Stanford who studies the effects of scientific and technological changes on the economy's growth, is not so sure.
"It's hard to tell if there's something real here or not," he said. With Enron's mystique dispelled, new companies may have trouble seeing the potential profits in applying the business model, even among a small number of competitors. 
Professor Romer recalled a sign that warns people crossing tracks in French railway stations: "One train may hide another." Rather than becoming a new economic model, Enron's business may only have been the result of some very special times. That was not so true during the California gold rush, the railroad bubbles, the stock frenzy of the 1920's or even the financial experiments of the past two decades.
If those special times change, so could Enron's usefulness. For example, a decision to re-regulate the energy markets could stifle the entire online trading business. Or changes in current accounting standards and securities regulation could relegate Enron's exotic financing vehicles to the past.
So, for the moment, Enron's legacy remains in doubt. And whether its business model offers a glimpse of one possible future could remain uncertain for some years to come.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: ASIAN MILITANTS; 
School in Indonesia Urges 'Personal Jihad' In Steps of bin Laden

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: SOLO, Indonesia, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
Among the nearly 2,000 students crammed into Al Mukmin boarding school, Osama bin Laden is a hero. His photo, in full color and poster size, is plastered on the walls of the dormitories much as rock stars decorate teenagers' bedrooms in America. His face peers out from the inside of locker doors and appears on T-shirts worn under the preppy blazers of senior prefects.
 The lionization comes from the top: the principal, a fiery preacher, Abu Bakar Baasyir, champions Mr. bin Laden and exhorts Muslims to follow his example. More important, say American and Asian officials, he has recruited operatives for Al Qaeda in Southeast Asia. According to the government of Singapore he is the leader of Jemaah Islamiah, or the Islamic Group, which officials say is a terrorist organization with cells throughout the region. 
 Mr. Baasyir, 64, a vision in white with his Muslim cap, long gown, scarf, toothy smile and snowy beard, denies any involvement in terrorist activities. But under questioning by the Indonesian police last week, he acknowledged that he had taught 13 of the people arrested in Malaysia and Singapore in connection with a plot to blow up the American Embassy in Singapore. 
In an interview at the school, Mr. Baasyir declared that the United States was "the terrorist nation." It was not Mr. bin Laden who masterminded the Sept. 11 attacks. Americans organized the attacks on the World Trade Center, probably with the help of Israel, he said.
"I rejoiced because it seemed Allah punished the United States for its arrogant behavior," he said of his reaction to the attacks.
Some of the preacher's statements appear to be more emphatic expressions of popular ideas in the mainstream news media here.
There are plenty of people in Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim nation, who say they feel more sympathy toward Mr. bin Laden and his cause than toward the United States. It is not unusual to hear that Jews were responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks. Many agree with Mr. Baasyir, including those who wrote an editorial this week in the newsmagazine Tempo, that the United States should produce any evidence against Mr. bin Laden in an international court.
Still, given Indonesia's history, it is striking that a boarding school -- one of the thousands that specialize in Islamic curricula and are known as pesantren -- would breed such a politicized interpretation of Islam.
For hundreds of years, Indonesia has prided itself on a system of religious schools where students, mostly from poor backgrounds, learned a laissez-faire form of Islam and acquired a sense of self-sufficiency and initiative. Though somewhat feudal in nature because they tended to be closed societies led by a charismatic preacher, the pesantren were regarded as the incubators of democracy, institutions that tried to instill justice and moral values. During the authoritarian era of General Suharto, the schools were thought to be crucibles of tolerance set against an unyielding secular state.
In contrast, Mr. Baasyir founded Al Mukmin in 1972 as a standard-bearer for an Islamic state, a place where the curriculum emphasizes carrying out a "personal jihad" to defend Islam.
The school is largely a collection of shabby one-story classrooms and offices. The one exception to the general air of decay is a new three-story dormitory financed by friends of the school in Saudi Arabia.
One man arrested in the Philippines, Fathur Rohman al-Ghozi, who was arrested on suspicion of being a crucial figure in the plot by Al Qaeda to blow up the American Embassy in Singapore, spent four years studying at Al Mukmin.
During a visit to the campus, it was easy to see how young boys, some as young as 5, could become foot soldiers in an anti-American campaign organized in the name of Islam.
"Jihad is the way of Allah," said Dwi Purwanto, 19, one of the boys sporting the image of Mr. bin Laden across his chest. "We will attack the enemy who attacks Muslims." 
With barely any exception, boys from junior high school to the final year seniors, said their goal in life was to ensure that Islam was applied "correctly." On further probing this meant that Indonesia should become an Islamic state, and that "anti-Islamic forces" -- usually described as the United States -- must be destroyed. They were proud of their alumnus, Mr. Ghozi, saying he had glorified Islam.
The students are awakened at 3:30 for first morning prayers, followed by study groups on particular topics of the Koran. Sixty percent of the curriculum is devoted to the study of Islam: how to read the Koran; the speeches of the Prophet Muhammad; and the interpretation of Islamic law. "We try to emphasize Islamic law," said Sarid Maruf, the director of the school. 
Arabic is a compulsory subject, and is another opportunity for teaching Islam. Nurul Hidayap, a young Arabic teacher, showed the day's lesson: questions and answers about the Prophet Muhammad's life that had to be written down in Arabic script. Question: When did Muhammad set aside the most time for contemplation? Answer: When he was 46.
With lights out at 10 p.m., the boys get little sleep. There is no television, no radio. The students are allowed out of the school one Friday a month from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. Life is spartan.
In one cluster of buildings, the school caters to girls; some had hidden makeup in their dorms, and many seemed to have more varied professional aspirations than the boys. For the most part, boys said they wanted to go back to their villages and preach, or further their Islamic studies. Several girls said they wanted to become doctors, social workers or psychiatrists. 
Mr. Baasyir founded Al Mukmin after graduating from Gontor, a distinguished religious school in East Java, sometimes referred to in Indonesia as the Harvard of pesantren. His aim, he said, was to create a different kind of religious school, one that produced students who "if and when they become leaders of the nation they would abide by Islam." 
His fealty to the idea of Indonesia as an Islamic state brought him into open hostility with Mr. Suharto. Mr. Baasyir was jailed and subsequently fled to Malaysia, where he said he had founded another pesantren, Lukmanal Halium. "I was received warmly in Malaysia, especially by the youth," he said. In Malaysia, he read all of Mr. bin Laden's books, he said. "He published various books about why he's against the United States," Mr. Baasyir said. "I absorbed that into my preaching." 
The Singapore authorities contended that Mr. Baasyir was involved in more than that. They said he was a central figure in setting up the network in the region.
On his return to Indonesia in 2000, Mr. Baasyir took up the cause of an Islamic state again, addressing a gathering at the stadium in Solo on the theme of women not being suitable to serve as president. (The current leader, President Megawati Sukarnoputri, became the first female president of Indonesia six months ago.)
In some ways, the fact that Al Mukmin operates in Solo, a commercial city known as a bastion of conservative Islam, is not surprising. According to one count, more than 70 Islamic organizations exist here, many of them new and radical. Among them is the Solo Islamic Youth Front whose militia accompanied Mr. Baasyir to his police questioning. Others include Laskar Jundullah (Army of God) and Laskar Hizbullah (Army of the Party of God).
Are members of the major Muslim organizations in Indonesia worried about Mr. Baasyir, his school, and the surge in radical Islamic groups here? Yes and no.
Dahlan Rais, the regional leader of Muhammadiyah, one of the two largest national Muslim groups, put it this way: "To some Muslims, Baasyir is a symbol of truth and courage. In the current circumstances, people are alienated from their surroundings, economically and socially. It doesn't take much to incite the masses."

HEADLINE: ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE OVERVIEW; 
ENRON PANEL FINDS INFLATED PROFITS AND SELF-DEALING

BYLINE:  By KURT EICHENWALD 

 BODY:
A report from a special committee of the Enron Corporation's board concluded yesterday that executives intentionally manipulated the company's profits, inflating them by almost $1 billion in the year before Enron's collapse through byzantine dealings with a group of partnerships.
 The 217-page report describes an across-the-board failure of controls and ethics at almost every level of Enron, the Houston energy company. It was issued just before scheduled testimony in Congress by Enron's top executives, and during criminal and regulatory investigations into what has emerged as one of the landmark scandals of American business. 
 As oversight broke down at Enron, the report says, a culture emerged of self-dealing and self-enrichment at the expense of the energy company's shareholders. The report is also harshly critical of Enron's accountants at Arthur Andersen and the company's lawyers, saying they signed off on flawed and improper decisions every step of the way. 
The transactions, which resulted in the collapse of the company, were caused by "a flawed idea, self-enrichment by employees, inadequately designed controls, poor implementation, inattentive oversight, simple (and not so simple) accounting mistakes, and overreaching in a culture that appears to have encouraged pushing the limits," the report says. "Our review indicates many of those consequences could and should have been avoided."
What emerged at Enron, as described in the report, was a culture of deception, where every effort was made to manipulate the rules and disguise the truth as part of an effort by executives to falsely pump up earnings and earn millions of dollars for themselves in the process.
When ownership of a particular partnership stake would have set off legal requirements, the holdings were put in the name of a domestic partner of one executive; in another instance, suggestions were made for stakes to be owned in the name of one executive's wife. Money was siphoned back and forth between multiple entities, disguising its true ownership and in turn providing false information about the financial state of Enron.
At bottom, the report makes clear, Enron failed to properly follow the dictates of the federal securities laws, and its executives engaged in numerous intentional acts to deceive investors, directors and, in some cases, one another.
The report was reviewed all day yesterday by the full board of Enron at a marathon meeting held in New York City in a 25th-floor conference room at the offices of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, the company's bankruptcy lawyers.
Directors began arriving at the conference room at 7 a.m. yesterday, where they were given a copy of the report. For hours, they read the report until they received their formal presentation from the investigating committee.
As the tales of deception and manipulation unfolded, the directors responded with rising anger, according to people who were there.
"The board was clearly very upset," said Thomas Roberts, a partner with Weil, Gotshal who attended the meeting.
According to the report, Enron entered into a series of transactions with the partnerships -- which were controlled by the company's former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow -- that served no economic purpose other than to manipulate reported profits. An independent third party would never have entered into such dealings, the committee concluded.
Among those cited in the report for failures were Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's longtime chairman and chief executive, and his protege, Jeffrey K. Skilling, who served as president and then chief executive before resigning in August.
In essence, both men were condemned for setting up a system in which Mr. Fastow would work as chief financial officer of Enron and general partner of the partnerships -- putting him on both sides of each transaction -- without ensuring that there was appropriate oversight. 
Mr. Lay "bears significant responsibility for those flawed decisions, as well as for Enron's failure to implement sufficiently rigorous procedural controls to prevent the abuses that flowed from this inherent conflict of interest," the report says. 
Earl J. Silbert, a lawyer for Mr. Lay, did not return phone calls.
The report is far more damning of Mr. Skilling. The former executive "certainly knew or should have known of the magnitude and the risks associated with these transactions," the report says. "Skilling, who prides himself on the controls he put in place at many areas of Enron, bears substantial responsibility for the failure of the system of internal controls to mitigate the risk inherent in the relationship between Enron and" the partnerships.
Indeed, according to the report, Mr. Skilling was warned in March 2000 by Enron's treasurer, Jeffrey McMahon, that there was reason for strong concern about the Fastow partnerships. "It appears Skilling did not take action" afterward, the report says. Mr. McMahon was named president of Enron last month and is helping lead its restructuring.
The report says that the committee obtained information showing that Mr. Skilling actively participated in efforts to disguise Enron's true performance and hid those efforts from the board.
"Although Skilling denies it, if the account of other Enron employees is accurate, Skilling both approved a transaction that was designed to conceal substantial losses in Enron's merchant investments and withheld from the board important information about that transaction," the report says.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Skilling said: "We believe the report bears out what Mr. Skilling has been saying for months. Mr. Skilling was not involved in any improprieties."
C. E. Andrews, global managing partner at Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditing firm, said in a statement that "the report overlooks the fundamental problem: the fact that poor business decisions on the part of Enron executives and its board ultimately brought the company down."
"This report fits Enron's established pattern of the last several months of attempting to shift blame to others."
Vinson & Elkins, Enron's major outside law firm, played a lesser but distinct supporting role in Enron's downfall, according to the report. Like Andersen, it failed to prevent Enron from issuing financial statements that obscured the essence of the partnerships, the report concluded. Nor did Vinson insist on full and clear disclosure of Mr. Fastow's conflicting interests.
Vinson's top managers were not able to get the report until late in the evening, according to Joe Householder, a spokesman for the firm. Harry Reasoner, the former managing partner who is coordinating Vinson's responses to Enron matters, is expected to comment on it today, Mr. Householder said. "But we are confident that when all the facts are known about the role we played, it will be seen that we met our professional obligations," he said.
The strongest criticism in the report is reserved for Mr. Fastow, who is described as having ultimately deceived the company and its directors as part of an effort to enrich himself.
In meetings with the board, what Mr. Fastow "presented as an arrangement intended to benefit Enron became, over time, a means of both enriching himself personally and facilitating manipulation of Enron's financial statements," says the report, which was filed with the federal bankruptcy court in New York that is overseeing Enron's case and was posted on the court's Web site about 6 p.m. Eastern time. "Both of these were inconsistent with Fastow's fiduciary responsibilities and anything the board authorized."
Gordon Andrew, a spokesman for Mr. Fastow, declined comment. 
The committee, headed by William C. Powers Jr., the dean of the University of Texas Law School, was appointed in the wake of Enron's disclosure of its dealing with the partnerships. Its other members are Raymond S. Troubh, a New York financial consultant, and Herbert S. Winokur, the chairman and chief executive of Capricorn Holdings Inc., a private investment company. The directors hired William R. McLucas, a longtime official of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to oversee the inquiry.
Mr. Lay and Mr. Powers are expected to testify before Congressional committees tomorrow. Mr. Skilling and Mr. Fastow are scheduled to testify later in the week.
In October, the company took a charge against earnings of $544 million after Andersen concluded that some of the partnership results should have been consolidated with the company's. That decision also contributed to a reduction of $1.2 billion in shareholders' equity, a measure of the the company's value. 
In the aftermath of those disclosures, Enron fell into a death spiral as confidence in the company and its reporting rapidly dwindled among banks, investors and traders. Ultimately, the company collapsed, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December. 
W. Neil Eggleston, a lawyer who is representing Enron's outside directors, said that the report showed "that critical information was withheld from the board.
"The board and its committees were repeatedly assured that the controls that the board had ordered were adequate and being followed, but the board was misled," he added. Mr. Eggleston said the board had agreed to permit Enron to enter the transactions only on condition that "stringent controls were followed."
Robert Bennett, a lawyer for Enron, said the company would use the report as a tool in its efforts to resuscitate itself. "This company wants to get down to the bottom of what occurred and solve the problems and move forward into the future and stabilize itself," he said.
According to the report, several Enron executives used the partnerships for personal gain at the company's expense. "Enron employees involved in the partnerships were enriched, in the aggregate, by tens of millions of dollars they should never have received," the report says.
Mr. Fastow received at least $30 million from his partnership transactions, according to report. Another executive who worked with him, Michael J. Kopper, received at least $10 million. Two others received at least $1 million each, and two more obtained what the committee said appeared to amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
One transaction was cited as being of particular concern. According to the report, Mr. Fastow appears to have offered a group of Enron employees the opportunity to invest in Southampton Place, a partnership that provided spectacular returns. 
In about two months, a $25,000 investment in Southampton netted Mr. Fastow some $4.5 million. Two other employees, who invested just $5,800, received $1 million in the same time period. 
"We have seen no evidence that Fastow or any of these employees obtained clearance for those investments, as required by Enron's code of conduct," the report says.
The transactions with the partnerships were also improperly disclosed to investors, the report says. Many of the disclosures, it says, were crafted by Mr. Fastow's division, and did not communicate the nature or function of the partnerships.

Life After AOL Time Warner Was Never So Much Fun

BYLINE:  By Aaron Donovan (COMPILED BY RICK GLADSTONE) 

 BODY:
O.K., maybe Gerald M. Levin's new job does not pump the adrenaline quite as much as his old one running the parent of America Online, the Warner Brothers studio, Warner Music, Warner Books, Time, Time Warner Cable, HBO, CNN, TNT and the rest of it. But Mr. 
Levin, 62, who stepped down as chief executive of AOL Time Warner in December, said he was quite excited to be the new guy on the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. "You might say it's different from what I've been doing," Mr. Levin said in a telephone interview last week, "but I don't think it's that big a leap."
 Mr. Levin, who oversaw the merger that created one of the biggest media and entertainment companies, said his old job and his new one required judgments that would affect the global economy. The New York Fed helps execute the government's international monetary policy -- buying and selling dollars in the foreign exchange market, for example. "I didn't think I'd have this opportunity," Mr. Levin said. 
 The opportunity came last fall, Mr. Levin said, when William J. McDonough, president of the New York Fed, and Peter G. Peterson, chairman of its board of directors, approached him about taking over a directorship that was to be vacated by Charles A. Heimbold Jr., chairman and chief executive of Bristol-Myers Squibb. In his new role, Mr. Levin said, "I'm supposed to represent the public interest."

Answering the Call to Rebuild

BYLINE:  By SUSAN HODARA 

 BODY:
WHEN organizers of the World Economic Forum decided to move this year's conference to New York City from its traditional location in Davos, Switzerland, it was to demonstrate support for the city after the Sept. 11 attacks. The conference, which began Thursday at the Waldorf-Astoria in Manhattan, brings together economic, political and academic leaders. 
 On a smaller scale, Westchester businesses have been making similar decisions to reflect their support for New York. Last month, the Waldorf-Astoria was host to another meeting: the annual Consultants and Engineers Conference of Greenwich Technology Partners, based in White Plains. 
 Founded in 1997, Greenwich Technology Partners is a computer networking company with some 400 employees in the United States and Europe. Since Sept. 11, the company has been involved in restoring networks and data centers of clients who were tenants of the World Trade Center. 
"Our decision to move our annual meeting to New York City was a response to what Mayor Giuliani and Governor Pataki were urging," said Joe Beninati, the company's chief executive officer. "Usually we go to sunny places where there's a beach. This year we made a patriotic choice. We were trying to do something tangible." 
Mr. Beninati estimated that the conference meant $1 million in revenues for the city. "The conference alone cost us about $500,000," he said. "And then we were hosting about 450 people, all of whom were going out and spending money on their own." 
In addition to outings to Chelsea Piers, Lincoln Center and the Tavern on the Green, Greenwich Technology Partners organized buses to take employees to Ground Zero. Many of them told Mr. Beninati how moved they were to be in New York at this time. 
The Pepsi Bottling Group , with headquarters in Somers, made a similar decision. Pepsi Bottling is the largest manufacturer, seller and distributor of Pepsi-Cola beverages, and until 1998, was a division of PepsiCo. A meeting of 23 top Pepsi Bottling executives was scheduled for the week of Sept. 17 in Jackson Hole, Wyo., and was postponed because of uncertainty about travel. Craig E. Weatherup, the company's chairman, rescheduled the meeting for early October in Manhattan. The company held its January board of directors meeting in Manhattan at the Stanhope Hotel. 
In early September, PepsiCo was in the planning stages of a meeting of public affairs executives from all of its operating divisions, including Frito-Lay in Dallas, Quaker in Chicago, Tropicana in Florida, and PepsiCo here in Purchase. 
"We were considering locations around the country," said Dick Detwiler, vice president of public relations at PepsiCo, "but after Sept. 11, we felt it would be a good thing to hold our meeting in New York City. We considered it a supportive measure."
According to NYC & Company, the city's convention and visitors' bureau, the cost of a hotel room accounts for 40 percent of a guest's expenditures each day. With the average room rate in the city around $200, that is approximately $500 per overnight visitor in revenues to the city, in addition to money spent by corporations on the events.
"The numerous meetings and conventions that have decided to move to New York following Sept. 11 send a clear message that New York is open for business," said Cristyne L. Nicholas, president and CEO of NYC & Company. "We've never appreciated their business more."
For other businesses, support for the city meant proceeding with plans made before Sept. 11. Collins Brothers Moving Corporation, situated in Larchmont since 1910, decided to open a Manhattan sales office. 
"We have always wanted a New York City branch," said Therese Ferretti, chief operating officer for Collins Brothers. "We were in the planning stages before Sept. 11, and we decided not to let the disaster sway us from going forward." The company moved into its new space on West 23rd Street in December. 
Mercy College, with headquarters in Dobbs Ferry and campuses in Yorktown, White Plains and the Bronx, has leased space in Herald Square in Manhattan. The school subleases smaller quarters from St. Michael's Academy in Manhattan, but hopes to open its new campus this fall. 
"We'd been talking about opening our own Manhattan location for quite some time," said Lorraine Gerstner, dean of the Manhattan campus, "but at the time of the terrorist attacks, we still had no lease. So we took a deep breath and said, 'Yes, we do want to make a commitment to the city, and there is no better time to do it than now.' " 
Mercy College is also holding its annual trustees' dinner in New York City. The event, scheduled for March 5 at the Pierre Hotel, is a fund-raiser for the college. 
Tom Christopher's contribution to New York City began with a single painting of the World Trade Center towers standing tall behind the Brooklyn Bridge and glowing a fiery orange and red in the sunrise. Mr. Christopher, an artist who lives and works in South Salem and whose paintings feature scenes of Manhattan, completed the piece, titled "New York Morning," in 2000 and was about to ship it to Germany when the towers were destroyed. 
Mr. Christopher said he felt compelled to "do something positive to help the city." After conversations with Robert McDonald, director of the Museum of the City of New York, which displayed "New York Morning" in its rotunda in the weeks after the disaster, and Curt Johnson, a publicist, an event called Art for America was organized. 
The event, an auction held at Chelsea Piers in late November and online for several weeks afterward, gathered the support of the art world, with celebrities such as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Richard Gere, and auction houses including Sotheby's, Doyle New York and Leland's Auctions. It raised more than $500,000 for the Twin Towers Fund. 
The newly merged ChevronTexaco Corporation will make its headquarters in San Francisco, and Texaco is in the process of closing its Purchase campus and relocating to California. (This week Morgan Stanley announced plans to buy the Purchase property.) But representatives from ChevronTexaco had a chance to participate in the opening bell ceremonies at the New York Stock Exchange -- one of the first businesses to do so since the disaster. 
"It was a chance for us to display our belief in the return to a new normalcy," said Chris Gidez, a ChevronTexaco spokesman.

Money, Contacts and a Bid For Lieutenant Governor

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON 

 BODY:
DENNIS MEHIEL may be the most moneyed candidate in the race for lieutenant governor of New York, but, he insists, "I'm no Mike Bloomberg."
 New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg spent some $69 million of his own money on his mayoral campaign. In an interview last week, Mr. Mehiel estimated that his own campaign to become the Democratic nominee in the November state election would cost "several million dollars." Mr. Mehiel, the owner of several large companies, has a reputation as a prodigious fund-raiser, and he said that he would seek much of his financing from contributions. But he plans on paying the rest himself. He has already invested $1 million. 
 Besides money, he has a politician's looks and charm, and plenty of contacts. But why wage a hard-fought and expensive campaign for a job that has few official duties? 
Mr. Mehiel's answer: To help Democrats defeat the Republican Gov.George E. Pataki, who is expected to run for a third term. 
"Any money the Democrats have, they should spend it on unseating Governor Pataki," said Mr. Mehiel. He said his business acumen lay in acquiring failing businesses and making them profitable. "I'm a pragmatic business guy. I would not be making this kind of effort if I didn't think victory in November was a strong possibility." 
Mr. Mehiel, 59, has remained actively involved in state politics for 25 years. Mr. Mehiel was chairman of the Westchester County Democratic Committee from 1989 until 1994. He serves on the boards of several schools and organizations, and handles fund-raising for several charity groups. He and his second wife, Karen, split their time between a home in Manhattan and one in Armonk. He has seven children (two boys, five girls; the youngest is in elementary school) from two marriages. 
He made his fortune in cardboard. In 1966, he founded a company that is now called Box USA, a large producer of corrugated packaging. Mr. Mehiel is the chairman and chief executive officer of S. F. Holdings Group in Manhattan. It is the holding company for the Sweetheart Cup Company and the Fonda Group, which manufacture disposable paper products. The privately held companies had reported revenues of more than $1 billion last year. 
Mr. Mehiel said he will keep his "day job" in industry for the time being, but that he will decrease his role in business as the campaign progresses. 
George S. Latimer, the Democratic county legislator from Rye, has also said he planned to run for lieutenant governor. He did not make himself available for an interview last week. David Alpert, chairman of the Westchester County Democratic Committee, has endorsed Mr. Mehiel, calling him "a strong serious candidate" who has broad statewide support and can bring lot of money to the race. 
At least four other people say they plan to run for lieutenant governor: Sandra Frankel, the town supervisor of Brighton, near Rochester; Jane Steiner Hoffman, a former commissioner of New York City's Department of Consumer Affairs; Stephen Burke, the chairman of the St. Lawrence County Democratic committee; and Charlie King, a former chairman of the Manhattan Democratic Party. 
Last year, Mr. Mehiel was the campaign chairman for Peter F. Vallone, a former New York City Council speaker, who unsuccessfully ran for mayor. In 2000, as chairman of the state Democratic committee's campaign committee, Mr. Mehiel helped the party win support in rural areas upstate that have long been Republican strongholds. He thinks that Governor Pataki's grip on the areas has loosened and that voters there want a candidate with strategies for revitalizing local economies. 
Mr. Mehiel is longtime ally of H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor. Recent polls of Democratic voters show Mr. McCall in a close race with Andrew M. Cuomo for the nomination. Mr. Cuomo, a son of former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, is a former federal housing secretary. 
Neither Mr. Cuomo nor Mr. McCall has endorsed a candidate for lieutenant governor.Under state election law, lieutenant governor candidates run separately from gubernatorial candidates in the primary. The winning candidate is paired on the ballot with the winner for governor. 
For both positions, the candidates are voted upon at the Democratic state convention, which will be held on May 22 and 23 in Manhattan. The primary is on Sept. 10.
"I'd rather bring strength to the ticket than look to hook a ride," Mr. Mehiel said.

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS; 
Despite Bush's Conservatism, His War Role Lifts Ferguson

BYLINE:  By Raymond Hernandez; Raymond Hernandez reports from Washington for The New York Times.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Only a few months ago, Democrats saw great promise in New Jersey's Seventh Congressional District, figuring it could play a big part in their plans to take back the House in the 2002 elections.
 It is easy to understand why. The seat is held by a freshman Republican, Mike Ferguson, who eked out a victory in the 2000 election in a district that voted overwhelmingly for Al Gore. 
 But there was more to it than that. Moderate Republicans like Mr. Ferguson had been placed in a political bind because the new Republican president, George W. Bush, began advancing a decidedly conservative agenda during his first eight months in office. 
Democrats seemed eager to exploit this, threatening to tie Mr. Ferguson to the Bush agenda in the 2002 elections -- even as Mr. Ferguson moved to distance himself from some of the President's policies and establish his independence.
Then came the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 and the war in Afghanistan.
Now, the president's popularity is soaring, and Democrats are suddenly acknowledging that their strategy could backfire.
This reversal underscores the volatility of politics and how quickly the public's view of its leaders can change. More than that, though, it suggests the new obstacles Democrats face in their campaign to take back the House, where Republicans hold a six-seat majority.
One Democratic strategist marveled at how things have changed in the past few months.
"If the election were held tomorrow, Mike Ferguson would be re-elected," the strategist said. "Tying him to the president would only help him right now."
Mr. Ferguson is also keenly aware of the new political environment.
"The world has changed," he said in a recent interview. "It's an amazing turnaround."
Before Sept. 11, Mr. Ferguson faced a major balancing act, forced to choose between his president and a district that he won with a mere 50 percent of the vote, as against his opponent's 48 percent.
But he moved decisively, taking positions that helped inoculate him against Democratic charges that he was unwilling to stand up to his party's dominant conservative wing. Again and again, he defied Mr. Bush, particularly on environmental and educational issues.
He joined his fellow Republican, Representative Marge Roukeman, the dean of the New Jersey delegation, in sending a letter to the president after his administration reversed itself on placing certain limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. 
Mr. Ferguson also spoke out against the Bush administration's proposal to allow oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge -- as well as the administrations decision to reconsider a Clinton-era policy that called for cutting the amount of naturally occurring arsenic in municipal drinking water.
He also defied Republican congressional leaders in seeking full financing for special education programs. This was all the more remarkable because he had an unlikely ally: Representative Patrick J. Kennedy of Rhode Island, the former head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee who traveled to New Jersey the previous year to campaign against Mr. Ferguson.
The Ferguson camp believes that moves like this have helped the congressman shore up his standing in the district, regardless of how voters feel about the president.
"I think Mike has charted a middle course that has been faithful to his district," said Chris Jones, his chief of staff.
But Mr. Bush's high approval ratings certainly do not hurt these days.
"We've had the wind at our backs for the last few months because of the President's popularity," Mr. Jones acknowledged before noting, with amazement, that his boss does not even have a challenger yet.
"A year ago, I would not have said that we would not have an opponent in February 2002," said Mr. Jones, noting the obvious political vulnerabilities that Mr. Ferguson had when he took his seat in Congress in January.
But a lot still can happen between now and the Election Day, and Democrats contend that Mr. Bush's popularity could fade as quickly as it appeared, particularly if their party can shift the focus to Mr. Bush's domestic agenda and the slumping economy.
Democrats say that Mr. Ferguson will have a lot of explaining to do if that happens. They argue that he has sided with the President on several domestic matters that may not be all that popular among the moderate-leaning voters of his district.
Democrats say, for example, that Mr. Ferguson is vulnerable because of the position he has taken in the debate over revamping the nation's campaign finance laws. A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers in the House have pushed for a vote on a bill opposed by Republican leaders and the president. But Mr. Ferguson has refused to join that bipartisan effort.
"People are fixated with the war right now, but there is going to come a time in the next few months when people will focus on the domestic agenda," a Democratic strategist said. "That's when Mike Ferguson becomes vulnerable, because he has cast votes with the president on a very reactionary, conservative agenda."

Russia's Stock Market Comes of Age

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
RUSSIA'S young stock market has been more a casino than a place to invest since its inception seven years ago. Last year, the market's performance was second only to China's, but in 1998, it was the worst-performing emerging market in the world.
 But as Russia enters its fourth consecutive year of economic growth and the private sector bubbles to life, analysts are saying this market may be ready for investors, not just gamblers. 
 "This place has been a speculation, sometimes opportune and sometimes dreadful," said Bernard Sucher, a managing director at the investment bank Troika Dialog, who moved to Russia in 1993 after nine years on Wall Street. "I've refused to use the word investment for most of the time I've been here. But now Russia is threatening to become a capital market." 
For the individual American investor, the options are still limited. The easiest way into the market is through a mutual fund listed in the United States. Eight funds at least partly dedicated to Russia are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, according to Lipper Inc. Of these, two are closed-end funds. In addition, shares of four Russian companies -- the telephone companies, Vimpel-Communications, Mobile TeleSystems and Rostelecom; and the oil company Tatneft -- can be bought as American depository receipts on the New York exchange. More than 50 other companies trade over-the-counter as American depository receipts, according to the Bank of New York. Offshore funds, not covered by American regulations, offer higher-risk investments, including bets against the market. 
A boom in Russia's oil industry has propelled the market. The main stock exchange is the Russian Trading System, known by its abbreviation, R.T.S. It has quadrupled in value since it hit a low in 1998, the year the government defaulted on its domestic debts. Bond prices have risen even more.
Despite an 80 percent jump in the value of the Russian market last year, stocks are still relatively cheap, said Peter Boone, head of research at Brunswick UBS Warburg, an investment bank in Moscow and a subsidiary of UBS Warburg. 
This is partly because the market fell so far in 1998: The R.T.S. index fell 96 percent from October 1997 to October 1998, and has yet to climb back to its level of fall 1997. The riskiness of investing in Russia, Mr. Boone said, has also kept valuations down.
"Russia is still the cheapest of all the major emerging markets," Mr. Boone said. "In 1999 there were a lot of people who absolutely didn't want to talk about Russia and met you out of friendship more than anything else. Now Russia is the flavor of the day."
In past years, Russian stocks traded in tandem far more than shares in developed markets. Recently, some companies have begun to break out of the market's overall trading pattern, making stock-picking important, said Sylvie Armand-Delille, director of international sales at Nikoil, a brokerage firm based in Moscow. 
FOR example, while shares of Yukos Oil, Russia's second-largest oil company, rose 191 percent last year -- in part because of a campaign to improve relations with investors -- Lukoil, the largest oil company, was a relative laggard, with an increase of 32 percent. Lukoil trailed the market at least in part because it was slow to release internationally audited versions of its financial accounts.
Poor treatment of minority shareholders was common in the 1990's, when new capitalists were grabbing assets from the government. Since then, big shareholders, their fortunes in hand, have begun repairing relations with investors, especially as they try to access international markets. Yukos has sold a bond issue internationally, while Lukoil is seeking a stock listing in London.
Russia's stock market is small. Only about 10 stocks are traded actively, out of 235 companies listed, and the average daily volumes on the R.T.S. range from $15 million to $50 million, with another $400 million traded abroad and on another Russian exchange that trades only in rubles. That limits choices for Russia-dedicated mutual funds, which typically stick to the most liquid stocks, like oil companies and mobile phone operators.
The Pilgrim Russia Fund was the best performing United States-based emerging market mutual fund over the last three years, with an annual return of 56 percent a year, Lipper reported. The fund was managed by Troika Dialog until early in 2001, when ING Barings, which bought it the year before, brought in its own managers. 
"Few other markets have as much going for them as the Russian market," said Samuel Oubadia, senior investment manager at ING Investment Management in the Netherlands. This was not always the case. Despite last year's performance, the fund was the worst in its category in 1998, when the Russian stock market collapsed after the government defaulted on its debts. 
About 40 percent of the fund's assets are held in oil companies, led by Surgutneftegaz, Russia's third-biggest oil company. Other large holdings include Norilsk Nickel, the giant metal producer, at 5.2 percent of assets at the end of last year, and Vimpelcom, the mobile phone company, at 4.1 percent.
Wealthier individuals may be interested in offshore funds, which are not regulated by American authorities. The $425 million Hermitage Fund, registered in the Channel Islands, requires a minimum $1 million investment for Americans. It returned an average 71.94 percent each year over the last three years, but lost 92.9 percent in the year ended October 1998.
Investors have streamed into Russia's stock and bond markets before, with disastrous results. In 1997, heavy buying drove the Russian Trading System up 184 percent before a financial crisis in Asia dampened enthusiasm for emerging markets. Half a year later, Russia, without warning, defaulted on $40 billion in government bonds. 
While much has changed since then, the market is not yet mature and some fund managers are cautious.
"Everyone talks about Russian oil companies, saying they are undervalued," said Oleg Biryulyov, a portfolio manager at J. P. Morgan Fleming Asset Management, which oversees a fund, registered in Dublin, with about $500 million in Russia. "Fine, I can accept this. But we need to remember that the Western companies have management resources and track records." 
STILL, there is reason for optimism. In contrast to the unchecked borrowing and spending of the 1990's, the Russian government now pays its debts on time and runs budget surpluses. The economy is expanding -- last year by 5.2 percent, this year by an expected 3.5 percent. The country is running a trade surplus of more than $50 billion. 
Chris Weafer, head of research at Troika Dialog, said that the turbulent politics of Boris N. Yeltsin had given way to the steady hand of President Vladimir V. Putin.
"They have a plan several years ahead," Mr. Weafer said, "rather than just dealing week to week."
Russia also has the beginnings of a bustling private sector. Supermarket chains have sprung up, advertisements flash from billboards and cafes line streets in Moscow, if not in many provincial cities. A corporate bond market has come alive in the last year. Oil companies carry less debt than three years ago, and they have reduced staff and modernized operations and drilling.
"Russia is in better shape and is better posed for economic growth than it ever has been over the last 10 years," Christof Ruehl, the World Bank's economist in Russia, said. 
Still, it remains a risky place to invest. Corruption is rife in the government and the courts. And with gross domestic product at $302 billion -- four-fifths the size of the Netherlands -- Russia has a small economy. A distrust of banks has led many Russians to keep their savings under mattresses. 
"Ask the majority of the Russian population about their plans for 10 years down the road -- no one will have an answer," Mr. Biryulyov said. "Ask the same question in any Western country and people will answer with far more certainty. That's a major difference. It's the same in the market."

A Church With a Storied Past And an Underside of Ill Repair

BYLINE:  By JUDITH MATLOFF 

 BODY:
As an old and venerable Harlem institution, the Convent Avenue Baptist Church has long drawn politicians to its Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebrations. This year's lineup included Mayor Bloomberg, Gov. George E. Pataki and Senator Charles E. Schumer. 
 But this church with powerful friends has alienated many neighbors. Community advocates say it is a bad property owner that has let several holdings fall into disrepair. 
 "The neighborhood is furious after 20 years of enduring the buildings' decay and negative impact on the economy," said Ronald L. Melichar, a resident. "Development is now what the church does best. They should move on."
He said the neo-Gothic church, at Convent Avenue and West 145th Street, had refused to find developers to preserve the buildings.
Near the 103-year-old marble-faced church, neighbors complain about a heap of garbage in front of a church-owned town house. A vacant brownstone owned by the church is so decayed the Fire Department won't enter in case of emergency.
A particular source of contention is the ruined hulk looming over 145th Street, between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue. Billed for 20 years as the "Future Home of the M. L. Wilson Boys Club of Harlem," a youth group sponsored by the church, the building once housed Public School 186. It has been abandoned for so long that a sizable tree sprouts from its broken roof. Vagrants loiter around the site.
Calling these and other church-owned buildings a blight, George Goodwill, the chairman of Community Board 9, expressed dismay that the church had failed to follow up proposals to relocate the local post office in one of its vacant properties. 
The pastor, the Rev. Clarence P. Grant, defended holding onto the properties. He said the church, which once had a pastor with a close working relationship with Dr. King and strong links to the civil rights movement overall, wanted to expand its programs for youth and the elderly. He also said the church lacked the money to maintain its properties. "We just don't have the resources," he said.
At least $16 million is needed to demolish the 145th Street structure and replace it with an eight-story building, he said. He rejected appeals by preservationists to maintain the grand Italianate facade. Putting up a new, bigger building would give the church an extra 5,000 square feet of space and thus more space to rent out. 
The church's goals for the former public school are ambitious: to increase the membership of the boys' club from 150 to 3,000; to rent space to a bank and 10 stores; and to build an auditorium, a gymnasium and a theme park on the history of Harlem and the civil rights movement.
Mr. Grant would not say where the money would come from, but he vowed to have a design plan by August and a complete building by 2005. JUDITH MATLOFF

The Promise of Power That's Always There

BYLINE:  By DAVID LUDLUM 

 BODY:
LAST month, Active Power, which makes a device for improving the quality and reliability of electric power, booked its largest order.
 It came from a plastics maker, not from the data centers or communication companies that have been the usual customers for technology to protect sensitive equipment from electrical spikes and sags. 
 With the increasing use of digital manufacturing technology, a broad range of companies are affected by power problems, which can interrupt production, damage equipment or destroy work in process. "Most people think it's just eBay and Charles Schwab that are affected," said Eric A. Prouty, an analyst at Adams, Harkness & Hill, an investment firm, "but it's the old economy, too." 
As a result, companies like Active Power of Austin, Tex., and SatCon Technology of Cambridge, Mass., have begun attracting attention, even though many have yet to earn a profit. Active Power, which has an innovative flywheel technology for uninterruptible power supplies, reported revenues of $22.6 million for 2001 and a net loss of $28 million.
Much of the appeal of such fledgling companies, and of well-entrenched manufacturers that rely on battery technology like American Power Conversion, of West Kingston, R.I., and C&D Technologies of Blue Bell, Pa., comes from the market's size, said Richard A. Giesen, manager of the Munder Power Plus fund. 
The Electric Power Research Institute, a research consortium supported by utility companies, estimated last year that power failures cost the United States economy $104 billion a year and that power quality problems, like spikes and drops, cost an additional $15 billion. Manufacturing companies suffer greater losses than "new economy" companies, like those involved with data processing, the group said. 
Worldwide expenditures to address these problems each year run $10 billion to $15 billion, including the cost of backup generators, said James P. LoGerfo, an analyst at Banc of America Securities.
The research firm Frost & Sullivan estimates that the market for uninterruptible power supplies reached $5.8 billion last year and will grow to $7.9 billion in 2007. High-end industrial systems represent 45 percent of sales.
At the moment, companies making flywheel systems are seeking inroads in a market dominated by batteries. Flywheels convert the energy of a spinning disk or cylinder to electricity during momentary power disturbances or until a backup generator takes over. They require less space and maintenance than batteries and are less expensive over their lifetimes, but the initial cost of batteries is lower. That poses a marketing challenge, said Mas Siddiqui, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs.
The size of the market for flywheel systems is an open question, said Richard T. Stuebi of NextWave Energy, a consulting firm in Denver. "Developers of flywheel technologies are still trying to figure out which customers prefer them to batteries," he said.
Caterpillar of Peoria, Ill., the leading supplier of backup generators, distributes Active Power's flywheel systems, and that has made some analysts view Active Power more favorably. Tim Fogarty, an analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners, gives Active Power a price target of $8 within the next 12 months. It closed Friday at $4.70. 
SatCon Technology offers a rival technology, which is incorporated into flywheel systems made by Beacon Power of Wilmington, Mass. SatCon reported revenues of $41.7 million for the year ending Sept. 30 and a net loss of $24.3 million.
MR. LOGERFO favors SatCon, in part because its power electronics can be used not just with flywheels but also with generating equipment like wind turbines, solar arrays, fuel cells and microturbines. 
"It's an inexpensive way to gain exposure not just to power quality but to other emerging opportunities," he said. His price target is $15 over the next 12 months. The shares closed Friday at $5.90. 
American Power Conversion offers investors a more conservative way of entering the market. The company, which provides uninterruptible power supplies based on batteries, is well established and profitable. It has systems for everything from a desktop computer to a data center and an industrial plant. 
With $1.43 billion in annual revenue, Mr. Siddiqui said, "it's much more of a real company" than most energy technology concerns. It earned $115.2 million last year. "If you want something that's here and now, this is it," he said. His price target is $18. The stock closed Friday at $14.20.
Another more conservative play is C&D Technologies, with sales for the nine months ending Oct. 31 of $383.4 million and earnings of $31.8 million. It is a leader in North America for reserve power batteries, Mr. Prouty said. He says the stock, which closed Friday at $20.66, is worth $24.50. "This is not a development-stage play," he said. "These guys are very profitable."

HEADLINE: Even Last Year, Option SpigotWas Wide Open 

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
SURPRISE, surprise. Early reports suggest that top executives across America got a bigger dollop of stock options last year as part of their pay.
 As corporate earnings and cash flow have ebbed and stock prices have fallen, boards have been doling out options as a cheap, balance-sheet-friendly way of compensating managers. 
 The annual proxy season, when companies reveal compensation, is just starting. If the disclosures show the trend toward larger option grants holding after a year that most companies would like to forget, it would seem to make a mockery of the concept of pay for performance. That was the reason options grew so popular in the first place. Yet while some companies are trying to make options better reflect their fortunes, most others simply contend that options are primarily a motivational tool and have never been a reward for performance. 
With stock prices stalled, options may not seem attractive now. But executives who receive them can usually count on rich rewards eventually, even if a company does only marginally better. The increase in options, however, imposes additional costs on shareholders; the more options granted, the lower the return for investors, since their holdings are, one way or the other, diluted.
But the options keep coming. Chief executives who received more of them last year, even as their companies suffered, include Daniel A. Carp of Eastman Kodak, John T. Chambers of Cisco Systems, Scott G. McNealy of Sun Microsystems and Harvey R. Blau of Aeroflex.
And Henry B. Schacht, returning to the helm of troubled Lucent, received annual options grants almost five times the size of those his predecessor received -- and more than 17 times the size of the last grant he received the year he retired. "Fiscal 2001 was rather challenging for Lucent, so the grants were made to ensure Henry had management stability through the turnaround," said Mary Lou Ambrus, a Lucent spokeswoman, in explanation.
Chances are, many chief executives received bigger options awards, as proxy statements, filed each March and April by most companies, are expected to show, experts say. Some were no doubt issued to make up for previous grants that had been rendered worthless by tumbling stock prices.
At the same time, the market's recovery has revived hopes that old option grants will not be worthless. "Options typically run for 10 years, and already many of the ones issued in the last year are back in the money," said John N. Lauer, chief executive of Oglebay Norton, a shipping company. "If the economy recovers, those issued in previous years will also regain value." 
 MR. LAUER has gained notoriety in corporate circles for his insistence on being paid entirely in options priced well above Oglebay's stock price. Though Oglebay's performance has improved somewhat, options he received five years ago are still worth nothing.
"In a social setting where I'm in a room with other C.E.O.'s, someone will teasingly suggest that they pass the hat for me because I'm not making any money," he said. "I think they figure I'm loony or something."
Mr. Lauer is not the only executive to have high performance goals, but it is safe to say that most executives keep drawing large salaries, plus more and more options. According to a survey done in the third quarter of last year by Pearl Meyer & Partners, a human resources consulting firm in New York, the number of options granted by 50 major companies that will report their 2001 compensation this spring was up an average of 12 percent from 2000.
Consultants expect that trend to continue as companies report 2001 compensation practices this spring. "It's a great time to give options," said Pearl Meyer, president of the firm. "They're cheap because they involve no charge to earnings, and that's important at a time when profits are down and boards are trying to make up for the fact that salaries and bonuses are both down."
But Ms. Meyer and many others in the field -- as well as, they say, the members of corporate compensation committees -- are not happy to see the increase in options grants. Their expressions of concern are striking because compensation consultants have been among the biggest champions of the use of options as performance incentives.
The consultants are worried, in part, about the option "overhang" -- options outstanding, plus those shares that investors have authorized but that have yet to be granted. More fundamentally, they suggest that the links between a manager's pay and a company's performance -- as measured by, say, profitability, market-share growth and smart acquisition strategies -- have become more tenuous.
Ms. Meyer suggests that the at-risk components of executive pay be viewed as the legs of a stool; the leg reflecting stock performance has grown longer and longer, while those reflecting business and financial performance have become shorter.
"We have overdosed on options and the stock market," she said. "We're dependent on the stock market for executive compensation, pension payments, directors' compensation, 401(k) plans -- our whole economy, practically, is dependent on the market's performance."
That reliance has produced an overhang that dangles like a sword of Damocles over investors. Eventually, their stakes will be diluted -- either when companies issue vast quantities of new shares to make good on options grants, or when they undertake share-repurchase programs that eat up cash they might use for operations.
According to a study by Watson Wyatt Worldwide, a human resources consulting company, the average options overhang of the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was 14.6 percent of outstanding shares in 2000, up from 13 percent a year earlier.
This spring's numbers will probably show another rise. The overhang "is definitely going to be up" by a percentage point or more in 2001, said Ira T. Kay, a consultant at Watson Wyatt Worldwide, "because people aren't exercising their options the way they were when the stock market was booming." 
Mr. Kay predicted that the slowdown in the exercising of options would work to curb the issuing of new ones this year and next, although he anticipates a slow increase over the long term. "I've been in meetings of five boards that were very reluctant to go to shareholders to ask for more shares to underwrite options grants," he said. "They don't think they can justify it."
Companies are losing out on another salutary benefit of options compensation as well -- their ability to reduce corporate taxes. Employers get a deduction when employees exercise options, but as Mr. Kay and other compensation consultants note, these days few are cashing them in.
Oddly, shareholder advocates and institutional investors, who stand to lose the most from an option glut, seem sanguine thus far. Some note that while option awards have increased, the value of the awards has collapsed. Pearl Meyer's research shows that the value of option grants fell 7 percent in the first eight months of 2001 after rising steadily for several years.
Some shareholder advocates say that will also help curb future grants, as long as stocks are sluggish.
"We've had a 20 percent drop in the Standard & Poor's index," said Patrick S. McGurn, of Institutional Shareholder Services, a consulting business in Rockville, Md. "And the standard valuation method for options would tell you that you'd have to double or triple grants just to get to the level where you were the previous year. Most boards are going to balk at those numbers, particularly when corporate performance has been so poor."
But that may be wishful thinking. Last year, Eastman Kodak took $659 million in restructuring charges that, combined with falling sales and market share, pushed its earnings down 95 percent. In November it awarded its chief executive, Mr. Carp, options for 250,000 shares at an exercise price of $29.31, Kodak's stock price at the time. All Mr. Carp must do to gain is keep Kodak's stock level.
That grant came on top of the 100,000 options he received in January 2001 at a strike price of $40.97. So Mr. Carp received three and a half times as many options in 2001 as he did in 2000 -- at markedly lower strike prices. Sandra R. Feil, director for worldwide total compensation at Kodak, said Mr. Carp received two awards last year because the company had changed the timing of its grants, to November from January.
 AS for the increase, Ms. Feil said Kodak had worked with Frederic W. Cook & Company, a compensation consultant, which found that Mr. Carp was in the lowest 25 percent of executives receiving options. "What we've done," she said, "is taken a step, and even a conservative step at that, in getting him out of that lowest quartile."
But what about Kodak's dismal performance last year? "We look at stock options as a long-term incentive that's forward-looking," Ms. Feil said. "We don't look at them as a reward for past performance."
To understand just how easy it is to get richer and richer on options, consider the case of Lawrence J. Ellison, chairman, chief executive and co-founder of the Oracle Corporation, the software maker. In January, with Oracle's stock trading just above $30, near its yearly high of $34, Mr. Ellison exercised option grants for about 23 million shares at an average price of 23 cents, for a paper profit of more than $700 million.
It was the biggest options bonanza on record -- and Mr. Ellison holds options to buy an additional 47.9 million shares. "He could end up taking $3 billion out of the company," said Judith Fischer, managing director of Executive Compensation Advisory Services, a consulting firm.
Investors are often forgiving of founders like Mr. Ellison, many of whom staked personal assets and invested buckets of sweat equity to get companies off the ground. His paper profit has shrunk to $378 million as Oracle's stock has sagged. 
But investors were still piqued by Mr. Ellison's timing. He exercised his options a month before Oracle issued an earnings warning. The options expired on Aug. 1; he was under no pressure to sell them in January. 
To protect shareholders from dilutions from options, Oracle routinely buys shares in the market. Other big corporate users of options, like Microsoft and Dell Computer, do, too, contending that it not only protects shareholders, but offers them tax advantages.
But repurchase programs can also have a huge impact on a company's cash flow. Oracle started the fiscal year that began June 1, 2000, with $7.4 billion in cash, then spent $4.3 billion to repurchase shares largely for use in its options program.
At the end of the fiscal year, the company's overhang stood at 28 percent of total outstanding shares. Microsoft has a similarly large overhang, but it also has more cash.
For years, shareholders have pushed companies to make chief executives earn their keep, and they initially applauded the use of options to accomplish that goal. But companies found ways to make sure the options were worth something regardless of performance, by repricing worthless options or replacing them with fistfuls of new ones.
The outcry over those practices, however, may be pushing some companies to make changes.
In the spring of 1999, the LongView Collective Investment Fund, which manages some A.F.L.-C.I.O. pension money, submitted a shareholder proposal to the Chubb Corporation, the insurer, asking it to grant options that would more closely align compensation with performance.
The proposal was defeated. But when Beth W. Young, an independent consultant who advises the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and other pension fund managers, called Chubb the next spring to resubmit the proposal, she was told that Chubb had already incorporated into its incentive plan options that could be exercised only if the stock price rose significantly.
Roughly half the options handed out to Chubb's senior management in 2000 and 2001 have an exercise price 25 percent higher than the stock price on the day they were granted. But only 2 percent to 4 percent of large companies use such "premium priced" options, consultants say.
"The executives who were granted these options will, at least in theory, have a much stronger incentive to take steps to increase the stock price," said Donald B. Lawson, the Chubb senior vice president who manages compensation and benefits.
Chubb also uses "performance shares," which can typically be redeemed only after three years and only if the company clears specific hurdles. In 2000, for example, the performance shares it handed out in 1998 were worthless because the company did not hit those targets.
For Dean R. O'Hare, Chubb's chief executive, that meant his total compensation fell by $448,508 from the previous year. He did get more options, but those largely replaced restricted shares -- those that cannot be sold right away -- after the company decided not to use them to reward executives, Mr. Lawson said.
Performance shares held by C. Michael Armstrong, the chief executive of AT&T, have proved to be worthless for three years, as the company has fallen short of the board's goals for increases in total return to shareholders.
An options award for 419,200 shares granted to Mr. Armstrong at the end of 2000 was also tied to better performance. The options can be exercised only if AT&T produces a $145 billion pretax gain for shareholders in the year that started March 31. On the other hand, another twist on options accelerates the vesting period if a company's shares reach a certain target. In 2000, the Williams Companies granted options with the condition that if, on certain days, the stock traded at 1.4 times the price at the beginning of the year, the options could be exercised immediately rather than over three years.
Other companies are working to get more plain-vanilla stock, not options, into executives' hands -- stock they must buy. When Beazer Homes USA, a home builder, went public in 1994, it adopted a management stock purchase program to increase managers' stakes. At the beginning of each year, some 80 executives can choose to give up a percentage of their bonuses to buy stock at a 20 percent discount on the year-end closing price. The stock cannot be sold for three years.
Executives now own roughly 8 percent of the company, said David S. Weiss, Beazer's chief financial offier. "We think it's a good idea to have them put real money at risk, as opposed to just receiving a reward," he said. "Options feel like a gift from the company that the market, through its whims, will reward or not. Shares reflect the company's performance, whether good or bad."
Mr. Kay, at Watson Wyatt, said such pure stock subsidies were gaining popularity. More companies, he said, plan to use contingent options like those at Chubb and AT&T, which try to reflect financial and business performance.
Investors expect the BellSouth Corporation and the Eaton Corporation, for example, to disclose such adjustments in their new proxy statements. A spokesman for Eaton said he was unaware of such a move, and a spokesman for BellSouth declined to comment until the proxy is released in March.
BUT other boards are already finding ways to limit the risks that performance shares, premium-priced options, performance-accelerated options and other performance-linked tools pose.
Until last April, Archie W. Dunham, chief executive of Conoco, had options giving him the right to buy 700,000 shares. But he could exercise them only if Conoco's shares traded above $35 on each of the five days before Aug. 17 of this year.
Before Conoco bought Gulf Canada Resources in July, however, its board granted a two-year extension to Mr. Dunham and at least six other executives holding those options. "The board thought the climate was right this year for some kind of an acquisition but that it could have an adverse effect on the stock price," John McLemore, a Conoco spokesman, said. "They thought it wouldn't be really fair for those people who held these options to be punished for something that might make it harder for them to meet the conditions."
That means the board rewarded Mr. Dunham and his colleagues for an acquisition that it knew was likely to hurt Conoco's shares, at least temporarily -- a courtesy not extended to shareholders.

HEADLINE: The Death of Deficits 

 BODY:
When President Bush delivered the sobering news last week that his budget would run a deficit, there was nary a squawk of protest. Deficits have returned, but deficit outrage has not. Concerns about war and recession have chased away memories of nearly two decades of Congressional battles over what mixture of taxes and spending was needed to balance the federal ledger.
 In recent years, in fact, the argument was what to do about surpluses. But now that surpluses have disappeared, Democrats are afraid to talk about raising taxes, and the administration seems afraid to cut spending. They are acting as if the prospect of big deficits does not matter. 
 In the short run, they're right -- deficits do not matter. That is a message to keep in mind as Mr. Bush presents his $2 trillion federal budget on Monday. A slumping economy is no time to worry about balancing the budget. Neither should the fear of deficit spending stand in the way of the need to combat terrorism abroad and protect against terrorist attacks at home. But it is unsettling that Mr. Bush shows no signs of acknowledging the long-term importance of avoiding another era of endless red ink. It is also disturbing that no one else in Washington seems prepared to talk about the tough choices that the current budget policies portend.
The role of the federal deficit has long been a peculiar feature of American politics. Some Americans have long resented the fact that the government could run in the red while they could not. Republicans have especially made headway with the charge that deficits came from profligate spending by Democrats. President Clinton made deficit reduction a centerpiece of his first economic program, and he persuaded Congress to raise taxes to accomplish his goal.
Deficits are a remote abstraction when the public has other things to think about, however. Indeed, Mr. Bush plans to increase spending so substantially that a group of conservative Republicans has complained that he has undermined the party's historic commitment to smaller government. According to leaks, Mr. Bush plans the biggest military spending increases since the Reagan era, a doubling of domestic security spending and targeted increases in areas like education, health and child nutrition programs.
In some areas, there will be budget cuts that Congress may reverse, especially if they threaten popular job training or day care programs. But there seems to be little appetite for the ideological warfare over the role of the federal government that characterized budget fights under President Reagan, Mr. Bush's father and Mr. Clinton. 
In this comforting atmosphere, however, Congress needs to beware of steps that threaten the country's ability to address deep-seated problems like Medicare and Social Security.
By some calculations, Mr. Bush's budget plans to tap into $1.5 trillion generated by the trust funds of these retirement systems in the next decade. Accelerating and making permanent last year's tax cuts, as Mr. Bush wants, would make that raid even bigger. Draining the funds for other purposes, even to fight terrorism and pay for military spending, would make it much harder to keep Social Security and Medicare solvent for the retiring baby boomers. The nation needs a discussion about that right now.
During the 2000 campaign, Mr. Bush promised to keep these retirement systems in good health. His programs run counter to that pledge. But the Democrats can be faulted for not being brave enough to address the true consequences of the tax cuts. Both Senator Tom Daschle, the majority leader, and Representative Richard Gephardt, the House minority leader, rightly blame the tax cuts for the deficit. But they are not forcing even their own supporters to confront the choice between repealing the cuts and shoring up Social Security and Medicare. Like Mr. Bush, they, too, need to confront these long-term questions.

Finding Common Ground On Poor Deadbeat Dads

BYLINE:  By BLAINE HARDEN 

 BODY:
BE they Democrats or Republicans, all politicians love to chase deadbeat dads. With the White House, Congress and state legislatures all joining the hunt, the capture and extraction of money from AWOL fathers has become one of the most successful -- and bipartisan -- social policy crusades of recent years.
 Collection of child support from the 11 million fathers who do not live with their children has nearly doubled in the past decade, to more than $18 billion a year. 
 "There is no way to escape these guys unless you get an alias and are prepared to hide for the rest of your life," said Damien Abeyta, 24, who lives in Denver and is the father of two infant sons from two mothers with whom he no longer has contact. The state of Colorado caught up with him last year, even though he was working an off-the-books construction job. It warned him that unless he acted at once to pay his arrears, his driver's license would be revoked. 
Yet with the budget that President Bush sends this week to Congress, there is now bipartisan recognition at the highest level of government that the hunt for deadbeats is getting out of hand when it comes to the 2.5 million American fathers who are poor.
This is an unusual case of conservatives and liberals realizing that no-nonsense law enforcement is chasing some fathers away from their children. It comes at a time when both parties have agreed to support the crucial role that fathers play in child development.
The White House is acknowledging what recent social research has shown: for a poor absentee father and his even poorer children, the current system offers only family-unfriendly choices.
If a poor father pays child support to the state, it typically keeps the money to pay itself back for welfare benefits paid to his children. As a result, his children and their mother see no tangible evidence that the father is helping their lives. If he gives money to his family under the table, which greatly improves his relationship with the mother and often allows him more time with his children, it does nothing to reduce his legal child-support obligations. Instead, a father often finds himself living as an invisible man, working in the underground economy as his child-support arrears, with interest running at 12 percent in some states, mount ever higher.
The president's budget proposal will offer absentee fathers who are "dead broke" much better odds of seeing their children, while coming in from the cold of unpayable debt. The Bush proposal will include a provision to send all of a father's payments directly to his family. It will also propose spending $286 million over five years to reimburse states that pass child support on to families. 
"What we are trying to do is set up family ties so that the father knows that the check is going to the family and the children, versus going to some government coffer somewhere," said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Even those child-welfare experts who have almost nothing good to say about the Bush administration's policies toward the poor regard this proposal as innovative and much needed. "It is an important signal about the value of child support to low-income families and a message to poor fathers that if they pay support it will really make a difference to their children," said Paula Roberts, a lawyer who specializes in child support issues at the Center for Law and Social Policy in Washington. 
There is only one state, Wisconsin, that passes along all child-support money to families without any reduction in welfare payments. Five years of research there suggests that the policy has been a solid success. It motivates fathers to pay more child support, encourages unmarried partners to establish paternity more quickly and shortens the amount of time that mothers stay on welfare.
It is no coincidence that Wisconsin's child support experiment, having been validated by research, is being proposed this year as federal policy under Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, who is a former governor of Wisconsin.
In the federal welfare reform law of 1996, which imposed a five-year limit on cash payments to mothers, all states were given the option of passing child support payments on to families. But none has done so with Wisconsin's zeal.
IN part, that's because of bureaucratic hunger for a large slice of the child-support pie. With 55,300 employees, the state and federal child-support system spends $1 of every $5 it collects on administrative overhead, according to federal figures. "The logic of the system overtook the policy, which was to help children," said Maria Cancian, an economist at the University of Wisconsin, who worked on an evaluation of the state's child-support reforms.
The federal and state enforcement system works well when collecting child support from middle-class dads with jobs, she said, "but the fathers of poor children are often themselves poor and the logic of forcing them to pay the cost of welfare is not compelling."
A piece of the welfare puzzle that is compelling to both Republicans and Democrats has emerged from a flood of research on poor families. It shows that a father's presence in the home is much more important to the emotional development of children than was previously understood. Among other things, it increases the odds that a child will complete high school, not take drugs and not become pregnant before the age of 18.
Complementing that research are findings in Wisconsin and elsewhere that a significant percentage of nonresident poor fathers (about one-third) have at least weekly contact with their children and that many would like to see them much more often. "When you are separated from your child, there is a part of you that dies every day," said Eric Legette, a nonresident father in Brooklyn who runs a program called Fathers With Voices, which offers men instruction in how to use the legal system to see their children.
The desire of men to be with their children is "the only carrot" that works with many poor fathers, said Robert Brady, head of the Young Fathers program in Denver. "These men may not care about the law, but they do want to see those kids," he said.
The Bush proposal to allow a poor dad's money to go directly to his offspring seems certain to lure more fathers in from the underground economy, child-support experts agree, while making the children and the mothers considerably happier to see them.

HEADLINE: Tempted by Oil, Russia Draws Ever Closer to Iraq 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
President Bush may have plenty of reasons why Russia, his new ally in the war on terrorism, should stop cozying up to Iraq, one of the states he sees as part of an "axis of evil."
 But Leonid Fedun has 20 billion reasons why Russia should not. 
 Mr. Fedun is vice president for development at Lukoil, Russia's biggest oil company. He oversees a 23-year contract to develop Iraq's West Qurna oil field -- 667 million tons of crude, a half-million barrels a day. It is potentially, he says, a $20 billion moneymaker. 
But only potentially. Thanks to United Nations sanctions on Iraq, Lukoil has not pumped a drop from West Qurna since it won drilling rights in 1997. With the United States now talking openly of ousting President Saddam Hussein of Iraq from power, Mr. Fedun wonders whether Lukoil ever will pay off.
"If the Americans start military operations against Iraq," he said, "we may lose a contract, and American oil companies will come in our place. No one has ever said the opposite."
For two nations that have jointly pledged to stem the spread of terror, weapons and the despots who would use them, agreeing on what to do about Mr. Hussein is the first serious test of their wobbly new friendship, with pragmatism and suspicion rife on both sides.
"I'm very critical of Russian supporters of Saddam," said Andrei Kozyrev, former President Boris N. Yeltsin's first foreign minister and one of the United States' more consistent supporters here. "But speaking about Washington, it's a very, very awkward, very simplistic and inflexible approach they take toward Iraq. There's a lot of room for improvement."
Some American experts are no less confounded. "Do I want to curry favor with the Iraqi regime?" said Eugene B. Rumer, a State Department policy strategist in the Clinton administration who is now a Russia scholar at the National Defense University in Washington. "Or do I want to maintain a solid relationship with the United States and, to a lesser degree, with Europe? The answer to that ought to be fairly obvious." 
Even in the wake of Sept. 11, Russia has clung to its position as Iraq's chief protector against new United Nations sanctions or a new American attack.
The Kremlin also wants an end to British and American patrols of the no-flight zones imposed after the Persian Gulf war to prevent Mr. Hussein's jets from bombing Iraq's Kurdish and Shiite minorities. Russia argues that the United Nations never specifically approved such zones.
Mr. Rumer argues -- and some Russians agree -- that the Kremlin has let Russia's best interests in Iraq take a back seat to the agendas of a powerful oil industry and a bureaucracy still nursing cold war resentments.
For its part, however, the United States has done almost nothing to allay Russia's very real fear: that if Mr. Hussein goes, Russia's multibillion-dollar stake and its influence in Iraq will go with him.
Baghdad still owes Russia at least $8 billion from the days of the cold war when, as a client state, Iraq outfitted its military with armor bought on Soviet credit. Then there are billions of dollars in oil contracts with Russian companies, and billions of dollars more trading that could be done with a pro-Russian government in Baghdad.
The American silence on Russia's actual and potential stake in Iraq only solidifies the conviction of some Russians that the White House cannot be trusted to play fairly, new friendship or not.
So far, Mr. Hussein has played deftly on America's rage and Russia's fears. He gave Russia by far the largest share of Iraq's contracts last year -- $1.3 billion -- under the United Nations oil-for-food program, which allows Iraq to sell oil to buy supplies to help Iraqi civilians.
In late September, days after President Vladimir V. Putin cast Russia's lot in with the West's war on terrorism and the White House began expressing its concern about Iraq, Baghdad announced plans to award Russian companies another $40 billion in contracts as soon as United Nations sanctions were lifted.
Iraq also has courted Russian politicians with trips and other inducements; Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the outspoken nationalist, has made several visits.
"It's safe to say that there is a strong pro-Iraqi lobby in Russia," said Alexei V. Mitrofanov, a member of Parliament from Mr. Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party. "Just as there is a strong pro-Taiwan lobby in the United States."
Last week, as American strategists pondered the prospects for Mr. Hussein's demise, Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, was in Moscow. He returned to Moscow the following week after talks in China, but left without meeting any senior officials. 
Russia's foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, said during the earlier visit that Russia and Iraq saw eye to eye on questions of extremism and terrorism and that the American-backed sanctions against Iraq were counterproductive and should be lifted. More pointedly, he said Russia solidly opposed "spreading or applying the international antiterror operation to any arbitrarily chosen state, including Iraq."
The Kremlin offers some diplomatic arguments for its policy: that the United States has overstepped the United Nations mandate on Iraq and that it is unproven that Iraq is developing weapons of mass destruction or supporting terrorism.
Russia pointedly does not say that Mr. Hussein is a friend, because he is not. "There are no emotional bonds between the Russians and the Iraqis," said Dmitri Trenin, a top expert on Russian foreign policy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Moscow. "It's not Yugoslavia or Serbia. You have to talk about interests -- very specific, very easily identifiable interests."
Those interests are largely in places like West Qurna, one of the world's largest oil deposits. 
Soviet wildcatters and engineers had probed the West Qurna deposit earlier, sinking 300 wells in 1979 alone in preparation for pumping oil. 
Iraq's war with Iran halted work in the 1980's, and Mr. Hussein's invasion of Kuwait kept it at a standstill in the 1990's. Iraq revived the project in the mid-1990's as tensions over the presence of United Nations weapons inspectors inside Iraq were peaking.
The new production-sharing agreement gave Lukoil rights to more than half of all oil pumped there during the life of the contract. Iraq got another 25 percent. But the Kremlin got a stake, too: two Russian government agencies gained another quarter of the oil rights as part of a scheme to repay some of Iraq's Soviet debt.
Russia was explicit that it would not pump oil until sanctions were lifted. But Iraq was not without leverage: in November 2000, Mr. Hussein threatened to void the West Qurna deal for nonperformance.
That December, the Kremlin sent a letter to Baghdad proposing an end to the no-flight zones and a deal in the United Nations to lift economic sanctions against Iraq in exchange for the return of weapons monitors.
The Kremlin continues to pursue that deal, and although Iraq rejected it again last week, Mr. Aziz's visits here and in Beijing almost certainly center on reaching some United Nations accord that would stave off American military action.
No one professes to know where Mr. Putin really stands regarding Mr. Hussein. Among experts here and in the United States, there is a growing sense that the Kremlin's control of its Iraq policy is being taken over by Russian industry and the Soviet holdovers, in both the bureaucracy and Parliament, who still see Iraq as part of a grand game to thwart American influence.
Equally, it is not clear whether the United States cares about Russia's stake in Iraq.
Experts on both sides say a savvy Kremlin almost surely would grab any American compromise that offered reassurances on Russia's economic interests and unpaid debt in exchange for Moscow's help in ratcheting up the pressure on Mr. Hussein.
Even Mr. Fedun of Lukoil, holding a $20 billion contract he cannot execute, suggests that his firm might welcome American oil companies in a venture to spread the risks of the West Qurna project -- if only the sanctions would end.
"I don't see why one can't make sure that those interests are taken good care of," said Mr. Trenin of the Carnegie Endowment. "I think this calls for a trade-off."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 7, 2002

An article on Sunday about Russia's relations with Iraq referred incorrectly to Shiite Muslims who are being protected from Saddam Hussein's military by American and British air patrols. Shiites in Iraq are a majority, not a minority.

HEADLINE: Bush Administration Approves $700 Million Grant to Help Rebuild Lower Manhattan 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
The Bush administration said today that it had approved a $700 million grant for New York State to help rebuild Lower Manhattan, create jobs and revive businesses devastated by the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center.
 The secretary of housing and urban development, Mel Martinez, said the money would be released next week, after Congress reviews the spending plan. The money is being provided through the Community Development Block Grant program. 
 "It's the largest single grant in the history of our department," Mr. Martinez said in an interview. "We worked hard to get it out as quick as we could. The focus is on economic development, with a particular emphasis on small business." 
Of the $700 million, $396 million is earmarked for loans and grants to small businesses. The next largest portion, $250 million, is to provide incentives for companies to stay in Lower Manhattan or relocate there. 
New York could, for example, provide a loan or a grant to a company that signs a long-term lease or agrees to hire a certain number of workers.
State officials estimate that the attack disrupted more than 10,000 businesses and displaced 377,000 workers, forcing many relocations. Some investment banks and law firms moved to Midtown or to New Jersey.
Federal officials said the grant also included $25 million for planning and design and up to $14 million for administrative costs.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, praised the Bush administration for moving quickly to release the money, provided in an appropriations bill signed by President Bush on Nov. 26. 
"It's really vital to the city's future, and it will have a big bang for the buck," Mr. Schumer said. "It could be the difference between life and death for many small businesses and nonprofit organizations, and it will help the city retain larger businesses."
Federal housing officials said they expected to approve another Community Development Block Grant for New York within two months. It would provide $2 billion for similar purposes. But before approving that grant, a federal official said, the Bush administration must resolve "a lot of controversial issues," including the amount to be provided as cash assistance to individuals and the amount to be spent on housing.
In the days after the terrorist attack, Mr. Bush said the federal government would provide $20 billion in aid to New York, and he reaffirmed that pledge last month. But so far, Mr. Schumer said, the federal government has come up with only $11.2 billion. That sum includes the two community development grants, as well as money spent on disaster assistance by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, said the $700 million was "just a down payment" on what was needed to revive the city's economy and keep residents and businesses in Lower Manhattan. She and other New York lawmakers said they would press for more federal aid.
Recognizing that New York's problems were unlike those spawned by any other disaster, Congress allowed the administration to waive laws and rules that usually apply to the community development grants. For example, federal law says that at least 70 percent of the money in a community development grant is to be used for activities that benefit people with low or moderate incomes. Secretary Martinez said he had waived that requirement.
"Lower Manhattan certainly doesn't fit that profile," he said.
Under a normal grant, a state must distribute the federal money to local government agencies, which then spend it on various activities. Administration officials waived this requirement, so that Gov. George E. Pataki and the state government can, if they wish, carry out such activities directly in New York City.
Mr. Pataki unveiled a proposal for spending the money in December. The proposal for use of the $700 million was devised jointly by state and city officials, with advice from citizens and businesses affected by the Sept. 11 attack. But they have not reached a consensus on what to do with the trade center site.

HEADLINE: Bush's $2 Trillion Budget Links Dollars to Deeds 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
The $2.13 trillion budget plan that President Bush will send to Congress on Monday for the first time formally assesses the performance of government agencies and programs and to some degree links their financing to the grades they receive, administration officials say.
 Based on an internal review conducted by the White House Office of Management and Budget, the budget gives uniformly poor marks to all the major cabinet departments in five categories of management, including personnel and finances. It singles out programs within departments for praise, criticism and corresponding spending increases or cuts. 
 The Department of Energy's fossil energy research and development programs were judged ineffective and duplicative and had their budget slashed to $58 million from $101 million, a 43 percent reduction. The Agriculture Department's system of 5,600 county field offices was rated ineffective and had its budget increase limited to about 2 percent, or $59 million, probably not enough to keep pace with inflation. 
But the National Weather Service's hurricane and tornado warning program was deemed highly successful, and the administration will seek a budget increase for it of $32 million, or 4.2 percent.
The effort grew out of a campaign promise by Mr. Bush to make government more accountable for its performance and follows similar efforts in Congress to find ways to measure bang for the taxpayer's buck. 
It dovetails with the ideological push by many Republicans, including Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the White House budget director, to weed out what they consider to be wasteful, duplicative and inefficient programs in their drive to reduce the size of government.
But with the disappearance of the budget surplus, the effort also provided the administration with a justification for freezing or cutting programs to make room for its two priorities, increasing spending on the military in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks and pushing for a new round of tax cuts intended to help the economy.
Although the Pentagon was judged to have serious flaws in all five categories of the management scorecard featured in the budget, Mr. Bush is calling for $48 billion in new spending on the military, the biggest increase since the Reagan administration.
The five categories are personnel, using competition to hold down costs, financial management, using technology to increase efficiency, and matching the effectiveness of programs to the financing they receive.
"Defeating international terrorism and defending Americans in our homeland are imperative duties of the federal government, above and beyond all its other activities," Mr. Bush's budget proposal says. "We must provide for these increases and fund other necessary programs without letting total spending rise unacceptably. We must demand proof of value from programs of lesser priority."
Democrats said the initiative would be viewed skeptically in Congress, where Mr. Daniels's relationships with members of both parties have been strained by his campaign to hold down spending.
Scott Lilly, staff director for the Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee, said that budgeting based on performance was essential and that Congress and the executive branch had been striving to achieve it.
"But the idea that Mitch Daniels has come up with an analytical, objective new standard by which he's going to cut excess spending out of the budget by looking at how well people are doing their work is not credible," Mr. Lilly said.
Other budget experts said the issue was not so much ideological as it was about the longstanding tug of war between Congress and the executive branch over the power of the purse.
"It's a good concept, but there have been an awful lot of things like this tried in the past unsuccessfully," said Bill Frenzel, a former Republican member of Congress from Minnesota who was his party's senior representative on the House Budget Committee. 
"Congress usually sees this sort of thing as a way to distort its priorities," Mr. Frenzel said, "afraid that unfavorable standards will be set for departments that are favorites of certain members of Congress."
The focus on management is one of a number of administration initiatives to hold down spending.
Administration officials said the budget would step up the White House's so far unsuccessful campaign to clamp down on pork-barrel spending by Congress. The budget will identify "earmarks" -- projects focused on a particular district or state at the behest of a lawmaker -- forced on each agency by Congress.
Mr. Bush's plan projects that the government will run a deficit in the current fiscal year of $106 billion and a deficit next year of $80 billion.
Last year, the government ran a surplus of $127 billion. The projected surplus for the next few years has been eaten up by a combination of the tax cut Mr. Bush signed into law last year, the weak economy and increased spending.
In addition to its request for a $48 billion increase for the Pentagon and its call for new or accelerated tax cuts in an economic recovery package, the administration has also proposed doubling the budget for domestic security programs, to $38 billion.
Mr. Daniels has said he wants to hold spending outside of defense and domestic security to an increase of around 2 to 3 percent, well below what Congress has appropriated in recent years.
In assessing the performance of the cabinet departments, administration officials said they had identified management issues that most needed attention and that the poor marks were therefore to be expected. The results were given to cabinet secretaries late last year, and Mr. Bush reviewed them with the secretaries in January.
There were three categories of performance. A green light indicated that a department met all standards for success in that area. The review yielded only one green light: the National Science Foundation's financial management was judged to be up to par.
A yellow light signified that the department had met some but not all of the criteria. The Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Labor and Transportation all got at least one yellow light, as did agencies like NASA and the Small Business Administration.
A red light meant that a department had at least one serious flaw in a category. The Departments of Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice, State and Treasury all received red lights across the board.
After examining its own performance, the Office of Management and Budget gave itself nothing but red lights.
The goal of the scorecard, said Mark W. Everson, the administration official who oversaw its development, was "to bring a private-sector standard into the government."
But administration officials said it was more difficult to assess specific programs for effectiveness and value for money than to review managerial practices in a department. They said their efforts to link allocations of money to performance were still in their early stages.
"The number of programs for which there is enough information to declare them effective or ineffective is still a small minority," Mr. Daniels said. "We hope to stimulate a lot more discussion of that issue through publication of this document."
Mr. Daniels said ideology had played no role in assessing the programs. 
"We followed the facts where they led," he said, noting that a number of initiatives traditionally criticized by Republicans got high marks. He said they included the women, infant and children's program, which provides food to poor women and their babies, and the Job Corps, one of the largest job training programs.

HEADLINE: FORUM IN NEW YORK: FORUM; 
ECONOMIC FORUM SHIFTS ITS FOCUS TO NEW DANGERS

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
The world's most powerful policy makers and entrepreneurs, who have in the past used the World Economic Forum to promote the opportunities promised by technology and borderless commerce, seem more obsessed this year with their endless vulnerabilities.
 In seminar rooms and in the hallways of the Waldorf-Astoria in Manhattan this week, the men and women who once trekked to Davos, Switzerland, to talk about how the Internet could revolutionize life in Indian villages have spent much of the last few days discussing more prosaic concerns: Keeping their corporate headquarters secure, their chemical and biological materials out of the wrong hands, and how to best fight terrorism. 
 While the meals have been opulent -- sushi and cocktails at the Four Seasons, followed by endless courses at Le Cirque 2000 -- for the chief executives and prime ministers, economists and "media leaders" gathered at the World Economic Forum, the main dish is anxiety.
Gone, too, is any post-Sept. 11 reticence about criticizing the Bush administration's war against terrorism and its charting of the economic rules of the road.
Almost every speaker congratulated the United States on how it has fought the war in Afghanistan. But in the next breath, many European and other leading diplomats say that Mr. Bush's use of the phrase "axis of evil" on Tuesday night, to describe Iraq, Iran and North Korea, made them fearful that a superpower on a roll was now looking for trouble. 
The phrase instantly entered the Davos lexicon here and led members of the coalition against terrorism to question whether they had been seduced by the mirage of a new partnership with Washington, only to discover that Mr. Bush planned to run the war his way -- if necessary.
The confrontations have been polite, but not exactly subtle. On Friday morning, no sooner had Secretary of State Colin L. Powell finished a brief discourse about dealing decisively with "rogue regimes," than Javier Solana, the secretary general of the council of the European Union and the former secretary general of NATO, told him that his allies do not just want consultation. They want a real vote, he said. 
"For me, the coalition is a collective ambition to share responsibility, but to share also decision-making," he said.
The sentiments grew more blunt in small-group discussions seeking ideas for both fighting terrorism and "draining the swamp" of poverty that can breed terrorists.
After leading an hour and a half of discussion that produced more sound bites than new policy approaches -- "freeze-dried foreign policy" muttered one human-rights official -- Joseph Nye, dean of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, summed up the message he was hearing. "For the Europeans," he said, " 'axis of evil' was a bridge too far. There's a strong suspicion here that Bush is back to unilateralism, that after Afghanistan, America isn't especially interested in listening to the rest of the world."
Davos was on the road to pessimism even before this year's session. At the last meeting in Switzerland, Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, turned what was supposed to be a rapprochement with Shimon Peres, then the former Israeli prime minister, into an ugly confrontation accusing Israel of "fascist military aggression," that was built on policies of "murder, persecution, assassination, destruction and devastation."
Mr. Arafat is surrounded by Israeli tanks this year, and did not make the meeting. Mr. Peres is scheduled to take part in three sessions today.
Mr. Arafat is not the only one who is missing. Relatively few Japanese executives and just a smattering of government officials showed up. In the past, they came to argue that that they had their economic problems in hand and that their country was on the cusp of a rebound.
Now the numbers look bleak -- on Friday the Nikkei stock average dropped below the Dow Jones industrial average for the first time in 45 years -- and the government's popularity is sinking. So when a panel considered whether Japan would emerge from its difficulties intact, no one made a successful argument that Japan could find its way back for years.
Even without the Japanese, business executives here were in a deep funk. "If you want to talk to negative people talk to C.E.O.'s," said Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, who used to be one, at Alcoa.
But Mr. O'Neill, who once argued that he had his finger on the pulse of the American economy because he made real products sold in real markets, has been in Washington long enough to believe that he now has a truer picture.
Company executives worry incessantly about what could go wrong, but he argued "that is not really reflective of what is going on in the real economy."
For true doom and gloom, though, there was the discussion on Friday about "asymmetric threats," an exploration of whether nuclear, chemical or biological weapons could be used by rogue states or groups.
Some C.E.O.'s wondered openly about whether their factories or laboratories could become victims of theft, sabotage or attack, or, to bring the issue truly close to home, whether they were safe inside the Waldorf.
For all the worry, the protests were nonexistent on Thursday and Friday. On Saturday, some 7,000 protesters gathered for nonviolent marches but there were 38 arrests. 
Ever since the debacle of the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle two years ago, store windows have been shattered and tear gas has been the official odor of meetings of world leaders. But near Park Avenue this week, windows were intact and the strongest smells have emerged from the coffee cups as idle police officers seek a place to stay warm.
Thus, New York bore no resemblance to Genoa, Italy, last summer, which was wrapped with razor wire to protect leaders of industrialized nations for their annual summit. Genoa was a ghost town of empty sidewalks and locked steel grates.
In contrast, traffic buzzed slowly around the East Side, and participants at the conference scooted across Lexington Avenue to pick up a latte at Starbucks. "Look!" said one amazed veteran of recent global conferences, "They've still got windows!"
But if the ranks of the protesters were thinned, so were the ranks of the entrepreneurs.
A few years ago in Davos the world seemed more prosperous and the stars of the show were Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman, and Silicon Valley C.E.O.'s who ran seminars like "Wiring the World," and mixed it up with bureaucrats on the question of whether the Internet would foster so-called virtual democracies -- like-minded people of many lands bringing about change.
This year, the seminars have more down-to-earth subjects, like survival. There was "The Future of Terrorism: What Are the Next Threats?" and "Crisis Management: Look Out Ahead."
Three years ago, Ted Turner entertained the elites with a discussion of how far media conglomerates could reach, boasting that CNN was making national borders irrelevant. Government officials sheepishly agreed.
But now borders are back and being secured. So is the power of government over private enterprise.
On Friday, the subject of one media panel was whether the American military would be within its rights to bomb broadcast facilities of Al Jazeera, the Arab satellite network, if it appeared to be giving aid to the enemy.
Former Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia warned that unlike nuclear material -- which is almost all controlled by governments -- chemical and biological agents are overwhelmingly in the hands of private industry, and that the responsibility should fall on corporations to devise ways to keep such material out of the hands of those who would misuse them.
"We're going to have to have a private sector effort here," he said, noting that if he were in business, "I'd want to get out in front" before the biological version of a Three Mile Island nuclear accident led to the imposition of "regulations that will stifle commerce." 
Then the dispirited executives went to lunch, so that they could brace themselves for the afternoon session, "New Sources of Vulnerability: Thinking the Unthinkable."

 President Bush delivered a passionate opening about the war on terror, then lobbied for budget increases for the military and domestic security. Then he used his first State of the Union address to home in on
the economy, pressing anew for his economic stimulus plan, prescription drugs for seniors, more trade authority and new safeguards for pensions. (He did not mention Enron.) And he called for Americans to commit 4,000 hours to volunteer work over their lifetimes. He was interrupted more than 70 times by applause. But who's counting? David E. Sanger

HEADLINE: Now Who, Exactly, Got Us IntoThis? 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
HERE we go again.
 In an eerie flashback to the savings and loan scandal a decade ago, it turns out that some of the lawmakers and regulators investigating some of the causes behind the Enron-Arthur Andersen scandal -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- may need to look no further than a mirror. 
 Corporate law experts and investor advocates say some of the same people who are now professing moral outrage over Enron's collapse and the $60 billion-plus loss to investors, and who are groping for legislative and regulatory fixes, actually helped create a legal climate for Enron and Arthur Andersen to push the envelope. 
First, in 1995, the group of lawmakers and lawyers pushed successfully for legislation that shielded companies and their accountants from investor lawsuits. Then, five years later, the group succeeded in forcing regulators to dilute proposed restrictions on accountants. The group includes the current chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and three House and Senate committee chairmen now involved in the cleanup who have been among the accounting industry's largest campaign recipients. 
Now, some in the group, like Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, are having second thoughts about their opposition to the tougher accounting rules. Others, like Harvey L. Pitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, say they are beginning to rethink the wisdom of some provisions of the 1995 law.
The law they helped push through as part of Newt Gingrich's Contract With America, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, may prove to be an obstacle to investors as they try to recover tens of billions of dollars from Enron, which has filed for bankruptcy protection, as well as its auditors, lawyers, bankers, partners and others who may have been involved. 
"It was the ultimate in special-interest legislation," said James D. Cox, a professor of corporate law and securities regulation at Duke University.
The law, passed after heavy lobbying from Andersen, the rest of the accounting industry and Silicon Valley, shielded executives from liability for making dubious financial projections. Since its passage, the high-technology bubble has burst and a record number of corporations have restated their earnings, costing investors billions. A study of all earnings restatements -- by Andersen, no less -- found that the largest number of restatements came from companies in California, followed by Texas, Massachusetts and New York.
The law's supporters justified it as a way to eliminate abusive and frivolous lawsuits, although consumer and investor advocates warned Congress that the measure went too far in insulating companies and their advisers and accountants. The law toughened the procedural rules for investors and gave executives legal immunity for making questionable financial projections. It generally eliminated the "joint and several" liability of accountants, which would make their deeper pockets available to compensate investors, particularly when companies have little or no money to satisfy damage claims.
"There were clearly abuses in litigation," said Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America. But that rhetoric "covered a much broader effort to protect the accountants in particular from liability." The 1995 law, she said, "made it not only possible but likely that something like Enron would occur." 
Ms. Roper, along with other corporate law experts, says the law helped to create a culture that led to the Enron-Andersen scandal, and she has little hope that there will be significant reforms. "The people in Washington who made the Enron scandal happen clearly have a credibility problem as the people who will solve this crisis that they helped create," she said. "Most will not acknowledge the role they played in helping to bring it about."
Sarah Teslik, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents many of the nation's largest shareholders like pension funds and labor organizations, agreed. "It is absolutely clear from their record that neither the regulators nor Congress has been looking out for investors," she said.

Influential Friends
One central figure in getting the 1995 law adopted -- over the objections of the S.E.C. and President Bill Clinton -- was Mr. Pitt, the new S.E.C. chairman. As a top lawyer for the accounting industry, Mr. Pitt, in 1991 Senate testimony, laid out what became the first road map for parts of the 1995 law. 
His agenda included getting rid of "frivolous litigation," but in the eyes of its critics it also took aim at many meritorious claims. It included tougher burdens of proof for investors, shorter statutes of limitation, limits on pretrial discovery, limits on liability for accountants, and rules forcing the loser to pay legal costs. Many experts say the fee-shifting rule in particular would have the effect of making it impossible for investors to recoup losses.
While he formally appeared at the 1991 hearing on behalf of the accounting industry, Mr. Pitt insisted that his agenda was not meant to benefit any particular clients but reflected "my own personal views." 
"What you get from me here is my unvarnished view based on both my experience at the S.E.C. and my experience as a private practitioner," he testified, referring to his role as the agency's general counsel in the 1970's. "I would never compromise my own integrity by giving you a view that I think would benefit any individual client. And I would like the record to be clear on that."
In an interview last week, Mr. Pitt said he could not draw any conclusions about whether the 1995 legislation or other laws and regulations he worked on in the 1990's contributed to the climate that led to the failures at Enron and Andersen. But he said it certainly was now a fair issue to examine. He said the law "made sense when it was enacted" but could now use some re-examination.
"I think, in light of Enron, no issues and no potential solutions are off the table," he said, including the possibility that the law "may need rethinking."
"I for one am sufficiently concerned about the things that have occurred and am desirous of getting some effective solutions that I am not willing to exclude any possibility," Mr. Pitt added
"To me, the important thing is to make sure that if investors have been defrauded or taken advantage of, that they have a method of being compensated for illegal acts," he said. Following many Democratic and Republican predecessors, he said that lawsuits by investors "play a vital role" in augmenting enforcement efforts of the commission.
The accounting industry's strong Congressional supporters who wrote the 1995 law included three lawmakers who have now emerged in central roles in investigating Enron and proposing possible new legislation. 
One is Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who now heads the House Commerce Committee and has excoriated Enron and Andersen. Over the years, Mr. Tauzin has been the largest recipient in Congress of Andersen donations, receiving $57,000 since 1989, and, all told, his campaigns have received more than $289,000 from the accounting industry, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. He declined to comment. 
Another is Representative Michael Oxley, the Ohio Republican who heads the House Financial Services Committee and will lead the questioning of Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's former chairman and chief executive, if he fulfills his pledge to appear tomorrow before that committee. Mr. Oxley was also heavily involved in pushing the 1995 act.
Peggy Peterson, a spokeswoman for Mr. Oxley, said the 1995 legislation had achieved its purpose of reducing "frivolous litigation," noting that the number of investor cases has not declined in recent years.
But Professor Cox and other experts say that the number of cases filed is an inadequate measure, and one can just as easily conclude that "a lot of meritorious cases that should have gone forward haven't, particularly in light of the speculative bubble and tremendous number of earnings restatements."
Mr. Dodd, chairman of the Senate banking subcommittee on financial institutions, was a chief sponsor of the 1995 measure. Mr. Dodd, perhaps the accounting industry's closest friend in Congress, went so far as to lobby House members personally to approve the legislation over President Clinton's veto. What made his campaign so politically fascinating was that when he broke ranks with the White House, he was chairman of the Democratic National Committee. 
Last month, Mr. Dodd was among the first lawmakers to say he would introduce legislation "that would address longstanding problems in the accounting industry."
Mr. Dodd's campaigns have received more than $54,000 from Andersen, second in the Senate to Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican and another supporter of the accounting industry, who has received more than $76,000 from accounting firms.
Mr. Dodd said last week that "as a general proposition" Congress ought to re-examine the 1995 legislation as well as other rules in light of Enron, but that he also thought the 1995 law had done more good than harm.
"If the point is to blame what happened on this law, it is totally misplaced," he said. "The goal of the bill was to deter frivolous lawsuits -- not lawsuits, but frivolous lawsuits. And our goal was to not hold one guy totally responsible for something that he may be only marginally responsible for." 
He also attributed the sharp increase in corporate restatements and the sharp decline of Silicon Valley stocks to potential conflicts of interest at auditing firms that did accounting and consulting work for the same clients. "These guys are coming in one door with one agenda," he said, "and running into each other in the hallways."

A Scandal's Progeny
The roots of the current law can be found in the thick of the savings and loan scandal a decade ago. Then, a coterie of accounting lobbyists formed an alliance to head off efforts in Congress that would have made it easier for investors to sue what were then the Big Six (now Big Five) accounting firms.
The group was formed shortly after the Supreme Court handed the S.E.C. and the Justice Department a surprise defeat, closing the court door to investors who said they had been the victims of securities fraud by imposing sharp time limits on such suits. The 5-to-4 decision in Lampf v. Gilbertson immediately raised concern among some lawmakers, who feared it would enable savings and loan operators like Charles H. Keating Jr., who operated one of largest failed savings institutions, to get investors' lawsuits against them dismissed.
Investor advocates and plaintiffs' lawyers mounted an effort on Capitol Hill, led by Senator Richard H. Bryan, Democrat of Nevada, to adopt legislation overturning the Lampf decision, but the accounting group managed to water down that effort.
Despite its victory, the accounting industry was hit hard by the fallout from the savings and loan scandal. The Big Six were forced to pay more than $1 billion in damages to the government from 1992 to 1994 for their role in advising corrupt and mismanaged savings associations.
But the small accounting lobbying group grew in size, sophistication and influence and completely overcame the industry's tarnished image. By 1993, according to records at the Federal Election Commission, the industry's main political action committee was helping to finance more than 300 races in Congress. Each of the Big Six also contributed more than $2 million to finance lobbying for more limits on lawsuits. 
Its lobbying sophistication is evident from internal records that show the group kept comprehensive reports on most lawmakers, including everything from the mundane to the significant. The reports described the lawmakers' key aides and outside advisers, influential constituents and local news organizations, donations from rival political groups, and political vulnerabilities and pressure points. To assist in the lobbying effort, the group also turned occasionally to the lawmakers' personal accountants to pitch for greater restrictions on investor lawsuits.
By 1995, the group had teamed up with interests from Silicon Valley, which as it grew richer was growing more influential. The group's agenda fit easily into the Gingrich revolution's mission of attacking lawyers and the legal system.
Abuses of the system had made investor lawsuits an easy political target, although critics believe Congress used the abuses as a pretext to shield accountants and companies to an unnecessary degree. Some lawyers, for instance, had filed suits with no evidence of wrongdoing.
"In fairness, this is not a Manichaean story where there is all good on one side or the other," said Joel Seligman, an expert on federal securities law and member of the professional ethics executive committee of the American Association of Certified Public Accountants. Still, Mr. Seligman said the combination of a 1994 Supreme Court decision eliminating liability for accountants and lawyers for "aiding and abetting" securities fraud, along with the 1995 act, provided powerful disincentives for policing potential problems.
"Together, what they did for the accounting profession is lower the probability of discovery, raise the probability of not being named a defendant, and increase the probability of the case being dismissed on a pretrial motion," he said.
Others, like Ms. Roper of the Consumer Federation, go further.
"Of course there were abuses in litigation," she said. "But the legislation that was approved was in no way about addressing abuses in litigation, but went much further." She said that if the lawmakers had been genuinely concerned about abuses, Congress could, for instance, have extended, not restricted, the statute of limitations to give lawyers more time to do more thorough investigations before filing lawsuits.
The bill passed the House on March 8, 1995, by a vote of 325 to 99. Only a day earlier, Deloitte & Touche was hit with an $81 million verdict in a shareholder class-action lawsuit that had accused it of malpractice in the audit of Koger Properties, which had collapsed a year earlier.
In the final days of the 1995 session, the Senate also passed the measure, not knowing what the president would do. Mr. Clinton decided at the last minute to veto it, complaining that the standards it set for filling a complaint would be too onerous on investors. But he did little lobbying to prevent an override. On Dec. 22, 1995, Congress voted for the first time to override a Clinton veto.

Changing With the Times?
It is difficult to predict how lawmakers' decisions over the last decade will now affect the thinking on Capitol Hill.
"They are unapologetic," Ms. Roper said, "about their role in writing the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, unwilling to acknowledge the degree to which they created the environment that made Enron possible, and as a result they are unconvincing reformers." 
Arthur Levitt, a former S.E.C. chairman, said "it is appalling" that the clout of the accounting industry may yet keep Congress from adopting meaningful laws.
"The way this may play out is that you will see a wad of bills proposed," he said. "The ones that may have some traction are the ones that don't do much, but allow the members to say they did something."
Ms. Teslik, of the investors group, said it was difficult to forget that "this is the same Congress that said no to Arthur Levitt's reforms."
"If you judge them by their past actions, they have not been looking out for investors," she said. She is concerned that Congress "may try to solve profound problems of auditor independence and corporate governance with Band-Aids."
But Ms. Roper said she had hope that Congress could be moved to adopt meaningful change, just as the savings and loan scandal turned Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, into a supporter of campaign finance reform after he was reprimanded for pressuring regulators to help a contributor, Mr. Keating.
"The members certainly have something to prove -- that the millions of dollars in contributions from the industry hasn't bought them off," she said.

Axis of Debate: Hawkish Words

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
STARTING with his State of the Union address, President Bush bared his teeth toward Iraq, Iran and North Korea for most of last week, labeling them an "axis of evil" and ordering them to stop developing nuclear weapons and put their houses in order -- or else.
 But what, exactly, did or else entail? Why, for example, did the White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, say immediately after the president's speech that no military action was imminent? What did it mean on Friday when Mr. Bush said that he would be "happy" to sit down with North Korea for talks? 
 The contradictions between the hot words and any cooler actions under contemplation seemed to crystallize a longrunning debate over how audacious or prudent the world's leading military and economic power should be in prosecuting a war. The debate has been with the United States in all the years of its superpower status, from Korea to the Cuban missile crisis and through Vietnam. It resurfaced in the Persian Gulf war and has still not died. In that war, the boldness that evicted Saddam Hussein from Baghdad is no longer questioned, but the restraint that left him in Baghdad is. 
Now, a president who once promised a carefully timed, step-by-step strategy in the war on terror has issued a simultaneous challenge to three problem nations -- nations that are not natural allies themselves. Just what the challenge means has been left open to guessing.
Mr. Bush's hot words on Tuesday had the immediate effect of setting off cries of alarm from American allies around the world, as well as exposing the fault lines between the hawks and diplomats in his own administration. Some senior state department officials, for example, didn't find out that Mr. Bush would refer to the three nations as an axis of evil until the rest of America did -- when he uttered the words to a joint session of Congress and before millions watching on television.
The state department officials could take heart that for a half-century now, martial swagger has most often been tempered by negotiations. 
But even if that is the case with this administration -- and Mr. Bush's remark on Friday about talks with North Korea suggests that so far it is -- the debate is still alive. Now the question is whether the president's swagger has helped or hurt support around the world for his cause.
In other words, will the president's language, which is poetry to the hard-liners at the Pentagon, intimidate Iran and North Korea and Mr. Hussein into changing their behavior? Or will the oratory set back a measure of progress, at least in Iran and North Korea?
"Personally, I would love to see them take down Saddam's regime, but I think there is a real danger in this level of rhetoric, given the fact that they don't seem to be ready to back it with any kind of action," said Kenneth M. Pollack, the deputy director for national security studies at the Council on Foreign Relations who served President Bill Clinton as director of Persian Gulf issues on the National Security Council staff.
"If you keep telling people that victory in the war on terrorism will require concessions from Iraq, Iran and Korea," Mr. Pollack said, "you may be locking yourself into a situation where you have to start delivering on some very big promises."
Certainly Mr. Bush's "axis of evil" phrase created no ardor for America among the western allies. "A lot of the Europeans, who are always looking for evidence of how stupid and undiscriminating we are, now feel that they've found it in this statement," said Walter Russell Mead, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. "There's a lot of grave concern mixed with Schadenfreude."
But Mr. Mead said he did not necessarily agree with the Europeans who say that Mr. Bush's words undercut reformers in Iran. The reformers are trying to prevail over hard-liners, who are the ones pursuing nuclear weapons. "I think it reinforces among people in Iran that the cost of confrontation with the United States is heading up," Mr. Mead said.
Similarly, he said, he was not concerned that Mr. Bush's words would derail any talks with North Korea. "I frankly think it's somewhat useless that we're going to make peace with North Korea by soothing their feelings, because there's nothing we can say or do that would truly soothe them," Mr. Mead said.
James R. Lilley, a former United States ambassador to South Korea, agreed with Mr. Bush's use of tough language, even if North Korea appeared to be complying with a 1994 accord to freeze its nuclear weapons program. "It's going to be dicey, and we're going to get a lot of criticism for it," Mr. Lilley said, arguing that it was necessary to put the North Koreans on notice that Americans were serious about cracking down. "They are as cunning and manipulative a people as any I've seen, especially in dealing with Americans."
BY late last week, the administration was busily trying to put the president's words in context, even as Mr. Bush blurted out during a two-day swing through the South that those nations that "don't hold the values we hold dear" (but just who did that include? Saudi Arabia? France?) would now be on a new American "watch list." Condoleezza Rice, the president's national security adviser, pointedly said in a speech the same day that the administration wanted to work with its allies to deal with threats posed by Iraq, Iran and Korea, and made no reference to direct military action.
"They've attempted to walk this back and box it in," said Wesley K. Clark, a retired general who led the NATO alliance during the Kosovo war in Yugoslavia. "It was overwhelming rhetoric."
Mr. Fleischer, in fact, said that Mr. Bush had not meant to compare the three nations to the Axis powers of Germany, Italy and Japan during World War II, and that his words were more "rhetorical" than "historical." Before the speech, Mr. Bush had not publicly commented on the three nations collectively. At the very least, he had never equated the regimes of Iran and North Korea with that of Mr. Hussein, the man accused of plotting to assassinate Mr. Bush's father and whose survival torments Washington a decade after the gulf war.
If there was a central criticism of the president's oratory, it was of the abrupt creation of this new trio, which bewildered diplomats in Washington about what to tell their capitals. Inside the White House, there was of course less confusion. Iraq, after Al Qaeda, is first among enemies there. Administration officials say that while military force is not the way to confront North Korea or Iran, there is an active debate about its use to root out Mr. Hussein.
PENTAGON officials like Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz and conservatives like Richard Perle have continually argued that the United States must stop Iraq, come what may, before it develops nuclear weapons, while Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has emphasized the pursuit of economic sanctions. Mr. Powell has also pointed out that many allies oppose an American war against Mr. Hussein, and that the United States needs allied support for success, whatever method it uses to try to restrain him.
At this point, nobody knows whether Mr. Bush's challenge will ultimately help or hurt him as he prosecutes his war around the world. But a few things are clear: Mr. Bush has sided with the hard-liners in his administration, he has greatly expanded the borders of the fight and he has succeeded in keeping Americans fearful -- and focused -- on a war with ever more difficult and elusive goals.

Money, Energy Politics and Enron's Costly Misadventure in Bombay

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

 BODY:
As the problems of Enron have unfolded, the White House has persistently maintained that no American official did anything specific to help the company when it was heading toward bankruptcy. Apart from evidence that the administration's energy policy was largely consistent with Enron's goals, that claim has gone mostly unchallenged.
 But there was something quite specific that Mr. Bush's top aides did to help Enron last year before the hollowness of the company became clear: they lobbied to avert the shutdown of a $2.9 billion power plant in India built by Enron and two other American partners, Bechtel and General Electric, with some participation by Indian financial institutions. 
 This lobbying was testimony not only to Enron's importance as an investor abroad but to its political influence at home. The company contributed to both Republicans and Democrats. Indeed, it was the Clinton administration that first came to Enron's aid when it was trying to get the plant built in the 1990's. 
The White House has acknowledged that Vice President Dick Cheney and other members of the administration pressed Indian officials last year to pay Enron the money owed to it from the purchase of power generated by the 2,200-megawatt plant, located south of Bombay.
At the time of Mr. Cheney's intercession, Enron's troubles were only beginning to surface; few thought that they threatened the company's future. More specifically, Mr. Cheney is said to have raised the subject of back payments with Sonia Gandhi, widow of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and current head of the once-dominant Congress Party, now the leading opposition party.
If so, Mr. Cheney went to the wrong person. Mrs. Gandhi would have even less room to maneuver than other Indian politicians because of her sensitivity to the issue of foreign influence. Mrs. Gandhi was born in Italy and is acutely aware that her late husband was accused of getting kickbacks from a Swedish arms maker. Any bailout would be complicated by politics. The Hindu nationalist government of Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has been loath to act because doing so would benefit Mrs. Gandhi's Congress Party, part of Maharashtra's ruling coalition.
Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, has said that Mr. Cheney's intervention was appropriate because the United States government held guarantees on loans to the project. But the intervention also carried risks. Politically inspired influence on behalf of American corporations overseas can undermine the credibility of American investment in the developing world. 
That is especially true in India, where a long history of economic exploitation under British rule has left lasting resentments regarding foreign influence. In the 1970's, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi famously ejected Coca-Cola and I.B.M. Only in the last decade has the distrust diminished. The failure of the Enron project, the largest single foreign investment in India, seems to have reawakened the old suspicions and has already caused a decline in investment. 
From the beginning, critics in India warned that the power plant was economically unsound, and there have been suggestions that corruption was involved in the awarding of the contract. The Hindu, a leading Indian newspaper, said recently that "no India-specific shenanigan has yet come to light." But it added that the possibility of malfeasance cannot be dismissed "in the light of voluminous material now available on Enron's unethical behavior in the U.S."
The failure of the Enron plant stemmed partly from the structure of the deal, which pegged the cost of the power to the dollar. The rupee's collapse and other factors made the price too high for Indian customers to pay. In addition, the Maharashtra state government gave free power to customers with political connections, while others simply stole the power from local transmission lines.
The fear now is that the Enron scandal may discourage foreign investment in other parts of the region, including Afghanistan, or may lead countries with such development to suspect exploitation by foreign investors.
This week, President Bush and Hamid Karzai, the interim leader in Kabul, announced steps to revive Afghanistan's economy, including government-backed loans for private enterprise. Some experts fear that private investment in the developing world could be hindered if the Enron scandal reinforces a belief that globalization, American style, is tainted by corruption.
"Fairly or not, the Enron scandal is going to cast a shadow over the prospects for foreign investment in India," says an American diplomat who has been involved in the Enron discussions. "The problems in India are largely of its own making. But rest assured that in India, everyone is saying that these problems were designed and made in Houston and Washington."

HEADLINE: Bush Hires Hard-Liners To Handle Cuba Policy 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
At a time when Cuba is exhibiting increasing signs of reaching out to the United States, the Bush administration is filling its Latin America policy ranks with officials known for a hard-line stance toward Fidel Castro's government.
 Several incoming officials advocate an unyielding hostility toward Cuba and the maintenance, if not strengthening, of a trade embargo that is four decades old. 
 The policy being promoted by people like Otto J. Reich, a Cuban exile who is the State Department's top policy maker for Latin America, is increasingly placing the administration at odds with farmers, business executives and a growing number of members of Congress -- including many Republicans -- who have been pushing for trade with Cuba. But the hard line is still an article of faith among many Cuban-Americans. 
"The Cuban-Americans sense the momentum is moving away from their position quite rapidly, and they're trying to put in some fire walls," said Sally Grooms Cowal, director of the Cuba Policy Foundation, a bipartisan group that advocates an easing of sanctions.
In recent months, Cuba has made gestures that indicate an eagerness to set relations with Washington on a new track. The Castro government has bought more than $40 million in food from the United States; it has withheld criticism of the use of the United States Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay to house captives; and it has offered to increase cooperation on a variety of issues, including drug trafficking and fighting terrorism.
Mr. Castro has invited former President Jimmy Carter, who has been an intermediary between Washington and hostile nations, to visit, said Deanna Congileo, a Carter spokeswoman. He has not decided whether he will go, she said.
Taken together, the moves reflect the most significant outreach since 1996, when Cuba shot down two civilian planes flown by Cuban-American activists and the United States responded by tightening sanctions.
Yet the overtures have fallen flat with the Bush administration.
The State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said this week that the Cubans had no reason to expect the United States to ease its policy. "Since you give me the opportunity," he said, "let me try to disabuse them of this notion. Cuba has not taken any of the steps necessary to make improvement of relations possible."
Cuba must free political prisoners, carry out free elections or otherwise guarantee human rights, Mr. Boucher said. Other officials dismissed Mr. Castro's outreach as part of a ploy to get the United States to bail out Cuba's floundering economy.
In addition to Mr. Reich, a former Reagan administration official and ambassador to Venezuela, the other top diplomat for the Western Hemisphere is his deputy, Lino Gutierrez, a former ambassador to Nicaragua. Both are Cuban-Americans identified with a no-dialogue policy.
Another Cuban-American, Emilio Gonzalez, is a deputy of the National Security Council to handle Caribbean affairs, including Cuba. "Especially Cuba," said Colonel Gonzalez, a former West Point instructor who most recently served at the United States Southern Command in Miami.
On Capitol Hill, Jose Cardenas is taking over the Latin America portfolio on the minority staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. For much of the last decade, he has been a lobbyist for the exile Cuban American National Foundation's drive to preserve sanctions.
The defense of a tough line looms so large, some officials say, that new appointees in Latin American affairs face a litmus test on Cuba. President Bush waved Mr. Reich, the top custodian of Cuba policy for the State Department, into office with a recess appointment last month after Senate Democrats blocked his confirmation on the grounds that he had behaved unethically in the Reagan White House and that he was too partisan.
Mr. Reich was unavailable for comment, a spokesman said. In a speech in November 2000, he outlined his views on Cuba. "Let me say that while popular in some circles, blaming U.S. policy for Cuba's ills is simply wrong," he said. "The Castro regime controls and directs the nature and scale of all foreign interaction with Cuban citizens."
That view is increasingly under fire from farm groups who are eager to sell more of their products to Cuba, and their allies in Congress. Many of the new critics are Republicans who insist the current policy is archaic or self-defeating. 
Representative Jo Ann Emerson, Republican of Missouri, who was reached this week at a conference in Mexico on selling agriculture products to Cuba, said lawmakers' changing views had placed them on a collision course with the administration. "There's no doubt that a majority of our colleagues in the Senate and the House support more trade with Cuba and lifting the travel ban, which is the heart of it all," she said.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE WEEK THAT WAS; 
From Wall St. to Washington, More Aftershocks Radiate From Enron

BYLINE:  By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
Whenever a big earthquake strikes, aftershocks are bound to be felt for months, or years, afterward. So it is with Enron's collapse.
 On Wall Street, the market shuddered after several other companies suggested that they might have exaggerated their own profits in ways that echoed Enron's practices. 
 In Washington, the White House fought to keep from disclosing the substance of contacts Vice President Dick Cheney had with energy industry officials while he was formulating the administration's policy last year; meanwhile, President Bush said he favored changes to 401(k) retirement plan rules, in hopes of avoiding losses like those Enron's workers experienced. 
Closer to the epicenter, Enron's interim chief executive came to Houston, where the company is based, and promised that Enron would return to its roots as a simple energy producer and gas pipeline operator. Unlike just about everybody else, the new executive, Stephen F. Cooper, said he had no interest in what Enron had done in the past. "I'm not going to spend my time here looking in the rear-view mirror," he said.
In California, politicians renewed their clamor for federal regulators to look into whether Enron manipulated energy markets to drive up electricity prices there in 2000.
No one blamed Enron for the wave of mild earthquakes that jostled Southern California last week. But maybe the shakes served to warn how long some people could be dealing with the consequences of Enron's collapse. It turned out those quakes were aftershocks from the destructive Northridge earthquake of 1994.

FEARS OF OTHER ENRONS -- Last Tuesday, the stock market plunged on concerns that hidden financial practices like those that felled Enron could affect other companies, particularly in energy and in banking. Williams, Tyco International, WorldCom, Cendant and PNC Financial shares, among others, sank sharply.
"It's the cockroach theory," one analyst said. "There's never going to be just one company that because of accounting practices or excessive debt levels will be a problem."
The market later made up most of the losses because of emerging signs that the economy is starting to improve, but doubts about the quality of reported earnings continued to worry investors.

LEGAL SHOWDOWN -- The General Accounting Office, an arm of Congress, said it would sue the White House to try to force Mr. Cheney to release documents describing contacts between corporate executives and the Bush administration's energy task force. Among those who met with Mr. Cheney was Kenneth L. Lay, the former chairman and chief executive of Enron. The White House vowed to resist, saying that getting candid advice from outsiders depended on privacy.
On Friday night, the Justice Department also ordered the White House to preserve records of contacts between government officials and Enron executives over the past three years.

A NEW LINE IN THE SAND -- The accounting industry, which has repeatedly failed to uncover corporate abuses, sought to reassure investors that it would change certain practices that might have contributed to Arthur Andersen's flaws in monitoring Enron's financial practices.
Several of the major accounting firms said they would no longer provide some kinds of consulting services to clients whose books they audit. All except Deloitte & Touche said they would also stop performing both internal and external auditing functions for the same company.
Andersen remained on the defensive; its chief executive, Joseph F. Berardino, said his firm was likely to lose business because of the scandal. 
Some critics said that lawmakers and regulators should not let the firms' proposals stand in the way of establishing tougher rules that would prohibit accountants from selling any consulting services to the companies they audit and that would require companies to rotate auditors every few years.

STAND BY YOUR MAN -- Linda Lay, the wife of Mr. Lay, went on NBC's "Today" program to defend her husband's reputation. In a carefully orchestrated public relations blitz in advance of Mr. Lay's scheduled Congressional testimony tomorrow, Mrs. Lay said that her husband was betrayed by executives working for him. "Not for one second would he have allowed anything to go on that was illegal," she said.
From a richly decorated room of their $7 million Houston penthouse, Mrs. Lay also claimed that her family had been financially ruined by Enron's collapse. "There's nothing left," she said. "Everything we had mostly was in Enron stock."
Later in the week, public records and people close to the family revealed that Mr. Lay's son, Mark, and his sister, Sharon, had also had extensive business dealings with the company.

PINNING THE BLAME -- As lawmakers prepared for a wave of Congressional hearings this week that are expected to feature former top Enron executives being forced to publicly defend their actions, there were new revelations about when and how the company's board was informed of some practices at the heart of the collapse.
One senator said that Enron was refusing to cooperate with his committee's efforts to obtain crucial records of the partnerships that helped bring the company down. Lawyers for Enron said they were doing what they could to comply.

PRESERVING RETIREMENT -- Mr. Bush offered a proposal that no company be allowed to require workers to hold company stock contributed to their 401(k) plans for more than three years; some businesses now insist that employees retain the stock much longer.
The plan would also require, without saying exactly how, that companies protect employees against losses during "lockdown" periods when no sales can be made. The president's plan is somewhat more limited than the approach favored by some Democrats in Congress.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: DIPLOMACY; 
In Visit to U.S., Kuwaitis Support Action on Iraq

BYLINE:  By JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
A group of prominent Kuwaitis visiting the United States has delivered an unusual message of support for American policy and values.
 The delegation of 11 Kuwaiti parliamentarians, human rights activists, former officials and academics closed out a weeklong trip to Washington and New York on Friday with a meeting at the Council on Foreign Relations and a visit to ground zero. They said that President Bush's victory in Afghanistan had helped give them the courage to challenge Islamic fundamentalists in their own country. 
 Muhammad Jassem al-Saqer, a former publisher and now chairman of the Kuwaiti Parliament's foreign affairs committee, applauded President Bush's vow to act against Iraq, Iran and North Korea for developing weapons of mass destruction. He called Iraq "the richest and most dangerous state in the region" and said his conversations with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz and other senior officials in Washington had convinced him that President Bush was determined to act against Saddam Hussein. 
"The clock is ticking," Mr. Saqer said. "The later you move, the more dangerous he becomes."
Ahmad E. Bishara, an engineer and a co-founder of a liberal political party, urged the United States to stand by Arab individuals and groups that favor democracy, secularism and enhanced human rights. The September attacks, he said, were a "defining moment" for the Arabs in that they "set the stage for diverse, vibrant discussion" and intellectual confrontation between Islamic fundamentalists and "the majority of Arabs who stand for human rights."
"You've got to stay and get engaged with us," said Faisal al-Mutawa, a prominent businessman and another co-founder with Mr. Bishara of the liberal National Democratic Movement. "We want to privatize Islam rather than make it part of the purview of the state. Religion is between everyone and his God."
Islamic militants in Kuwait and elsewhere in Arab countries, he said, were trying to "re-engineer Islam to suit their own objectives." 
Education, he added, badly needed reform, and Arab schools did not graduate students with skills that modern economies require: "These students are unemployable because all they know is a few verses of the Koran."
Fouad Ajami, a professor of Middle Eastern studies at Johns Hopkins University who moderated the panel's discussion, said in an interview that the delegation's visit and its open identification with American policy showed that Washington's victory over the Taliban in Afghanistan "has emboldened liberals and secularists." 
He added: "It has given them the nerve and the self-confidence to try to retrieve the ground they have lost to the Islamists and extremists over the last decade."
That boldness was evident in the Kuwaitis' call for action against Iraq. It was also evident in Mr. Saqer's endorsement of a "secure Israeli state next to a viable Palestinian state." Mr. Bishara said America's message was not "getting through" to the Arabs because American officials still preferred talking to Arab governments rather than directly to their citizens. "Don't talk to the regimes, but to the Muslim people," he suggested.
Professor Ajami said the United States government was "understandably suspicious" of Arab civil society since many media outlets, private associations, and other nongovernment institutions had been taken over by Islamic militants hostile to American policy and values. 
Dr. Saad bin Tifla al-Ajmi, a former Kuwait minister of information and now a lecturer at the University of Kuwait, accused Arab governments of fomenting a "culture of terrorism" by having abdicated mosques and charitable institutions to the Islamists.
Those institutions had to be reclaimed, Mr. Bishara said, however unpopular that would be. 
Islamists in the Kuwaiti Parliament had denounced the delegation's visit and accused the Kuwaiti government of encouraging the trip. But Lulwah Saleh al-Mulla, secretary general of the Women's Social and Cultural Society, said that the delegates had paid their own way and that they had decided themselves last fall to make the trip.
"We came out of love," she said, "and to express our gratitude to the United States for having liberated us" in the 1991 Persian Gulf war against Saddam Hussein.
Because of that searing experience, many Kuwaitis have greater respect for America than do other Arabs in the Gulf and Arab states. Even so, the Kuwaitis said, America needed to do more to show that it would remain engaged in the battle for human rights and dignity. In 1991 in Iraq, as one of them put it, "you came, you bombed and you left."

HEADLINE: For a Not-So-Private Citizen, All the World's Still a Stage 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
He has been a private citizen for a month now, but the world still regards him as synonymous with New York City. He is known simply by his first name, though out of habit and respect, he is still called Mr. Mayor. Crowds and television cameras still swarm around him at every opportunity -- perhaps now more than ever.
 Rudolph W. Giuliani is still everywhere. 
 In recent days, Mr. Giuliani has been a star at the World Economic Forum. He accompanied leaders of the forum to ring the bell at the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday morning and later spoke, along with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki, at the forum's opening event. 
In between, he met privately with the mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delanoe. And on Friday, Mr. Giuliani appeared on two different World Economic Forum panels, including one with the director of homeland security, Tom Ridge, and many corporate executives.
On Tuesday, Mr. Giuliani attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Battery Park City. (Mr. Bloomberg was also there.) Last week, Mr. Giuliani led members of the United States Conference of Mayors on a tour of ground zero. (Mr. Bloomberg was in Washington that day.)
During the Super Bowl today, Mr. Giuliani will appear in a 30-second Monster.com commercial in which he will thank America for helping New York after the Sept. 11 attacks. He was not paid to appear, but Monster.com is making a $350,000 donation to the Twin Towers Fund, which he controls. 
With few exceptions, modern mayors of New York City have left office only because voters tossed them out. Even Fiorello H. La Guardia and Edward I. Koch, who each served three full terms and were regarded as two of the most popular mayors, left City Hall after the electorate had tired of them. 
But the events following Sept. 11, and term limits barring him from seeking re-election, have put Mr. Giuliani in a situation unprecedented for a former mayor: he is as popular now as he ever was in office -- and in even greater demand. 
"The media demand for him comes from South America, Australia, China, all of Europe; it is literally international and it is unsolicited and relentless," said Sunny Mindel, the former mayoral communications director, who continues to serve as Mr. Giuliani's spokeswoman. 
Add to all this Mr. Giuliani's strong endorsement and support of his successor, and the situation gets even weirder: Mr. Giuliani still seems to be dominating the stage and -- at least for now -- Mr. Bloomberg does not seem to mind. "There are a lot of people in this city to whom his presence means a great deal," Edward Skyler, Mr. Bloomberg's press secretary, said of Mr. Giuliani. "And for good reason. The man did an incredible job." 
Some aides, however, have grumbled privately that they do not understand Mr. Giuliani's proclivity for showing up at events where the objective was clearly for Mr. Bloomberg to shine. Mr. Bloomberg's aides are not publicly revealing concerns. Several noted, however, that some positive publicity Mr. Bloomberg has received -- particularly for the openness of his administration -- has come to a certain degree at the expense of Mr. Giuliani. 
They also noted that many of Mr. Giuliani's public appearances had been perfectly understandable. He helped, for example, bring the World Economic Forum to New York and now that he is working in the private sector he has a legitimate interest in meeting more people in the corporate world. 
Fred Siegel, a historian and senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington, said he expected Mr. Giuliani to remain in the limelight and Mr. Bloomberg not to fret over it. "There is no precedent for leaving office like that," he said. "Let's look back: La Guardia is dying; O'Dwyer is fleeing; Impellitteri is an interim mayor; Wagner is so tired; Lindsay is utterly discredited; Beame is a monumental failure; Koch -- from 1933 we have to go all the way up to Koch -- Koch leaves, he's on television he's on radio, he doesn't go away." 
Several of Mr. Giuliani's former aides said they were impressed that he had refrained from publicly commenting on Mr. Bloomberg or city affairs. When Mr. Bloomberg put plans for new baseball stadiums on hold, Mr. Giuliani did not weigh in. Nor has he commented on Mr. Bloomberg's meeting with the Rev. Al Sharpton. 
"Who would have thought that the man who was so undisciplined in office -- and commented on everything -- could be so disciplined once he left office," a former senior Giuliani aide said. 
Mr. Giuliani, of course, is busy enough. His schedule has quickly filled with lucrative speaking engagements even as the former mayor's closest aides struggle to start up his new consulting business, Giuliani Partners. 
Last month, Mr. Giuliani went to California, where he appeared on "The Tonight Show"; promoted an HBO movie about the days after Sept. 11; campaigned for his friend William E. Simon Jr., who is seeking the Republican nomination for governor; and attended a benefit for the Twin Towers Fund. 
Later this month, Mr. Giuliani will go to England, where he is to be knighted by the queen, tour Parliament, visit with Prime Minister Tony Blair and raise more money for the fund. (Because he is not a British subject, he cannot use the title Sir Rudy.) He is also scheduled to visit the Netherlands to give a speech and go to Germany to receive an award. 
In the months ahead, he is booked to speak at several conventions and events. Next week, he is to be the keynote speaker at the International Builders Show in Atlanta, and over the weekend there is a fund-raising event for a Jewish group in Miami. In March, he is scheduled receive the Ronald Reagan Freedom Award from Nancy Reagan. In April, he plans to give speeches in Washington, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma and Texas. And the first of two books he has agreed to write is due out in the spring.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE FORMER CHAIRMAN; 
His Influence Lost, Lay Prepares to Answer Questions in Washington

BYLINE:  This article was reported by David Barboza, Don Van Natta Jr. and Jim Yardley and was written by Mr. Yardley. 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
The last time he appeared before Congress, Kenneth L. Lay did not lack confidence. In May 1996, his company, the Enron Corporation, was the emerging force in the energy business, and Mr. Lay was its apostle. His testimony, calling for opening electricity markets to competition, was part lecture, part sermon.
 The lawmakers that day were deferential to a man whose campaign donations had helped elect many of them. Enron, Mr. Lay boasted, was "one of the new breed," and those who opposed him represented "the threatened status quo." Follow Enron, he promised, and "we will unleash a new era of productivity and creativity." 
 "The vision I have in mind," he said triumphantly, "will have a dramatic impact on every household and every business in America." 
For his next appearance, scheduled on Monday before a Senate subcommittee, Mr. Lay will face a panel eager to pulverize him. Mr. Lay, 59, is now deposed and discredited, and Enron's collapse into bankruptcy, with its Shakespearean themes of greed, ambition and arrogance, has become a corporate scandal rippling into the highest reaches of Washington politics.
Mr. Lay, who resigned last month as the company's chairman, is expected to provide his first public explanation of what went wrong at Enron and to describe his own role in the collapse. His critics are portraying him as a greedy corporate chieftain who brazenly used enormous campaign contributions to push his deregulatory views on politicians in Washington and in state capitals all over America. A scathing report released yesterday by a special committee of Enron's board said that Mr. Lay bore "significant responsibility" for the breakdown of controls and ethics at the company.
But an examination of how he spent the last three decades rising in business and accumulating political influence reveals that Mr. Lay is too complicated for caricature. He can be avuncular and unpretentious, a religious man once admired by his employees and revered in Houston, his adopted hometown, for his civic leadership.
But he also has huge ambition and energy; he wanted to change the business world, and to do so he could be ruthless and petty. He was a demanding boss who, if not always immersed in details, created and condoned a cutthroat corporate environment that spun out of control.
"Ready, fire, aim," went the joke colleagues often told about Mr. Lay's approach as a young executive.

Politics, Cut With Business
The constant theme in Mr. Lay's career over the last three decades is his understanding of the symbiotic relationship between business and politics and his willingness to aggressively play the game.
His famous friendship with the Bush family helped establish him as a man politicians needed to know. He never hesitated to sprinkle money to generate good will, whether through political contributions to two-thirds of the members of Congress, or through gifts to charities and nonprofit groups in Houston, the sort of giving that corporate image makers call "reputational capital."
Mr. Lay, temperamentally a Republican, directed three of every four dollars Enron contributed to Congress to the Republican Party. But he dabbled with Democrats, too. In Houston, after an incumbent congressman irritated downtown business leaders, Mr. Lay led the fund-raising efforts to help elect a little-known challenger, Sheila Jackson-Lee, now one of the most liberal Democrats in Congress. He worked in the 1992 campaign of former President George Bush, and the next summer was playing golf with the man who beat him, Bill Clinton.
"He was pretty pragmatic in who we ought to support," said his longtime lobbyist at the Texas Statehouse, George Strong. "He thought we should support who was going to get elected."
He did not hesitate in trying to exert his influence on those he helped elect. When Mr. Strong ran into problems in the Statehouse, he often asked Mr. Lay to call the governor, George W. Bush. With Mr. Bush's ascension to the presidency, Mr. Lay had a private meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney on the administration's energy policy and was an important supporter of the appointment of a fellow Texan, Pat Wood, as chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
"The Enron and Ken Lay stories are best told in an English literature class, or a classics class where you are trying to explain what hubris is all about," said Bill Burton, a Houston lawyer and former Clinton administration official who has known Mr. Lay for 10 years. "The classic Greek story of Icarus -- a pretty classy guy, he had these big moral aspirations, then he tries to do too much, and he tries to fly too close to the sun."
Mr. Lay's scheduled Monday appearance comes more than 30 years after he first went to Washington as a bright young man following his favorite economics professor at the University of Missouri. The professor, Pinkney Walker, had been appointed to the Federal Power Commission, the forebear of F.E.R.C., and he contacted his former student about becoming his assistant.
The son of a Baptist lay preacher and sharecropper, Mr. Lay grew up humbly in rural Missouri before the family moved to Columbia, a university town. He worked his way through college and told Mr. Walker upon graduation that he needed "to make some money." When Mr. Walker later approached him about going to Washington, Mr. Lay was working at Exxon and was uncertain about leaving.
"Hey, Kenneth," Mr. Walker recalled telling his protege, "what if this had their blessing?" He said he called the chief executive of Exxon and explained the benefits of having a former employee working for such a powerful regulatory agency. "They liked that," Mr. Walker said.
For Mr. Lay, it would be his first lesson on the nexus of business and politics. He became indispensable at the commission, arriving every morning by 6, organizing the daily agenda. He got noticed and later was an under secretary at the Interior Department, specializing in energy issues, before he was hired as a vice president by Jack Bowen, the chief executive at the Florida Gas Corporation.
When Mr. Bowen left for Transco, a larger gas company in Houston, Mr. Lay eventually became a top executive at Florida Gas and began lobbying in Washington for the deregulation of the natural gas industry and laws allowing the interstate transport of gas. By 1981, his first marriage had disintegrated, and Mr. Lay, who would later marry his secretary, Linda, began looking for a change.
He contacted Mr. Bowen, who again hired him, this time as president and chief operating officer at Transco. Mr. Bowen welcomed him to Houston, and Mr. Lay joined the clubby social circle of oil executives and other business leaders that included, by extension, James A. Baker III, then chief of staff for President Ronald Reagan, and George Bush, then the vice president.
"At first, I would have considered him more of an introvert than later on," said Robert A. Mosbacher, a Houstonian who became commerce secretary when Mr. Bush became president in 1989. "He sat back and listened more than he talked. And he obviously learned a lot."
Mr. Mosbacher introduced the new man to his friend, the vice president, while Mr. Bowen took him on business trips to Washington that included meetings with Mr. Bush. "I remember somewhere along the line mentioning to Bush that he was a can-do kind of guy who would like to do some work for him and the Republican Party," Mr. Mosbacher said.
A long-time Republican Party fund-raiser from Texas said Mr. Lay "was one of the people Mosbacher brought into the political fund-raising world. Mosbacher showed him how it was done."
At first, other fund-raisers recall, Mr. Lay was awestruck that a preacher's son from Missouri was rubbing elbows with the vice president of the United States. He eventually became a natural.

The Creation of Mr. Houston
Mr. Lay's political ascent coincided with his growing stature in the Houston business community. He joined Houston Natural Gas in 1984 as chief executive and adroitly maneuvered himself and his company when it merged with a larger company, Internorth, based in Omaha. He emerged as chief executive and earned $4 million in stock options. The company that would become Enron was born.
Mr. Lay was an aggressive executive, pushing for new deals, fast. A former Houston Natural Gas executive recalled that the firm once sold a chemical company in a weekend. "One joke went, 'Linda is pregnant,' " the executive recalled. " 'How long is it going to take?' Ken would ask.
" 'Well, nine months, Ken,' " the joke continued. " 'That's unacceptable,' Ken would say. 'Can you do it in six?' "
Mr. Lay was never a screamer and was always polite. But he was hardly soft. "It's Ken's way or you're out," the executive said. "We flew on some trip, and I read a nonbusiness book. And he looked at me and said, 'How can you do that?' Well, I never did that again."
Mr. Bush's 1988 presidential victory meant Mr. Lay could count as a friend the most powerful man in the world. "The velocity of his political ascent was pretty dramatic," one friend, a Washington lobbyist, said.
That ascent was fueled by the campaign contributions Mr. Lay began giving to both parties in Texas and Washington, as well as his sheer friendliness. Mr. Burton, the Clinton administration official who is now a Texas energy lawyer, said, "He quickly figured out how the game in Washington was played."
Mr. Lay became co-chairman of President Bush's re-election campaign in 1992 and chairman of the Republican National Convention in Houston that summer. When Mr. Mosbacher stepped down as commerce secretary, Mr. Lay's name came up. He could have had the job, too, a friend said, but he wanted to stay at the helm of Enron.
Mr. Bush's defeat altered the political landscape, but as Mr. Lay's golf game with Mr. Clinton attested, he adjusted quickly. He built a Washington lobbying office that by the end of the decade would employ more than 100 people. Despite such a huge staff, Mr. Lay preferred to meet with cabinet members or senior White House aides in private.
"Ken would stroll in alone, and that was the exception," Mr. Burton recalled. "He did not need an entourage, and it was one of the things that impressed us about him."
Mr. Lay needed political power because Enron was trying to rewrite the rules of the energy business. By 1992, Mr. Lay wanted to dominate the natural gas market and was also calling for the deregulation of the electricity market, a political fight that meant taking on the entrenched public utilities. Enron itself was evolving, becoming less a traditional pipeline company than a Wall Street-styled trading operation that believed energy could and should be traded like stocks, bonds and futures.
The federal government opened the door to deregulation in 1994 but, in doing so, shifted much of the debate to individual states. In Texas, another Bush was rising, with Mr. Lay's help. Mr. Lay gave generously to George W. Bush's 1994 upset victory and, with Enron, has contributed nearly $575,000 to the younger Mr. Bush's political races. The company has also donated $1.9 million in soft money to the national political parties, of which $1.5 million went to the Republicans.
The pre-eminent issue in Texas for Enron was electric deregulation. The debates began in the Texas Legislature in 1993, but deregulation was not approved until 1999. Mr. Lay stuck with it all the way. "When we needed some help with the governor or the governor's office, Ken would make the calls," Mr. Strong, the former Enron lobbyist, recalled.
Enron's influence on Mr. Bush's politics included his failed 1997 effort to revamp the state tax code. Mr. Bush's original plan, which would have cut taxes for companies like Enron, was based on a proposal by Charles Walker, a former Reagan Administration official then on Enron's board. Another Enron executive, Richard Kinder, helped conduct public hearings on the issue.
In the midst of it all, Mr. Lay was emerging as Mr. Houston, partly because of the money he had spread over the city. He became chairman of the United Way, and Enron became its biggest supporter. He helped lead the campaign to persuade voters to approve new taxes to build a football stadium and a baseball stadium that would become Enron Field, and convinced former President Bush to make a personal appeal in a commercial.
He also was willing to get personally involved in certain races. In 1994, he worked to defeat a Democratic member of Congress, Craig Washington. Mr. Washington was a folk hero among black politicians in Houston, but he had angered business leaders, particularly by voting against an appropriation bill for the NASA space center in Houston. Local Democrats say Mr. Lay became the de facto finance chairman for Mr. Washington's opponent, Ms. Jackson-Lee.
"He made it acceptable for people in the business community to give money in the Democratic primary against an incumbent for Congress," a local Democratic consultant said. "That usually wouldn't be done."
One local politician said Mr. Washington's defeat by Ms. Jackson-Lee sent an unmistakable message: Do not mess with Ken Lay.

Friends Can't Stop the Fall
The presidential campaign of the younger Mr. Bush began to focus national attention on Mr. Lay. He became one of the early "pioneers" who raised more than $100,000 for the campaign, and he eventually placed Enron's entire political action committee behind Mr. Bush.
Mr. Bush's victory immediately brought speculation that Mr. Lay would be appointed to the cabinet. Colleagues dating to his days at Houston Natural Gas say Mr. Lay harbored such ambitions, and two of his friends say that Mr. Lay wanted to be Treasury secretary.
"I don't think it was ever seriously considered by the president and vice president," one of the friends said, noting that the new administration already had three Texas oil men, Mr. Bush, Mr. Cheney and the designated commerce secretary, Donald L. Evans. 
But Mr. Lay, one associate said, was still "the best positioned guy in America" on Inauguration Day. Enron's stock was soaring, and his candidate had become president. Little could he have imagined that the slide of Enron, and the disintegration of his own political power, had already begun. Perhaps, as Mr. Lay is expected to argue on Monday, he had spent so much time politicking, wielding influence and building his civic legacy that maybe he did ignore his company at his own peril.
If anything, associates agree, Mr. Lay has always understood a fundamental rule of politics, namely that contributions make friends of elected officials. But those same contributions, and the potential taint they carried, made Mr. Lay politically radioactive when he began secretly asking administration officials for help in bailing out Enron. The answer was no, and even Mr. Bush, who used to call him "Kenny Boy," suddenly began describing him as "a supporter."
"I feel sorry for him," said Mr. Strong, the former lobbyist who was fired with a two-sentence letter. "On the other hand, I'll be real mad if I find out he not only knew about this but lied to employees."

HEADLINE: Gore Rebukes Bush, and Tries to Mend Fences at Home in Tennessee 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
Declaring that "I intend to rejoin the national debate," Al Gore re-emerged in his home state tonight and unleashed a searing critique of George W. Bush's policies on issues from the economy to the environment to campaign finance to health care.
 While he did not waver from his steadfast support for the White House's handling of the war, this speech was the first in which Mr. Gore has derided Mr. Bush's programs since they faced off in what was perhaps the most contentious presidential competition ever. Mr. Gore even invoked former President Bill Clinton -- whom he steered clear of for much of the presidential campaign -- in accusing Mr. Bush of squandering the last administration's economic successes. 
 "Not long ago, our economy was very strong because we made the right decisions, decisions that reflected our values," Mr. Gore declared at a fund-raising reception here for the Tennessee Democratic Party. "Whatever anyone wants to say, I believe Bill Clinton and I did a good job on the economy. But now, our economy is back in recession, an unbelievable $4 trillion in projected surpluses have disappeared in a single year and public investments in priorities like job training, school construction and health care are once again being slashed." 
On the environment, Mr. Gore said, "They're trying to open up the most beautiful and pristine wilderness in Alaska."Noting that a campaign finance reform bill would have been his first priority as president, Mr. Gore did not cite the Enron debacle but said pointedly, "We need campaign finance reform to stop the ever growing, alarming examples of too much buying access and influence in Washington, D.C."
After more than a year of virtual political seclusion, Mr. Gore sounded tonight as if he were back in the heat of a campaign against Mr. Bush. But he told the crowd here what he has told friends: "whether or not I will" run "as a candidate in 2004, I don't yet know." 
This event was the first of what Mr. Gore's advisers say will be dozens of appearances around the country for candidates in November's elections. The speech left no doubt that the former vice president wants to keep his options open. If he runs in 2004, his candidacy could not be dismissed. After all, he won the popular vote in 2000, and he is far better known than the other Democrats with designs on the White House.
In appearing before more than 1,000 Tennessee Democrats, who paid $25 a head for pretzels and chips and to hear Stella Parton, Dolly's younger sister, at the Renaissance Hotel here, Mr. Gore was also taking a vital step if he decides to try for a rematch: convincing Tennesseans that he is still a viable candidate.
"I live this state with all of my heart and soul," he said.
Yet the hurdles for Mr. Gore extend beyond making amends in Tennessee, which he lost to Mr. Bush by a humiliating four points. Although he almost became president, and while his supporters in 2000 credit Mr. Gore for delivering a gracious concession, many are eager for a fresh candidate. And, close race or not, many Democrats argue that Mr. Gore should have swamped Mr. Bush.
In the Senate alone, several Democrats who backed Mr. Gore in 2000 are already preparing their own campaigns for the party's nomination. Even senators who are not running are openly critical, even dismissive, of their last standard-bearer.
Senator Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota, for one, laughed uproariously when asked about supporting Mr. Gore again.
"Al Gore lost North Dakota by 28 points!" Mr. Dorgan said. "The entire ticket went down with him in North Dakota. When you lose by 28 points, that's a megalandslide."
Asked about Mr. Gore's prospects, Mr. Dorgan said, "I don't hear anybody say much of anything about Al Gore."
Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana said about Mr. Gore: "Things change. In politics, it's here today, gone tomorrow. It's a whole new scenario right now. You have to be likable before they can vote for you."
Even Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, who is so close to Mr. Gore that the former vice president held a fund-raising event for him in the fall, is not ready to commit to him again. 
"We have to see what the lay of the land is," Mr. Harkin said. "It would be harder for him because he's not the sitting vice president."
Mr. Harkin said that if Mr. Gore ran, he would have to contend with his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, who announced this week that he, like Mr. Gore, had established a political action committee to help candidates this year. Mr. Harkin said he was skeptical of Mr. Lieberman's promise not to run if Mr. Gore does.
"Joe has said if Gore runs, he won't run," Mr. Harkin said. Asked whether he took Mr. Lieberman at his word, Mr. Harkin replied:
"Don't know. It's easy to say that now. But when the fever hits you, you don't know."
The primaries may be two years away, but the presidential contest is under way, with possible contenders traveling to important states and assembling staffs. The most aggressive have been Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, Senator Lieberman, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, who made his first presidential prospecting trip into New Hampshire this weekend. 
The Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, has not taken steps toward running. But many leading Democrats are encouraging him.
In an interview, Mr. Daschle said that Mr. Gore "would be the front-runner" if he made the race and "deserves to be in the mix." But Mr. Daschle added that there would be many other formidable candidates.
Mr. Gore still has steadfast supporters who argue that he is far more popular among voters outside Washington than inside. 
"In the base of the party, there's still a great deal of support for Al Gore, and in Washington there isn't," said Mitchell Berger, a top fund-raiser for Mr. Gore in 2000 who said he would back him again. "When I worked for Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, nobody in Washington wanted them. Currently, a similar thing is going on with Al Gore."
Steve Hildebrand, a strategist in South Dakota who ran Mr. Gore's campaign in Iowa in 2000, said: "We would be foolish to not want someone as qualified as Al Gore to serve our country. He is still the most qualified individual out there at a time when the economy is in question and international affairs are of great concern. He is still deeply beloved by activist Democrats and regular Democrats."
Indeed, Mr. Gore drew fervent ovations from the party loyalists here tonight. "I don't think there's anyone else that would make as good a leader as he would," said David R. Harper, chairman of the Macon County Democratic Party. "I think he's ready to go."
Mr. Harper's wife, Carol, said she was disappointed that Mr. Gore waited until tonight to resurface. 
In his speech, Mr. Gore conceded that "some disagreed with my choice to withdraw" from policy debates until now. But he said, "I thought it appropriate given the nature of the election."
Many Democratic strategists said the move by the Democratic Party last month to advance the primary schedule by a month in 2004 would benefit Mr. Gore, who is far better known than the other prospects. That could be particularly helpful for Mr. Gore in a large field, where he would be assured of a minimum of support, while his opponents might split the rest of the vote. 
The strategists also argued that if Mr. Gore appeared to gain steam, naysayers would happily climb back on board for his candidacy.
Still, despite all his advantages, even Mr. Gore's advisers agree that he would have a more arduous climb to the nomination than when he was vice president and had the resources of the White House and President Clinton -- albeit the baggage of Mr. Clinton as well -- at his disposal.
Mr. Gore has failed to engender deep support from many past backers. Several top strategists from 2000, including Michael Whouley, Robert Shrum and Ronald A. Klain, have been talking to other Democrats who plan to run in 2004. At a recent strategy session that fund-raisers for Mr. Gore held at Mr. K's, an expensive Chinese restaurant in downtown Washington, six people showed up.
Even among Democrats who are willing to support Mr. Gore again, there seems to be rather tepid interest in a Gore candidacy. Several people said they would back him if he ran. But they were not willing to encourage Mr. Gore to run.
Orin Kramer, an investment manager in New Jersey who was a top fund-raiser for Mr. Gore in 2000, has been eyeing other candidates. 
"Until people declare that they actually want to run for president," Mr. Kramer said, "people like myself have the liberty of waiting. It's easy for people to interpret that they're all falling off the wagon. But the process in 2000 was enormously expensive and tremendously emotionally draining. So there's a natural inclination for people to sit back and not be engaged."
But Mr. Kramer was not about to publicly distance himself from Mr. Gore. He said he was raising money for Mr. Gore's political action committee. He also said he would have traveled here for the event, "if I did not have a longstanding ticket to take my son to the Nets-Raptors game." 
Several of Mr. Gore's backers said the former vice president had been tarnished by his connection with Mr. Clinton. They contended that he might be more of his own candidate if he ran again.
"The country was against him because of Bill Clinton," said Representative Norm Dicks, a Washington Democrat who was one of Mr. Gore's most ardent backers. 
Saying he could still envision a President Gore, Mr. Dicks invoked Richard M. Nixon's comeback. "You think about Nixon, who lost in '60 and then came back and had, I wouldn't say a great presidency," Mr. Dicks said. "But he got elected twice."
Although Mr. Gore's intentions are unclear, one certainty is that he is not devoting himself full time to politics. He is a vice chairman for Metropolitan West Financial Inc., a financial services company in Los Angeles. He teaches at several universities, and he is writing a book about family with his wife, Tipper.
Mr. Gore's advisers said the first crucial step if he were to run again would be to improve -- and solidify -- his political position in Tennessee. 
Mr. Gore was the first presidential contender to lose his home state since George McGovern lost in South Dakota in 1972 and was trounced in a national landslide by Nixon.
"Obviously," Mr. Harkin said, "if he had carried his own state, he'd be president today. You can't just lose your home state, for gosh sakes."

HEADLINE: Porto Alegre Journal; 
A Leftist City Makes Money to Its Own Drummer

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: PORTO ALEGRE, Brazil, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
Few people here were surprised when organizers of the meeting to counter the World Economic Forum in New York told the World Bank and other pillars of the global economic establishment they were not welcome. It was just another expression of anti-globalization sentiment in this socialist stronghold in southern Brazil.
 The meeting here, the World Social Forum, is an opportunity for Porto Alegre's leaders to swap ideas on containing global capitalism with representatives of the European and American left. 
 The participants run the gamut from members of Brazilian fringe groups in ragged outfits to polished members of the European Parliament. 
Olivio Dutra, a former Porto Alegre mayor who is now governor of Rio Grande do Sul State, denounced the "dehumanization" of the economy in a raucous opening speech.
This city of 1.2 million offers a complex view, though, of how the fortunes of developing countries are intertwined with international economic activity. Porto Alegre developed into a socialist center in the 1980's, when Brazil's military government was preparing to hand over power to democratically elected representatives. Its large number of organized civil servants helped the Workers Party to win control of the city.
Few places in Brazil are more enmeshed in the global economy, though.
General Motors makes compact cars here, and Dell Computers assembles PC's. Telefonica of Spain controls wireless communications. British American Tobacco produces cigarettes nearby, and John Deere assembles tractors. Porto Alegre is also home to Brazilian multinationals like Gerdau, a steel producer with plants in the United States; Taurus, a maker of handguns, and Varig, the airline.
As a result of investments by those companies, this city has the nation's lowest urban unemployment rate, though it is still high at 15.1 percent. Beyond a city center of old high-rises is an extensive system of parks and plazas. Poor districts that started as shantytowns mostly have paved roads and treated water. Crime is a concern -- gunmen were thwarted in an attempt to rob an armored car this morning in front of the building where the forum was taking place -- but it has not reached the level of larger Brazilian cities. 
"The city has little exotic appeal because we're far from the archetype of what people expect from Brazil, but it's a decent place to live and work," said Marcelo de Almeida Fleck, a researcher at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul.
Companies choose Porto Alegre because of its location as a gateway to the pampas, stretching into Argentina and Uruguay, two important markets. Another reason is a relatively well-educated and prosperous citizenry.
With its economy so dependent on interaction with the rest of the world, it is no surprise that socialist politicians here tread a fine line between vociferous critiques of globalization and subtle efforts to lure foreign investment and financing. 
Mr. Dutra learned this strategy the hard way at the start of his term as governor in 1999 when the Ford Motor Company dropped plans to build a factory in Porto Alegre after he refused to honor his predecessor's promise of more than $400 million in incentives.
The poorer northeastern state of Bahia quickly reached a deal with Ford, its 1,500 jobs went there and Mr. Dutra's popularity declined.
Since then his administration has largely focused its policies on supporting small- and medium-sized businesses and on agriculture in the interior, where state police were encouraged to avoid confrontation in land seizures by the Landless Workers Movement.
"We have tried to protect the DNA of our economy, which is not the large multinational but the small businessman and farmer," Mr. Dutra, a former bank clerk who sometimes dons traditional gaucho clothing for public events, said in an interview.
Hard-liners aligned with him have locked horns with followers of Mayor Tarso Genro of Porto Alegre, Mr. Dutra's main rival in the socialist Workers Party. Mr. Genro, a lawyer who backs a more market-friendly type of socialism, has shown an interest in challenging Mr. Dutra in the upcoming gubernatorial election.
Rio Grande do Sul, with a population of more than 10 million, has long been a Workers Party redoubt. With presidential elections this year in which the Workers Party candidate, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, is leading in the polls, the rivalry here is troubling party leaders.
Recent corruption charges against associates of Mr. Dutra involved in an effort to legalize electronic gambling have further tarnished the party's image. "The party stands a fair chance of losing here in presidential elections for the first time since 1989," said Rosane de Oliveira, political editor of Zero Hora, Porto Alegre's main newspaper. "Its support among the middle class is not what it used to be."
Serving as host to a forum that excludes the World Bank has not prevented local officials from showing pragmatism in some instances. The state government has drawn on $170 million in World Bank loans to improve roads and alleviate rural poverty. Mr. Genro's municipal administration has received $76 million from the Inter-American Development Bank to improve water sanitation in poor neighborhoods, widen roads and develop bicycle paths.
The socialists were able to secure the financing by agreeing to contain budget shortfalls. Mr. Dutra, who halted a privatization process initiated by the previous governor, has resisted pressure to raise government salaries and pensions. Mr. Genro says he has controlled city spending through "participatory budgeting," a system of close coordination with community associations.
Not everyone is convinced of the socialists' effectiveness. As a counterpoint to the World Social Forum, the Institute of Business Studies, a nonprofit organization supported by large companies, organized their own Liberty Forum here last year to discuss market-oriented strategies for dealing with social problems.
"The thinking of the left is authoritarian and stagnant," Jorge Gerdau Johannpeter, a steel executive and vocal critic of the Workers Party, said at the event. 
For others, like the 300 families from the National Housing Struggle who occupied an abandoned office building during the World Social Forum, Workers Party politicians are not radical enough. 
"There is no realistic housing policy for poor people," said Ancelmo Schwertner, one of the group's coordinators.

HEADLINE: McGreevey Struggles to Cope With a Budget Shortfall He Inherited 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
Across-the-board budget cuts, the layoff of more than 1,000 state workers and a freeze in state aid to New Jersey cities and towns announced during Gov. James E. McGreevey's first two weeks on the job have suggested that much of his first year in office will be defined by the state deficit.
 But despite all the publicity that Mr. McGreevey's belt-tightening has generated, the cuts announced so far will save less than $200 million -- roughly one-fifteenth of the deficit he must eliminate by June 30. 
 So as Mr. McGreevey tries to fix this year's $2.9 billion budget gap and cope with next year's shortfall -- which may reach $6 billion -- he must now confront three uncomfortable and politically volatile options: increased borrowing, increased taxes or huge layoffs and program cuts. 
Mr. McGreevey has refused to discuss details of his budget plan before he addresses a joint session of the State Legislature on Feb. 11. But finding short-term solutions may be easier than finding long-term ones: Wall Street financial analysts and Mr. McGreevey's budget advisers say there is a reasonable chance he may be able to solve this year's problem without having to resort to any of those measures. The next year's budget is a different story.
New Jersey grew so prosperous during the past decade, when the pharmaceutical industry flourished and the Wall Street boom enriched the state's 45,000 residents who work in financial services, that several of the state's special revenue funds now have hundreds of millions of dollars in reserve. Mr. McGreevey's budget team is poring over the treasury records of all 80 of the funds, and several, like the unclaimed personal property trust fund and the retired employees health care fund, are likely to be tapped to close this year's deficit, administration officials say.
The governor may also seek to divert contributions from the unemployment insurance fund to pay for the state's Family Care program for low-income families. Such a move might allow him to cut $300 million or more from expenditures.
But if Mr. McGreevey uses those one-shot solutions now, they will not be available for the budget year that begins on July 1, thereby depriving him of easy answers. That means the effort to close next year's budget gap will involve more difficult choices, and explains why Mr. McGreevey has taken so much trouble to remind the public that he inherited the deficit from Republicans.
His options are further limited by his own words. Mindful that New Jersey's last Democratic governor, Jim Florio, was run from office for pushing a steep tax increase, Mr. McGreevey made a campaign promise not to raise taxes. He has been also been unrelenting in his criticism of former Gov. Christie Whitman for increasing state debt, calling it "irresponsible" and "immoral."
Republicans were quick to condemn Mr. McGreevey last week when he acknowledged that he planned to authorize the state to issue bonds against its part of the tobacco settlement. By issuing a tobacco bond, New Jersey will be able to quickly recoup part of the $7 billion the state is scheduled to be paid over the next 25 years, but at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars in interest.
Counting the proceeds from that proposed bond issue, Mr. McGreevey's budget team has tentatively identified possible ways to bridge about two-thirds of next year's $6 billion gap, administration officials said on Friday. But the challenge of getting those measures through the State Legislature, and finding an additional $2 billion in revenues or spending cuts, will test Mr. McGreevey's skill at cutting both budgets and deals, according to municipal finance experts.
"We're soon going to see the painful decisions," said Richard Marino, an analyst for the bond rating agency Standard & Poor's. "One way or the other, there's going to have to be agreement on what direction to go and what are the appropriate spending levels."
If the last week is any indication, the road to any such agreement will be bumpy. Mr. McGreevey last week escalated his criticism of Republicans, calling their budgets "fraudulent" and comparing them to the C.E.O.'s of Enron, who have been accused of concealing their company's frail financial condition before it went bankrupt. Administration officials said they were simply keeping the public informed about the dire financial information Mr. McGreevey discovered upon taking office.
"It's important to explain to the public the scope of the problem, a problem of historic proportions," said Jo Astrid Glading, the governor's chief of policy and communication. "And explaining how we got here is part of that."
Republicans, from legislators to former Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco, strenuously deny the suggestion that they misled the public or ignored warning signs about an imminent decline in tax revenues. They blame the deficit on the combined effect of the national recession and repercussions of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
But even many of those who disagree with Mr. McGreevey acknowledge that it is politically shrewd for the governor to remind people that he did not create the budget problem he is now scrambling to solve.
"He's laying the groundwork for doing something unpopular and wanting to shift the blame for it," said Larry Weitzner, a Republican political consultant.
The questions remaining are how many unpopular things Mr. McGreevey will be compelled to do and which ones he will choose.
The administration is considering several low-impact measures to increase revenues. By refinancing New Jersey's debt, Mr. McGreevey can take advantage of the current low interest rates and cut the state's debt service costs. An increase in a variety of fees the state charges individuals and businesses could also bring tens of millions of additional dollars to the state treasury.
The administration may also call for a tax amnesty. Although Mr. McGreevey has expressed reservations about the idea in the past, he has grudgingly begun considering it, his staff members say, because the plan could raise more than $200 million.
The governor's advisers are also reviewing a plan to encourage New Jersey's Blue Cross to privatize, as it has in several other states, because the company would then be obligated to spend $40 million on health care, thereby reducing the state's health care costs.
While those initiatives will not come close to fixing next year's $6 billion shortfall, administration officials say Mr. McGreevey is committed to holding firm on his no-tax-increase pledge, although he recently revised that promise by saying that he was referring only to the income and sales taxes. New Jersey imposes more than 30 taxes.
Despite persistent reports to the contrary, the administration is not currently considering any possible increase in the gasoline tax, Mr. McGreevey's aides said.
There are, however, serious discussions under way about possibly suspending, or significantly reducing, the New Jersey Saver property tax rebate program, which is scheduled to cost nearly $1 billion next year, officials said. Any such move would probably encounter stiff resistance from Republicans. New Jersey's property taxes are among the highest in the nation, and Mr. McGreevey's decision not to increase aid to municipalities is all but certain to raise levies in some communities.

Who Can Part The Red Tape? Who Knows?

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
HERE it is, the most widely whispered line of the month: "We need a Moses."
 "We" is New York City; Moses is Robert, the domineering master builder from a less democratic era in the city's history. 
 Mr. Moses comes to mind increasingly as New Yorkers look to the rebuilding of the World Trade Center site and wonder how it will ever be accomplished, given clashing agendas and a large and ever-growing cast of characters, not one of them a leader with the kind of power and authority it will take to bring order to fragmentation, vision to necessity. 
A latter-day Moses could do it -- a sensitive Moses, if that is not a contradiction in terms -- with the vision to realize that there is more at stake than constructing an appropriate memorial and putting up new buildings. There is the larger task of reinventing a strategic section of the city.
"This is a major opportunity for the city to engage in planning on a scale that has only been matched a few times in our history," says Kenneth T. Jackson, a Columbia University historian who is president of the New-York Historical Society. "I think of the grid in 1811, which affects the whole future of the city because that, in a sense, sets up Union Square, Madison Square, Times Square -- because that's where Broadway crosses the avenues.
"I think of the laying out of Central Park. I think of Lincoln Center and, in some ways, the United Nations. Whether you like them or don't like them, you can certainly see they have influenced people's lives for at least a half-century or longer."
"WTC: Monument," a collaboration between the Skyscraper Museum and the Historical Society that is set to open tomorrow at the society on West 77th Street, is a reminder of the more phantasmagoric plans in the 1960's for Lower Manhattan. One model shows elaborate clover-leafed exits from the Brooklyn Bridge, underground highways, a green, traffic-free mall surrounding City Hall, the Municipal Building and Tweed Court traffic-free mall surrounding City Hall, the Municipal Building and Tweed Courthouse, and the Moses proposal for a Lower Manhattan expressway running across Broome Street and connecting the Holland Tunnel with the Williamsburg and Manhattan Bridges.
That plan was never built, and the expressway, which would have destroyed neighborhoods, was fiercely opposed and ultimately discredited. But the model, along with others in the exhibit depicting early versions of the trade center site and Battery Park City, sure showed vision.
NOBODY wants a Lower Manhattan Expressway, but people were thinking big," Mr. Jackson said. "If we miss this opportunity, we won't get it again. It's like Central Park. If they'd waited 25 years, it would have been too late. There are moments in time when you have to act."
It's not as if there aren't imaginative ideas around. Architects and planners are talking about restoring Greenwich and maybe Fulton Streets, interrupted by the trade center, about building more housing and improving mass transit beyond restoring the destroyed subway and PATH stations. The financial district has long suffered from inaccessibility compared to Midtown. Now, says Daniel Doctoroff, deputy mayor for economic development, might be the time to fix the problem by linking the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North to Lower Manhattan; Metro-North would be extended from Grand Central Terminal, and the Long Island from the Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn.
"It's something that deserves serious discussion," Mr. Doctoroff said. "Everyone agrees we have to think more broadly about transportation and zoning."
But who makes the decisions when so many people are involved? Consider the list so far: Survivors of the victims of Sept. 11; Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg; the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the land; Larry A. Silverstein, who bought control of the trade center complex two months before the attack and is already planning to rebuild 7 World Trade Center; the 11 members of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, 7 appointed by Mr. Pataki, among them its chairman, 79-year-old John C. Whitehead, and 4 by former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani; an advisory panel to the development corporation that includes several state and city politicians; more advisory panels to be appointed by Mr. Whitehead; neighborhood representatives; and assorted interested parties from editorial boards to academicians.
Robert Moses in his prime would have pretty much ignored all those players and done as he wished. Nobody would defend that today. But more than a few New Yorkers are asking if there is something halfway between a willful master builder and decision (or indecision) by committee.

Another Decade, Another Plan For Redeveloping Rockaways

BYLINE:  By SARAH KERSHAW 

 BODY:
On a Friday afternoon in the spring of 1964, Peggy and Albert Thomas stood on Beach 66th Street in Queens and watched, heartbroken, as a wrecking ball demolished their first home, the big white house with a wraparound porch.
 The Thomases were among the thousands of people whose houses and beachside bungalows were condemned and then torn down in the 1960's, as the city promised to rebuild a proud but decaying stretch of the Rockaway Peninsula. 
 But decades passed, and plan after plan for what is the city's largest tract of undeveloped waterfront land was drawn up and then abandoned. Now, almost 40 years after the houses were leveled, 308 acres in a neighborhood called Arverne remain empty, except for tumbleweeds and trash, prostitutes and wild dogs.
"It was a utopia out here," Mrs. Thomas, 65, said recently, standing on the vacant lot where her home once stood, not far from the housing project where she has lived since the house was razed. "But they came along, and they decided to destroy the Rockaways." 
In December, city officials unveiled a new plan to develop part of Arverne, a $350 million, 2,300-unit housing development called Arverne by the Sea, with a school, a day care center and a small shopping mall. The project is to be built on about 100 acres by a Long Island developer, Benjamin-Beechwood. Construction is scheduled to begin in June, and discussions are under way about what to do with the remaining 200 acres of Arverne, with a meeting scheduled for this week between Rockaway officials and the Bloomberg administration.
The project, described on the developer's Web site as "The Dawn of a New Day," is the scaled-down reincarnation of an earlier plan to develop all 308 acres, which collapsed when the real estate market crashed in the late 1980's and the developer, Forest City Ratner Companies, pulled out.
Despite the feeling among many people on the peninsula that the land is jinxed, city and state officials say they are confident that the project will move forward and that the 11-mile Rockaway Peninsula is on the threshold of fundamental change.
They say the plan, which would move ahead in phases, is less ambitious and more realistic than previous ones. And this time, they say, Rockaway, which is now represented for the first time by elected officials from the peninsula who are in Congress and on the City Council, is not going to fall off the radar screen.
Audrey I. Pheffer, a longtime state assemblywoman has lived for 45 years in Far Rockaway, on the peninsula's eastern end, which is home to some of the city's most destitute residents. "Every time you say something is going to happen in Arverne, people laugh," she said. "This time I believe it -- well, I believed it every other time, too -- but I've been here a long time, and I see real change. I couldn't have told you that 10 years ago."
But as often as some Rockawayites, as they call themselves, sound optimistic, others agree with Jean Berrios, a resident of the sprawling Edgemere Houses in Arverne, considered by many to be the roughest housing project on the peninsula.
"Rockaway is dying," said Mrs. Berrios, who moved into Edgemere in 1969, after her house near the beach was torn down. "We have been promised so many things that I can't even list them. We have no stores. Nobody invests here. We don't have a check-cashing place. Can you imagine? No place to cash a check."
Arverne is a neighborhood of 15,000 people on a peninsula of 110,000. Above it, between the Atlantic Ocean and Jamaica Bay, are the hulking housing projects -- the Edgemere and Arverne Houses. In all, there are more than 5,000 units of public housing on the eastern end of the peninsula, one of the city's highest concentrations of public housing.
The vacant land, owned by the city, made headlines in December when a pack of wild dogs attacked two joggers on the Boardwalk in Arverne, critically injuring a 74-year-old man. Stray dogs, along with mosquitoes that breed in the swamps near the bay, remain a major problem.
Residents say they have fought for years for more aggressive dog-catching and pesticide-spraying programs, saying these problems have come to symbolize the longstanding neglect of the eastern end of the peninsula. Unemployment is as high as 30 percent in some neighborhoods there, one in four people receive public assistance and the public schools are among the worst in the city.
There are no major supermarkets in Arverne. Most residents take one or two buses or a taxi to Beach 116th Street on the west end, or they do their grocery shopping on Long Island. Across the peninsula, residents complain about the dearth of major stores.
Transportation ranks as one of the residents' greatest concerns and was seen as a major obstacle to at least one of the grander plans for Arverne, the $1.2 billion Destination Technodome, which included a roller coaster, indoor ski slope and about 20,000 permanent jobs for Rockaway residents. The only subway that stops in Rockaway, the A train, takes at least an hour to reach Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. Various plans for ferries to Manhattan have fallen through, and the Long Island Rail Road line that once ran between Rockaway and Manhattan was abandoned decades ago.
Arverne, a popular resort for beachgoers in the late 1800's and early 1900's, was condemned and cleared under a federal urban renewal plan that was intended to help the city rebuild the neighborhood from scratch.
Between the Depression and the 1960's, as the entire Rockaway Peninsula began to lose its lure as a tourist destination, Arverne deteriorated badly, historians say.
After the houses were razed, factories and other major employers, including companies that made paper, curtains and bicycles, left the peninsula. The movie theaters and department stores that had once bustled in Far Rockaway were shuttered, too, leaving almost every block either empty or lined with boarded-up buildings.
The decline of the east end was also the beginning of a deep economic and racial divide on the Rockaway Peninsula, with largely white, middle- and upper-class people living on the west end and largely poor black and Hispanic people living on the east, though the area has a few affluent enclaves. 
Many residents consider the Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge, which connects the peninsula and mainland Queens at about the middle of the Rockaways, as a kind of Mason-Dixon line.
Some of the contrasts between the two ends are stark. There is the gated community of Breezy Point, with a pristine private beach, and million-dollar homes in Neponsit. In Arverne and Far Rockaway, there are the housing projects, soup kitchens and crumbling shanties. Public School 114, in Belle Harbor, is ranked as one of the top city schools. About four miles away, in Arverne, Public School 42 ranks at the bottom.
And some people view what happened to Arverne -- or what did not happen -- as a major factor in the east-west division, saying that if there were anything there to bring the two ends together, there might be a semblance of unity. 
"You have to have the experience of rubbing elbows," said the Rev. Sean G. Ogle, until recently the pastor of St. Mary Star of the Sea, a Roman Catholic parish in Far Rockaway. "It's sad to see how many people say they've never been to the other end. And I do think that the hole in the middle of the peninsula generates the separateness."
(The west end of the peninsula, where many firefighters and police officers live, mostly in Breezy Point and Belle Harbor, has had its own share of troubles in recent months. Almost 100 residents from the west end lost their lives in the Sept. 11 terrorist attack, and two months later, an American Airlines jet crashed into a residential block of Belle Harbor, killing all 260 on board and 5 people on the ground.)
The latest development plan has stirred some criticism from Arverne residents, who say that building housing -- with homes for middle-income buyers and expected to be priced from $250,000 to $500,000 -- will do little to ease the troubles of the surrounding neighborhood.
"Just to have new homes here is not going to do it," said Desmond Bailey, president of the Arverne Civic Association, a contractor who said he sends his two youngest children to a private school in Brooklyn because the neighborhood elementary school is so troubled.
Officials involved in negotiations over income requirements for potential residents of Arverne by the Sea say a debate is brewing over whether to provide subsidies for low-income home buyers from the neighborhood or, in order to bring more working families and middle-class people into the neighborhood, restrict the development to households with an annual income of $50,000 or more.
But even among the loudest skeptics, there is a stronger sense of optimism about Arverne than most people can remember feeling.
Since the Technodome project was declared dead last year, the political landscape has changed, small developers are building -- and quickly selling -- one- and two-family houses in Arverne and other neighborhoods, and community and civic groups have been gathering to discuss their stake in development plans.
Representative Gregory W. Meeks, who in 1998 succeeded the Rev. Floyd H. Flake in the Congressional district that represents southeastern Queens and the Rockaways, is from Far Rockaway. James Saunders Jr., a newly elected city councilman, lives in Arverne and is chairman of the Council's economic development committee.
"There's definitely a new sheriff in town," said Curtis L. Archer, who took over in 1998 as executive director of the troubled Rockaway Development and Revitalization Corporation, the peninsula's only economic development group.
Mr. Saunders, one of those scheduled to meet with Bloomberg administration officials this week to discuss the fate of Arverne, said, "Everything you can do wrong has been done here." But, he added, the latest plan "will go forward precisely because so many others have failed."

HEADLINE: FORUM IN NEW YORK: NOTEBOOK; 
One Hand Upholding The Law

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

 BODY:
A red minivan had lurched east across Fifth Avenue into the shadow of St. Patrick's Cathedral, which was lighted by the moon and hundreds of lights directed by the police.
 For a moment, it seemed as if the van would not stop. But it came to a halt in front of the raised hand of Police Officer Tell Beharry on Friday night. 
 A woman lowered the van's tinted window and spoke with all the breathless urgency of an underling trying to rush her boss to an important meeting. "I have the prime minister of Serbia in the car," she said. "Please let us through." 
For a time, all the millions being spent on security for the five-day World Economic Forum came down to Officer Beharry, 25 and still in the Police Academy. He did not flinch, consulted his superiors and spoke in a sparse, courteous tone.
Then the van pulled to the side and its occupants got out, wrapping coats around their credential-clad bodies. It became evident that Zoran Djindjic, the prime minister of Serbia, was being made to walk the two blocks to the Waldorf-Astoria. 
"I am the only dignitary here in New York who is without bodyguards," Mr. Djindjic said in broken English, trying to put the best face on an embarrassing moment. "I don't have anything to fear and because of that I am walking free."
As for Officer Beharry, he was glad he didn't just submit under pressure, even when confronted by a world leader. "Safety is paramount," his superiors had told him.

It's Not 1968 San Francisco
Did the protesters outside the Waldorf-Astoria accomplish anything? Did the world leaders notice them? Or have their ideas been co-opted by the mainstream? Those questions, and others, were on the minds of some inside the hotel.
"Somehow, the protesters are in this phase of being more interested in being able to complain than to help," said Jaron Z. Lanier, a computer scientist from TriBeCa and a forum participant who said he holds protests as one of the most precious parts of the American tradition.
"The world inside is so much more like the way the people on the outside wish it would be than they realize," Mr. Lanier said yesterday, brushing his dreadlocks from his face. "This meeting has really opened up."
The current anarchists do not realize their own importance, Mr. Lanier said. They have not articulated a clear point of view.
"You have to do the work of thinking about what to do," he said. "I just feel like this is a lazy movement. It is sort of like saying, 'We don't like it and it's not our job to figure out what to do. Instead, it's your job to make us happy.' It's like little kids and it really bothers me. This is totally different than other protest movements."
Oscar Holenweger, the president of Tempus Private Bank Ltd., in Switzerland, looked over the thousands of protesters on Park Avenue Saturday and shook his head.
"I protested against the Vietnam War as a student in 1968, in San Francisco," Mr. Holenweger, 56, said. "There we had a cause."

High Finance: A Few Bucks
Money, it seems, quickly runs short when you are a police officer assigned around the Waldorf. 
Take Officer Michael Fantroy, 32, annual earnings $36,000. Officer Fantroy was good and hungry yesterday when he went inside the Delmonico delicatessen. He studied the soda case, picked up a one-liter bottle of Mountain Dew but put it back. Then he picked it up again. "I had a 20 this morning," he said. "I got four kids and a wife and a mortgage to pay. I had breakfast; now I have a 10."
All weekend, the police have heard protesters rail against such global issues as third world debt, international capitalism and the pillaging of rain forests by the rich. It was small comfort for them to know that some also protested the officers' pay, or lack of it. One of those was Frank Lang, 42, a sculptor from the Lower East Side, who stood in the throng Saturday and held a homemade sign that read, "More pay for NYPD."
"Police in suburbs get at least 20 percent more pay than police in the city, and that doesn't seem fair to me," Mr. Lang said. "Mayor Mike could give them a raise right out of his own pocket, not to mention all those people in the Waldorf."
Officer Fantroy, who has five years on the job and usually patrols the subways in Queens, bought a ham and cheese sandwich and the soda. Maybe, he said, he never should have left his $47,000-a-year job at the post office. If the police do not get a raise soon, he may have to resign, he said.
"I still got $2," he said, stuffing his change into a pocket. It was 11 a.m., eight hours before his shift ended. Maybe he could get coffee later.

HEADLINE: 'Saving' Wild Salmon's Bucket-Born Cousins 

BYLINE:  By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: ALSEA, Ore., Jan. 30 

 BODY:
There are wild salmon in rivers across the Pacific Northwest, fish that spawn in gravel beds and grow in the rushing fresh water. Then they head deep into the Pacific Ocean before journeying back to spawn -- and die -- in the streams where they were born.
 There are also salmon that complete a similar voyage, though they are born in and return to a different place, a government-run hatchery. Spawned in plastic pails, raised in concrete pools, they are the majority in many Northwestern rivers now, as their wild cousins battle extinction. 
 But because the wild and hatchery salmon are of the same species, they are at the heart of a legal battle over the issue of extinction, and of just how much should be done to protect and restore the habitat that wild salmon need to spawn. The question is this: What is the difference between wild fish and hatchery ones? 
Absolutely none, say some critics of the Endangered Species Act, who contend that federal fish regulators have wrongly looked only at the condition of the wild salmon to determine whether fish in rivers like the Alsea, here in the Oregon coastal range, should be considered threatened. A federal judge largely agrees with them, ruling in September that regulators "arbitrarily and capriciously" treated the Alsea's wild and hatchery salmon differently when listing the wild fish as threatened.
The ruling, by Judge Michael R. Hogan of Federal District Court in Eugene, Ore., is being appealed. But it has prompted the Bush administration to announce a thorough review of the listings for two dozen groups of Pacific salmon and steelhead (another kind of fish, capable of returning to sea after spawning) in other Western rivers and to consider new rules that would factor in the strength of hatchery stock in designating species as endangered.
Meanwhile, the property-rights group that prevailed in the first round of the fight here is opening a new front this coming week, filing a lawsuit to block protections for fish in the Klamath River basin, where enraged farmers were denied irrigation water last summer to protect the wild fish there. The group's initial suit was intended to overturn logging restrictions that had been put in place to safeguard the salmon.
Environmental groups say that if the ruling is upheld, it could fundamentally alter the intent of the Endangered Species Act.
"It is supposed to protect creatures in their natural habitat, in the wild," said Patti Goldman, a lawyer for Earthjustice, an environmental group involved in the lawsuit.
"Otherwise," Ms. Goldman said, "it's like we're saying that lions in zoos are exactly the same as lions in the Serengeti."
Her opponents are happy to use the same analogy.
"That just seems to make our argument, because they're both lions," said Russell C. Brooks, a lawyer for the Pacific Legal Foundation, a private group that litigates on behalf of property rights. "Whoever is making this statement, I'd certainly challenge them to go stick their head in the lion cage in the zoo, because that lion is just as wild as the lion in the jungle. It's the same species."
Indeed, the two types of coho salmon at issue here are the same species, capable of interbreeding when a hatchery fish veers into the habitat of a wild fish, or vice versa. Nevertheless, the growing reliance on hatchery fish raises questions about the long-term health of the salmon population. Hatchery fish are more genetically similar to each other, and they are also more prone to mass outbreaks of disease.
At the Alsea fish hatchery here, run by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, where nearly half a million fish are raised each year, the hatchers are quick to point out that hatchery fish were never intended to replace the wild fish.
"They can complement, but they can't replace wild fish," explained Tim Schamber, the hatchery manager, taking a break the other day from harvesting eggs from winter steelhead, a magnificent gray fish with a shimmering rainbow collection of colors in its scales.
"You can run into a real genetic bottleneck for future fisheries if you do that," Mr. Schamber said, returning to squeezing and pumping fish with air to force the eggs, 3,000 per average female, into a bucket.
But because hatchery fish augment the wild fish and in some cases wind up breeding with them -- the offspring are called "strays" -- it is difficult to make precise biological and physical distinctions between them. For that reason, the National Marine Fisheries Service said Judge Hogan's ruling raised a valid point in questioning why the two fish categories are treated differently.
"The hatchery fish certainly have a role in recovery, and a part to play in an E.S.A. listing," said Brian Gorman, a spokesman for the service, referring to the Endangered Species Act. "It's time that we articulate what the proper role of hatchery fish is when we make a listing."
David Bayles, conservation director for Pacific Rivers Council, an environmental group based in Eugene that is involved in the legal battle, said, "The Endangered Species Act was designed to protect habitat for wild fish, not concrete pools for man-made salmon." 
"In a wild salmon stream, it's survival of the fittest," Mr. Bayles said. "In a hatchery situation, everybody survives, and ultimately you're producing a lot of unfit fish."
But Mr. Brooks, the Pacific Legal Foundation lawyer, said such protections amounted to a "political agenda" that had brought economic pain.
"Our rivers and streams are teeming with salmon," Mr. Brooks said, "yet farmers have been allowed to go bankrupt, businesses are closing and lives are being destroyed while government officials explain away listing fish that really aren't endangered at all."
Among fisheries biologists, there is virtually no support for making hatchery fish the sole source for a river, though in some places, including the Snake River in Idaho and Washington, the returning numbers of wild salmon are so small that hatcheries are the dominant provider of some types of salmon. However, biologists differ on just how much of a role the hatcheries should play.
T. Charley Dewberry, a restoration ecologist, has been studying salmon in Knowles Creek, on the western slope of the Oregon coast range near here, for 20 years. His efforts to restore the salmon habitat have been financed by the national Forest Service, private timber companies and Pacific Rivers Council.
Studying schools of juvenile wild salmon the other day, Mr. Dewberry pointed to areas where logjams had helped create the shady, protected areas where they like to spawn. Wild coho salmon populations in the Oregon coast area are at less than 5 percent of what they were in 1900, when more than a million fish returned to spawn each year, according to the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations.
Hatcheries have been around for more than 100 years and have a role to play, Mr. Dewberry said. But the long-term aim, he said, should be to restore most rivers and their ecosystems to a condition in which wild salmon can thrive on their own.
"We've got a patient in cardiac arrest, and that's what the coho situation is," he said. "So they're on a heart machine right now. But the goal is not to keep your patient on the machine. The goal should be to get the patient off the machine."

HEADLINE: Argentina Offers Economic Plan, Hoping to Sidestep Court 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
The Argentine government said tonight that it would allow the peso to float freely against the dollar and ease, but not eliminate, a freeze on bank accounts ruled unconstitutional on Friday.
 The measures are apparently an effort by the government to undermine the adverse decision of an unpopular Supreme Court while reaching out to foreign creditors. 
 In a 40-minute televised speech detailing a sweeping plan aimed at reactivating an economy that has ground to a halt, Economy Minister Jorge Remes Lenicov also said that all financial debts and assets would be converted from dollars into pesos, but at differing rates that could signal big losses for banks but make the change less painful for debtors and account holders.
"We want our autonomy and our own currency," he said. 
The government's decision to abandon the two-tiered exchange rate it adopted last month, with a fixed rate of 1.4 pesos to the dollar as its anchor, is a major concession to the International Monetary Fund and other lenders.
For the last month, ever since Argentina abandoned a decade-old policy of linking the peso to the dollar at a one-to-one rate, the lenders have contended that such a system is inherently unworkable and vulnerable to corruption.
President Eduardo Duhalde made it clear, however, that he is willing to risk an open confrontation with his country's own Supreme Court, one he seems confident he can win. The measures announced tonight remove restrictions from many, but not all, bank accounts and transform all assets originally held in dollars into pesos, except for those held by smaller depositors who are willing to accept a new government bond denominated in dollars.
In remarks Saturday on a radio program of which he is the host, Mr. Duhalde dismissed the Supreme Court as a "totally discredited" institution engaged in "trickery." He linked the Friday ruling to a decision by Congress earlier in the week to set up a committee to evaluate 28 complaints against various Supreme Court justices that could lead to their being removed from the bench.
"When the Chamber of Deputies created an impeachment commission, they began to blackmail the deputies," Mr. Duhalde said. "They even spoke to a cabinet minister, demanding that they not be subjected to trial."
Justices had rebuffed earlier attempts to weaken or overturn the bank freeze, imposed early in December in an effort to prevent dollars from leaving the country and banks from collapsing. That position made them one of the main targets of the pot-banging middle-class street demonstrations that have become a regular feature of Argentine political life for the last two months.
Technically, the judgment handed down Friday applies to the single complaint of a depositor with an account denominated in pesos and not, in sharp contrast to most of the funds held in the Argentine banking system, American dollars.
Most other depositors may have to file individual suits to get their money back. That would be a complicated and time-consuming process that would give the government room to maneuver -- which it apparently intends to utilize fully.
"We're trying to adjust our economic program to the ruling," said Eduardo Amadeo, Mr. Duhalde's press secretary. "We're not going to say it doesn't exist. We don't plan to disavow it. But we're not going to stop governing and we don't foresee far-reaching changes in our program, since our lawyers say the decision offers room for interpretation."
Speaking with reporters at the World Economic Forum in New York over the weekend, Horst Kohler, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, appeared to endorse Mr. Duhalde's approach. "The ruling of the constitutional court complicates things tremendously," he said, "but I think it is still right to do the defreezing of the deposits on a gradual basis."
The Argentine Supreme Court, though nominally independent, bears the stamp of former President Carlos Saul Menem, who was in power for most of the 1990's. Early in his tenure, Mr. Menem, a Peronist, was able to negotiate a political accord that increased the number of justices from five to nine and allowed him to put friends and allies on the bench.
With the packed court and its so-called "automatic majority" in place, Mr. Menem soon benefited from a series of favorable rulings on political and economic initiatives whose constitutionality had been widely questioned. These included privatization of state companies and sweeping pardons for military officers and guerrillas accused of human rights abuses during the military dictatorship from 1976 to 1983.
Mr. Duhalde was Mr. Menem's first vice president, but the two quarreled and now are bitter enemies. Mr. Menem has declared his candidacy in presidential elections scheduled for late next year, which political analysts here say gives him an interest in seeing Mr. Duhalde fail. 
Though Mr. Menem left office more than two years ago, the court continues to be regarded as loyal to him and responsive to his interests. Before his appointment to the court, Chief Justice Julio Nazareno was a partner with Mr. Menem and his brother in a law firm and other business interests in their home province, according to local news reports.
In July, Mr. Menem was placed under house arrest in connection with charges that he approved and then covered up the illegal sales of 6,500 tons of arms and munitions to Croatia and Ecuador during his presidency. But in a widely criticized move, the court ordered him freed in November, saying there was insufficient evidence of a gunrunning and "illicit enrichment" conspiracy.
Congressional leaders said they intend to accelerate their investigation of the supposed wrongdoing by the Supreme Court justices. The 28 pending complaints of "improper performance" of duty include the Menem arms case as well as the botched investigation of a terrorist attack on the Israeli Embassy here in 1992.
"The ruling constitutes an act of absolute irresponsibility," said Sergio Acevedo, chairman of the commission and a member of Mr. Duhalde's Peronist party. "The judges who endorsed it seek nothing more than to drag down the three branches of government and deepen the political and social crisis that afflicts the country."

HEADLINE: FORUM IN NEW YORK: DIARY; 
A Forum for the Formerly Radical

BYLINE:  By Jim Dwyer 

 BODY:
In another time, the panelists speaking about Northern Ireland at the World Economic Forum yesterday might have sent the bomb-sniffer dogs howling at the skies and the metal detectors blaring out alarms. 
 One was once held on a British prison ship and in jail on suspicion that he was a member of the Irish Republican Army. Another served time as a bombmaker for loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland. A third joined a hard-line group that shut down the province with strikes and violent protests rather than share power with Catholics. 
 Even one expert questioning the panel had a loud past: as a teenager, he had been a member of the Stern Gang, the Zionist fighters who sabotaged and attacked British institutions holding territories that would become Israel.
Still, the bishop of Oslo, Gunnar Stalsett, deputy leader of the Nobel Peace Prize committee, said he was "proud to be at the feet of such men" yesterday, and said they offered glimpses of hope in tense times.
The four main political leaders in Northern Ireland said that despite continuing violence against Catholics in northern Belfast, and caches of arms held by various paramilitary groups, they were sure their peace agreement would stand. 
Eight years after the I.R.A. and paramilitary loyalists called cease-fires, it was clear that the political leaders who emerged from the peace process were considering what the next decade would bring -- including the question of how people in Northern Ireland who retain British identity would be treated if the entire island of Ireland were to become united under a single government.
Population and political shifts make the issue more than academic. Some demographers forecast a Catholic majority within a decade or two in the six counties of northeastern Ireland. In that area, retained by Britain after the island was partitioned in 1920, Catholics generally identify themselves as Irish nationalists, while many of those who see themselves as British -- often called unionists or loyalists -- come from one of the Protestant traditions.
In response to a question about the rights of unionists in a united Ireland, Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the political party of Irish republicans, said Irish nationalists could not prudently pursue a course of "mathematical majoritarianism."
"I don't think we can force upon unionism an all Ireland which doesn't have their assent or consent and doesn't reflect their sense of being comfortable, of them having their place," said Mr. Adams, who was interned for five years without trial on suspicion that he was a member of the Irish Republican Army.
David Trimble, the first minister of Northern Ireland and the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, said later that he regarded Mr. Adams's remarks as "significant" because of the prominence of the forum. 
Among those questioning the panel was George Schwab, a City College professor who was a member of the Stern Gang in 1947. He asked if the unionist majority was finding difficulty in the new arrangements.
Mr. Trimble said that the support for the agreement was weak in his party, and that more progress was needed on the disposal of arms, particularly those held by the I.R.A. 
Once a member of a hard-line group called the Vanguard Ulster Progressive Party that had opposed a power-sharing arrangement in the early 1970's, Mr. Trimble shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1998 with John Hume for negotiating the current agreement. 
Mr. Adams, whose party is closely aligned with the I.R.A., noted that the group had already destroyed weapons under the supervision of an independent inspector. "Be assured, be assured, that Sinn Fein is committed to taking the guns out of Irish politics," Mr. Adams said. 
The two other party leaders suggested that defining politics in Northern Ireland in strictly religious terms was misguided. "The moralists and the fundamentalists will always make the angles of division," said David Ervine, the chief spokesman for the Progressive Unionist Party, who served five years after being caught transporting a bomb, and then renounced violence. 
"We have to come to a position where we treat religion not as a tribal brand, but as a guide and a spiritual resource," said Mark Durkan, the province's deputy first minister, and the leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party, who has no known record of arrests or political extremism.
Halfway through the session, a group of Irish journalists charged into the room, highlighting the difficulties reporters from around the world have had in covering the private gathering. 
Most journalists are not permitted in the Waldorf for the meetings because of space limitations, but must follow the proceedings on video feeds to the Intercontinental Hotel, across 49th Street. The Irish session was scheduled for broadcast into the press area, but another program was shown instead. The reporters, who had come from Ireland for the forum, persuaded officials to give them temporary passes into the Waldorf. 
Earth Times, a small newspaper that published an article complaining about the access issues yesterday, was removed from the list of papers distributed at the Waldorf at the request of a forum press officer, said Aaron Ide, the hotel's director of guest services. 
Charles McLean, the chief press officer for the forum, said that he was unable to find anyone on his staff who gave that instruction. "We haven't banned their distribution," he said.

Pressure Tactics Force Sweet St. Louis Offense to Sing the Blues

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM C. RHODEN 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
MIKE MARTZ will have three sea sons winter, spring and summer -- to try to figure out how his heavily favored Rams were the victims of one of the greatest upsets in Super Bowl history. He will have three seasons to figure out how his futuristic, high-octane offense was shut down by the New England Patriots in a 20-17 loss.
 During Super Bowl week and for most of the season, the question on everyone's lips was: How could anyone slow down the Rams? Of course, they could not be beaten, but how could the Patriots slow them down? 
 Experts predicted that St. Louis would win by two touchdowns. At least. 
Until Kurt Warner scored the Rams' first touchdown with 9 minutes 31 seconds remaining in the game, Martz, the N.F.L.'s mad scientist, watched his offense and his reputation for manufacturing points by the bushel take a pulverizing hit.
Last night's duel was between two former coordinators -- Martz, with a doctorate in offense, and Bill Belichick, with a doctorate in defense.
Super Bowl XXXVI was each man's chance to validate himself on one of the greatest stages in sport. Martz was an assistant under Dick Vermeil in 1999 when St. Louis won the Super Bowl. Belichick was an assistant under Bill Parcells when the Giants won two Super Bowls in 1987 and 1991 and when New England reached the Super Bowl and lost to Green Bay in 1997.
But if last night's improbable victory was a huge lift for Belichick, the loss was an enormous upset for Martz, whose climb from the unemployment line to offensive mastermind became the story of this Super Bowl.
Before last night.
The life span of fancy systems can be short-lived. At some point, winning and losing boils down to will and spirit. 
The Patriots' defense did not throw a complex maze at the Rams' vaunted receivers. It was just airtight, in-your-face, man-to-man coverage by cornerbacks Ty Law and the 36-year-old Otis Smith.
Law matched up against Isaac Bruce, and the wise Smith was on Torry Holt.
Last night, the Patriots unveiled a smashing blueprint for derailing Martz's offense: pressure, pressure, pressure. Hit, hit, hit.
Instead of trying to blitz Warner and playing into Martz's trap, the Patriots put the game in the hands of the secondary. They covered more than they blitzed. For three quarters, nothing the Rams tried worked. Law would hound Bruce, Smith would hound Holt.
Law had the best rejoinder for the St. Louis speed. "They said the Rams were the fastest track team in the N.F.L.," he said. "I never saw anyone win the 100-yard dash with somebody standing in front of them."
Everything Martz prided himself on broke down in his biggest game. Warner was sacked three times for 38 yards and threw two interceptions.
The word on the Rams was that if you hit them, you could win. Bruce, Holt and Warner were pounded mercilessly.
Martz, the mad scientist, partly redeemed himself with two fourth-quarter touchdowns: a quarterback sneak by Warner and a catch and run by Ricky Proehl. But even Proehl's touchdown was an adventure. On third-and-goal at the 3-yard line, Warner's pass was nearly intercepted by Law. On fourth-and-goal, Warner was forced to run and he fumbled. Tebucky Jones picked up the fumble and raced 97 yards with what would have been a spirit-breaking touchdown. A defensive holding call negated the touchdown and gave the Rams new life. Warner scored on the second play after that.
Martz found out last night that players make or break systems.
If there was a disappointing aspect to the game, it was Martz's refusal to give the Patriots' secondary more than passing credit for scuttling his supposedly unstoppable offense.
Asked about Smith and Law, Martz said: "They're good cover guys. They did a nice job."
Asked about Smith's third-quarter interception, that helped set up a field goal, Martz said, "If Torry doesn't slip, he probably catches it and he probably scores."
But Holt did slip and Smith made the catch and pushed the Rams one step closer to the cliff.
But give Martz and the Rams credit for taking a player like Marshall Faulk and putting him in a system where he could thrive. When he went to the Rams from Indianapolis in 1999, Faulk was asked to play a much different role for St. Louis. He was asked to pick up the blitz and to block more than he had ever done in his career. He accepted his role and the Rams won a Super Bowl. 
"I didn't touch the ball a lot in '99 at times in a games and we won huge," he recalled. "We have to make those sacrifices and understand that there is a bigger goal."
The Martz system is derived from the Don Coryell school of offense. Coryell, whose system was known as Air Coryell, was the head coach for the St. Louis Cardinals and later San Diego, turning the Chargers into a scoring machine in the late 1970's and early 1980's. Kellen Winslow, John Jefferson, Charlie Joiner, Dan Fouts and Chuck Muncie were the weapons.
Like the Rams, San Diego was fun to watch. 
Unlike the Rams, the Chargers never reached the Super Bowl under Coryell's points-galore system. They scored a lot but the defense leaked like a sieve.
Until last night, Martz found the perfect blend of offense and defense. But when someone asked Martz about the efficiency of his system, he made it clear that the roots of his system, any system, were the human beings in it.
Now it's back to laboratory for the mad scientist.

Online matchmakers are helping to bolster the finances of their corporate parents as they raise the romantic hopes of clients.

BYLINE:  By Bob Tedeschi 

 BODY:
THE advertising market has been ailing for the better part of a year, particularly online advertising. But some Web categories are in remarkably good health, like personal ads.
 Sites like Match.com of Ticketmaster, Matchmaker.com of Terra Lycos and ClubConnect of Yahoo are helping to shore up the finances of their parent companies, even as the sites raise the romantic hopes of millions of Internet users. 
 Take Match.com, which like its parent Ticketmaster, is part of the USA Networks Interactive Group of Barry Diller. While Match's sister company, CitySearch, a collection of online city guides, contributed to Ticketmaster's $46 million loss in the fourth quarter, Match.com contributed $7.6 million in earnings -- an increase of 451 percent over Match.com's profit in the fourth quarter of 2000. 
Analysts are not necessarily surprised at such figures. "Online dating content is one of the few types of content that people will actually open their wallets for online -- so much so that companies are actually upping their prices," said Stacey Herron, an analyst with the research and consulting firm Jupiter Media Metrix.
Ms. Herron pointed out that with online personal ads, as opposed to ads in newspapers, users can get immediate responses, filter the respondents easily and reach a large number of people in a wide geographic area. "This is one of those things that the Web is just very good for," she said.
Match.com is the acknowledged leader of the category, with 3.8 million monthly visitors, according to Jupiter, and more than 382,000 subscribers, who pay an average of $18 a month for the right to post descriptions and photos of themselves, contact other members, and be sent alerts when potential matches join the service.
"This has clearly beaten our public expectations," said John Pleasants, the chief executive of Ticketmaster. "People are just now getting to the point where they say 'Hey, this is not a cheesy thing.' "
Mr. Pleasants said that, as with many businesses, the online dating industry was profoundly affected by the events of Sept. 11. In this case, the effect was positive. "We went from logging 3,000 to 4,000 new subscriptions a day to 5,000 to 6,000," he said. A national cable television advertising effort helped ignite that growth, Mr. Pleasants said.
Executives from several other online dating services reported similar growth and speculated that -- as one executive put it -- people were searching for "more meaningful connections." Of course, in a sinking economy, such sites were also a cost-effective alternative to trolling for dates at a singles bar.
Mr. Pleasants said he expected similar growth this year, in part because of more aggressive TV advertising, on which the company will spend $20 million to $50 million. Thirty to 70 percent of the advertising dollars are "instantly recouped," he said. "It's one of those categories where advertising really works -- even when we advertise online."
Match.com's closest competitor is Yahoo Personals, which rolled out a paid service called ClubConnect last fall. A fee of about $20 a month gives a user, among other things, the ability to answer an unlimited number of the site's personal ads.
Yahoo promoted the service heavily on its home page at the end of the year with good results, according to Mark Hull, the director of Yahoo's community services, who heads the personals division.
Mr. Hull declined to disclose subscriber figures, as is customary for the company, but according to Jupiter, Yahoo Personals trailed Match.com only slightly, with 3.7 million visitors in December. Mr. Hull declined to say how the revenues from Yahoo Personals compared with the $17.6 million Match.com took in during the fourth quarter, but he offered an optimistic forecast.
"We think we're well positioned to be the leader in this field in a short amount of time," Mr. Hull said. "The single biggest cost in this category is user acquisition, and that's next to nothing for us. So you can see how we can make a serious run at this."
Yahoo can keep its customer acquisition costs low, Mr. Hull said, by using its own properties as marketing vehicles. Aside from Yahoo home page advertisements, he said the company offered complimentary one-month trials of the paid service, promoting the offer heavily on the parts of the Yahoo Personals site that remain free. That program has been so successful that the company last month reduced the free trial period to two weeks.
Mr. Hull said he expected to link the Yahoo Personals business with more offline operations this year. The company, for instance, is considering giving users the opportunity to place their Yahoo personal ads in local newspapers, although Mr. Hull declined to discuss details.
Offline partnerships are a growing area for the other big player in online personal ads, Matchmaker.com. According to Stephen Killeen, United States president of Terra Lycos, the Spanish company that owns Matchmaker, the company heard last year from its users that they wanted to meet people face to face. "So we had an event in Dallas, where we brought a whole bunch of people together," Mr. Killeen said. "We charged something like $20 a head, and even though we didn't make a huge amount on it, it wasn't insignificant."
Mr. Killeen said that in addition to holding more such events, Matchmaker would increasingly "take people into the ancillary services that go with finding a mate," -- in other words, helping them find restaurants, flowers, clothes and the like.
In the past, analysts have tagged online dating services as little more than add-on businesses for larger companies. That is precisely what the services have become for the top three players in the field.
But for smaller stand-alone companies like MatchNet, an online dating service based in Beverly Hills, Calif., a market niche can be worthwhile in its own right.
The company operates international sites under the MatchNet name, but according to Joe Shapira, MatchNet's chief executive, most of the company's value derives from its niche dating sites in this country: JDate.com, which caters to a Jewish clientele, and Gay11.com, for gay and lesbian dating. (The company will roll out separate dating sites for older people and the disabled later this year.)
Mr. Shapira concedes that he cannot compete with Match.com in the mainstream dating market, at least domestically. But the niche sites, he said, helped the company realize an operating profit of $831,000 in the third quarter of 2001, "and we've growing our numbers by 20 percent every quarter." Matchnet, which is publicly held, projects a profit of $6.5 million for this year, on revenue of $23 million.
"We never subscribed to the new-economy phenomenon, so we believe in having stable and gradual growth," Mr. Shapira said of his operation, which has 60 employees. "For us, this is a nice little business."

HEADLINE: New Economy; 
A new stock offering should give some signal whether investors have forgiven Internet investments.

BYLINE:  By Matt Richtel 

 BODY:
ARE investors ready to take a ride again on the Internet? 
 An answer may become clearer with the initial public offering of Paypal, which provides a payment system for goods and services bought over the Internet. 
 A stock offering by a consumer-oriented Internet start-up is a rarity these days. Adding to the intrigue is that Paypal at once embodies elements that attracted rabid Internet investors as well as those that drove investors away screaming. 
On the downside, Paypal is not yet profitable, having lost $265 million in two-and-a-half years. And it faces potentially thorny regulatory obstacles. 
Yet the company has the potential for fast growth, has the dominant position in a new market and is capitalizing on several facets of the Internet already considered a commercial success -- auctions, gambling and pornography. 
"Investors must decide" how to perceive Paypal, said Gary Craft, an analyst for Financial DNA, a research firm in San Francisco. "On the one hand, it's a model that comes out of the troubled Internet space and has many warning signals of an Internet company -- like it's not making money." 
On the other hand, "it has the potential to become a new payment network that can provide much better service, at much lower cost," he said. "It has the potential to become the Visa or Mastercard of the Internet." 
The company, which analysts expect to go public in the next few weeks, declined to comment, citing the government-mandated "quiet period" before a public offering. 
At its most basic, Paypal lets people make payments to one another, and to businesses, over the Internet. A user opens a Paypal account, then deposits money into it by credit card, check, bank wire transfer or other means. The user can then send a payment to anyone else who has a Paypal account, over the Paypal network. 
Paypal makes most its money by taking a cut of each transaction -- about 3.2 percent, up from a fee of 2.1 percent the company was charging at the end of 2000. In 2001, the company generated $104.8 million in revenue, with substantial growth each quarter. For example, the company took in $40.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2001, up from $30.2 million in the third quarter. 
But the losses piled up, too, including a loss of $107.8 million in 2001. Of that amount, $91.9 million was related not to day-to-day operations, but to charges from acquisitions and stock-based executive compensation.
Of the total $264.7 million in losses the company accumulated from its inception in March 1999 through Sept. 30 of last year, $125 million was also related to similar, nonoperational charges -- suggesting to some analysts that the company is not faring as badly on an operating basis as its losses might otherwise suggest. 
In a filing last month with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Paypal reported that it had 12.8 million subscribers as of Dec. 31, of which 2.6 million were business accounts. As of Sept. 30, the company reported that about half its accounts were active in the first nine months of 2001.
The bulk of Paypal's transactions -- 68 percent -- comes from auction-related trade on eBay and other sites, according to the company filing. Meanwhile, 10 to 15 percent of the company's business comes from handling payments to online gambling sites and for sex-related content, according to analysts who follow the company. 
Operators of gambling sites say that Paypal has become an important outlet for them, given that some big banks that issue Visa and Mastercard credit cards have been forbidding the use of their cards for Internet wagers. Some industry analysts say that gambling, and other growth areas, are reasons for optimism about Paypal. 
"They are involved with the two kinds of dot-coms that do well -- eBay and vice," said Randall Roth, a research analyst with Renaissance Capital, in Greenwich, Conn. 
More generally, Mr. Roth said, the company has the potential to become a "de facto standard for transferring money" over the Internet. In turn, some analysts say the company could challenge the huge reliance by consumers on Visa and Mastercard for other types of Internet-based payments. 
Already, Paypal has 90 percent of the e-mail payment market. Fledgling competing payment systems, put out by the likes of Citibank, a unit of Citigroup; Yahoo; and eBay, having yet to make a substantial dent in the market, according to Gwenn Bezard, an analyst with Celand Communications, a research firm in New York that has looked extensively at the electronic payment market. 
Still, in its own S.E.C. filing, Paypal noted that some of its competitors "have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, customer service and other resources, greater name recognition or a larger base of customers in affiliated business than we have." 
In a particularly noteworthy challenge, Mr. Bezard noted, Mastercard recently announced a partnership with Certapay, a Toronto technology company that could give Mastercard the technical means to create a competing system. 
Ebay in March 2000 introduced its own e-mail payment system, called Billpoint, owned 35 percent by Wells Fargo. Kevin Pursglove, a spokesman for eBay, said Paypal still held a significant lead. But he said that eBay was aggressively promoting Billpoint and that the items on the eBay site that had a Billpoint account attached to them were growing 20 to 25 percent each quarter. 
Mr. Pursglove said eBay remained an "open marketplace" that would not prevent Paypal from participating. But he said that eBay would continue to advertise to members aggressively and could have an inside track on growth because it owned the auction service. "We want as many people as possible to use Billpoint," he said. 
Paypal faces challenges in its other markets, too -- including the potential that Internet gambling could be regulated, or outlawed, putting a sizable chunk of Paypal's revenue at risk. 
The company also faces a more basic challenge associated with participating in Internet transactions: fraud. In its filing with the S.E.C., it wrote, "We face significant risks of loss due to fraud and disputes between senders and recipients." Examples of such fraud would be breaches in security, use of the system for illegal purposes and, in a problem widely faced by credit card companies, a concept called charge-backs, in which users of the system deny making a transaction and demand a refund. 
And yet, several analysts who cover Paypal said it had done a good job controlling the risks associated with fraud. 
Mr. Roth of Renaissance Capital said Paypal's offering would serve as a good test of the public's attitude toward Internet investments. "Two years ago, this stock would have taken off like a moon rocket," Mr. Roth said. "Six months ago, it might well have been tougher. There was a lot of skepticism about I.P.O.'s." 
Now, the analyst said, people may be more accepting of new stocks like Paypal's. "This," Mr. Roth said, "is a complicated story."

HEADLINE: ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE BUZZ; 
World Economic Forum Plays Down the Scandal

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
More than a thousand corporate chief executives are gathered in New York for the World Economic Forum, their voices ringing out in almost all the panel discussions.
 But in four days of nonstop talking, the Enron scandal has hardly been mentioned; when it has been, the emphasis has been on lax business practices and how every recession brings down some big company, rather than on the apparent fraud at the heart of Enron's collapse. 
 Only one hastily organized panel specifically dealt with the scandal, and its principal speaker, Richard H. Murray, director of legal and regulatory affairs at Deloitte & Touche, quickly set the tone. Enron, he told a less-than-packed audience in one of the smallest conference rooms, should not be viewed as a morality play -- there are too many nuanced issues and no clear answers. 
Gail D. Fosler, chief economist at the Conference Board, argued that "Enron happened as part of the change in corporate value systems between 1989 and today."
Ms. Fosler, appearing with Mr. Murray, said she had not been recruited until Wednesday for the Saturday panel, long after most planning for the conference was done. 
No one gives more support to the World Economic Forum than those leading American corporations that each pay $26,000 a year in dues and fees to cover much of the cost of the elaborate annual gathering held, until this year, in Davos, the Swiss ski resort. Enron was a prominent supporter, and when the first list of probable participants for this gathering went out in late September, Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman, was still on it, although his company had begun to unravel in public.
"I don't think we have ever had a more sudden demise," Charles McLean, the forum's chief spokesman, said. Or seen a company more quickly dismissed. "Enron is not important to us," Mr. McLean said. "They are bankrupt."
But if the forum's participants -- not only chief executives, but entertainers, heads of state, writers, religious leaders and union officials -- winced at dealing with Enron head on, there were references to it in the panel discussions and the hallways.
Many cited Enron as a symptom of the times, a point of view offered by Stanley Fischer, the former second in command at the International Monetary Fund who is now a vice chairman at Citigroup. "Enron is something that happens at the end of a boom," he said in a panel on the economic outlook, "so I think we are in for a period of slow growth."
But mostly there was minimizing. Joseph F. Berardino, chief executive of Arthur Andersen, also under fire as Enron's auditor, canceled a scheduled appearance. And in interviews, half a dozen chief executives, made less rather than more of the scandal.
"It will raise the diligence of boards," said Michael D. Capellas, chairman of Compaq Computer. "I don't think there is a C.E.O. out there who is not paying attention. But I don't think they are drawing the conclusion that because Enron failed, the system is flawed."
The resistance to linking Enron to corporate fraud and political connections came out at a session on a supposedly loftier matter attended by John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "Someone raised the issue of corporate corruption," Mr. Sweeney said, "and the consensus on the panel was that this was not an issue of globalization."

HEADLINE: Candidates Try to Fathom New York's Shifting Voters 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
There have always been a few givens for any candidate contemplating a run for office in New York State: Upstate and the suburbs vote Republican, while New York City goes for the Democrats. Black and Hispanic voters tend to go Democratic, and unions are the engines that bring out Democratic voters. And, recent Republican victories notwithstanding, there are many more registered Democrats in New York than Republicans.
 But as Gov. George E. Pataki and his two potential Democratic opponents, H. Carl McCall and Andrew M. Cuomo, prepare for the campaign ahead, the rules that have long guided candidates seeking statewide office in New York seem to be out the window. 
 While there is debate in political circles over the extent and permanence of these shifts, there is a growing sense that a realignment has taken place in New York over the last four years that is forcing the gubernatorial candidates and their advisers to reconsider the way they approach this year's contest. 
Aides to the candidates, in a series of interviews, seized on different elements of the shift to highlight changes that they said benefited their party. Democratic officials, for example, noted the sharp rise in their party's registration in recent years, and strong Democratic showings upstate and on Long Island, traditionally Republican strongholds. Aides to Mr. Pataki noted the governor's success at picking up support of labor unions, Hispanic leaders and other Democratic figures, and the fact that New York City has now elected a Republican as mayor three times in a row.
But while it is still early in the contest, it is the Democrats who seem particularly concerned these days as the full picture of this scramble of political allegiances come into focus. And that is a notable change from just six months ago, when many Democrats -- cheered by back-to-back victories in New York Senate contests -- voiced confidence about the party's prospects of defeating Mr. Pataki.
"There is the potential for a total realignment in New York right now," said a prominent Democratic consultant who spoke only on the condition that he not be identified, offering what for Democrats is a gloomy assessment of the state of political play in New York. "Some traditional Democratic constituencies are moving toward the Republicans."
A Democratic consultant, Richard Schrader, said that while some changes were helping his party, most of them seemed to benefit the Republicans in general, and Mr. Pataki in particular.
"Look at how he's expanded his base," said Mr. Schrader, who managed Mark Green's campaign for mayor last year. "Think about the issues. Think about the environment. Think about Vieques. Think about labor issues. He's snatched these issues away from the Democrats. And effortlessly."
The concern in Democratic circles has intensified in recent weeks because of the course of the special election campaign on the Upper East Side to replace State Senator Roy M. Goodman, a Republican who retired to take a job in the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. 
The competition between the Republican, John Ravitz, and his Democratic opponent, Liz Krueger, has provided abundant daily evidence of the tenuous cohesiveness of the traditional Democratic coalition. A succession of organizations that normally support Democrats, from labor unions to gay rights groups, have endorsed Mr. Ravitz, responding to promises and pressure from Republicans who control the Senate. Several Democrats suggest that what is taking place now, in advance of the Feb. 12 vote, offers a preview of the gubernatorial campaign.
And it comes after a mayoral election in New York City that showed once again that the days when a Democrat would never consider leaving his party's line on the ballot were over. Mr. Bloomberg's election marked the third consecutive time in which an overwhelmingly Democratic city had elected a Republican as its mayor.
Still, some forces are working on behalf of Mr. McCall and Mr. Cuomo. To start, the party enjoys a two-million-vote edge among registered voters in New York, a margin that has grown in recent years. "There is a natural Democratic advantage, and you have close to a million new registered Democrats in the last two years," said Mr. McCall's campaign coordinator, Richard Fife.
Mr. Cuomo's pollster, Mark Penn, noted the number of Democrats elected statewide and said: "If anything, the Democrats are coming home to Democrats. Pataki is surrounded: There are two Democratic senators, a Democratic comptroller."
And, in a hopeful sign for Democrats, the part of New York that is normally solidly Republican -- upstate -- now appears to be very much back in play. An early sign of this came when Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat, swept United States Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a longtime Pataki ally, from office in 1998 after campaigning intensely upstate. Hillary Rodham Clinton did the same thing when she was elected to the Senate in 2000, winning nearly 50 percent of upstate votes against Mr. Pataki's candidate, Rick A. Lazio.
During their campaigns, Mr. Schumer and Mrs. Clinton often expressed concern about the state of the upstate economy under Mr. Pataki -- the same argument that Mr. McCall and Mr. Cuomo have begun using against Mr. Pataki. Mr. Lazio suffered badly in that campaign when he asserted at a debate in Buffalo that the state economy was in good shape, a statement he made at least in part out of concern that criticizing the upstate economy might provide ammunition to Mr. Pataki's Democratic foes.
Aides to Mr. Pataki say Mr. Cuomo will be powerless to use that argument against Mr. Pataki, because so many voters blame his father, Mario M. Cuomo, whom Mr. Pataki unseated in 1994, for the state of the economy. "The most important thing here is Pataki is seen as having led New York from an economic crisis when he came into office," said a senior Pataki adviser, Kieran P. Mahoney. "And that is the proximate cause of why against two very, very well-known Democratic challengers, he has a 2-to-1 lead in every state poll."
Whether voters hold Andrew Cuomo accountable for any perceived lapses by his father could prove to be one of the more intriguing questions of this campaign. And it is unclear what Mr. Pataki, who has spent much time criticizing the elder Mr. Cuomo, will do if Mr. McCall wins the race.
Several Democrats note that Mr. Pataki has turned much of his attention downstate, particularly after the attack of Sept. 11, in a way that suggests he may be concerned about how he is doing upstate. "He's got to go all over downstate because he's afraid of what upstate is going to do to him -- given the economy and education," said Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell, the state Democratic Party chairman.
Whatever Mr. Pataki's situation upstate, he clearly appears to be doing well downstate, and in other traditional Democratic quarters. He became a fixture on New York City television stations in the months after the World Trade Center attack, and his identification with recovery and rebuilding efforts could raise his stock among New York City and suburban voters, Republicans and Democrats said.
Mr. Pataki has demonstrated unambiguous success in picking up support among the Democratic coalition. The decision by the president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, James P. Hoffa, to join the head of the state health care workers, Dennis Rivera, in attacking both Mr. McCall and Mr. Cuomo sent a chill through Democratic circles.
The two union leaders assailed the Democrats after Mr. McCall and Mr. Cuomo had criticized the way in which Mr. Pataki pushed through a multi-billion-dollar health care plan that provided raises for members of Mr. Rivera's union.
Mr. Rivera now seems inclined to endorse Mr. Pataki outright, or remain neutral. Mr. Rivera's union is renowned for its ability to get out the vote of its members, so his decision to stand aside, or support Mr. Pataki, could be a big problem for either Mr. McCall or Mr. Cuomo.
Aides to both Democrats suggested that the effects of such a defection would be limited. "It's one thing about union resources," Mr. Penn said. "It's a whole other thing when it comes to voters behind the resources. I wouldn't include the rank-and-file behind" Mr. Rivera.
A senior McCall adviser, Hank Sheinkopf, said flatly of Mr. Rivera's union, "His members will vote for Carl McCall."
Yet Mr. Pataki's success at forming an alliance with Mr. Rivera, who is one of the state's most prominent labor leaders and one of its leading Hispanic leaders, also reflects his continuing attempt to gain support among another group of usually Democratic voters, Hispanic New Yorkers. 
The governor has prominently identified himself with demonstrators against the Navy's practice bombing runs on the Puerto Rican island Vieques, and his aides say that because of President George W. Bush's success at courting Hispanic voters across the country. Republicans have a much stronger shot with Hispanic voters in New York.
"In 1998, to try and get Hispanic votes as a Republican in New York was virtually impossible, because the national Republican Party was seen as hostile to Hispanic issues," Mr. Mahoney said. That has changed entirely, he argued.
Mr. McCall's advisers say that Hispanic and black voters will be more likely to support him because if he is elected, he will be New York's first black governor. But even Democrats are worrying these days about the possibility that Mr. Cuomo may win a primary that reignites the racial tensions of last year's divisive mayoral primary. In that case, Mr. Pataki may indeed do well in his effort to woo Hispanic voters, while a second normally Democratic constituency, black voters, may be inclined to stay at home.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
Talk of Crime Gets Big Push

BYLINE:  By KURT EICHENWALD 

 BODY:
The report released Saturday evening by a special committee of the Enron Corporation's board clearly raises the specter that at the foundation of the company's downfall was a series of multimillion-dollar crimes, legal experts and former prosecutors said yesterday.
 Until now, much of the investigation into Enron's free fall has been focused on complex transactions that, while suspicious and poorly executed, appeared to fall within the framework of workaday corporate finance. These include the now notorious off-balance sheet deals that shifted assets and debt from the company's books and into a byzantine collection of partnerships, many of them controlled by Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow. 
 But with the committee's report, if it proves accurate, investigators into the company's collapse will seek to pinpoint whether the same kinds of fraudulent acts that were at the foundation of the savings and loan scandals of the late 1980's and early 1990's occurred at Enron, too. These include false valuation of assets, bogus deals between related parties, and millions of dollars pocketed by participants along the way. 
"This report is a road map for the Department of Justice to bring a criminal indictment," said John J. Fahy, a certified public accountant who was once a federal prosecutor in New Jersey.
With its detailed description of seemingly irrational transactions that served no economic purpose other than to pump up Enron's earnings, the report has shifted the focus from the company's balance sheet, which lists assets and liabilities, to its income statement, which describes revenues and profits.
To those uncomfortable with the internecine workings of finance, that may sound like a distinction without a difference. 
But in truth, the shift allows the federal inquiries trying to unravel the Enron collapse to move from an area weighed down by dueling professional opinions to the familiar stomping ground of criminal prosecutions.
"Moving from the balance sheet to the income statement makes the case a lot easier for a prosecutor to bring and a lot easier for a prosecutor to explain to a grand jury," Mr. Fahy said.
To prove any case against Enron, prosecutors would have to establish that potential defendants intended to commit a crime. Under the law, a person can participate in activities that result in false information being given to investors without committing a crime, so long as he believed -- even falsely -- that the activities were appropriate.
That is what created difficulties for a criminal case based on Enron's incorrect accounting for the partnerships as separate entities. Executives at Enron could point to approvals from Arthur Andersen, the company's accounting firm, as evidence that they intended nothing improper.
But with the report's conclusion that certain transactions served no purpose other than to manipulate the reported earnings of the company -- and with certain executives personally receiving millions of dollars in undisclosed profits from their partnership dealings -- the hurdle of proving intent to commit a crime has been dramatically lowered.
"It's going to take a herculean salesmanship job to persuade a jury that the Enron executives involved in this could not appreciate the fraudulent nature of these transactions," said Christopher J. Bebel, formerly a federal prosecutor and a lawyer with the Securities and Exchange Commission who is now with Shepherd, Smith & Bebel in Houston.
"Their reliance on the advice of experts is starting to go out the window," Mr. Bebel added, "and the accountants could end up being key witnesses for the government in some respects."
Members of Congress, who have been investigating the Enron debacle, made it clear yesterday that what they are seeing now appears to fall within the realm of a criminal conspiracy.
"We're finding what may clearly be securities fraud," Representative Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana and chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said on NBC's "Meet the Press."
Most criminal fraud prosecutions must show that participants had some financial motive to participate in an illegal scheme, and in this instance, former prosecutors said, there are plenty of examples of such benefits. Enron insiders received millions of dollars in undisclosed compensation from their dealings with the partnerships; Mr. Fastow alone, whose spokesman has declined comment, received at least $30 million from his partnership dealings. 
An array of other insiders received huge sums in a deal offered to them by Mr. Fastow and another executive, Michael J. Kopper, who declined to be interviewed by the committee. Two participants in the deal earned about $1 million in profits in just two months from an investment of $5,800 each, the report said.
"The magnitude of these returns raise serious questions as to why Fastow and Kopper offered these investments to the other employees," the report said.
Ultimately, if the report proves correct that profits were improperly manipulated, the range of charges that would be under consideration are the standard mix for corporate frauds, according to former federal prosecutors. They include, at their base, securities fraud from the filing of false information regarding corporate profits with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Those, in turn, lead to charges of mail fraud and wire fraud relating to the transmission of that information, both to the S.E.C. and to the investing public.
Despite the dozens of people involved in the transactions, the report describes an atmosphere of compartmentalized information, where few people understood the full scope of anything that was going on.
Employees had little understanding of their roles and responsibilities in the transactions; in one particularly stunning passage, the report describes how an executive who negotiated a deal with Enron on behalf of one of the partnerships believed that, instead, she was acting on behalf of the energy company.
But, for investigators, the most damning information relates to the repeated instances in which the company engaged in transactions that served no purpose other than to inflate the earnings Enron reported to investors and the public.
Indeed, the portrait painted by the report is one of a corporation where facts were fungible, capable of being massaged and manipulated to create whatever outcome most benefited the executives involved. It describes, for example, transactions with backdated documentation, done for the apparent purpose of taking advantage of a high price in a stock that was at foundation of the deal. By the time the deal was actually done, the price of the stock had fallen dramatically, but Enron was able to book millions more in profit by simply pretending that the transaction had taken place weeks before it did.
Repeatedly, the report said, there were transactions in which Enron sold an asset to a partnership near the end of an accounting period, only to buy them back later after profits had been booked. The partnership involved in those transactions never lost money on any deal, the report said, even when the value of the asset being bought and sold had declined. Indeed, the report said, there are suggestions that Enron guaranteed the partnerships involved against loss.
Ultimately, certain transactions were simply bogus, the report concluded. For example, the most complex series of transactions involve a group of four partnerships known as Raptor I-IV. Purportedly, the transactions were designed to allow Enron to hedge certain investments it made -- transactions in which the risk of an investment is shared with another party for the purpose of minimizing potential losses. But in truth, the report said, the Raptor transactions were simply a complex group of partnerships controlled by Enron, used as a secret dumpsite where troubled Enron businesses -- and the poor financials that accompanied them -- could be hidden.
Even worse, the report concluded, is the potential that, since Enron was essentially on both sides of each deal, the transactions were merely an illusion.
"The fundamental flaw in these transactions is not that the price was too low, the report said. "Instead, as a matter of economic substance, it is not clear that anything was really being bought or sold."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Raising Red Flags"Enron engaged in over 20 transactions from September 1999 to July 2001 with LJM partnerships created and managed by Andrew S. Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer at the time. The board's special investigation committee found several reasons many of these transactions raised red flags: Enron often sold the partnership assets at the end of accounting periods, only to buy them back later; LJM made a profit even when the asset's value had declined; and true ownership of certain partnership stakes was sometimes disguised. Chart shows companies sold or bought back by Enron from 2000 2001. CuiabaBrazilian power plant Enron sold its stake in a Brazilian power plant that was under construction to LJM1 for $11.3 million, allowing it to book $65 million of income related to a gas supply contract in the third and fourth quarters of 1999. Despite serious construction problems, Enron bought back its stake for $14.4 million in August 2001. Enron securitiesCollaterized loan obligations Enron wanted to sell some securities with low credit ratings but was unable to find a buyer, so it sold them to LJM2 and another partnership. A year and a half later, with their value deteriorating, Enron bought the securities back at cost plus interest, sparing LJM2 a loss. Nowa SarzynaPolish power plant Enron wanted to sell its interests in a Polish power plant before the end of 1999 to improve its balance sheet. Enron sold the plant to LJM2 as a temporary solution, hoping to find another buyer, and recorded a $16 million gain. Three months later, after the plant malfunctioned during a test, Enron was forced to buy it back under the terms of a credit agreement, giving LJM2 a 25 percent return. MEGSNatural gas gathering After failing to find a buyer, Enron sold a 90 percent equity interest in MEGS to LJM2 for about $26 million, giving Enron an advantage in its year-end accounting. Less than three months later, Enron bought the company back, giving LJM2 a 25 percent return. Later, Enron took a write-off because of diminished performance of the gas wells. YosemiteTrust Enron sold its share of certificates in a trust, Yosemite, to LJM2. The date of the sale was recorded in legal documents as Dec. 29,1999, but the actual sale appeared to occur on Feb. 28, 2000. LJM2 held the certificates for one day before selling them to an affiliate of Enron. LJM2 earned $100,000 plus expenses on the deal. BackboneFiber optic cable Enron Broadband Services, under pressure to meet quarterly numbers, sold its unactivated dark fiber optic cable to LJM2 on June 30, 2000, recording a $54 million gain. Mr. Fastow was hesitant to invest LJM2's money in the deal, so EBS had to increase the promised return to LJM2 if it was not able to resell the fiber within two years. The fiber was eventually sold to outside companies. (Source: Special investigation committee of Enron's board)(pg. A19)

HEADLINE: Reviving an Aging Playboy Is a Father-Daughter Project 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD WEINRAUB 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
On a recent afternoon, Hugh M. Hefner sat in the library of his 10,000-square-foot, Tudor-style mansion in this city's exclusive Holmby Hills section. The 75-year-old founder of Playboy, which is still the world's best-selling men's magazine, was impeccable in a silk smoking jacket, silk and linen black pants, white cashmere socks and black silk slippers.
 "The magazine is about fantasy and dreams -- and that's what my life is about," said Mr. Hefner, who oversees Playboy Enterprises with his daughter, Christie Hefner, the chairwoman and chief executive. "Social values change," he said. "So does pop culture. We had a tough time in the 80's. Now, there's a new fascination with things Playboy. We're back." 
 Actually, Playboy Enterprises still has a way to go, as it deals with competition from magazines like Maxim that appeal to younger men and as it tries to coax profits from a money-losing Internet effort. Yet to be seen, too, are the full ramifications of the company's move last summer to depart from its soft-core image and bolster its sexy but tame television unit with the purchase of three sexually explicit pay-per-view cable networks: the Hot Network, Hot Zone and Vivid TV. 
Wall Street analysts said the $70 million cable deal was potentially lucrative and even necessary for the company at a time when demand was growing for explicit programming. But the raciness of it put the stock off limits to some institutional investors, contributing to the midyear plunge in Playboy Enterprises' share price in 2001.
For 2001, the company is expected to report a loss of $31.4 million on revenue of $290 million, said Robert G. Routh, an analyst at the investment company Arnhold & S. Bleichroeder. It would be Playboy Enterprises' third consecutive unprofitable year. Playboy had a spate of profitable years in the mid-1990's after investments in its cable television ventures began paying off. 
Financial matters and the shareholders, though, are the problems of Mr. Hefner's daughter, 49, who says, "The single greatest challenge for the company is getting the stock price up." The shares closed Friday at $15.45, down about 22 percent from their 52-week high last summer.
Mr. Hefner, for his part, seems to be too busy enjoying the honors and attention being bestowed upon him as Playboy prepares to observe its 50th anniversary next year. A publishing pioneer who had an instant success with Playboy, whose first issue featured Marilyn Monroe as the nude centerfold, Mr. Hefner is now an elder statesman -- if "elder" is applicable to a man who shows up several nights a week at trendy clubs and parties accompanied by as many as eight platinum-haired girlfriends, some of whom live with him on the hilly five-and-a-half-acre Playboy estate, with its 29 rooms, a zoo, a grotto with whirlpools and mattresses, a 24-hour kitchen and a staff of about 70.
"Viagra was made for me," Mr. Hefner told a visitor.
Last week, Mr. Hefner shared the magazine industry's highest honor, the Henry Johnson Fisher Award, with Richard M. Smith, the chairman and editor in chief of Newsweek. The award was an acknowledgement by the Magazine Publishers of America of Mr. Hefner's impact not only on the magazine business but, for better and, some say, worse, on the nation's post-World War II culture. (Critics range from conservatives to some feminists.)
"Name me another magazine that reflects pop culture as well as we did over the last 50 years," he said. "We're back. We're hot."
To hear a less sanguine, perhaps more realistic view of Playboy, one needs to travel five miles away, to the company's Los Angeles offices, in a plain building on the fringe of Beverly Hills. There, Christie Hefner, one of only a handful of women in the nation running a large public company, expressed some concern that the readership of Playboy magazine -- age 31, on average -- was perhaps getting too old. And she acknowledged that the Playboy brand had not yet proved its value in cyberspace, where the company's offerings include photos and gambling.
By all accounts, she has a warm relationship with her father -- whom she, like almost everyone else in the company, calls Hef. But Ms. Hefner, who lives in Chicago and spends most of her time at corporate headquarters there, indicated that the "symbiotic" father-and-daughter partnership worked best with a certain amount of elbow room. 
"I think he's really happy that I'm doing what I'm doing, and I'm really happy that he's doing what he's doing, and he lives in L.A. and I live in Chicago and that's probably a good thing." 
Ms. Hefner, whose father and schoolteacher mother divorced in 1959, when Christie was 7, began working at Playboy shortly after graduating summa cum laude in English and American literature from Brandeis University in 1974. She worked for a year as a contributing editor for The Boston Phoenix newspaper and then joined Playboy in what she thought was a temporary job on her way to law school. But she quickly moved into high-level marketing, advertising and public relations jobs and has never left.
She took over the company in 1988, three years after her father suffered a stroke, from which he seems to have fully recovered. "It was a stroke of luck," Mr. Hefner is fond of saying now, because he decided to focus full time on the magazine and hand the other businesses over to his daughter.
Ms. Hefner, whose husband, Billy Marovitz, is a businessman and a former Illinois state senator, has a brother, David, 46, a computer programmer in Northern California, who visits the mansion infrequently.
Living in a separate home beside the mansion on the estate is Hugh Hefner's second wife, Kimberley Conrad Hefner. The marriage lasted from 1989 until their separation in 1998. The couple, who are not divorced, have two sons, Marston, 11, and Cooper, 9.
Mr. Hefner controls 70 percent of Playboy's voting stock. He has transferred future control of Playboy Enterprises to his two young sons through a trust, but he has promised that Christie Hefner will head the company for as long as she wants.
"It's not really that complicated," Mr. Hefner said. "She works for me, but I can't fire her."
Ms. Hefner's first big moves were to streamline the company's staff to cut costs, shift the company's licensing away from trinkets to upscale clothing and other items and close the casinos and the Playboy Clubs -- vestigial ventures that had slim profit margins and had "run their course," she said. She has sought to extend the company's brand through international licensing and alliances and with Internet experiments.
The magazine's circulation has hovered around 3.1 million in the last few years, and its advertising pages dropped only 5.4 percent in 2001 -- not dreadful, considering the recession in magazine advertising. Advertising at GQ, for example, dropped about 13 percent last year.
But Playboy faces intense competition from Maxim, an off-color blend of sports, humor and sex -- but no outright nudity -- which was introduced to the United States in 1997, two years after it began in England.
Maxim's circulation in this country has quickly climbed to 2.2 million. And last year, Maxim held on to all but 1 percent of its advertising. 
Ms. Hefner says Playboy has not lost readers to Maxim. "They found a different audience that previously hadn't had a men's magazine," she said. "It's more of a frat boy sensibility."
But the growth of Maxim points to an underlying problem for Playboy. David Verklin, the chief executive of Carat North America, a leading media services company, said Maxim was able to find distributors and advertisers who avoid Playboy.
"Particularly in the Southeast, nudity will limit your distribution in convenience stores and grocery stores," Mr. Verklin said. "And Maxim is getting advertisers that Playboy is not." The major automobile companies, for example, have long refused to advertise in Playboy because of its full nudity.
But "there's a little bit of hypocrisy here," Mr. Verklin. While Maxim does not have full nudity, "we're talking about a piece of clothing the size of a Band-Aid," he said.
The bigger problem, though, in some analysts' view is the septuagenarian Mr. Hefner as the public face of the magazine. Mr. Verklin credits Mr. Hefner as a publishing pioneer and one of the most innovative editors of the last 50 years. And yet, "he's a little bit of an anachronism," Mr. Verklin said. "If you're a 28-year-old guy, you have a hard time relating to him. No one seems to be able to tell him that."
Even if no one dares tell the emperor to put his clothes on, his daughter is pulling the Playboy philosophy into the 21st century. The company's deal in July to acquire the sexually explicit cable channels was driven by the realities of the marketplace, said Robert G. Routh, a senior financial analyst at Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder, one of the few investment firms that follow Playboy. 
"Playboy never wanted to enter the hard core business," Mr. Routh said. "But they realized that if they didn't do it, someone else would."
Ms. Hefner said the racier fare "is a complementary and separate business from the Playboy business" -- one in which the Playboy logo and brand would not be evident. 
"We discovered in the 1990's, through our television business, that the ability for consumers to watch adult movies at home instead of going to a theater was a real business, and the large scale cable companies wanted to be in it," Ms. Hefner said. "I haven't seen any way that this is likely to be hurtful to the company. I think this is a good business opportunity." Analysts say revenue from entertainment will soon overtake the company's revenue from publishing.
Ms. Hefner noted that cable shows on HBO and Showtime, like "Sex and the City," and "Queer as Folk," were fairly explicit and had not stirred much protest. "I think this country is growing up a little bit," she said.
Her father agreed. Mr. Hefner said that when he began Playboy in 1953, with $8,000, most of it borrowed, the nation seemed sexually conservative. "Men's magazines were about action, adventure and male bonding," said Mr. Hefner said. "Even though the magazine was crudely put together at first, the concept was the same then as it is today: a lifestyle magazine from a single man's point of view about a romantic connection between the sexes."
"There was a huge post-war audience hungry and ready for it," Mr. Hefner said. He said his parents were a conservative couple in Nebraska. His mother lent him $1,000 to help put out the first issue. "It made her a millionaire," said Mr. Hefner. "She never read it." 
And he hired his father as an accountant. "He ultimately became treasurer," said Mr. Hefner. "He never read the magazine, either."

The group issued its statement after a review of two decades of studies. Most, it said, found that the children of gay or lesbian parents were as well adjusted socially and psychologically as the children of heterosexual parents. A17

Shift in Political Landscape Recasts Race for Governor
There is a growing sense that a realignment has taken place in New York over the last four years that is forcing the gubernatorial candidates and their advisers to reconsider the way they approach this year's contest. As Gov. George E. Pataki and his two potential Democratic opponents, H. Carl McCall and Andrew M. Cuomo, prepare for the campaign, aides to the candidates seized on different elements of the shift to highlight changes that, they said, benefited their party. A1

Compromise Health Bill
Republican lawmakers have offered a compromise bill requiring health insurers to cover contraceptives, winning the support of birth control advocates and closing much of the gap between their position and the Democrats'. But a key Democratic legislator remains dissatisfied with a provision that would allow insurers to charge deductibles for mammograms, and cast doubt on whether the Democrat-controlled New York Assembly would accept the bill.

New Jersey Deficit Battle
Across-the-board budget cuts, the layoff of more than 1,000 state workers and a freeze in state aid to New Jersey cities and towns announced in Gov. James E.

Despite all the publicity that his belt-tightening has generated, the cuts announced so far will save less than $200 million -- roughly one-fifteenth of the deficit he must eliminate by June 30. B1

HEADLINE: FORUM IN NEW YORK: THE ISSUES; 
Global Forum: Sharing Viewpoints

BYLINE:  By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

 BODY:
There are reasons why the World Economic Forum draws so many powerful people year after year, foremost among them the unparalleled concentration of other powerful people. It is a chance to do business, it is a crash course on what is important, and it is hard to resist an invitation to mingle with the likes of Bill Gates, King Abdullah of Jordan, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Bono.
 But one repeat participant offered another reason. For those who wield power through their corporations, wealth, office or intellect, the Forum, he said, "offers a nonthreatening setting to criticize and be criticized." 
 At a luncheon over poached salmon yesterday, for example, another participant, a fiery European labor leader, harangued his dark-suited colleagues about the dismal plight of workers, warning that there was "a growing bull market" in antiglobalization sentiment out there unless they did something. Outside, in the street, his rage might have been frightening, even violent, and there could be no discussion. In the elegant Waldorf-Astoria function room, the warning drew a polite round of applause and an approving pat on the back of Neil Kearney, the general secretary of the International Textile, Garment and Leather Workers' Federation.
Mr. Kearney was one example of the way in which Klaus Schwab, the founder and organizer of the annual gatherings, has sought to bring some of the street anger that has confronted economic summits in recent years into his exclusive gatherings. If some participants thought it a palliative, no-risk device for the rich and powerful to make a show of caring, there were others who said that at the least, it allowed the satraps to explore the sentiments of a world from which their rank often insulated them.
The New York streets, in fact, proved far less violent than many had feared, and the protesters, with their costumes and tactics intended to caricature the magnates, sometimes seemed more a caricature of protest.
The discussions of social issues were only one portion of a menu that covered a remarkably wide variety of straightforward business questions like "the future of oil," through promotional discussions of individual countries, and on to subjects like the benefits of spontaneous singing.
But it was the sessions that grew out of the issues of the day -- security, terrorism, Islam, American power, antiglobalization -- that drew the largest attendance, often filling the main plenary ballroom and sometimes overflowing, like the discussion early yesterday on "The Paradigm for the Future," starring, among others, Senator Clinton, Zbigniew Brzezinski, the national security adviser under President Jimmy Carter, the billionaire George Soros and the Israeli foreign minister, Shimon Peres. 
With seven panelists and one hour and 45 minutes, it would have been unfair to expect probing depth. Yet the very tumble of concentrated ideas, followed in the same hall with a panel of religious leaders and speeches by leaders of Malaysia, Jordan and Russia, was the sort of forced exposure to the issues of the day that most of the business participants had little time for in their normal working lives.
While business and markets were globalizing, Mr. Soros argued, politics was not, creating a lopsided world. "You can't leave everything to the market," he said. Mr. Peres argued that a modern economy was impossible without openness and decency. Mr. Brzezinski declared that the long-range challenge was to organize the international community "when one country is paramount which is not to be confused with omnipotent."
In session after session, the cascade of images and ideas volleyed across the ornate rooms at the Waldorf-Astoria could be aired without risk of shock, scandal or confrontation. Only one discussion, on the volatility of oil prices, was placed off the record, on the premise that comments by some participants could move markets. But that may have been more for dramatic effect. 
There was often the taste of a palliative. Many speakers, especially religious leaders and often politicians, issued statements that were closer to sermons than arguments.
King Abdullah of Jordan, a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, drew a standing ovation when, in an impassioned defense of Islam, he said, "I reject the false claim that humanity can be slaughtered in the name of the one God, the merciful, the compassionate." Though undoubtedly a reflection of the eloquent monarch's personal faith, and a credo shared in public by virtually all Muslims present, the statement did little to explain why humanity had been slaughtered so recently by Muslims acting in the name of God.
Bono, the singer for the rock group U2, was one of the few speakers who tried to impress on the participants the enormous gap between the injustices and suffering in the world, and the discussions in the elegant salons of the Waldorf-Astoria.
"We are debating in a very casual setting issues that affect real lives," he said. "Discussing barbaric things is itself barbaric. That's why people get annoyed with the World Economic Forum." The credibility of such discussions, he said, was in jeopardy "if we don't follow through with real action."
It was noteworthy that Bono, who has campaigned vigorously on behalf of AIDS issues, debt relief and other causes, was identified in the forum's program as "Composer and Singer, Principal Management, Ireland," a title that appeared to extend to him the same respectability as business executives and national leaders.
Many of these participants would never have raised these issues in public, much less debated them with their critics.
Many foreign participants felt emboldened in so noncombative a setting to criticize the United States and its perceived self-centered policies. Grigory A. Yavlinsky, a Russian parlimentary leader, for instance, described his keen disappointment in the way the Bush administration was treating Russia.
In that same spirit, Senator Clinton acknowledged: "We've certainly not done our fair share to take on the global challenge of health, environment, human rights."

HEADLINE: Mexican Leader Visits Castro to Repair Damaged Ties 

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
President Vicente Fox of Mexico met here today with President Fidel Castro to try to restore a century-old diplomatic relationship that was built on a shared history of popular revolutions but damaged in recent years as Mexico began its transition to a multiparty democracy.
 The meeting between the Mexican president, a conservative businessman who is widely considered a symbol of democratic reform in Latin America, and Mr. Castro, the region's most resilient Communist revolutionary, was compared by experts to a political high-wire act, with Mr. Fox struggling to balance conflicting national and international interests. 
 Despite those pressures, the tone of Mr. Fox's 24-hour visit, the first official trip to Cuba by a Mexican head of state in nearly eight years, was distinctly cordial. One high-ranking Mexican official pronounced that the visit marked the end of Mexico's relationship with the Cuban revolution and the beginning of its relationship with the republic of Cuba.
"A century of diplomatic relations is a symbol of the fraternal links that bind Cuba and Mexico," Mr. Fox said during a ceremony in a restored government palace in Havana's historic center. "The relations between our governments are deep and solid and have endured the toughest tests of time."
Mr. Fox's public agenda focused on Mexico's desire to improve commercial ties with Cuba, which ruptured in the early 1990's with the enactment of new trade restrictions against Cuba in the United States. 
But aides to Mr. Fox said that in several hours of private talks, he broached serious political issues, including the fate of several Cuban political prisoners and his opposition to the United States trade sanctions against Cuba enacted under the Helms-Burton Acts in the 1990's. Although Mr. Fox had publicly denied that he would meet with human rights activists in Cuba, senior Mexican officials indicated that he would meet with a small group of Cuban opposition leaders on Monday.
In the days before his arrival, Mr. Fox, the opposition leader whose election 18 months ago ended the 71-year rule by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, was barraged by conflicting pressures over how stridently, and how publicly, to advocate democratic reforms in Cuba.
Traditional political leaders of the former governing party, which continues to hold a majority in the combative Mexican Congress, urged Mr. Fox to mend fences with Mr. Castro. Mexico's relationship with Cuba, formerly considered one of the most solid alliances in Latin America, had been damaged under Mr. Fox's predecessor, Ernesto Zedillo, who in a speech at a regional summit meeting criticized the Cuban government for denying basic freedoms. President Zedillo's foreign minister, Rosario Green, infuriated the Castro government by meeting a prominent dissident leader in 1999 in the Mexican Embassy.
But weighing against reconciliation were pressures from leaders of Mr. Fox's pro-business National Action Party, who urged Mr. Fox to meet with Cuban dissidents during his visit here. And there were reportedly similar pressures from President Bush, who has raised relations with Mexico to new levels of closeness.
Aides said Mr. Fox aimed to tone down the emotional tenor of Mexico's relationship with Cuba, which has been largely based on popular admiration in Mexico for Mr. Castro's 44-year-old revolution and for his defiance of the United States.
"We want the relationship to evolve in terms of commerce and in terms of regional issues that are important to both governments," said the Mexican foreign minister, Jorge G. Castaneda. "And we want to be able to talk about human rights issues without rancor or conflict." 
During his first year in office, Mr. Fox has abandoned his country's traditional noninterventionist foreign policy principles. When his country won a temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council, Mr. Fox pledged to make Mexico a more active international player on issues ranging from free trade to terrorism and human rights.
Mr. Smith said Mr. Fox's visit to Cuba was aimed at demonstrating that his blossoming friendship with Mr. Bush did not mean that he has forsaken relationships that reach Mexico's roots. The political pressures, however, seemed to have an effect on the visit, which was downgraded from an official state visit to a "working visit," in which Mr. Fox was accompanied by a handful of aides and Mexico's wealthiest businessman, Carlos Slim. 
Mr. Fox spoke only vaguely about his agenda, saying that he wanted to celebrate Mexico's historic relationship with Cuba and wanted to explore new prospects for increasing trade between the two countries.
In interviews on Saturday, several Cuban dissidents continued to hold out hope for a meeting with Mr. Fox.
But Magaly de Armas, wife of Cuba's most prominent political prisoner, Vladimiro Roca said a hurried meeting with Mr. Fox would mean little to her and the plight of some 210 political prisoners in Cuban jails.
"I could care less about some symbolic meeting with me," she said. "I just hope that when President Fox meets with President Castro, he has my husband's name on his lips."

HEADLINE: FORUM IN NEW YORK: PROTESTS; 
A Little Violence And Lots of Police Equal 150 Arrests

BYLINE:  By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
The general calm that had permeated the weekend's protests against the World Economic Forum ended abruptly yesterday afternoon, when chanting and sometimes raucous demonstrators took over stretches of the East Village and the Upper East Side. The actions earned the swift and stern police response that they were meant to attract, and by late evening more than 150 people had been arrested.
 In the first confrontation, hundreds of police officers descended upon the East Village to end a brief cat-and-mouse game with protesters who had stopped traffic. As hundreds of demonstrators and spectators watched -- including, briefly, both Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly -- the police arrested 87 people and led them to vans and buses. 
 Then, as if to provide a coda of protest to the day, hundreds of people left an "earth and animal liberation" rally to roam the Upper East Side. Red paint was spilled, a door and windows of a high-rise apartment building were smashed, and about 70 more people were arrested. 
But for all the street drama, the incidents included virtually none of the violence and property destruction that have marred similar demonstrations in other cities, and seemed almost anticlimactic given the reputations that preceded some of the protesters. Virtually all of the arrests were for nonviolent activity like disorderly conduct and unlawful assembly.
The episodes also illustrated, for the second consecutive day, how thoroughly the Police Department had prepared for the protests against the World Economic Forum, a five-day gathering of world leaders and corporate executives at the Waldorf-Astoria that ends this evening.
"The overwhelming majority of the demonstrators have been peaceful and orderly and we appreciate their cooperation," Mr. Kelly said last night. "However, there has been a small group of hard-core protesters who have attempted to cause trouble. And we have, and we will continue to deal with them firmly and quickly."
On Saturday, daylong rallies in Midtown brought together thousands of people to demonstrate under the watch of thousands of police officers, many of whom wore helmets and carried batons. In the end, though, only 36 people were arrested, including 27 who Mr. Kelly said yesterday were about to attack police officers and storm the Plaza Hotel on Central Park South. The police commissioner praised both the police and the protesters. 
But praise from the police may not have been what some activists desired. At a meeting on Saturday night, a group of anarchists called the Anti-Capitalist Convergence canceled its plans to hold a "scavenger hunt" yesterday, after The New York Times reported that the game was intended to encourage traffic disruption, property damage and other mischief. It was decided instead to stage a more common protest activity, a "snake march," in which a line of people weave haphazardly along sidewalks and streets.
"It's sort of a march that reflects democracy, and everyone decides where it's going to go," said Kate Cooper, an activist. "It's not the sort of thing that's rigidly planned out. It's an anti-authoritarian march."
At 1:30 yesterday afternoon, dozens of people milling outside St. Mark's Church in the Bowery, on 10th Street at Second Avenue, suddenly broke into a snake march, whooping and clapping to the beat of drums, and some waving red flags. The group turned north onto the sidewalks of Second Avenue, chanting "This is what democracy looks like," and "Walking's not dangerous." 
Dozens of police officers were already in the area, as if in anticipation. "It looks like the police had been tipped off," said Eric Laursen, one of the organizers of Saturday's protests who did not participate in yesterday's activity. "They probably had people in our meeting."
Commissioner Kelly acknowledged yesterday that the police had learned that "this type of activity might take place." So, he said, "we deployed a large number of police officers in that area who were ready to make arrests."
At first, though, it seemed that the police did not quite know what to make of the snake march. One senior police official told a subordinate: "Are they violating the law? Give them a chance to violate the law."
That chance came when some of the marchers left the sidewalk and waded onto Second Avenue, their red flags visible above the stopped cars. Over the next few chaotic minutes, people were wrestled to the ground, handcuffed and led away, while reporters and photographers were shoved out of the way, and other demonstrators jeered. 
In the end, according to the police, 34 people were arrested at Second Avenue and 13th Street, and another eight were arrested at First Avenue and 14th Street. But the most intense, drawn-out confrontation between police officers and protesters took place at the intersection of Third Avenue and 12th Street.
Drums beat ominously as demonstrators linked arms and hundreds of police officers assembled with military precision. The thwock-thwock of police helicopters sounded overhead, audible above the chants of "Shame! Shame!" A young woman, appearing no more than 20 years old, began to cry when handcuffs were clasped around her wrists.
It happened that Mayor Bloomberg was a couple of blocks away from the confrontation, eating chicken parmigiana and ziti with the firefighters of Ladder Company 4 on East 13th Street. Dressed in a blue blazer, gray slacks, and black shoes with tassels, he calmly walked south on Third Avenue to the scene, now and then talking quietly with Commissioner Kelly, who was beside him.
After less than five minutes, he turned around and left. As shouts arose from the crowd -- "Let 'em go, Mike!" and "Protect the rich!" -- he climbed into a black sport utility vehicle and was driven away. Moments later, Mr. Kelly walked away as well.
At 3 p.m. -- with police officers armed with pepper spray poised for more action, and other officers peering from surrounding buildings -- a police official shouted through a bullhorn that it was time for the crowd to leave. "If you don't leave the area, you will be arrested for disorderly conduct," he said. Within a half-hour, the crowd had melted away, and buses packed with the arrested drove away. 
But the day's events were not over. At 4 p.m., some four miles to the north, more demonstrators had gathered at 76th Street and Fifth Avenue for a rally being held by the Coalition for Earth and Animal Liberation. A crowd of a dozen or two quickly grew to more than 100 people, who began marching east through one of the city's more exclusive neighborhoods, followed by vans of police officers.
A cluster of demonstrators paused in front of a high-rise apartment building at 188 East 76th Street, which some of the protesters described as the home of a certain corporate executive. With a cluster of demonstrators gathered around, the building's windows were smashed, and red paint was splattered on the building.
Aaron James, 38, an architect from Memphis, who said he had come to take part in a peaceful rally, split off from the main core of marchers at this point. "When they broke the window, I left," he said. "I think it was uncalled for and it's unfortunate. But they're young and inexperienced and it's just poorly expended energy."
Once property had been damaged, scores of police officers swooped in. Three people were arrested, and the protesters split into separate camps that wended through the East Side streets, chanting slogans to the beat of drums. But no matter where they went, there were police officers in front of them, beside them, behind them -- even above them, in helicopters.
Sometime after 5 p.m., the police made clear their impatience. 
As one group of demonstrators continued down Third Avenue, near 60th Street, a police official using a bullhorn announced again: "You are creating a disturbance. You are blocking pedestrian traffic. If you do not walk one or two abreast, you will be arrested."
A standoff developed. But within a few minutes, the police were wading into the group and making arrests, 60 in all. 
Meanwhile, on 59th Street, between Second and Third Avenues, a similar standoff was taking place, in part because the protesters would not -- or could not -- explain their plans. "We asked them, where is it you are trying to go, but they wouldn't tell us and they wouldn't tell their own people," said Detective Kevin A. Czartoryski, a Police Department spokesman who was there.
After a short discussion, the police gave the protesters a choice: Disperse or be arrested. Some protesters opted for the first choice; four took the second, and were promptly handcuffed.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook; 
Singers Smoothly Merge Politics With Patriotism

BYLINE:  By CARYN JAMES 

 BODY:
"Live from Afghanistan" and "Super Bowl" are not words you expect to hear in the same breath, but watching members of the American military send greetings home from Kandahar was not even the strangest part of the nonsports coverage yesterday.
 There was an actor dressed as John Hancock signing the Declaration of Independence and former President George Bush joining the coin toss. 
 Mariah Carey sang the national anthem in a wardrobe and performance that were simple but elegant. (Two words you'd never expect to see in the same sentence as Mariah Carey.) Her straight hair, unadorned blue dress and diamond necklace suited her low-key, inflected delivery of the song. (This couldn't have been an uncalculated way to start turning around that nasty recent publicity about how her record label bought her out, even though her song was taped.) 
Most emblematic, there was Bono, fresh from the World Economic Forum, where on Saturday he had a formal debate with Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and lobbied for the cancellation of third-world debt. Yesterday, he led U2 in a live performance during the halftime show, a one-man walking, talking, singing symbol of how politics and entertainment mixed here. 
Recreating a scene from the group's recent tour, he sang one of U2's most familiar hits, "Where the Streets Have No Name," as the names of the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks scrolled on a screen behind him. For a finale, he opened his black leather jacket to reveal its stars-and-stripes lining.
Yesterday's pregame and halftime shows were, as they were meant to be, jarringly different from most Super Bowl extravaganzas, but it was easy to see where it all came from. Loyalty to sports teams is a close cousin to patriotism; and after Sept. 11, the N.F.L. recast the entertainment, adopting the theme "Heroes, Hope and Homeland."
By now, though, the entertainers seemed to echo too many other tributes. The official pregame show began three hours before the game, but only in the last 40 minutes did the hyped "Tribute to America" begin. It sounded and for a minute even looked like the first big televised fund-raiser, "America: A Tribute to Heroes" (the George Clooney event), as John Travolta, on tape, introduced a live performance of a new song, "Let Freedom Ring," at the Superdome in New Orleans. Written by Barry Manilow, it was sung by him, along with James Ingram, Patti LaBelle and others. It wasn't a memorable song, but then earnestness trumped entertainment throughout the show. Marc Anthony and Mary J. Blige sang "America the Beautiful," the Latino and black singers important parts of this multiethnic all-American cast.
But the more serious the tribute became, the more it seemed as if the usually raucous Fox network had been uncomfortably transformed into the History Channel. There were those re-enactments of the founding fathers, as well as a film in which the Declaration of Independence was read by former N.F.L. players against patriotic backdrops, including two players turned congressmen, Jack Kemp and Steve Largent.
The Boston Pops performed Aaron Copland's "Lincoln Portrait," with film narration read by all the living former presidents, except Ronald Reagan. (Nancy Reagan appeared in place of her husband, who has Alzheimer's disease.) They all looked somber and sadly tired.
The Super Bowl atmosphere returned when Paul McCartney performed "Freedom," a song most first heard at his benefit concert in New York. When he finished, the crowd chanted, "U.S.A.! U.S.A.! But you couldn't help noticing that as a scoreboard in the stadium flashed "Freedom!" there was a smaller illuminated sign next to it that read "Bud Light." 
This is, after all, the television event known for commercials as much as for sports. Britney Spears even did an entertaining commercial moving from the black-and-white 50's to the 90's recreating the styles and theme songs of Pepsi through history.
At the start of the pregame show, Michael Douglas narrated a patriotic segment that called the Super Bowl "this great but unofficial American holiday." Not every network saw it that way. NBC hoped to get viewers (especially young men) to switch over at halftime by scheduling a Playboy Playmate edition of its game show "Fear Factor." ABC threw in the towel with repeats of its series "Alias" and "The Practice," and CBS counterprogrammed with a chick flick, the box office dud "Sabrina."
It's hard to compete with sports and patriotism. During "Freedom," flags of the world were paraded across the field, which looked a lot like an Olympics opening ceremony, a premonition of all the flag-waving still to come our way.
Among all this sentiment, it seemed like a gift when some humor crept in. During halftime Sir Paul, as McCartney was dutifully called, joined the Fox announcers and did an a capella duet of "A Hard Day's Night" with Terry Bradshaw, a scene even goofier than it sounds. Forget the game; that's the moment you want to replay on tape.

HEADLINE: America and Anti-Americans 

BYLINE:  By Salman Rushdie; Salman Rushdie is the author of "Fury: A Novel" and the forthcoming essay collection "Step Across This Line."

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
They told us it would be a long, ugly struggle, and so it is. America's war against terror has entered its second phase, a phase characterized by the storm over the status and human rights of the prisoners held at Camp X-Ray and by the frustrating failure of the United States to find Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar. Additionally, if America now attacks other countries suspected of harboring terrorists it will almost certainly do so alone. In spite of the military successes, America finds itself facing a broader ideological adversary that may turn out to be as hard to defeat as militant Islam: anti-Americanism, which is presently becoming more evident everywhere.
 The good news is that these post-Taliban days are bad times for Islamist fanatics. Dead or alive, Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar look like yesterday's men, unholy warriors who forced martyrdom on others while running for the hills themselves. Also, if the persistent rumors are to be believed, the fall of the terrorist axis in Afghanistan may well have prevented an Islamist coup against President Pervez Musharraf in Pakistan, led by the more Taliban-like elements in the armed forces and intelligence services -- people like the terrifying General Hamid Gul. And President Musharraf, no angel himself, has been pushed into arresting the leaders of the Kashmiri terrorist groups he used to encourage. 
 Around the world, the lessons of the American action in Afghanistan are being learned. Jihad is no longer quite as cool an idea as it was last fall.
States under suspicion of giving succor to terrorism have suddenly been trying to make nice, even going so far as to round up a few bad guys. Iran has accepted the legitimacy of the new Afghan government. Even Britain, a state which has been more tolerant of Islamist fanaticism than most, is beginning to distinguish between resisting "Islamophobia" and providing a safe haven for some of the worst people in the world.
America did, in Afghanistan, what had to be done, and did it well. The bad news, however, is that these successes have not won new friends for the United States outside Afghanistan. In fact, the effectiveness of the American campaign may have made some parts of the world hate America more than they did before. Critics of the Afghan campaign in the West are enraged because they have been shown to be wrong at every step: no, American forces weren't humiliated the way the Russians had been; and yes, the air strikes did work; and no, the Northern Alliance didn't massacre people in Kabul; and yes, the Taliban did crumble away like the hated tyrants they were, even in their southern strongholds; and no, it wasn't that difficult to get the militants out of their cave fortresses; and yes, the various factions succeeded in putting together a new government that seems to have broad support among the people.
Meanwhile, those elements in the Arab and Muslim world who blame America for their own feelings of political impotence are feeling more impotent than ever. As always, anti-American radicalism feeds off widespread anger over the plight of the Palestinians, and it remains true that nothing would undermine the fanatics' propaganda more completely than an acceptable settlement in the Middle East.
However, even if that settlement were arrived at tomorrow, anti-Americanism would probably not abate. It has become too useful a smokescreen for Muslim nations' many defects -- their corruption, their incompetence, their oppression of their citizens, their economic, scientific and cultural stagnation. America-hating has become a badge of identity, making possible a chest-beating, flag-burning rhetoric of word and deed that makes men feel good. It contains a strong streak of hypocrisy, hating most what it desires most, and elements of self-loathing. ("We hate America because it has made of itself what we cannot make of ourselves.") What America is accused of -- closed-mindedness, stereotyping, ignorance -- is also what its accusers would see if they looked into a mirror.
These days there seem to be as many of these accusers outside the Muslim world as inside it. Anybody who has visited Britain and Europe, or followed the public conversation there during the past five months, will have been struck, even shocked, by the depth of anti-American feeling among large segments of the population. Western anti-Americanism is an altogether more petulant phenomenon than its Islamic counterpart and far more personalized. Muslim countries don't like America's power, its "arrogance," its success; but in the non-American West, the main objection seems to be to American people. Night after night, I have found myself listening to Londoners' diatribes against the sheer weirdness of the American citizenry. The attacks on America are routinely discounted. ("Americans only care about their own dead.") American patriotism, obesity, emotionality, self-centeredness: these are the crucial issues.
It would be easy for America, in the present climate of hostility, to fail to respond to constructive criticism, or worse: to start acting like the overwhelming superpower it is, making decisions and throwing its weight around without regard for the concerns of what it perceives as an already hostile world. The treatment of the Camp X-Ray detainees is a worrying sign. Secretary of State Colin Powell's reported desire to determine whether, under the Geneva Convention, these persons should be considered prisoners of war was a statesmanlike response to global pressure -- but Mr. Powell has apparently failed to persuade President Bush and Donald Rumsfeld.
The Bush administration has come a long way from its treaty-smashing beginnings. It should not abandon consensus-building now. Great power and great wealth are perhaps never popular, yet, more than ever, we need the United States to exercise its power and economic might responsibly. This is not the time to ignore the rest of the world and decide to go it alone. To do so would be to risk losing after you've won.

HEADLINE: Sharon Enters Armistice Talks 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

 BODY:
In the wake of President Bush's stern warning to state sponsors of terror, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel felt the time was ripe to open direct truce talks with a troika of Palestinian leaders other than Yasir Arafat.
 After Palestinian sources leaked word of their first meeting in Jerusalem last Wednesday night, Sharon felt free to give me his telephonic account of what could be the start of a true truce process with the veteran Palestinian negotiators known as Abu Ala, Abu Mazen and Muhammad Rashid. 
 "I wanted to hear from them directly what they wanted," he recounted, "and I wanted to be sure they know our message. Our demands are: one, arrest all the terrorists and their commanders and conduct real interrogations. We all know who ordered the murder of one of our ministers, and how much was paid the two murderers -- 200 shekels. And we know who approved the purchase of the 50 tons of munitions from Iran. 
"Two, dismantle Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front, Tanzin and Arafat's Force 17 -- half of our casualties were caused by Arafat's presidential guard and Tanzin. Three, confiscate all weapons and hand them over to U.S. representatives to be destroyed, as signed at Wye long ago."
But why --
"I have two left. Four, take strong preventive steps to stop terror before it strikes, and five, stop incitement of their people." But since these Palestinians report to Arafat, why not deal directly with the top man?
"When Arafat got the names and addresses of the worst terrorist from us two months ago -- and did nothing -- he made himself irrelevant. That day I decided that with him, we cannot talk any more." 
And what did the Palestinians want?
"One, they wanted us to stop the targeted killings of the terrorist leaders. We call them 'interceptions.' We used to call them 'removal from our society.' They are killings, of course, and that is hardest for them to accept."
Two? (The former general's orderly mind imposes a certain structure on an interview.)
"Make it easier for the population. Three, enable Arafat to leave Ramallah. Four, stop acting in Zone A, and open the roads. I told them we had no intention of staying in areas already given to them, but if they would not make arrests, we would take from their beds their terrorists and put them in our prisons. If that's inconvenient, you arrest them."
Sounded to me like little progress, but he disagreed. "For the first time, we each understood what we really want most. I told them I want to meet again when I get back from the U.S. this week. This first meeting was important. I really want to move this forward."
Not with Arafat?
"He must be put under heavier pressure than ever, from America, from Europeans, from us. I know these men report to him, but that makes no difference. At the current time, he's too influential for somebody else to get up and take over -- therefore, everything depends on pressure on Arafat."
Sharon paused, and spoke with deliberation about his longtime enemy: "Everybody knows there is criticism among top Palestinians of Arafat. If we want steps taken, the pressure must grow -- no visits from him, no missions to him. Only then will there be a chance to have different, more pragmatic leadership." 
In his opening conversation with the three Palestinian leaders, was the outline of a general agreement discussed? 
"I told them how I saw it possible to move forward. It's not possible now to reach an overall agreement with decisions on borders. These are talks about reaching a cease-fire, and I'll conduct these myself now. Once it's quiet, we can reach a state of non-belligerency. Later we can reach the permanent agreement phase."
Turning to President Bush's threat to terrorist-sponsoring states of Iraq, Iran and North Korea, I recalled how Sharon a decade ago criticized Israel's restraint under Iraqi missile attack in the Persian Gulf war. If Saddam Hussein, attacked by the U.S., lashed out again, would Israel hold back? 
"We won't be able to sit by. One dangerous development is the increased activity between Iran and Iraq. They are discussing the possibility of Iranian planes flying over Iraq to Damascus, part of the airlift of weapons, especially rockets, and then by truck through Syria to the Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon. If there is a reaction from Iraq from any direction, we will be ready for that." 
As reported here before the capture of the Iranian-Palestinian terror ship with explosives intended to blow up Israeli civilians, Sharon is most concerned about Iran. "Iranians are active among a small number of Israeli Arabs, trying to recruit suicide bombers and espionage agents, but most prefer a normal life. Iran calls for the destruction of the state of Israel and elimination of the Jewish people. That's why it was so important for President Bush to name them as sponsors of terror last week." 
(At the World Economic Forum, I asked the Iranian diplomat Mohammed Adeli about the Iran-to-Palestinian terror ship caught red-handed and the discussions about munitions overflights of Iraq: "complete fabrications," he fabricated.) 
Can Sharon, in stepping in to personally conduct cease-fire talks, steer between a band of Israeli Army reservist refuseniks on the left and Bibi Netanyahu's call for toppling the Palestinian Authority on the right? 
"Too busy to worry about that," says the prime minister, eager to compare notes with Bush this week. "We have to solve our economic problems, save Argentina's Jews, combat anti-Semitism in France, achieve a cease-fire. But I'll be able to manage it."

HEADLINE: Acrobatic Ape in Java Is in High-Wire Survival Struggle 

BYLINE:  By MARK DERR 

 BODY:
Their heads and bare faces fringed by Bozo the Clown hair, high-flying gibbons are often called the greatest acrobats of the animal kingdom. Using their hands like hooks, these small apes swing through the canopies of Southeast Asian rain forests at breakneck speed, often leaping 30 feet between tree limbs.
 Among the few monogamous primates, gibbons are also great vocalizers: their songs and cries carry more than a mile. Yet nearly all nine species of gibbon are imperiled through much of their range -- none more than the silvery gibbon, named for its distinctive color and found only on the Indonesian island of Java. 
 Experts estimate that in the last 25 years, the number of silvery gibbons has plummeted to fewer than 2,000 and perhaps fewer than 400 from 20,000. The pressure on the surviving animals is enormous, with many barely hanging on in shrinking fragments of forest, said Dr. Don J. Melnick, executive director of the Center for Environmental Research and Conservation and a professor of biology at Columbia University. 
Dr. Melnick and a team of researchers from the United States and Indonesia recently completed a genetic study of silvery gibbons and found that the species split around 100,000 years ago into two groups or lineages. The researchers have proposed that wildlife officials manage those two lineages separately to let them follow what appears to be a natural evolution that could ultimately lead to a new subspecies or even a new species, though no one can predict how long that may take.
That approach will also prevent the loss, through interbreeding, of groups of genes that have evolved and now work together to provide each lineage with unique characteristics, like immunity to certain diseases, Dr. Melnick said. (The Indonesian government, preoccupied with political and economic turmoil, has not acted on the researchers' proposal.) 
While potentially significant for the long-term survival of silvery gibbons, the research also shows the way genetic, demographic, behavioral and ecological studies are increasingly being used to understand the relationships among groups of animals that have become fragmented and genetically isolated through habitat loss and other human activities. Researchers can then plan ways to overcome those problems in the wild, avoiding costly and largely ineffective captive breeding programs.
"A hidden time bomb in today's world is the loss of genetic diversity within species," Dr. Melnick said. His conservation genetics laboratory at the research center -- a joint venture of Columbia, the Wildlife Conservation Society, the American Museum of Natural History, the New York Botanical Garden and the Wildlife Trust -- is working to try to keep that bomb from exploding for more than 100 endangered species, from salamanders and toads to Asian elephants and Java rhinos.
Where groups are isolated in dangerously low numbers from other members of their species, the loss of genetic variability through inbreeding becomes a major threat to survival, says Dr. Alan R. Templeton, a professor of biology and genetics at Washington University in St. Louis. Inbred groups can develop dangerous mutations, lose their resistance to infection and disease and easily fall prey to environmental upheaval. Potentially beneficial genetic and behavioral adaptations that appear in the isolated group cannot spread through the species.
When isolated groups cannot be linked through protected wildlife corridors, humans must move animals around to try to restore historic gene flows, said Dr. Keith A. Crandall, an assistant professor of zoology at Brigham Young University. Java and other islands of Indonesia present particular problems for such intervention with a number of species. One of the most densely populated islands in the world, with 115 million people, Java has lost 91 percent of its forests, and the expanding population demands ever more land. Protection of forests and animals is poor, conservationists say.
"Keeping land in Java free from development is very difficult," Dr. Noviar Andayani, secretary of the Center for Biodiversity and Conservation Science at the University of Indonesia, said in a telephone interview from Jakarta. "With the current economic crisis, there are even more problems."
Dr. Andayani, Dr. Melnick and three collaborators published their analysis of the silvery gibbons' mitochondrial DNA -- that is, DNA inherited through the mother -- and recommendations for saving the endangered apes in the June 2001 Journal of Conservation Biology.
Java's last silvery gibbons are confined to 23 isolated parks and unprotected patches of lowland evergreen rain forests, Dr. Andayani said. Some of those forest fragments hold no more than 10 gibbons, a number that cannot sustain itself. Gibbons are easy prey for people and dogs when they try to cross farms, she added, and an illegal pet trade further depletes their numbers.
The more stable of the two silvery gibbon groups, called the western lineage, numbers in the hundreds and lives in and near Gunung Halimun National Park. The central lineage, also in the hundreds, occupies scattered pockets of forests and parks on the east side of the peaks around Gunung Salak, which can rise above 6,000 feet. (Gunung means mountain.)
Although the reasons for the initial split between the two lineages are still unknown, the researchers suggest that silvery gibbons find the high montane forests around Gunung Salak inhospitable and refuse to enter them. Dr. Andayani plans more detailed studies of the region to make sure no silvery gibbons live there and to try to determine when and why the area became a barrier.
The genetic split in silvery gibbons is ancient enough, at 100,000 years, that the scientists have recommended against a plan to mix the western and central populations unless there is no other way to preserve the species. The researchers propose instead to move animals between forest fragments to increase genetic diversity within the central groups. The plan is to capture young gibbons preparing to leave their families and take them to other carefully selected areas.
The decision to link isolated groups of animals requires a complex analysis of how and why their genetic differences arose. Wildlife biologists must determine whether the differences result from natural processes, like shifts in geology or climate, or from human activities, said Dr. Rodney L. Honeycutt, a professor of genetics at Texas A & M. Researchers should also examine whether the isolated group fills a different ecological niche or exhibits unique behavior, Dr. Honeycutt added.
If the genetic differences result from human activities or are not very pronounced, a number of experts say, the isolated group should be brought back into the greater species gene pool. But if the genetic split appears to be the result of natural processes or the group shows signs of unique behavioral and ecological adaptations, scientists should avoid interbreeding. And the final decision should emphasize preserving as many animals and as much variability as possible, even if that means losing some unique characteristics.
"Philosophically, what we are trying to do is preserve adaptive diversity," said Dr. Robert Wayne, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California at Los Angeles, "and we have to develop a framework for doing that."
Many experts agree that the most successful genetic recovery program to date involved the introduction of eight Texas cougars to South Florida in 1995 to alleviate intensive inbreeding that was driving the elusive Florida panther to extinction. Wildlife biologists acknowledge that the panthers remain geographically isolated and will probably require infusions of new genes about every 20 years. But for now they have been revitalized.
In recent years the tools for genetic analysis have grown stronger and more complex. Examining DNA, biologists can identify individual animals and their lineage, measure their age and determine whether they are breeding.
In 1995, Dr. Templeton, of Washington University, created a computer program to determine genetic relationships among and within species based on an examination of specific haplotypes, clusters of genes that are inherited as a unit. The program helps researchers determine whether groups of animals have become fragmented because of natural forces or human actions, he wrote in the March 2001 issue of the journal Molecular Ecology.
It is available to other researchers through Dr. Crandall's Web site at Brigham Young. The program also indicates whether a given group of animals represents hybrids between two distinct species or subspecies and, tracking the spread of specific mutations, reveals the historical movement of animals into new territory, Dr. Templeton said. It also points to "natural and historical forces that contribute to speciation."
But if sophisticated genetic studies are to become more than academic records of the path to extinction, scientists say, then officials and people concerned about conservation must commit themselves to preserving land and animals, and scientists and conservationists must find ways to increase legal protection and public support for imperiled animals like the acrobatic silvery gibbon.
Providing those "adorable creatures" a future in their native habitat, said Dr. Andayani of the University of Indonesia, will also benefit a host of other animals struggling to survive in the vanishing Javan rain forest.

HEADLINE: Alien Invaders Reshape the American Landscape 

BYLINE:  By CAROL KAESUK YOON 

 BODY:
In the summer of 1904, Hermann Merkel, the chief forester at the Bronx Zoo, noticed that a few of the majestic American chestnut trees lining the zoo's walkways had developed a mysterious new disease. The next year, nearly every chestnut tree in the parks of the Bronx had the disease. And by the 1950's it had spread from Maine to Georgia, killing billions of chestnut trees and changing the East's wooded landscapes forever.
 Merkel had discovered the disaster known as chestnut blight, giving scientists their first bitter taste of the imported diseases that have been sweeping through American forests ever since. 
 The best known are chestnut blight and Dutch elm disease, both of which are believed to have come from Asia and are still attacking trees today. But scientists say a host of devastating forest pathogens have continued to arrive. Among the most recent is sudden oak death syndrome, which has killed thousands of oaks and other trees in California and may threaten the mighty redwood as well. 
Fast-moving and usually hard or impossible to cure, these exotic diseases have destroyed countless trees in forests, cities and suburbs. The results can be seen not only in landscapes stripped of some of their most beautiful species but in changes to how forest ecosystems work and in the economic value of this natural resource.
"I get concerned about what the forests of the future will look like," said Dr. Craig G. Lorimer, a forest ecologist at the University of Wisconsin. "To have so many diseases cause so many problems over such a short period of time is really unprecedented. You get this impression that clear-cutting is the most devastating thing that's ever happened to North American forests, and it's not. This is much more serious."
As world trade intensifies, scientists predict that more and more tree diseases will find their way into the country (and out of it). And while most pathogens die on arrival, unable to find a suitable victim or climate, a small portion turn into devastating blights. According to a report last month from the National Academy of Sciences, about 13,000 plant diseases a year are intercepted by inspectors at international ports of entry -- and these inspectors are able to examine perhaps 2 percent of the incoming cargo and baggage.
The effect of such invasions is clear. A fungus called dogwood anthracnose has killed millions of flowering dogwoods in the southern Appalachians alone, essentially wiping out the species in many areas. In the Southeast, butternut canker has hit butternut trees so hard that the species has been listed as threatened in at least one state, Tennessee, and has been declared a species of special concern, a prelude to consideration for federal listing as threatened or endangered. 
In the Northwest, an imported root disease is killing off Port Orford cedars, whose wood can be worth as much as $50,000 for a single, mature tree. And the list goes on. If imported insects are included among the pests, the casualty list grows even longer; some species are attacked by both kinds of imported pest.
Dr. Don Goheen, a plant pathologist with the United States Forest Service in Medford, Ore., who works with Port Orford cedars, echoed the comments of others, saying: "These introduced diseases are bad news. We're run ragged by them." 
Though the devastation goes on around the country, it has received little notice outside the community of forest researchers -- largely, scientists say, because a diseased tree can take years to die and its loss is not always evident to the casual observer.
"When you look out there you don't have a barren moonscape," said Dr. Scott E. Schlarbaum, a forest geneticist at the University of Tennessee. "You have a forest. But that forest is very different than it was 100 years ago."
The loss is most likely to be noticed when the tree is prized for its beauty. The rapid spread of dogwood anthracnose, a fungal disease that begins with spotting leaves and soon ends in the death of the tree, has robbed many communities of flowering dogwoods, long a joyful herald of spring.
Dr. Mark Windham, a plant pathologist at the University of Tennessee, says the disease is attacking Pacific dogwoods in the West and flowering dogwoods in the East, with the southern Appalachians hardest hit.
In 1989, Dr. Windham said, he saw 20,000 healthy trees on Lookout Mountain in Tennessee go under. "They became fully blighted in two weeks," he said. "In three years most were dead." 
Researchers estimate that in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, 60 percent of the dogwoods have been killed by the disease. But even this well-traveled area may not look too bad to the casual visitor: roadside dogwoods do well, exposed to sunshine, which the fungus dislikes. "Tourists don't tend to get out of their cars, so they might not see much," Dr. Windham said. "Several hundred feet into the woods they'd see a different picture."
Likewise, dogwoods in sunny yards can escape unscathed.
Besides being beautiful, dogwoods play a number of roles in the forest. The leaves have high levels of calcium, making them a primary food for lactating deer. In addition, the calcium in decaying leaves keeps soils from becoming too acidic, a growing concern now that dogwoods have disappeared from so many areas. And the outer coat of the berries is 20 percent fat, making them a crucial source of energy, for example, for songbirds.
Likewise, animals are thought to have suffered when chestnuts disappeared. Before 1900, one out of every four trees in the East was an American chestnut, an abundant hardwood and a hearty nut producer. Dr. Frederick V. Hebard, staff pathologist at the American Chestnut Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the Herculean task of restoring the tree, says oaks and hickories typically produce hundreds of pounds of nuts per acre -- but when chestnut trees were also present, that same acre produced thousands of pounds of nuts. Chestnuts were said to have covered the ground like marbles.
The bounty was devoured by chipmunks, voles, bear, deer, turkey, grouse, crows and people. (The roasted chestnuts sold by street vendors generally come from Europe).)
In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, "people moved here expressly to get land up on Clinch Mountain, where there were so many chestnuts you could set pigs out to forage in the fall," said Dr. Hebard, speaking from the foundation's field station in Virginia. "Before there were ever cowboys in America, there were pigboys, herding up pigs on horseback and setting them loose to forage."
Rare trees are being hit hard, too. Butternut or white walnut trees, which produce a beautiful wood favored by carvers and cabinetmakers, have nearly been wiped out in the Southeast by butternut canker, a fungus whose country of origin is unknown.
Among the most worrisome pests from abroad are the various species of Phytophthora, a group of funguslike organisms that includes the culprit that caused the Irish potato famine in the 19th century. Another species of Phytophthora, whose origins remain mysterious, showed up in native forests in the 1950's, attacking the roots of Port Orford cedars. It continues to attack them today.
In addition to being a highly valuable commercial wood, these cedars are critical to Northwestern forests. Their fibrous root systems shore up river banks, and their durable wood, once fallen in a river, provides important fish habitat -- critical functions where many species of salmon are struggling.
Yet another species of Phytoph thora has been found to cause sudden oak death syndrome, which has jumped to 14 different plant species since it was first noticed in 1995. Last month, researchers at the University of California reported finding DNA evidence of the disease on dying redwood shoots. Scientists are continuing laboratory tests to see whether the new disease can indeed kill this beloved species, or whether something else is doing in the redwood shoots.
Sometimes these imported diseases can be treated, if caught early and if enough fungicide is applied or enough limbs are cut off. But such expensive cures are usually attempted only for individual trees on private property. Cures on a forestwide scale are, in general, impossible. Even curbing the spread of the diseases is difficult, as many travel as tiny wind-borne or water-borne spores or on insects flying from tree to tree.
Instead, researchers are seeking to identify and breed disease-resistant trees. In some cases, for example with chestnuts, researchers are creating hybrid trees that are a mixture of resistant foreign species and natives. In other cases, nature itself provides the answer.
In Catoctin Mountain Park in Maryland, where nearly all the dogwoods have died, researchers discovered one thriving dogwood whose branches were entwined with several others that had died. That tree has since given rise to a disease-hardy line known as Appalachian Spring, which has just become available for sale.
And scientists say one lesson that has come from these blights is the importance of diversity, particularly in planted landscapes. The graceful branches of the Dutch elm, for example, once arched over streets in nearly every city and town. Scientists say its very popularity may have led to the epidemic.
"People came west with this vision that that's what a street should look like," said Dr. George Ware, a tree scientist at the Morton Arboretum in Lisle, Ill. They planted row upon row of the elegant vase-shaped tree, producing a monoculture ripe for an epidemic.
"We really brought about the devastation," said Dr. Karel Jacobs, a tree pathologist at the Morton Arboretum. "We loved them too much." 
As a result, Dr. Jacobs said, researchers urge managers to plant more diversified landscapes to help slow or prevent the spread of diseases. Yet she added that most cities and towns remained worrisomely undiversified, with a handful of favored trees in abundance.
Still, hope lives on, even for chestnuts. Dr. Hebard says that in undisturbed forests there are billions of chestnut sprouts that have been growing since the original epidemic decades ago, still too small to be hit by the disease. One promising avenue of research is work on viruses that can attack the chestnut blight fungus attacking the tree.
But while many scientists aim for a return to the forests of old, some researchers say that goal is unrealistic.
"The concept was always that disease is bad, but that paradigm has shifted," said Dr. John Castello, a forest pathologist at State University of New York's College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse. Disease can perform functions like killing weak trees and releasing nutrients for other plants. "The question really is, how much disease is enough?" he went on. "That's what foresters and pathologists are trying to determine now."
People, he said, should move from the notion that the only good forest was the one that was here before Europeans arrived. "The idea that everything will remain the same without change is just wrong," he said. "Change is the rule."

HEADLINE: BANK ACCOUNTS; 
The Middle Class Struggles to Find Dollars

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER L. RICH

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
With banks and exchange houses closed today, the first day of a two-day emergency bank holiday declared this weekend, black market dollar-dealers -- known as arbolitos, or little trees, for all of their green -- are doing brisk business in the city center.
 On Wednesday, when the government's partial relaxation of month-old restrictions on bank withdrawals takes effect, the early morning lines in front of downtown exchange houses, while normally large, are expected to wrap around the block. 
 As the bankrupt government does everything it can to stop Argentines from cashing out of the insolvent banking system, the desperate and mostly middle-class depositors have been scrambling to stay one step ahead of the restrictions, trying everything, from boat trips to Uruguay to buying shares on the Buenos Aires stock market, to protect their wealth.
"It's a shame, but Argentines tend to expend more energy trying to get around the system that is in place than coming up with new solutions to our problems," said Nicolas Ducote, executive director of the Center for the Implementation of Public Policy for Equity and Growth, a research group known here as Cippec. 
After years of economic upheaval and hyperinflation, Argentines began depositing money in the banks in huge amounts by the mid-1990's, believing in the strength of the 1991 convertibility plan, which pegged the peso to the dollar. Deposits swelled from $41 billion in 1995 to $89 billion by the end of January 2001, according to Central Bank figures.
But the confidence was in the dollar, and that is where Argentines sought refuge when government finances started to weaken significantly last year as a result of a four-year recession. By the time the government clamped down on bank withdrawals and transfers in December, deposits had fallen to $69 billion. Around $2 billion more has left the banking system since then.
The capital flight has been so pronounced that prosecutors and government officials have opened a series of investigations here, saying that bankers may have illegally spirited hundreds of millions of dollars out of the country before or even after restrictions were imposed.
Last week, the Argentine judge running one of the investigations, Maria Servini de Cubria, said that a local bank, Banco General de Negocios, in which J. P. Morgan Chase, Credit Suisse First Boston and Dresdner Bank are minority shareholders, may have been the vehicle for an illegal transfer of $70 million or more out of the country after the withdrawal restrictions were put in place.
Part of that investigation was suspended after the supreme court ruled Friday that the banking freeze was unconstitutional, but the vice president of the bank, Jose Rohm, remains in custody. A J. P. Morgan spokeswoman in New York said the bank was cooperating with the investigation but declined to provide further details.
Unlike most of the country's wealthy, who private bankers say saw what was coming down the pike and sent their money abroad as much as a year ago, the middle class has had to find ways around the constantly changing restrictions -- or the reports, often unfounded, of more.
In the days immediately after the government's ban on money transfers abroad, hundreds of millions of dollars were deposited in banks in Uruguay, just a short boat ride across the Rio de la Plata. Customs officials across Argentina are now on alert to stop people with bulging suitcases of cash. Last week, a woman was stopped at the Buenos Aires international airport trying to get on a flight to Brazil with $70,000 in her carry-on bags.
Partly as a result of rumors that the government would ask foreign banks to freeze Argentine assets held outside the country, many Argentines withdrew dollars from the bank and stuck them in safe deposit boxes. Then last week, a rumor that the government was going to confiscate the contents of safe deposit boxes sent Argentines scrambling to the bank to empty them out. Much of Argentina's wealth may now be locked up in home safes or mattresses.
Some people with money caught in the withdrawal freeze were able to transfer money into brokerage accounts and buy stock on the Buenos Aires exchange. Local shares could then be converted into dollar-denominated American depository receipts on the New York Stock Exchange. The Merval stock index has jumped around 130 percent since the middle of November, to levels not seen since last June.
Experts say that some business owners with access to the export market will return to a practice common in the 1980's of hoarding dollars abroad by undervaluing exports and overvaluing imports.
"Say my product is worth $10," Mr. Ducote of Cippec explains. "I send it abroad with a bill for $5, and the importer deposits the other $5 for me in a foreign bank account."
Many Argentines do not plan to stick around long enough to work around the system. Middle-class Argentines of Spanish, Italian or Polish descent have been lining up at embassies around town looking to claim dual citizenship and seek a better life abroad.
Most everyone agrees that the money is not going to be returning anytime soon. That is bad news for Eduardo Costantini, a local businessman who founded the Museum of Latin American Art in Buenos Aires last year and relies on donations to finance the rotating exhibits.
"Convertibility was supposed to be the solution for Argentina, but the public institutions were all mismanaged -- all of them: the court, the pension funds, everything," Mr. Costantini said. "Not only do families have much less than before, but they have suffered great psychological damage."

To the Editor:
Re "When $450,000 Will Buy Just a Starter Home" (news article, Jan. 31):
 Santa Cruz is not the only California town in which exorbitant housing prices upset the economic and social ecology. 
In Santa Barbara, the median price for a starter home has risen from the mid-$300,000 range (in 1997) to more than $650,000 today. 
 Increasingly, people buying homes in Santa Barbara are wealthy retirees, not the teachers, nurses, police, fire and middle-class public and private-sector workers who form the heart of a regional economy. While the new residents make good neighbors, they do not provide the skills that are lost when more productive residents are priced out of the housing market. 
How will this situation be resolved in towns like Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara? Perhaps when housing prices collapse to an affordable level because of the steep decline in essential services. Eventually, even the retirees need to visit the hospital.

HEADLINE: THE GOVERNMENT; 
Turmoil Grows as Argentine Fiscal Crisis Deepens

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
The Argentine government ordered the country's banks to stop dealing in foreign currency today and to hand over all the dollars they had to the central bank. The moves extended the steps the government took on Sunday to convert all dollar-denominated debts and deposits in the country to pesos at rates far below those offered on the open market. 
 To forestall resistance to its emergency economic plan, the government imposed a six-month ban on legal challenges, specifically to its refusal to lift a two-month-old freeze on bank accounts that the Supreme Court has declared unconstitutional. 
 The government extended the central bank's control by ordering that no transfers of foreign exchange abroad, including the remittance of corporate profits, be permitted without authorization from the central bank. The restriction, coming after more than a decade in which the American dollar and the peso were used almost interchangeably here, is said to be only temporary, but government officials have given no indication of when it might be lifted. 
Central bank approval of money transfers abroad "has a certain odor of state intervention," said Rafael Ber of Argentine Research, an economic analysis firm here. "It's one of the safeguards of a market that isn't all that free," despite the government's intention to let the peso float against the dollar, he said.
The order to turn over dollars to the central bank, in turn, strengthens the government's ability to withstand any run on the peso that might occur when banks and exchange houses are allowed to resume doing business on Wednesday. Economy Minister Jorge Remes Lenicov said on Sunday night that the country had about $14 billion in foreign currency reserves, or more than double the total amount of pesos in circulation.
One banker said he was happy to send his dollars to the central bank and close his foreign exchange operations because "it gives people one less thing to be mad at us about." 
Privately, though, banks have been extremely critical of the government's decision to allow debtors to pay dollar obligations in pesos at a one-to-one rate but convert bank deposits at 1.4 to 1. A dollar was worth about 2 pesos on the open market today. 
Government officials estimate that the conversion to pesos will inflict losses of as much as $14 billion on banks here. The Argentine Bank Association had no immediate comment on the measures taken today, but Eduardo Amadeo, press spokesman for President Eduardo Duhalde, said the government was operating on the assumption that no large foreign bank would close its operations here as a result of the move. 
"There was talk at the beginning" of the crisis that such a thing might happen, he acknowledged, but most banks "have a high level of reserves, so they can withstand" the situation. "Citibank and Bank of Boston have been in Argentina since the 1920's, so just imagine the number of crises they have been through," he added. 
The six-month ban on lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the government's actions appears intended to give the Duhalde administration time to replace the Supreme Court with one that is less hostile. On Friday, by 6 to 3, the justices ruled that a freeze on bank accounts, imposed two months ago to head off a feared run by depositors worried about a devaluation, was unconstitutional because it "annihilates" the principle of private property. 
The government plan announced on Sunday night eased, but did not entirely eliminate, the bank restrictions imposed late last year. That drew criticism in the press that the executive branch was deliberately defying a court ruling. Lawyers predicted that thousands of account holders would quickly file new suits to recover their money. 
Mr. Amadeo said the government was not violating the constitution by prohibiting account holders from going to court to defend their rights until August. The step taken today "is foreseen in cases of a super-emergency" and has been invoked in the past, he said. In any case, he added, the measure "does not suspend rights, but simply slows down lawsuits." 
More than 2,700 legal challenges to the banking restrictions were filed in January, according to court officials. More than 700 additional complaints have been filed in just two workdays this month, including many today that also question the constitutionality of the government's latest decree. 
In the Argentine Congress, two new impeachment complaints against all nine members of the court were filed today, joining 28 accusations of "improper performance" of duty already on file against individual justices. An initial vote may be possible "within 20 to 30 days" because the accusations are so "solid and resounding," the chairman of the congressional commission investigating the charges, Sergio Acevedo, told reporters today. 
"Each and every member of the court is going to be tried," Mr. Acevedo said, adding that requests for retirement benefits filed recently by some justices had also been suspended. "Charges have been proffered against every single one of them."
The new banking measures and other concerns about the course of the crisis in Argentina contributed to sharp declines today in stock indexes in neighboring Brazil and in Spain, where a number of major banks, utilities and other companies have major interests in Argentina.

HEADLINE: Israeli's Dual Job: Chief of Defense, and Dissent 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
After 16 months of grinding conflict with the Palestinians, a few signs of dissent are appearing in Israeli society.
 More than 100 reserve officers and soldiers have signed a statement that they will not serve any longer in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, lands Israel took in the 1967 war. The left-wing group Peace Now, muted for months, is about to begin demonstrations demanding that Israel "get out of the territories." 
 But to have an impact on government policy, these protests face a formidable political obstacle: the man proposing to lead such critics in a broad coalition to unseat the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, is also the minister in charge of developing and carrying out the military methods they are attacking. 
The official, Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, is both Israel's defense minister and the newly elected leader of its Labor Party, in theory the most powerful left-leaning counterweight, inside or outside the government, to Mr. Sharon's rightist Likud. As much as that of Shimon Peres, the foreign minister and Labor's former leader, the role of Mr. Ben-Eliezer explains the durability of Mr. Sharon's year-old government. 
His dual mission, and the clash of values it can create, clearly cause Mr. Ben-Eliezer occasional distress. 
"Do you really think that I am happy as a result of giving some orders for more closures, and more closures, and more closures?" Mr. Ben-Eliezer asked, referring to blockades on Palestinian areas in his characteristically swift, staccato delivery. "No, no, no, no, no." 
But he had no choice given the security threat, he maintained, sitting by a picture of Mr. Sharon during an interview in his Tel Aviv office. 
Mr. Ben-Eliezer made much the same argument for his participation in the government, though his left-wing critics -- and there are many in his own party -- accuse him of simply providing political cover for Mr. Sharon. "I am there," he said of his government role, "because there is no other alternative today than being together -- all Israelis together -- to guarantee our existence." 
For now, he is trying to preserve that unity while resuscitating his once-dominant party and somehow differentiating himself from Mr. Sharon -- another short, stout ex-general who has contempt for Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader. 
"He is a good organizer," Moshe Shahal, a former Labor minister, said of Mr. Ben-Eliezer. "But he doesn't have a special, or a specific, agenda of his own."
Not yet, anyway. Mr. Ben-Eliezer, 64, is now on his first trip to the United States since joining Mr. Sharon's government, for meetings in New York today and Tuesday and then in Washington with Bush administration officials and members of Congress. He said that he was not going to Washington as a politician. Instead, he said he was going as minister of defense, to make the argument for the Israeli government that Mr. Arafat was not stopping violence, and that Iran presented a growing threat.
Even in Washington, Mr. Ben-Eliezer may be overshadowed by Mr. Sharon. After the defense minister scheduled his trip, the prime minister was invited to meet President Bush on Thursday.
Mr. Ben-Eliezer, who is universally referred to here by his nickname, Fuad, immigrated alone from Iraq at the age of 13. While his spoken Arabic is not fluent -- not as good as his rapid-fire English -- he has often served as a bridge to Arab leaders. Last week, when President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt wanted to take the rare step of comparing positions with the Israelis, it was Mr. Ben-Eliezer he summoned, to a meeting in Sharm el-Sheik.
Similarly, when former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin wanted to know in 1994 if Mr. Arafat was serious about peace, he dispatched Mr. Ben-Eliezer to meet with the Palestinian leader in Tunis. The first Israeli minister to meet with Mr. Arafat, Mr. Ben-Eliezer returned with the assessment that the Palestinian leader was prepared for a historic about-face.
Now Mr. Ben-Eliezer declares that Mr. Arafat has "completed his historical role." On the subject of the Palestinian leader, he sounds like Mr. Sharon. "Those elements are definitely backing Arafat," he said of Palestinian militants. "They are calling to continue the strategy of terror, and terror, and terror."
Mr. Ben-Eliezer, a commando, served in the Israeli Army for 30 years and was wounded seven times; his left cheek and nose are torn by yellowed scars. He supports the Israeli tactics of killing militants and blockading Palestinian regions to safeguard Israelis. But in the interview, he said that the army would begin relying more on large-scale operations to sweep through Palestinian areas and arrest, rather than kill, wanted men. 
On security issues, Mr. Ben-Eliezer differentiates himself from the prime minister by saying that for Mr. Sharon, a cease-fire is an end itself. For himself, he said, "The main goal is to contain the terror, and by that, to open the gate to a peace negotiation." 
He made clear that he expectedthat negotiation to take place with someone besides Mr. Arafat. "I am sure that in coming days, some leader of the Palestinians will occur, who will definitely realize that we have wasted decades," he said.
Mr. Ben-Eliezer said that in such negotiations he was willing to be "very flexible" when it came to giving up Israeli settlements. But he predicted that no Israeli prime minister would ever offer as generous a deal as Ehud Barak, the former prime minister, proposed a year ago in inconclusive negotiations at Taba, Egypt. Palestinians believe that Taba should serve as the starting point for peace talks.
Although it contributes to the stability of the government in the near term, Mr. Ben-Eliezer's dual responsibility also guarantees his eventual departure, his advisers say. Indeed, it has become something of a parlor game here to guess when he might go. 
At some point, perhaps by the fall, his advisers say, he will need to leave the government, pulling Labor out of Mr. Sharon's coalition, to present a clear alternative in time for elections in 2003. The smart money here is betting that he will depart over a social or economic matter, rather than a difference over security. 
But the scenarios multiply: Another Labor leader could challenge Mr. Ben-Eliezer to become the party's candidate, or perhaps the party could split between doves and hawks.
Labor's departure would not necessarily bring down the government, but it would mean a lurch further to the right, politicians here say. For Mr. Ben-Eliezer, that fact alone justifies his staying with Mr. Sharon, for now anyway. "In such a coalition," he said, "I cannot get everything -- but he cannot get everything as well. And here is the balance."

HEADLINE: Sell That Dress: Back To Basics In Spring Advertising 

BYLINE:  By GINIA BELLAFANTE 

 BODY:
Last fall, the advertising campaign Tom Ford created for Gucci revolved around a blond model who seemed to need an anger-management seminar. In one image she was seated on wall-to-wall carpeting in an unfurnished room, her hand aggressively on her jutting hip. She wore nothing that had not begun its life in a cow pen: black leather boots, a black leather miniskirt, a black leather blazer buttoned just at the rib cage, to reveal a chest no one would mistake for Sophia Loren's. Central to Mr. Ford's ethos is that women should dress for men, though this woman seemed to have styled herself for the kind of man who could help her enter the arms-peddling business.
 In the February issues of fashion magazines, where many spring advertising campaigns make their debuts, the Gucci woman has re-emerged after some life-altering decisions. Gone is the quasi-thug posture. Now the model faces away from the camera toward a powder-blue oasis in the desert. Her loose curls are flowing, and she is wearing a virginal white dress laced up her tawny back. The image does not lend itself to any dark or elaborate narrative. So anodyne and unreconstructed is the fantasy, it might as well have come with the tagline, "Calgon take me away." 
 Such is the tenor of fashion advertising since Sept. 11, a change in direction evident in many of the campaigns that are just appearing. Developed in the days immediately following the terrorist attacks, they veer away from the ominousness on which fashion advertising has depended. 
"I don't think you wanted to take some weird road and explore blah-bity-blah," said Trey Laird, the advertising director for Donna Karan, whose ads have involved Jeremy Irons and a beautiful consort sweatily navigating their way through dramas out of "The Year of Living Dangerously." "We've been doing cinematic campaigns," Mr. Laird said, "but it didn't feel like the time to go off on some adventure." 
Instead, this spring's ads depict the model Amber Valletta, dressed in white, in the vicinity of a gauzily appointed veranda with her lover, played by Julian Sands, a man whose looks, unlike Mr. Irons's, are almost incapable of suggesting sexual threat.
In ads for DKNY, Ms. Karan's lower-price line, New York is paid tribute. One picture has a young woman wiping her eyes, the twin-towerless skyline behind her. "This was a season to clean everything and have a real simplicity," Mr. Laird said.
In one instance, a fashion house took the idea of cleansing quite literally. Since John Galliano became the creative head of Christian Dior, ads have relied on his brash mediating of camp allusion. Female models slathered in oil have writhed all over one another. Last fall, the models leapt through a phantasm, seemingly Ecstasy-induced, influenced by Japanese anime cartoons. In the new ads, a model is shown wearing a simple red dress, happily tugging at her ponytail in a sea of soap suds.
Theoretically, fashion and beauty advertising offer the viewer the promise of amorous attachment. In the 1990's, though, ads were devised to capitalize on a collective upper-middle-class disillusionment about love and romance. Men and women looked out at the world through shattered glass or stared right through one another. Rare was the image that didn't look like a still from an Antonioni film, or just the right visual to accompany most contemporary short fiction.
A poll by New York magazine, released this week, reports that 47 percent of single New Yorkers consider their dating life to have improved since Sept. 11, while 63 percent of single people in committed relationships say those relationships have gotten better. Designers apparently have been right in step with this phenomenon. 
While last season's ads for Kenneth Cole followed a trend of models who looked disaffectedly at unwanted children, the new images unabashedly celebrate that renegade idea, domestic contentment. A couple lie together, hands clutching, in bed. A man holds his hand to his wife's cheek. The lighting is softer than in past ads, said Lori Wagner, the company's senior vice president of marketing and advertising. "The world was not ready to see another typical fashion ad," Ms. Wagner said. "Kenneth was very specific about wanting to show a relationship, warmth, humanness -- moments most people would actually relate to."
Ads for Jil Sander show a man enveloping his girlfriend in a postcoital embrace. Abercrombie & Fitch's spring catalog dispenses with the nudity that has been the subject of so much ballyhoo in past years. The Bruce Weber-photographed catalog tells the story of a train ride from New York to Savannah. "When we went to shoot it, we wanted to talk about love and feeling for one another," explained Sam Shahid, whose advertising and design agency creates the catalogs.
There are nudes to be found elsewhere in the landscape, most prominently in the Versace campaign, although their presence is almost quaint, given the eerie sort of pictures the Italian house has offered in other years. Versace ads of the recent past shot by Steven Meisel have taken as their reference the gold digger who locks herself into a world of monied misery so stifling that only the acquisition of more $1,000 medusa-head belts can bring relief. The latest round of ads put forth, more innocently, a bunch of young people cavorting on a beach in various stages of undress. "The whole idea," said Lori Goldstein, who served as the stylist for the photographs, "was, Let's go off to St. Tropez and not think about anything anymore."
The easy decadence in the images is also quintessentially Versace. The viewer could mistake the campaign for no other. In one ad, a giant red shoulder bag placed in the forefront on the sand eclipses a bare bottom -- merchandise is being sold after all. 
In the midst of an economic downturn, some houses are realizing just how important conveying this message has become. New ads for Prada quite radically consist of single black and white studio portraits of models in clothes, none of the details obscured. "Miuccia really wanted to see the clothes," said Ms. Goldstein, who also styled ads for Miuccia Prada.
For other designers, telegraphing a clear message has meant returning to their roots. One of the new Calvin Klein ads has a loose-limbed model in jeans. The image bears more than a striking resemblance to the memorable Brooke Shields ads from early in Mr. Klein's career.
According to some, fashion advertising would have taken a twist regardless of events. "Our business is constantly shifting," Ms. Goldstein reflected. "We love one thing one minute and another the next. You get bored, and then you love what you're bored with."

He Knows About Second Acts
A musical based on the life of GOV. JESSE VENTURA, below, is progressing, with songs titled "Hooyah" and "The Heart Is a Muscle." The composer STEPHEN DOLGINOFF says that he is awaiting Mr. Ventura's approval of the revised Act II. "The first act has been approved and finished," Mr. Dolginoff said. "He read the original second act, and he came back with notes. Every time he has given notes, definitely, no question, it has improved the show."
 Last month, Mr. Ventura told The Associated Press that he wanted the musical to have more of an edge. "Instead of being milquetoast and G-rated, we're starting to go for R-rated," he said. "Let's make it who I really am." 
 But Mr. Dolginoff said the musical "is still going to be suitable for the family."
Once Mr. Ventura has signed off on Act II, the producer PIERRE COSSETTE plans to move forward with staging the show. "My assumption would be sometime next season," Mr. Dolginoff said.

Leading Man in Love
A camera crew from the American Movie Classics cable channel spent the weekend following KERR SMITH around New York for a documentary on romantic leading men.
Who is Mr. Smith? Ask the nearest 13-year-old, who probably knows him as Jack on the WB series "Dawson's Creek."
The documentary-makers' cameras were rolling on Saturday when Mr. Smith, 29, slipped behind the bar of Brother Jimmy's, on Third Avenue at 92nd Street, where he worked in his young-actor days.
"Man, I loved working here, but I hated it, too," he said. "It was hard being in that place of no money and no sleep, where you'd go to auditions all day and work all night."
But enough about his life in the 90's. He wanted to talk about love -- he just became engaged to HARMONI EVERETT, an actress -- and his obsession with Montgomery Clift, whom he resembles. "Clift was just so cool," he said. "I have this 1949 Time cover of him and all these Playbills from when he started out. I even hunted down his old place on 61st Street. I had a feeling it was 207 or 211, so I stood there until this little old lady came out and told me 207."

Giuliani and Associates
Is MAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI bound for the Philippines as a crime fighter? Reuters quoted a spokesman for the Philippine president, GLORIA MACAPAGAL ARROYO, as saying that she had mentioned naming him "adviser on peace and order" after an encounter at the World Economic Forum. Her opponents in the Philippines were unimpressed. "This is a cheap gimmick," SENATOR JOHN OSMENA said. "What can he offer us?"
Mr. Giuliani's spokeswoman said that he and the president had had a conversation at the forum. "There was nothing specific that came out of it," the spokeswoman said.
While the former City Hall officials who joined Mr. Giuliani's new consulting firm are out lining up customers, JOSEPH J. LHOTA has joined a company that already has millions. Except that Cablevision, the company that has hired him to be executive vice president for corporate administration, calls them subscribers. Mr. Lhota, who became deputy mayor for operations in 1998 after several years as budget director, will oversee Cablevision's business telecommunications services division, among other things.

Wailing Over T-Shirt Prices
CEDELLA MARLEY started designing clothes for her brother's band. Now she has a line of clothing in the window of Henri Bendel, on Fifth Avenue near 56th Street. The labels in her embroidered T-shirts and skirts with leather patches say "Catch a Fire," a phrase that has served her family well over the years: it was the title of her father's first album. He was BOB MARLEY, who popularized reggae in this country in the 1970's (and died, at 36, in 1981).
She said she had never been to Henri Bendel before, and seemed surprised by the prices. "I was looking at this one T-shirt for $135 and I'm like, wow. I have a T-shirt with Daddy on it saying 'revolution is the only solution' and it's going for $98, and I'm looking at a plain white T-shirt with a screen print which I know cost $4, and I'm like, wow, that's $135 for that."

HEADLINE: FORUM IN NEW YORK: THE STREETS; 
So Long New York, and Thanks for a Mostly Well-Ordered Bash

BYLINE:  By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
The World Economic Forum closed its five-day conference yesterday afternoon with panel discussions on things like "recommended priorities to reconcile environmental and development agendas" and the "psychosocial factors on health and healing." Then came one final cocktail reception, and that was it.
 Adios. Au revoir. Farewell, city that is like a big apple. 
 As for how well New York managed an event that brought together 3,000 world leaders and corporate executives, attracted 7,000 or so protesters, and created widespread apprehension about the potential for violent cultural clashes in the streets, consider:
Number of buildings vandalized -- one.
Number of protesters charged with crimes of violence -- zero.
In the end, the elite conference and the various street protests that it spawned went off so smoothly that -- aside from some traffic inconveniences, a few minor tussles, and the temporary transformation of Midtown into a police state -- the lives of most city residents were unaffected. Over five days, the event created tens of millions of dollars in revenue for the city, while just 201 people were arrested, all but one charged with disorderly conduct or some other standard, protest-related misdemeanor.
The lack of serious incident also seemed to provide a response to a question that accompanied the opening of the conference last week, namely: Would swarms of protesters contribute to the lingering sense of vulnerability in a city still recovering from the terrorist attack of Sept. 11? 
The answer, it seemed, was no. Not with more than 4,000 police officers on foot, on horseback, on bicycles, and in helicopters, anticipating and containing every move by the handful of protesters interested in wreaking havoc. And, according to demonstration organizers, not with the general good will most protesters carried with their placards and puppets.
"It certainly was a big test for New York City," Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday. He said that the city had passed that test, and that the weekend had been an economic and public-relations success -- particularly given that protests at past economic conferences in other cities had been marred by violence.
"In terms of sending a message, in terms of helping us in soliciting other events going into the future, all you've got to do is look at what happened when the World Economic Forum was elsewhere," he said, and "compare it to what happened in New York."
It may be unfair to compare last weekend's events with the conferences held in other cities. Fewer than 10,000 demonstrators came to New York; some 50,000 came to Seattle in 1999, and more than 100,000 came to Genoa last year. In addition, New York's police officials were able to develop pre-emptive strategies based on the illegal tactics used by some protesters in other cities.
The Police Department's level of preparedness was in evidence throughout the forum's five days. Beyond creating a heavily guarded frozen zone around the Waldorf-Astoria, where the conference was held, the police seemed psychic in their ability to pounce at the moment that an expression of free speech morphed into a criminal act.
They arrested 27 people at the tail end of a protest parade on Saturday, based on what they said was solid information that those particular demonstrators were about to attack the police and storm the Plaza Hotel. Early Sunday afternoon, they emerged from seemingly nowhere to put an end to a raucous, secretly planned rally in the East Village, arresting 87 people. And later that afternoon, the moment that someone smashed an apartment building's windows on the Upper East Side, the police wrestled a suspect to the ground and later arrested an additional 60 or so people for blocking sidewalks.
Ronald L. Kuby, a lawyer for protesters who helped negotiate the logistics for Saturday's rally, generally praised the Police Department for working with the demonstrators. "For the most part there were very few lines drawn in the sand," he said. "And the tone the police took was: we want this to work."
But Mr. Kuby said that credit should also go to the organizers of the protests who worked hard to keep things vocal -- but legal and safe. On Saturday, he said, some protesters became frustrated with delays in the march down Lexington Avenue and were agitating for a massive sit-down, but organizers "made a conscious decision not to do that."
All told, more than 70 events, often attended by heads of state, were held at locations around the city; among them were a dinner for 2,000 guests at the New York Stock Exchange in Lower Manhattan and a Sunday-morning prayer service at the ruins of the World Trade Center. In addition, there were 16 scheduled protests over the five days, including an all-day rally attended by 7,000 people.
And of the 201 people arrested, only one stood out. Sherman Austin, 18, was originally charged with disorderly conduct and unlawful assembly after being arrested during Saturday's rally. But Raymond W. Kelly, the police commissioner, said that the F.B.I. had been interested in a Web site of Mr. Austin's that gave bomb-making instructions and that a recent search of his mother's home in California had found bomb-making materials.
The police commissioner also said that Mr. Austin would soon be facing a federal charge of placing bomb-making information on the Internet and that the investigation was continuing.
"I believe that our hard work has paid off," Mr. Kelly said. "The arrests that were made were done in a professional manner; there were no serious injuries to protesters or to the police."
As for the cost of deploying so many police officers for so long, Mr. Kelly said that the overtime bill would run into several million dollars. But he echoed the position of Mr. Bloomberg in saying that it was "certainly money well spent."
Cristyne L. Nicholas, the president of the city's tourism board, NYC & Company, estimated that the conference, "at a bare minimum," had generated $100 million in revenue for the city. She said that she based this estimate in part on hearing of how the conference's guests were spending lavishly at the city's exclusive shops and restaurants.
"This is a crowd that pumped a lot of money into the entire economy," she said.
But not everyone was at the receiving end of that pump. Take the owners of businesses on the East Side that wound up being in the restricted zone that the police established around the Waldorf. Several of them said that they had lost out on tens of thousands of dollars.
"The customers see the barricades and they go somewhere else," explained Silvio Gamba, the sharply dressed owner of the Cinquanta Restaurant, at 50 East 50th St. "Look at my reservation book. Today we have 2 people; last Monday we had 40 people for lunch. Last Saturday we did 140 covers for dinner; this Saturday we were closed."
Not only did he have to throw out $2,000 worth of fresh fish, Mr. Gamba said, but one of his waiters "told me this morning that the police horses were urinating on the sidewalk in front of our restaurant."
Such is life in the city that is like a big apple.

HEADLINE: FORUM IN NEW YORK: THE PROTESTERS; 
Mostly Pleased, but Knowing Few Heard Their Message

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
They came, they marched, they chanted (and a few landed in jail). But as the last of the rallies and teach-ins petered out yesterday afternoon, the demonstrators who came to New York to rail against the World Economic Forum expressed exhilaration, vindication and yet frustration, saying that their cause had produced larger-than-expected crowds and had defied predictions of violence -- but that their voices had fallen on largely indifferent ears.
 Still, after the ugly confrontations in Seattle and Genoa, Italy, organizers said that events in New York represented a turning point for a movement that has been so strongly associated with televised images of riot police and tear gas. 
 "I think we showed that we are peaceful, and that even when the police try to intimidate us, we will still come out in large numbers," said Starhawk, 50, a San Francisco woman who led a pagan ceremony in Washington Square Park over the weekend that drew as many officers as participants. 
Exactly how many people took to the streets was unclear. The Police Department estimated that 7,000 people made their way from Central Park to the Waldorf-Astoria in Midtown on Saturday. Organizers said the crowd was closer to 25,000 and complained that the lower number was an attempt to discount their power and their message.
In many ways, the dueling attendance figures were emblematic of the tensions between marchers and the police. Protest organizers said their rights had been trampled by overzealous officers -- that groups of demonstrators had been held for more than 30 hours without food and water. Lawyers who had helped get the necessary permits complained that public assembly guarantees were not always honored. Police officials countered that unruly provocateurs had sparked a handful of confrontations that led to the arrests of 201 people.
While the marches and rallies drew plenty of attention from journalists, the organizers said the attention was the wrong kind. Most press accounts focused on security concerns and the potential for violence, they said, leaving little room for explanations of why people were protesting in the first place.
"The news is not the protesters or the police," said Antonia Juhasz, an organizer with the San Francisco-based International Forum on Globalization. "The news should have been what issues brought us to the streets. The coverage was just appalling."
But they acknowledged that for many reporters on deadline, the panoply and complexity of issues was too much for a simple sound bite.
The collection of causes and protesters was wide: groups as disparate as Save the Redwoods/Boycott the Gap Campaign, the Anti-Capitalist Convergence, Queers for Racial and Economic Justice, the Pagan Cluster and even the Earth and Animal Liberation Coalition attended. They seem united by a sense that many world problems can be traced to a profit-hungry corporate elite.
For many, the convergence of so many people -- many of them young, some of them stooped and wrinkled -- was inspiring. Hundreds of New Yorkers opened their homes to strangers and many people, moved by the impassioned words of advocates, took to the streets, some for the first time.
Until last Saturday, Goldie Weissman, 74, a retired teacher from New Jersey, had not been to a demonstration in more than three decades. Why did she come? "All I know is that the free-market system has not saved the world as promised," she said. "I'm not anti-capitalist, but we've got to find a better way to bring about less suffering."
Beth Orem, a nurse practitioner who lives on the Upper West Side, had a similar awakening. Until recently, she said, she had no idea what the term globalization meant.
"Seattle was definitely a wake-up call," said Ms. Orem, 48, the mother of two teenagers. "I didn't even know what the World Trade Organization was." But she quickly learned, plowing through books that convinced her that the growing reach of corporations was leading to "a grotesque and dangerous polarization and inequality around the world."
"I came to realize that there had been a sea change in the way the world is governed," she said, "and I knew that corporations have so much to do with it."
Last Thursday, Ms. Orem welcomed nine people from Minnesota, Chicago and Kansas City to her cramped apartment, and on Saturday all of them, including her children, joined the protests. It was an enlightening day, she said, but also depressing. "When I left the protests and I got beyond Park Avenue, life was going on as normal," she said. "In fact people seemed annoyed by what we were doing."
Then it got worse. On Sunday, her 16-year-old daughter, Jesse, was arrested with a group of other protesters in the East Village. "She wasn't shoplifting, she wasn't smoking pot, she was just marching peacefully," Ms. Orem said. As of last night, Jesse was still being held.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 6, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about demonstrators at the World Economic Forum in New York misspelled the surname of a woman who said the protests had awakened her to the issue of globalization. She was Beth Oram, not Orem.
An article last Tuesday about demonstrations at the World Economic Forum in New York misspelled the name of an arrested protester and misstated the place of the incident. She was Jessie Oram, not Jesse Orem; the arrest occurred on the Upper East Side, not in the East Village.

HEADLINE: ELECTRICITY CRISIS EASES IN NEW YORK 

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
New York City, which faced a looming electricity crisis last summer as more computers and air-conditioners bought in a booming economy bumped up against the limits of the local power supply, now has all the energy it needs through at least the middle of next year and perhaps beyond, electricity experts say.
 The sharp turn of events is partly a result of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack, which removed in one horrific day about 100 megawatts of power demand -- enough to supply nearly 100,000 homes -- as buildings in Lower Manhattan fell and companies and residents were dispersed. 
 The recession, which has stripped tens of thousands of jobs since then -- meaning fewer office cubicles to be lighted or heated and less money in the economy being spent on electronic toys and gadgetry -- has further reduced pressure on the system.
Consolidated Edison, which delivers electricity to the city and its northern suburbs, is projecting no growth in demand this summer -- the first flat-line forecast in more than a decade. 
But the supply side of the electricity equation has also fundamentally changed. The collapse of Enron, the giant energy trading company -- and the prospect of an energy glut in many parts of the country -- has frightened investors who were once eager to pour money into power plant projects. Of the 22,000 new megawatts proposed for New York State, almost two-thirds, according to some economists' estimates, are now considered unlikely to be brought online. From politics, where energy is off the table as a likely issue in New York's election for governor, to environmentalism, where hot topics like energy efficiency have cooled, the transformation has been sudden. 
"I think the crisis, as it were, if it hasn't already passed, is well on its way to being behind us," said Fred Zalcman, executive director of the Pace Law School Energy Project, an energy research and advocacy organization based in White Plains.
Mr. Zalcman and other experts caution that one year -- especially one of tumultuous change and upheaval like the last half of 2001 -- does not in itself a new trend make. The forecasting department at Con Ed expects growth in electricity use to resume in 2003, as downtown Manhattan rebuilds and the city's economy improves. Natural gas, which is used to make much of the region's electricity supply, is also subject -- as always -- to fluctuations in price because of global politics and war. The winter has also been unusually warm, reducing energy use and thus keeping prices perhaps artificially low.
But there is general agreement among industry officials, environmentalists and big energy users that the urgent momentum that was pushing the system last year -- lots of money from Wall Street for power plant construction, and lots of anxiety that growth in demand would outstrip supply, crimping New York's economy -- has been shattered.
One of the clearest examples of the new rhythm might be called, "The Tale of the 80 Megawatts." That is how much power the World Trade Center was allocated for use at peak times, like midsummer. After the attack on Sept. 11, the State of New York said that the now-surplus 80 megawatt pool, provided at low cost by the state-run New York Power Authority, would be redistributed to companies that were displaced by the disaster. 
Nearly five months later, not a watt has been allocated. A spokesman for the power authority said the complicated task of identifying and finding companies that are eligible for the electricity pool has slowed the effort. Energy industry officials say the bigger problem is that with electricity prices so low right now from Con Ed, there is little incentive for electricity users to switch.
"You've got 80 megawatts walking around -- that's how much things have changed," said David Neiburg, the president of Energy Spectrum Inc., a Brooklyn-based consulting firm that works with large energy users. "They're saying, 'We have extra capacity, here we go.' But after 9/11, the capacity issues just aren't as much of a concern. The scare is gone."
Nationwide, the demand for construction of plants also seems to be plummeting. About 50 percent of the power plants that have been proposed across the country in the last few years will probably not be built, according to Platts/RDI, an energy industry research division of the McGraw-Hill Companies. In the Midwest, the Southeast, New England and Texas -- areas with more capacity than they can use right now -- it will not matter as much as it could in New York, said Will Dailey, a senior consultant at Platts/RDI.
Other industry experts say the energy lull could have a major impact all by itself -- mostly from the things that will not happen now because the pressure is off. Few people, for example, expect that Gov. George E. Pataki will have to confront voters angry about high utility bills or brownouts in running for re-election.
The mosaic of new conservation programs created by the state last year to reduce electricity demand at peak periods -- financed by a yearly pool of $150 million from a surcharge on utility bills -- also becomes a harder sell when energy prices are low because the payback time to recoup an investment in a more efficient air-conditioner is much longer.
Vincent Croce, the director of property management at Max Capital Management Corporation, a commercial real estate firm in Manhattan, said his company was considering installing some on-site generators in two of its Midtown buildings last year, using conservation money from the state. 
"But when the power shortage went away, we looked at the dollars and cents," Mr. Croce added. "And we said: 'Know what? For that small of a return, it doesn't make sense. Why go through this? We're not a utility company.' "
A spokesman for the State Energy Research and Development Authority, which administers most of the conservation fund, conceded that the economics have temporarily changed, and that enrollments did drop off after Sept. 11. But he attributed most of the decline to the agency's advertising cycle, which peaks in the summer, rather than the impact of lower prices.
Other industry experts view the lull as offering potential benefits to the environment. 
The State Department of Environmental Conservation, for instance, issued regulations last year allowing thousands of owners of diesel generators -- considered one of the most polluting forms of energy production -- to turn on their machines in times of short supply. This year the agency is considering tightening the rules so that generator owners will also need to go through a permit process. Last month, state regulators said that potential pollution from an expanded Con Ed plant on the Lower East Side would require further hearings. 
Some newer ideas for supplying energy for New York are also emerging in this climate. Two large projects have been proposed for new transmission lines that would supply New York City and Long Island from power plants in New Jersey, and industry analysts say there might be more to come -- not because it suddenly makes more sense to import power, but because it can be more readily pitched to investors.
"It's more difficult now to get a plant project financed than it was six months ago," said Edward Krapels, the director of gas and power services at ESAI, a Wakefield, Mass., energy market research firm. "But there's less impact on transmission projects than building projects because if you go in with a transmission project, you're offering diversification, and some people think it's a better investment."
How to balance the energy industry's needs and wants with the desires and safety concerns of residents has been a running question since the state first began stepping away from its traditional oversight system in 1999. 
Some experts say the lull of 2002 confirms the view that the market has won: electricity in New York, they say, is now subject to the boom and bust cycles of Wall Street. Others say that government has proven its worth. The 400 megawatts that were added to the city's system last summer -- 10 house-sized generators built around the city by the New York Power Authority, sometimes in the face of lawsuits and claims of bias -- created a supply cushion for this summer at the same time that government-sponsored efficiency programs took the edge off the system's most severe surges in demand.
But what could be the biggest consequence of the lull by far is the expected falloff in power plant construction. Especially for New York, fewer plant proposals are far enough along to have lined up capital, mainly because of the length of time it takes for siting plants and meeting environmental approvals, Mr. Dailey of Platts/RDI noted. He estimated that about 60 percent of those proposed in the state are now likely to be dead in the water.
The chairwoman of the State Public Service Commission, Maureen O. Helmer, said that so far she had not seen many signals that power plant developers were pulling out. But she said that new trends like the move toward more interstate transmission lines would probably play a bigger role in the regional energy mix than had seemed likely a year ago.
Other experts say that the lull could be a defining moment for the city -- one that could be wasted. 
"If this breathing room in terms of electricity demand gives us an opportunity to makes some smart decisions for New York's future, that will be a benefit," said Anne Reynolds, the air and energy program director for Environmental Advocates, an Albany-based lobbying and conservation group.
Otherwise, she said, "we're going to end up making fast and dirty decisions two years from now."

HEADLINE: European Regulators Drop Investigation ofIntel 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
European regulators have dropped a yearlong investigation into accusations that Intel abused its position as the world's leading computer chip maker to keep rivals from winning market share, officials said today.
 One of two complaints filed by Intel rivals with the European Commission, which enforces antitrust law, has recently been withdrawn, a commission spokeswoman, Amelia Torres, said. 
 After investigating the other complaint, the commission has "come to the preliminary conclusion that the accusations made against Intel are unfounded," she said. "Our intention is to close the file soon."
In New York, a spokesman for the competition commissioner, Mario Monti, who was speaking at the World Economic Forum, said the investigation was considered dropped.
"We believe the complaints were not founded, and the decision has been made to drop the investigation," the spokesman said.
The investigation in Europe came after a similar inquiry by the United States Federal Trade Commission, which ended in September 2000 with no legal action taken.
Intel, which has more than 80 percent of the PC microprocessor market, has also successfully defended itself against civil lawsuits brought by rivals.
Europe has declined to identify the complainants, who accused Intel of abusing its dominant position in the market for chip sets and microprocessors to try to run smaller companies out of business.
Intel has denied that its marketing practices, including loyalty rebates offered to Intel customers and exclusive purchasing obligations, were unfair or illegal.
Shares of Intel fell 69 cents, to close at $33.98.

HEADLINE: The Wrong Lessons of the Somalia Debacle 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
"Black Hawk Down" is, regrettably, a pretty good movie.
 It puts you in the heart of the Mogadishu gun battle in 1993 between Somali paramilitary forces and American Army Rangers, and you leave the theater, heart pounding, wanting to pull out a machine gun and mow down crowds of Somalis. But the real problem is that the film powerfully reinforces the two main lessons that America absorbed from the Somalia debacle -- and both lessons are wrong and have already hurt the struggle against terrorism. 
 They are:
1. Nation-building is bloody, costly and futile. So if people in piddling third-world countries want to tear each other apart, let 'em. 
2. Casualties are completely unacceptable in American military operations. At the first sign of blood, politicians abandon missions and generals are retired.
These phobias were counterproductive and ultimately helped produce more terrorism and more casualties. They meant that in the 1990's we stayed away in droves from places like Afghanistan, Sudan and Somalia, allowing a chaos that breeds terrorism.
Even now President Bush continues to stiff Afghanistan's caped hero, Hamid Karzai, as he pleads for American troops to help secure all of Afghanistan. 
There is nothing Afghanistan needs more desperately. At the moment, every time you drive between cities in Afghanistan you look nervously out the windows for signs of bandits who shoot up cars (or even cut off travelers' noses and ears). But we refuse to contribute to the international security force because of our dread of another Somalia scenario. 
It is not even necessary to wrestle with the humanitarian argument for helping tottering countries. Afghanistan, Serbia and Somalia all demonstrate the realpolitik merit of solving messes as they happen: if we leave countries to rot, eventually the rot spreads and comes back to infect us. 
No one is in favor of American casualties; the question is simply how best to minimize them in the long run. And many diplomats and military officers alike agree -- although they are reluctant to say so out loud, because they remember the Vietnam-era slogans about old men dreaming up battles for young men to die in -- that the zero-casualty standard of recent years has been counterproductive. It creates more American casualties in the long run by showing weakness and by turning nations into petri dishes for terrorists. 
"Bin Laden learned lessons from Somalia, too," said Ken Menkhaus, a Somalia expert at Davidson College in North Carolina. "He learned that you go kill a few Americans and they go away."
To his credit, Mr. Bush has reversed his initial hostility to nation-building and ended up in favor of what one senior administration official impishly calls "nation-building lite" in Afghanistan. Mr. Bush has also tried to drum in the truth that in military action, body bags are inevitable as well as tragic. 
The United States need not dispatch troops in every direction. But we should lead an international order that confronts the problem of failed states. It's difficult but not hopeless. Even Somalia might, with better policy and luck, have made gradual progress -- rather like its once equally hapless neighbors Ethiopia and Eritrea.
"It was a mishandling of the situation by the U.S. and the U.N., rather than any innate hatred among the Somalis for us" that led to disaster, says Robert B. Oakley, a former ambassador to Somalia and Pakistan. Likewise, an American who watched the fighting involving American troops in Somalia from a rooftop in Mogadishu, where he then worked for the United Nations, said: "The mission was not fated to fail. It failed because of U.N. and U.S. blundering." 
Nation-building is a blunder-prone business, but it can succeed. In 1992 Mozambique was forlorn and war-ravaged, but with military and civilian help from the United Nations it has since become one of the faster-growing economies in the world.
Likewise, Uganda was one of the world's horror stories in the 1970's, and now (after a push by Tanzanian troops in 1979 to evict Idi Amin) it's among the stars of Africa. I have a special warmth for Uganda because I was on a small plane that crash-landed there five years ago; with its fire trucks and unflappable immigration officials, Uganda makes an outstanding country in which to crash. 
And now, with luck, Afghanistan will again prove that helping war-torn third-world countries is a smarter policy than running away from them.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Offers Turkey $16 Billion in Loan Aid 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund agreed yesterday to lend Turkey $16 billion over the next three years, greatly increasing financial aid to a nation seen as a front-line state in the battle against terrorism.
 The rescue package for Turkey comes only a few weeks after the I.M.F. cut off aid to Argentina, which shares Turkey's chronic economic difficulties but not its strategic importance. 
 Turkey has received a series of rescue packages from the I.M.F. since 1999. But the nation has fallen into its deepest recession since World War II and is struggling to make payments on its foreign debt. 
Bush administration officials, who supported the fresh loans for Turkey, have often argued that the fund should not repeatedly bail out troubled nations. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill pointed to that philosophy when the fund decided to deny money to Argentina in early December.
But officials of both the Bush administration and the fund said Turkey is different. Unlike Argentina, they said, Turkey has closely followed a prescription for overhauling its economy and generating surplus budget revenues to lower public debt.
"Today's decision is a recognition by the international community of Turkey's success in developing and implementing a bold and comprehensive economic reform program," Horst Kohler, the fund's managing director, said in a statement. "Progress is impressive."
The new loan package includes $12 billion in fresh aid and $4 billion carried over from an existing loan. Altogether, Turkey has received about $31 billion since 1999 to stabilize its economy. 
That makes it the largest borrower from the fund since the giant rescue efforts for Indonesia, Russia and South Korea in 1997 and 1998.
Bush administration officials said early last year, when they signed off on a smaller increase in the fund's lending to Turkey, that the nation's economic leaders should not seek more loans if they were unable to restore growth to the economy.
But the attacks in the United States on Sept. 11 contributed to a change in thinking, analysts said.
Turkey, a member of NATO, straddles the divide between the Middle East and Europe. Though it is an Islamic nation, it has a secular government that has staked its credibility on building a Western-style market economy.
Turkey also plans to send 261 soldiers to join the British-led peacekeeping force in Afghanistan. In the past, it also has been a staging ground for operations against Iraq, which President Bush warned could be a future target in the fight against terrorism.
"The world is round, and it's foolish to deny that there are a range of considerations involved in making these loans," said Edwin M. Truman, a former Treasury and Federal Reserve official who is now a scholar at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. 
Mr. Truman said Turkey has followed the script of its existing I.M.F. program -- in contrast to Argentina, which has repeatedly missed targets set as a condition of the fund's loans. But he added that Turkey's debt problem and its deep recession remain serious challenges.
"The fund management is making a bet that Turkey can recover," he said. "But there's no assurance it will end up any better than Argentina."
As a condition of new aid, the Turkish government, with the approval of its Parliament, has shored up its banks, which have been hit hard by the country's problems; ended the state's monopoly on tobacco sales; and worked to eliminate corruption in state contracts.
Kermal Dervis, Turkey's economic minister, said the latest loans, which extend through 2004, will suffice to restore growth.
"We will not need this kind of large-scale financing after 2002," he said at the World Economic Forum. "The big shock is over."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE POLICE; 
Shrewd Anticipation Helped Avert Trouble

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM and AL BAKER 

 BODY:
Like a fastball pitcher brushing back a batter, the Police Department staked out a claim to its home plate -- the streets of New York City -- before the World Economic Forum even began, with a carefully choreographed strategy that officials say helped keep the peace by keeping protesters off balance.
 Using a combination of intelligence, a large deployment of police officers and elaborate planning, the department seemed to be everywhere at all times -- and, much to the consternation of some protesters, seemed able to anticipate their moves. 
 The police claimed the streets first, putting in traffic restrictions and flooding the area around the Waldorf-Astoria with thousands of officers at 5 a.m. on Wednesday, more than 24 hours before the meeting began. They surrounded the demonstrators, bracketing marchers on the streets, at one point with city buses and at another with police motorcycles, and monitored the protests with television cameras mounted high above the Waldorf and on a police helicopter. 
The result: over the past five days, the violence and destruction that had marred similar meetings in other cities failed to materialize. And, despite some small disturbances and 201 arrests, largely for minor violations, most of the protest organizers were in large measure satisfied that they had had a chance to demonstrate.
For the city, and in particular for Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, the relatively peaceful outcome showed that the new administration could maintain order while allowing demonstrators to exercise their First Amendment rights.
The world was watching. And it was a coming-out party of sorts, not just for Mr. Kelly, who faced his first major challenge since taking over the department he headed nearly a decade earlier, but for a city still recovering from the devastating effects of the Sept. 11 attack.
"People had the ability to demonstrate, people had the ability to say what they thought, and they did it generally without impinging on others' rights," Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday. And when protesters became unruly, he said, "the Police Department acted appropriately, with restrained but forceful consideration for the citizens of this city."
In at least two of the three cases in which large numbers of arrests were made, the police, through plainclothes officers on the street, learned in advance that trouble might erupt, and were ready. They had a plan in place to make arrests swiftly, and did so.
And despite concerns that anarchists and other protest groups would use swift strikes to catch the police off guard, the department, time and again, appeared to be prepared. "It was our intention from the beginning to set the tone and have a robust force in place from the beginning to show that we were prepared for anything," Mr. Kelly said yesterday. "And I think that was very helpful in dissuading those people bent on causing a problem from doing that."
Of course to some extent, the tenor of the demonstrations was in the hands of the protest groups. In large measure, the potential for violence depended on a combination of their actions and the police response. In fact, some in the protesters' ranks said they could have done more property damage, but ultimately rejected that tactic because they did not feel it was appropriate after Sept. 11.
Other protesters said they had achieved their goals. "The ultimate point, obviously on our part, was to show that the global-justice movement is alive and well and hasn't been defeated by the events of 9/11, as some have suggested," said Eric Laursen, a member of Another World Is Possible, an umbrella organization that included several protest groups.
Nonetheless, Mr. Kelly said, the Police Department was prepared, having visited cities like Seattle, Genoa and Quebec to study how protests there degenerated into violence and vandalism, and how police failures to quickly quell minor violations resulted in bedlam.
"We had a lot of resources ready to respond quickly," Mr. Kelly said, explaining that protesters in other cities had tied up smaller departments with a flood of low-level arrests that took so many officers off the streets that too few were left behind to maintain order.
The tactics were not without critics. Leslie Brody, a lawyer with the National Lawyers Guild who helped get permits and advised those who were arrested, complained that people were arrested for carrying plastic cafeteria trays that looked like police riot shields, but, she said, were being used as painted placards. "These are kids who wanted to act out in a creative way, and I think early on they were tagged for dressing or looking differently," she said. "Arrest first and ask questions later."
Some civil liberties groups said that what they called an "excessive show of force" discouraged protests.
But Ronald L. Kuby, a lawyer for the demonstrators who helped negotiate logistics for Saturday's rally,, had qualified praise for the permit process and the way the city and the Police Department handled the protests.
"The entire tone this new administration took with the demonstrators was profoundly different than taken in other cities, and profoundly different than the approach that Giuliani had taken," he said. "In the Giuliani era, the permit process was manipulated to stifle groups that Giuliani objected to." 
As the forum drew to a close late yesterday, the police, who said their successes so far were won in part by taking the field early, were determined to be the last to leave. "We are going to be in place to respond to anything that might happen tonight or tomorrow," Mr. Kelly said. "Some of the participants will still be in the area and in the process of leaving. So, we are keeping our force in place."

HEADLINE: FORUM IN NEW YORK: DIARY; 
Final Item On Agenda: Slow Down

BYLINE:  By Jim Dwyer 

 BODY:
As the certified masters of the universe prepared to roll out of town at the conclusion of the World Economic Forum yesterday (exact motto: "Committed to Improving the State of the World"), many of them finally got down to business.
 They jammed a room for a last-minute talk on how to repair their frayed lifestyles. 
 "How many of you are Type A personalities?" asked Dr. Mehmet C. Oz, director of the Cardiovascular Institute at Columbia University's New York Presbyterian Hospital. 
About half the men and women put up their hands. As for the others, quite a few appeared too busy multitasking to lift a hand: while listening to the doctor, they were tapping at handheld computers, scribbling on legal pads and collecting voice mail from their cellphones, which were set to the silent vibrate mode, so as not to aggravate anyone but themselves.
"Some people are honest," Dr. Oz muttered at the partial show of hands. "I don't think most of you'd be in this room if you weren't Type A."
This, after all, was a crowd where no man went without a necktie, not only on getaway day, but also at the most abstruse Saturday morning seminars.
Dr. Oz, a heart surgeon who pursues alternative therapies for patients, put the case that investing money to manage stress would end up saving big expenses on the kinds of surgeries he himself performs. He had teamed up with Dr. Dean Ornish, a physician and author who reported that his patients had been able to reverse heart disease by following a regimen of a very low-fat meatless diet, moderate exercise and stress reduction.
They had booked a room for 40 people, but more than 90 showed, along with about three dozen who had paid $75 extra to come early for an Ornish-approved luncheon of two salads, a lasagna made with polenta and layered with roasted vegetables and soy cheese, a sandwich wrap containing various representatives of the plant kingdom, and a fat-free apple strudel. Those who commented on the meal said it was very tasty.
"A lot of you think that you have a choice between an interesting, productive, stressed-out life, in which you die early, or a life in which you go sit under a tree," Dr. Ornish said. 
He noted that the mortality rate in the room would eventually add up to 100 percent. "We're all going to die," he said. "I don't want to be the one to break the news to you." 
To connect with the audience, the doctors turned to an expert: the vice chairman of the Nasdaq, Al Berkeley. 
Now 58, Mr. Berkeley said that in 1998, he noticed that his stamina was sinking, and he could only run for a minute before he got tired. "I just thought I was getting older," he said. By then, his younger brother already had two stents to keep blood flowing to his heart. Their father and grandfather had died of heart attacks before the age of 60. 
Mr. Berkeley learned that he had had a 95 percent blockage in the left anterior descending artery. "That's the one they call the 'widow maker,' " Mr. Berkeley said. "I felt like I was on a slow decline to death."
He had realized, he said, that "You're not completely in charge of your own show."
After getting a stent in the obstructed artery, he collected his brother and some other family members and neighbors and headed to California for a week with Dr. Ornish and his staff. Now he has stopped eating meat, and a combination of diet and drugs has brought his cholesterol readings down to about 160 from 280. As important, Mr. Berkeley said, he and his friends now talk regularly about their health. 
"Just sharing these fears of dropping dead is incredibly important," Mr. Berkeley said. "I feel like I am totally in control of whether I'm going to drop dead of a heart attack. That's a good feeling."
At restaurants, he said, he simply asks chefs to make him a good meat-free meal with as little fat as possible. While he often ends up with a plate of broccoli, carrots and cauliflower, some chefs rise to the challenge and bring him delicious meals. "I've lost my mouth for fat," he said.
He tries to squeeze in at least one minute a day of meditation, as Dr. Ornish prescribes, and he has found that his own emotions are never far from the surface. 
"I've gotten a little gentler with myself," he said. "It has given me a better relationship with everyone in my life. Having a disease is a very humbling thing."
"And humility," Mr. Berkeley said, "is a very good thing. "
Practically everyone in the audience put down their mini-computers and cellphones to applaud.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE MEETING; 
Annan Cautions Business as Forum Ends

BYLINE:  By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

 BODY:
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan closed the World Economic Forum yesterday with a stern message from the devastation of Sept. 11, which had brought the gathering to New York and posed many of the issues that dominated the five-day meeting of business and political leaders from around the world.
 The world had entered the new millennium "through a gate of fire, such as none of us ever wished to see," Mr. Annan said. 
 "The forces of envy, despair and terror in today's world are stronger than many of us realized," he said. "But they are not invincible. Against them, we must bring a message of solidarity, of mutual respect, and, above all, of hope." 
In this context, he warned, "Business cannot afford to be seen as the problem."
Mr. Annan's comments seemed a fitting conclusion to an annual event that was often portrayed by outsiders as a gathering of the world's richest and most powerful men shaping a global agenda from which the weak and poor were excluded.
From within, by contrast, the impression was often of an elite struggling to comprehend the increasingly threatening forces of anti-globalization, militant Islam, terrorism and poverty, forces that gained an immediacy in the inferno of Sept. 11.
The forum was shifted from its usual venue in the Swiss ski resort of Davos to New York as a sign of solidarity after the terror attacks, and the attacks were repeatedly invoked in the many discussions, workshops and conversations, whether about global anger, security or the role of America.
Mr. Annan made no suggestion that the attacks were somehow justified by injustices, and he has been consistent in his denunciations of terrorism. Rather, he warned that business leaders cannot ignore the inhuman conditions in which much of the world lived -- or the image that the world had of them.
The problem, he said, was "one of reality multiplied by perception. 
"The reality is that power and wealth in this world are very, very unequally shared, and that far too many people are condemned to lives of extreme poverty and degradation," Mr. Annan said. "The perception, among many, is that this is the fault of globalization, and that globalization is driven by a global elite, composed of, at least represented by, the people who attend this gathering."
That perception, in fact, formed a major subtheme throughout the meeting at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. . Though a good portion of the discussions focused on economic and business trends, the best-attended sessions seemed to be those centered on social issues.
"They've done a good job of broadening the dialogue," said Irene Zubaida Khan, the secretary general of Amnesty International.
Organizers said there were more nongovernmental participants this year, but they added that the move to New York had enabled them to increase total participation by about 25 percent, and that the breakdown of who attended was not yet available.
Reviews of the New York setting were mixed. Some participants missed the intimacy of the Davos village, and the absence of corners in which to talk and swap gossip. Many complained about the elevators, which were always packed. There were also the distractions of the city.
Many participants paid a call on ground zero, many went to theaters and restaurants and many had to return to work in their New York offices yesterday, before the conference was over. The advantage, organizers and participants said, was that New York allowed for more voices in the mix, and the lobby of the Waldorf served as a crossroads in which many chance and planned encounters took place.
Security, though tight, proved easy to navigate, perhaps because the demonstrations that were held outside never developed into the violent protests of the sort that accompanied recent international economic gatherings elsewhere.
Mr. Annan, who has spoken to previous Davos gatherings, acknowledged that participants were not always what their critics made them out to be, though the list of the rich and powerful -- including celebrity magnates like George Soros and Bill Gates, sheiks and princes from Persian Gulf oil states, and corporate chiefs and senior politicians -- was long and inclusive. The core of the World Economic Forum comprises the world's 1,000 largest corporations, at least those identified as such by Klaus Schwab, the founder and organizer of the gatherings.
"Perhaps no one in this hall feels as rich, or as powerful and influential, as he or she is perceived by others to be," Mr. Annan suggested. "And yet I believe that all of you, whether you are business leaders, political leaders or opinion leaders, know well that you are enormously privileged, compared to the great majority of your fellow human beings, both in your standard of living and in the power and influence that you wield."
Mr. Annan, who comes from Ghana, reminded the audience that a larger, rival gathering was held in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in parallel with the World Economic Forum. "Its title, 'World Social Forum,' is intended as a criticism of yours, implying that you are interested 'only in economics, or in profit, and that you do not care about the social effects of your economic activities,' " Mr. Annan said.
He did not share that perception, he said, and he believed that globalization in fact held the best hope of overcoming poverty and other social ills. "But it is up to you to prove it wrong, with actions that translate into concrete results for the downtrodden, exploited and excluded," Mr. Annan said.
Mr. Annan made many of the same points in a parallel message to the Porto Alegre gathering, though there he challenged participants to "show that you are ready to work in partnerships for change, rather than remain aloof through the politics of confrontation." 
In New York, Mr. Annan challenged a contention that was frequently made in the carpeted meeting rooms of the Waldorf, that it was for governments, not businesses, to set social policy.
"In many cases, governments only find the courage and resources to do the right thing when business leaders take the lead," he said.
He cited various channels through which corporations could contribute, including a Global Health Initiative that was discussed at the meeting, the United Nations Development Program, and a variety of other United Nations funds, programs and agencies.
At the forum, most business leaders seemed to agree with the general sentiment expressed by Mr. Annan. "We need a discussion about whether the rich world is giving back what it should in the developing world," Mr. Gates, the Microsoft chairman, told a session on "Business Leader to Global Leaders." "I think there is a legitimate question whether we are."
The problem that increasingly surfaced was what exactly that meant. David H. Komansky, the chairman of Merrill Lynch, cited the example of China's Three Gorges Dam. Environmental groups were fiercely opposed, while the Chinese government said the project was urgently needed. What was business to do? 
"We're trained as businessmen, but we're being asked to pass judgment on the moral and ethical value of these projects," Mr. Komansky said. "We need to recognize there are two sides to this story."

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Hardware: Chip Sales Fell In December 

BYLINE:  By Chris Gaither (NYT) (Compiled by Gary Bradford) 

 BODY:
 Global chip sales in December declined 4 percent from November, bringing to an end the worst year in the industry's history, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. It said chip makers recorded sales of $10.18 billion, a slight decline from $10.6 billion in November and a 43 percent plunge from $17.89 billion in December 2000. 
Sales for 2001 were down 32 percent. Despite growth in the United States, Europe and Asia, fourth-quarter sales were flat versus the third quarter because the slumping Japanese economy dragged down sales by 12 percent there, the association said. George Scalise, the association's president, predicted that first-quarter sales would be flat or slightly up from the fourth quarter, instead of the flat-to-down sales common for that period.

HEADLINE: N.Y.U. Gets $150 Million Gift To Help Lure Top Professors 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Eighty-three years ago, New York University gave Julius Silver, a poor boy from Brooklyn, an annual scholarship of $77.50 and a $100 loan.
 Before he died last month at the age of 101, Mr. Silver, a New York lawyer, paid the university back -- with a bonus of more than $150 million. The donation, the largest cash gift N.Y.U. has ever received, will be used to endow roughly 150 faculty chairs over the next 25 years, and to pay for scholarships. 
 Mr. Silver, who worked with Edwin Land to create the Polaroid Corporation and guide it for more than 50 years, had said he wanted to help N.Y.U. woo an army of top professors, with an emphasis on science and technology, according to university officials. They said they were stunned by both the size of his gift and his willingness to leave the bulk of his estate to the university. 
"Holy mackerel; it took me by surprise," said L. Jay Oliva, N.Y.U.'s president, who devised the idea for the gift but until recently did not know just how generous it would be. "I had this dream about creating a chair machine, where you don't spend the principal but only spend the income to create faculty chairs. If you create six chairs a year for 50 years, that's 300 chairs -- almost the whole faculty of arts and science."
Mr. Silver, whose father ran a sweater shop, would often talk about how the N.Y.U. scholarship had opened opportunities for him. After graduating Phi Beta Kappa from N.Y.U. in 1922, he attended Columbia University Law School and helped start a New York law firm, Silver, Saperstein, Barnett & Solomon. 
Mr. Silver's links to Polaroid grew out of his days as a summer camp counselor, when he met a young camper named Edwin Land. Mr. Land called Mr. Silver "the most extraordinary person" he had ever met, Peter C. Wensberg wrote in his book, "Land's Polaroid."
Mr. Silver, known as Julie, became Mr. Land's mentor and helped round up early investors in Polaroid. He was Mr. Land's principal business adviser for more than 50 years, serving as Polaroid's executive committee chairman, a member of its board of directors and a vice president.
The long association with Polaroid not only contributed to Mr. Silver's economic success, but immersed him in science and technology and shaped his philanthropy, said David C. Oxman, Mr. Silver's lawyer at Davis Polk & Wardwell. 
Mr. Silver contributed to the founding of Brandeis University and gave gifts to Columbia Law School and other educational institutions. But his gifts to N.Y.U. began modestly, with donations of $100 a year for several years in the 1950's and $500 in 1959. The university started to cultivate him, leading to a $10,000 gift for scholarships in 1961 and $8 million for a student dormitory at what was then the Bronx campus. At N.Y.U.'s main campus at Washington Square, three faculty residence buildings are named after him.
Still, the gift of his estate was anything but a sure thing. In the mid-1990's, after Mr. Silver's wife died, Mr. Oxman asked N.Y.U. how it might spend a gift from him, without revealing how much. N.Y.U. suggested a couple of possibilities, each involving a few million dollars. 
Mr. Oxman called Naomi Levine, then a senior vice president at N.Y.U., and asked her to think more grandly -- perhaps around $100 million. That is when Dr. Oliva pulled out his dream for a "chair machine" -- an idea that captivated Mr. Silver.
The chairs will be named after Mr. Silver, and his late wife and daughter, Roslyn S. Silver and Enid Silver Winslow, as will N.Y.U.'s Main Building on the east side of Washington Square Park.
Although Mr. Oxman advised N.Y.U. several years ago that Mr. Silver planned to give more than $100 million, Mr. Silver did not want the gift announced until after his death. Last month, after he died, N.Y.U. discovered that the gift would be at least $150 million.

HEADLINE: Oklahomans Try to Save Their California Culture 

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

DATELINE: WEEDPATCH, Calif. 

 BODY:
The relentless geometry of the farm fields still vanishes into infinity. When Earl Shelton, a 68-year-old retired oil refinery mechanic, walks the grounds of the former Weedpatch camp to which he and thousands of other Okies migrated during the Depression, the scrapbook in his mind turns to the image of Slab 529. That spit of concrete with a tent on it was home, on and off, for 13 years.
 Mr. Shelton was 7 when he arrived at the camp, which was immortalized by John Steinbeck in his 1939 novel "Grapes of Wrath." Like many other Dust Bowlers, who have revived the once-derogatory word "Okie" as a term of endearment and source of pride, he can vividly summon the chapters of his own life: Of losing a wheel at night en route to Needles and burning a Sears catalog for light, of hot summer nights cooled only by bedsheets soaked with a hose and then draped over the tent. 
 In the 1930's, Mr. Shelton's father, Tom, a widower with four sons, joined tens of thousands of other dispossessed farmers -- real-life Tom Joads hailing from Arkansas, Texas and Missouri as well as Oklahoma -- leaving the log house three miles from Scipio, Okla., in a Model A. In these fertile fields they sought deliverance from drought and the Depression in the largest peacetime migration in the nation's history. "I don't recall going hungry," Mr. Shelton said. "But I know my dad did."
He and other members of the local Dust Bowl Historical Foundation are now trying to raise money to restore the remaining original buildings of Weedpatch camp, which opened in 1936 as a response to unsanitary living conditions among migrants.
But, in this year of the centennial of John Steinbeck's birth, the vestiges of Okie culture are vanishing, as the Dust Bowl generation ages and the texture of the community changes. Every morning, Doris Weddell, a retired librarian who is spearheading the preservation effort, picks up her scissors to clip the obituaries: Ann M. Heid (1929, Cici, Okla.), Alice R. Terry (1912, Anadarko, Okla.), Roy Earl Livsey (1913, Thayler, Tex.).
There are new migrants now, who have altered the face of small towns like Arvin and Lamont, Calif. In Lamont (population 13,295), not far from the corner where a young Buck Owens used to play hard-knocks country music on a cotton truck, Mexican panaderias, or bakeries, open at 5 a.m. while in Arvin (population 12,956), the old Safeway is now a supermercado.
In 1950, 33 percent of the population in the southern San Joaquin Valley were whites from the Southwest; today, just under 10 percent is, said James N. Gregory, an associate professor of history at the University of Washington and the author of "American Exodus: The Dust Bowl Migration and Okie Culture in California" (Oxford University Press, 1989).
"It's a generation passing," Professor Gregory said. "Because their experience was memorialized by artists and writers, they are an important and very special part of the American memory."
Every Thursday morning, several Dust Bowlers have breakfast together at a bowling alley in Bakersfield, 90 miles north of Los Angeles.
"We called ourselves rich Okies, because we had two mattresses," said Billy Ross, 66, a retired high school teacher. "It made me not want to look at a farm the rest of my life."
Discrimination was rampant. Although "Grapes of Wrath" is now required reading in California schools, in 1939 it was burned in downtown Bakersfield. The Arvin Federal Emergency School, an innovative school for Okie children known locally as the Weedpatch School, was created in 1940 largely because of public resistance to educating migrants' children.
"I remember coming home dirty from the fields and going to a store in Upland," Mr. Ross said.
"Mother went in to get some milk, and they didn't want to sell her anything," he said. "But it was clean dirt she had on. Clean, honest dirt."
The Weedpatch camp, now the Sunset Migrant Center, has continued to operate, housing migrant workers who are mostly from Mexico by way of Texas or the Coachella Valley. The Kern County Housing Authority, which runs it, is replacing 100 termite-infested, substandard modular cabins, hauled in by truck in the 1970's, with permanent stucco houses with foundations. The new houses are being paid for by $6 million in state and federal money.
Preservationists hope to raise $250,000 to restore the historic buildings and create a small historical park.
Half of seasonal agricultural workers in California have incomes below the poverty level, according to the Department of Labor. In the Lamont area, which is 89 percent Latino, and in Weedpatch (population 2,726) -- a dusty intersection down the Weedpatch Highway -- about 95 percent of students are eligible for a free or reduced-cost lunch, compared with 60 percent in the rest of Kern County, said Roy Malahowski, a lawyer with Greater Bakersfield Legal Assistance, a nonprofit organization.
In some stretches of Weedpatch, three or more families share a mobile home in the summer, and it is not uncommon to see three or four small backyard cabins filled with families, an electrical cord running from the main house to the shacks. 
At the former Weedpatch School, now the modern Sunset Middle School, 8 percent of the student body is Latino, a quarter of them migrants, said Miguel A. Gonzalez, the principal.
Seventh graders there read "Children of the Dust Bowl: The True Story of the School at Weedpatch Camp," written by Jerry Stanley, a retired history professor from California State University at Bakersfield.
"It makes you feel there were other people like you," Emilio Vela, 12, said.
An identification with poverty still marks the lives of even the most successful and highly visible Okies like Buck Owens, who left Texas with his family in a 1933 Ford sedan and spent his childhood as a "fruit tramp." His Crystal Palace dinner club on Buck Owens Boulevard is a false-fronted shrine not only to his music empire, which includes three country radio stations, but also to the "Bakersfield sound," a raw brand of country honed in No. 3 galvanized tin wash tubs and hot tents.
In Tulare, an 83-year-old poet, Wilma McDaniel, the fourth of eight children born to Oklahoma sharecroppers, writes poems in longhand each morning with felt-tipped markers. She stores them in a plastic dishpan. "It used to be a shoebox," she said. "I've moved up."
She has 14 books in print but never finished high school. She has been a maid, a governess and a farm worker in fruit cutting sheds and alfalfa fields. From her small apartment, she writes of hard times large and small, her words as straightforward as twine.
In "Pies," for instance, she recalls 1933, her unemployed father's job prospects dwindling, her mother's mulberry pie the only thing to bring "a crinkle of hope around his eyes."
"I feel that if I do not tell what I know about my past it will be lost," Ms. McDaniel explained the other day. "I wrote what I wrote and I lived what I lived."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
From monkeys to M&M's, Madison Ave. mostly opts to entertain the Super Bowl's TV fans.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliot 

 BODY:
MADISON AVENUE, take a bow.
 There was widespread anxiety before Super Bowl XXXVI that advertisers buying commercial time during the game would seek to capitalize on Sept. 11 by unleashing several mawkish, hyperpatriotic ads that would have reasonable viewers cringing by halftime. 
 Instead, most of the spots that appeared were entertaining or enjoyable, even in some instances moving. They generally struck the right tone, a difficult task given the uncertain national mood.
That is certainly not to say that all 29 advertisers, ranging from AOL Time Warner to Yahoo, deserve pats, New England or otherwise, on the back. Many of the nine commercials for coming movies were jarringly violent or jingoistic, particularly for the films "Blade 2," "Collateral Damage" and "Hart's War." Also, two spots for the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy by the New York office of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, part of the WPP Group, seemed to exploit the tragedy by asserting that buying illegal drugs helps support terrorism. 
What follows is an assessment of some of the 56 paid commercials shown nationally during the game, for which advertisers paid Fox Broadcasting, part of the News Corporation, an estimated average of $1.9 million for each 30 seconds.

AT&T WIRELESS -- All the questions generated by an elaborate "teaser" campaign for AT&T Wireless, including four commercials in the first two quarters of the game, were answered in the third quarter when a 60-second spot revealed that "mlife" is the mobile way to live.
Sure, it was cute to liken the snipping of the umbilical cord to leading "a wireless life," as the announcer intoned, but as Peggy Lee, God rest her soul, would have asked, is that all there is? This campaign will be salvaged or savaged by the subsequent installments. Agency: Ogilvy New York.

ANHEUSER-BUSCH -- Nine commercials, the most for any advertiser, were bought by Anheuser-Busch, which may want to ask for a partial refund.
Three Bud Light beer commercials bordered on smutty. Two, by the Chicago office of DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, centered on boudoir and barroom misadventures; a third, by Fusion Idea Lab in Chicago, featured a sexually predatory falcon.
A Budweiser spot, also by DDB Chicago, was much better, showing how a woman may spend hours picking the right greeting card while a man will grab one off the rack at the convenience-store checkout as he buys beer. Expect more such "True" spots for Bud showing guys behaving like guys.
Then there was a spot featuring the Budweiser Clydesdales traveling to Lower Manhattan to bow before the skyline and the Statue of Liberty. It was crass to depict brand characters in a Sept. 11 commercial; what next, a statue of Mr. Peanut, Aunt Jemima and the Jolly Green Giant as firefighters raise the flag at ground zero? Still, it was stirring in an understated, sentimental way. Just don't do it again. Agency: Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, Boston, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group division of the Interpublic Group of Companies.

E*TRADE FINANCIAL -- The chimp that appears in spots for E*Trade Financial returned for its third annual spoof of Super Bowl advertising. This year, the monkey was "fired" for the poor performance of an imaginary Super Sunday musical extravaganza to promote the company's changing its name from the E*Trade Group.
The commercial was busier than an online brokerage during a dot-com meltdown, but the plot about an employee dismissed by an impatient boss is certainly timely in this worrisome economy. That same concern surfaced in another commercial, for the Lipton Brisk tea sold by PepsiCo and Unilever, in which the brand's puppet characters "lost" their jobs. E*Trade agency: Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, San Francisco, part of Omnicom. Lipton Brisk agency: J. Walter Thompson, New York, part of WPP.

GENERAL MOTORS -- The Cadillac division of General Motors, abandoning a series of spots centered on the symbol "&," replaced that gimmick with "and," as in "Rock and Roll," as in that song by Led Zeppelin, the first time the band's music has been heard in commercials.
One ad, linking the Cadillac brand's heritage and its new models, was stirring. A second, showing a tiny car called a Kleinschnittger fitting into the back of an Escalade EXT, was a treat. Agency: D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, Troy, Mich., part of the Bcom3 Group.

MASTERFOODS USA -- This division of Mars offered a hilarious twist on the tradition of pillow chocolates at ritzy hotels when a talking red M&M shares a bed with an unnerved lodger. Agency: the New York office of BBDO Worldwide, a division of Omnicom.

MONSTER.COM -- The job-search Web site operated by TMP Worldwide departed from the relentless Super Sunday ballyhoo to present a spot featuring Rudolph W. Giuliani saying "Thank you, America," for "all the help" New York City received after Sept. 11. The plug for Monster.com was mercifully brief. Agency: Arnold Worldwide, Boston, part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners division of Havas Advertising.

PEPSI-COLA -- The Pepsi-Cola division of PepsiCo rarely uses nostalgia in its ads, ceding that tactic to its rival, Coca-Cola. But a 90-second commercial in which Britney Spears recreated six decades' worth of Pepsi pitches was delicious, effectively demonstrating why, in a jingle reprised in a separate 30-second spot, Pepsi is still "for those who think young." Agency: BBDO New York.

PHILIP MORRIS -- Two antismoking commercials from Philip Morris missed the mark by nagging adults to talk to children about cigarettes but offering no reasons to shun smoking, unlike two hard-hitting winners from the American Legacy Foundation about the harmful ingredients in cigarette smoke. Philip Morris agency: Young & Rubicam Advertising, New York, part of the Young & Rubicam division of WPP. Foundation agencies: Arnold Worldwide and Crispin, Porter & Bogusky, Miami.

SUBWAY -- This commercial was a dreadful waste because it hid Jared, the charmingly nerdy star of previous spots for Subway Restaurants, who was seen only fleetingly. Two spots for a Subway competitor, Quizno's, were far better, standing out with audacious parodies of fast-food marketing methods. But what do I know? The Subway spot came in second among all Super Bowl commercials in a survey of advertising effectiveness released yesterday by Merwyn Technology in Cincinnati. Subway agency: Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer Euro RSCG, New York, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide division of Havas. Quizno's agency: Cliff Freeman & Partners, New York.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
StockIndexes Tumble Again On New Fears About Audits

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Worries about accounting problems in other companies in the wake of the Enron scandal sent stock prices sharply lower again yesterday, with the three major indexes all down more than 2 percent.
 The stock market fell last week on such concerns. Then, over the weekend, investors were given a new look into Enron and its accountant, Arthur Andersen, when a committee of the Enron board issued a detailed report on Enron's collapse. 
 Among the report's findings was that Enron had manipulated its publicly reported earnings to conceal "very large losses." 
Many stocks that fell last week dropped again yesterday.
"It's pretty clear that the more you scratch, the more you find that Enron is not the only company with funky accounting," said Thomas McManus, the equity strategist at Banc of America Securities. "I think people are right to say there is more behind this and right to wonder if earnings are overstated by 10 percent."
The focus on what other companies may be hiding in complex financial statements could intensify as Congress holds hearings on Enron and its fallout this week.
Tony Crescenzi, chief bond market strategist at Miller Tabak & Company, said, "The hearings are one reason we have a higher level of anxiety right now."
Tyco International, a Bermuda-based conglomerate, lost almost one-sixth of its market value, with its shares closing down $5.73, or 16.1 percent, to $29.90. The company lost access to the commercial paper market and said that it was drawing down $5.9 billion in bank lines of credit, largely to repay its $4.5 billion in commercial paper. Two credit rating agencies downgraded ratings on Tyco's bonds.
The shares of Enterasys Networks plunged 61.1 percent, or $6.60, to $4.20, after the company, a maker of networking hardware and software, announced that it was delaying its fourth-quarter earnings report and that it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Among the stocks touched with the accounting concerns last week that fell again yesterday were PNC Financial Services, down $2.88, or 5 percent, to $54.79, and General Electric, off $1.85, or 5 percent, to $35. PNC Financial said last week that it was cutting its net income for last year by $155 million because the Federal Reserve was troubled with the way it had accounted for problem loans and venture capital holdings. G.E. is among the large companies whose financial statements now appear to many investors to be too complex to understand.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 220.17 points, or 2.2 percent, to 9,687.09, less than 70 points from its low for the year. The Nasdaq composite index fell 55.71 points, or 2.9 percent, to 1,855.53, its lowest close since November. The index, which is heavy in technology, is now down 4.9 percent for the year. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished down 27.76 points, or 2.5 percent, at 1,094.44. Like the Nasdaq, this index is now at its low for the year, down 4.7 percent. The Dow is off 3.3 percent for the year.
As it has recently, the bond market became a haven for investors when stocks fell. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note jumped 19/32 , to a price of 10024/32 , while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 4.90 percent from 4.98 percent on Friday.
The 30-year bond climbed 20/32 , to 10012/32 . Its yield dropped to 5.35 percent from 5.39 percent.
Another factor pulling stocks lower yesterday was concern about the outlook for the economy. In comments on Sunday at the World Economic Forum, Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman, said that he did not expect a big uptick in the economy or the technology sector this year. Shares of Microsoft fell $1.54, or 2.5 percent, to $61.12 yesterday.
"The market has priced in a rebound," said Mr. Crescenzi of Miller Tabak. "But right now the rebound has not exceeded expectations." If the recovery is more in line with Mr. Gates's forecast than that of many analysts, stocks could pull back.
Mr. Crescenzi says, however, that the worry about accounting and misleading earnings will pass if the problems do not spread too far. "The market will be looking at these companies case by case," he said, "and if they come up empty-handed, that will ease concerns."

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: HEALTH SPENDING; 
Buckets for Bioterrorism, But Less for Catalog of Ills

BYLINE:  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
While President Bush is proposing a major increase in spending to defend against bioterrorism, other public health programs, like preventing chronic diseases and birth defects and controlling infectious diseases, would be cut under the 2003 budget the White House unveiled today.
 Excluding money for bioterrorism, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the nation's public health agency, would receive roughly a $340 million cut under the president's budget, bringing its nonbioterrorism budget to about $4.1 billion, down from more than $4.4 billion last year. 
 "To be perfectly candid with you, we had to make some tough decisions," Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, said this afternoon at a briefing.
Over all, the president is requesting $489 billion for the Health and Human Services Department, a 6.3 percent increase over 2002. The vast agency, which oversees the nation's welfare and Medicare programs as well as the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and the disease control centers, accounts for nearly one-quarter of all federal spending, Mr. Thompson said. 
In his proposal, the president lives up to his commitment to complete a five-year initiative begun by the Clinton administration to double the budget of the National Institutes of Health. Mr. Bush has requested an increase of $3.7 billion, or 15.7 percent, for that agency, raising its overall budget to $27.4 billion.
Mark B. McClellan, a member of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, said the increase reflected Mr. Bush's belief that the institutes, which finance pioneering biomedical research, provide taxpayers with a high rate of return on their investment.
But the increase is not distributed evenly across the various institutes that make up the N.I.H. Nearly half of it, or $1.5 billion, is devoted to new research on bioterrorism, primarily at the National Institute on Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
That agency, which is trying to develop a new vaccine against anthrax, would receive the biggest raise, an increase of $1.4 billion over its $2.5 billion budget in 2002. The second-biggest increase would go to the National Cancer Institute, which would receive an additional $515 million, raising its total budget to $4.7 billion.
The budget calls for the disease control centers to spend $1.6 billion on bioterrorism preparedness next year. That is a decrease of $661 million from 2002, but the drop reflects the agency's purchase of $757 million worth of pharmaceuticals and vaccines, a one-time expenditure in the aftermath of the attacks on Sept. 11. 
The disease control centers' bioterrorism budget includes $100 million for a new laboratory at the agency's branch in Fort Collins, Colo., as well as $940 million to improve state and local preparedness, the same amount the agency will spend in 2002.
While public health officials view bioterrorism preparedness as important, they cautioned today that it should not come at the expense of other programs. They note that just five Americans have been killed by bioterrorism over the last year, while thousands die each year of chronic illnesses and infectious diseases.
"We will be very concerned if we are funding one thing at the expense of another," said Dr. Georges C. Benjamin, president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. "If you really want to push people towards better health, you have got to keep these programs in place."
At today's briefing, Mr. Thompson described himself as passionate about disease prevention, and he pledged that his agency would "aggressively take on preventing the onset of diseases such as diabetes," which can often be prevented through diet and exercise.
But the budget proposal calls for a $57 million cut in the disease control center's program for chronic disease prevention and health promotion. Infectious disease control, meanwhile, would be cut by $10 million, at a time when public health officials are particularly concerned about the threat of new and emerging infections.
Financing will remain flat for a number of programs, including those devoted to childhood immunization, environmental health, preventing birth defects, and sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS.
Marsha Martin, executive director of AIDS Action, argued that Mr. Bush was sending "a clear message that our nation's public health has fallen off the administration's radar screen."
Ms. Martin added, "Homeland security also means investing in prevention and care services for people at risk and living with H.I.V."
The administration had already announced much of its major new spending for health care in today's budget, including $190 billion over 10 years to "modernize" Medicare and create a prescription drug benefit for the program's elderly beneficiaries. 
Prospects for major action on Medicare are considered poor this year, given the deep divisions between Republicans and Democrats, budget constraints and the coming midterm election. Mr. Thompson said today, however, that he remained optimistic.
"I understand everyone has written the obituaries for Medicare reform this year," he said. "I haven't."
The administration repeated its proposal, first raised in the presidential campaign, to use tax credits to help the uninsured buy coverage -- $89 billion over 10 years. The White House also considers community health centers to be an important way of reaching the uninsured, and Mr. Thompson proposed a $114 million increase for such centers in the new budget, raising their financing to $1.5 billion.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: NEW YORK PERSPECTIVE; 
Bush Budget Renews Battle Over Pledge Of Aid to City

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
President Bush did not include any more of the $20 billion he had promised in federal aid for rebuilding New York in the budget plan he issued today, an omission that New York lawmakers were quick to point out. 
 Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the White House budget director, emphasized that the Bush administration was still committed to providing aid to the city and state in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack. 
 "Aid to New York will eventually total well over $20 billion," Mr. Daniels said during a budget briefing. "It's not going to be proposed that way in any one budget because this is going to be a multi-year project. It's going to take years to rebuild infrastructure, subway, perhaps sea wall and other very expensive things. We won't know for a long time exactly how much it is." 
To date, the administration and Congress have agreed to provide $11.1 billion for New York's recovery efforts. But New York lawmakers are pushing to get the rest of the money as soon as possible, concerned that the city's case for aid will become weaker as new demands for federal money arise from other states and memories of the attack begin to fade.
Mr. Daniels further aggravated the existing tensions between the White House and New York lawmakers, who have been fighting a protracted battle to obtain more aid, when he suggested later in the day that he planned to count roughly $5 billion from a federal fund for victims of the attack against the $20 billion pledge. 
At first, Mr. Daniels appeared to justify counting the Sept. 11 Victim Compensation Fund, saying: "Well, it's cash dollars going straight into the pockets -- almost all, if not all New York, but the vast majority are people in the New York area. And it would be preposterous not to count it. But you know, I'm just going to tell you: for us, this has never been -- it seems strange to me to treat this as a money-grubbing game. The idea is, what is the federal government going to do? What are we going to get done? And then when we total up the amount later on, I guarantee you it will be more than $20 billion."
Democratic lawmakers from New York seized on those comments as evidence that the Bush administration was seeking to renege on the president's commitment and, in the process, pit the need to rebuild Lower Manhattan with the need to help victims. "This money is not related to the cleanup, rebuilding or economic recovery in New York," Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, a Democrat of New York, said of the victims' compensation fund.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, also a Democrat from New York, said Mr. Daniels's comments came close to being a "breach" of the commitment the president made. 
"It was explicitly clear that the victims' money was not part of New York's $20 billion," he said.
As criticism swelled after lawmakers learned of Mr. Daniels' remarks, the White House budget office began backing away from including the billions of dollars in compensation against the emergency aid already pledged.
Amy Call, a spokeswoman for Mr. Daniels, said, "New York will get $20 billion without counting victims' comp." 
Senator Clinton and other lawmakers also complained that the New York emergency aid did not have a separate line in the president's budget plan. 
"The president's budget provides zero to fulfill the commitment," Senator Clinton said, noting that the president's plan came with illustrations of the recovery effort in Lower Manhattan. "I wished the pictures had been matched by resources."
But Mr. Daniels also told reporters today that the White House still backed a $5 billion economic stimulus package to help rebuild Lower Manhattan, including the creation of a Liberty Zone for business that has yet to be passed by the Senate. That money would be in addition to the $20 billion.
The president's budget proposal will of course undergo considerable changes in Congress, which has its own priorities as its members head into the mid-term election season this fall. Other parts of the president's budget plan would affect teaching hospitals in the New York region. Hospital officials said today that they would lose hundreds of millions of dollars in federal Medicare money under the president's proposal.
The budget today included the Medicare cuts even though they have been strenuously opposed by politicians and hospital administrators in the New York region and in other states with large concentrations of teaching hospitals.
Hospital administrators and their allies in Congress had argued that the cuts could be prevented if President Bush moved to eliminate a cost-cutting provision enacted in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to reduce the size of Medicare, the health care program for the elderly.
Now, the matter goes to Capitol Hill, where lawmakers in both parties are warning that it will be difficult for the federal government to meet the broad array of needs that are suddenly arising around the country in this era of budget deficits.
"It's going to be a huge fight," said Representative Anthony D. Weiner, a Democrat from Brooklyn.
Nationwide, teaching hospitals will lose roughly $708 million annually once the cuts go into effect, by October of this year, according to industry officials. In New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, the cuts will total roughly $170 million a year once they are in place.
The 1997 Balanced Budget Act called for reducing projected spending on Medicare by $115 billion by 2003. But hospital officials and their allies on Capitol Hill note that the cuts have already totaled more than $200 billion and should, therefore, be suspended.
"The Balanced Budget Act's impact has gone well beyond what its authors intended," said Kenneth E. Raske, the president of the Greater New York Hospital Association. "For the sake of the health care system, we should be suspending any further cuts."
The Medicare cuts apply to additional payments that teaching hospitals receive to help them cover the costs of training new doctors. It also compensate these hospitals for the specialized, high-cost care they provide, like cancer therapies, burn treatment and cardiac care.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: THE CONTEXT; 
As Troubles Multiply, the Equation Changes

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
Do the math, President Bush told Congress a year ago. The projected budget surplus, he said, was so large that the nation could afford the biggest tax cut in two decades and still have plenty left over to address its other needs and keep a buffer in reserve.
 Today, Mr. Bush sent Congress a new budget plan, one in which the surplus has shriveled and there is little extra money for anything other than national security and the administration's proposal for new and extended tax cuts. 
 Clearly, the terrorist attacks and the evolving response at home and abroad have changed the equation enough that the budget, as a dollars and cents expression of the nation's priorities, had to change with it.
Still, against the backdrop of an economy that has come thudding back to earth and in an atmosphere in which the collapse of the Enron Corporation has reopened questions about fairness and the gulf between haves and have-nots, some new calculations jump out.
For instance: Is gradually repealing the tax on estates of more than $1 million -- a step included in last year's tax bill and one that would be worth $54 billion to tens of thousands of families in 2011 -- enough of a priority to constrain the nation's ability to help tens of millions of retirees pay for their prescription medicines?
More immediately, Congress will have to decide whether to go along with the administration's request to cut, freeze or tightly limit spending increases for nearly every function of government aside from national security. From job training and environmental protection to highway building and public housing, social needs will be pitted against national security and fiscal prudence.
The potential for such painful trade-offs was apparent a year ago when Congress took up Mr. Bush's tax cut. But the conventional wisdom at the time was that the surplus would grow bigger, not smaller, and Congress chose to believe that it would not have to make any difficult choices.
With the pool of available money diminished, and with new wartime demands being placed upon it, this budget returns Washington to a partisan and ideological battle over how to distribute the nation's resources.
The debate, said Kim Wallace, a political analyst in Washington for Lehman Brothers, the investment firm, gets at basic philosophical differences over the best way to help the economy and address social ills.
"For the republic," Mr. Wallace said, "is it better policy to let 10 or 15 percent of society have the freedom to do more for themselves than it is to use that money to make sure 50 percent of society doesn't get worse off?"
Mr. Bush's commitment to tax cuts has not wavered since he began running for president. He has argued that tax cuts are necessary when the nation is flush with prosperity and when it is in the economic dumps, in peacetime and in wartime, to get rid of the budget surplus and to restore it.
Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said the tax cut was not constraining the administration's agenda in the least.
"Its opponents have blamed the tax cut for everything except mad cow disease," Mr. Daniels said today. 
Mr. Daniels said taxation, as measured as a share of total economic output, remained near its all-time highs even after last year's tax cut. The best way to regenerate the surplus and the flexibility it provides in addressing the nation's needs, he said, is to make the economy vibrant again. And the best way to make the economy strong again, he said, is to keep pushing taxes lower.
Democrats suspect that the administration and its Republican allies on Capitol Hill are not at all unhappy to have placed the government in a fiscal vise.
"Their goal last year was not simply to return money to the hands of the American people, but to starve the beast, to take all the money off the table," said Thomas S. Kahn, staff director for the Democrats on the House Budget Committee. "They did a good job of it. And not only are they not chastened, but they are emboldened to do more."
But only the more liberal of elected Democrats are making an argument that policy has become unduly skewed toward tax cuts that favor upper-income people. And only the most politically secure of those Democrats are calling openly for delaying or rolling back Mr. Bush's tax cut. 
Kevin Phillips, a political analyst and author of the forthcoming "Wealth and Democracy: A Political History of the American Rich," said the muted response of Democrats to the questions about the distribution of the tax cut was tied to the campaign finance system.
Inevitably, Mr. Phillips said, moderate Republicans as well as Democrats respond to their wealthy benefactors, effectively silencing or co-opting the voices of elected officials who would otherwise do more for people at the bottom of the income spectrum.
"Uniquely in the history of the republic, there's going to be a correlation between tax fairness and campaign finance," he said.
Alan J. Auerbach, director of the Robert D. Burch Center for Tax Policy and Public Finance at the University of California at Berkeley, said fiscal policy has historically swung back and forth in response to economic and political pressures. 
After President Ronald Reagan's signature tax cut in 1981, which conservatives still view as the high water mark of public policy, Congress quickly turned its attention to the burgeoning budget deficit. It subsequently raised taxes in each of the next four years, and overhauled the entire tax code in 1986.
Mr. Bush has already warned against a repeat, saying the tax cut will be rolled back over his dead body. Still, Mr. Auerbach said, it could happen, if not now then sometime.
"No one wants to talk about it or propose it," he said, "but what it means is that there's going to be a suspension of the tax cut eventually."

HEADLINE: Chances of a Shooting Similar to Diallo's Are Less, Mayor Says 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg offered a simple, concise answer when asked yesterday what had changed in the New York Police Department in the three years since Amadou Diallo was shot and killed in the Bronx by four police officers.
 "Ray Kelly and Mike Bloomberg," he said, referring to himself and Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly. 
 He made the comment at his news briefing, on the third anniversary of the death of Mr. Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant. 
Asked to elaborate, the new mayor said: "I think that Ray Kelly is providing the leadership and the training for the Police Department so the likelihood of an event like that is diminished." 
"And I will do the best I can to make sure if and when -- unfortunately, probably when -- events happen that we wish had not taken place," he continued, "that the outreach and the confidence in all communities that Ray and I are building will be sufficient to explain to people, comfort people, and convince people that we'll take steps to make sure whatever event takes place doesn't happen again."
Mr. Bloomberg's remarks -- which came hours before about 100 people gathered in the Bronx for a candlelight vigil marking the anniversary of Mr. Diallo's death -- were yet another indication of how he envisions changing relations between New Yorkers and the police from the top down, as well as a glimpse of how he views his role alongside the police commissioner's. His comments also appeared to tacitly criticize his predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who, along with the police, was the object of daily protests and acts of civil disobedience after the Diallo shooting. The Diallo case had exacerbated Mr. Giuliani's chilly relations with some members of minority groups. 
Since his election, Mr. Bloomberg has met with many black elected officials, clergy members and community advocates as he tries to establish connections throughout the city. While it is unclear whether Mr. Bloomberg will maintain a solid relationship with those he has met recently, he has received a warm reception, with many commenting on the contrast to the reception given to the Giuliani administration. After the Diallo shooting, the former mayor was accused of failing to keep in contact with many black officials. 
A spokeswoman for Mr. Giuliani did not return a call seeking comment. 
The Rev. Al Sharpton, who was instrumental in organizing the daily protests after the Diallo shooting, in which more than 1,000 people were arrested for committing acts of civil disobedience outside Police Headquarters, praised the remarks and Mr. Bloomberg's efforts to strike an inclusive tone. "Not only is it a different tone, it's a whole different sound system," Mr. Sharpton said, adding that he hoped Mr. Bloomberg's deeds would match his words when put to the test.
It was typical of Mr. Bloomberg to mention Mr. Kelly first in his comments. So far in his young mayoralty, Mr. Bloomberg has seemed more than content to hang back and allow Mr. Kelly to be the public face of the Police Department, another notable change from the prior administration. Further evidence of Mr. Bloomberg's preference occurred on Sunday when he went to the front lines where demonstrators protesting the World Economic Forum were facing off with the police, surveyed the scene, and conferred with Mr. Kelly. He left without holding his own impromptu news conference, telling reporters that Mr. Kelly would conduct a briefing later.
And when two students were shot and wounded last month at Martin Luther King Jr. High School on the West Side of Manhattan, in the first shooting incident in a city school in eight years, Mr. Bloomberg did not race to the scene. He left the policing to the Police Department.
But the mayor has taken to promoting the city's crime statistics. Over the weekend, he noted more than once that the number of killings committed during the first four weeks of his mayoralty had dropped 40 percent compared with the same four-week period last year, to 33 from 55. And on Saturday he went to the scene of a fire on East 86th Street, not far from his town house on East 79th Street.
The mayor spoke about the anniversary of the Diallo shooting at a news conference to announce the appointment of the new deputy police commissioner for legal matters: Stephen L. Hammerman, 64, a former prosecutor who was most recently vice chairman at Merrill Lynch.
Mr. Hammerman joins two other recent recruits to the top echelons of the Police Department with impressive and unusual resumes: Frank Libutti, a retired Marine Corps general who is now the department's deputy commissioner for counterterrorism, and David Cohen, a retired spymaster with the C.I.A. who is deputy commissioner of intelligence.
"We need somebody to make sure that the Police Department does its job within the law," Mr. Bloomberg said in announcing the appointment.

Bush Budget Priorities: The Military and Tax Cuts
President Bush sent Congress a $2.13 trillion budget proposal that would squeeze much of government to bolster national security and continue to cut taxes, even at the cost of higher budget deficits for a few years. A1

Even with a $48 billion increase in military spending requested by President Bush, senior military officials said, the Pentagon will still fall tens of billions of dollars short of having enough money to replace aging aircraft, ships and tanks. A20

President Bush invoked the threat of terrorism and a sense of patriotism to promote the biggest increase in the military budget in a generation. A19

Democrats assailed the plan as a return to deficit spending and a drain on the Social Security surplus. Scattered throughout the budget request are dozens of proposals to cut back domestic programs. A19

The cuts would affect an array of public health programs, including those that seek to control infectious diseases and prevent chronic diseases and birth defects. A20

HEADLINE: FORUM IN NEW YORK: AFTER HOURS; 
It Was Clinton at Waldorf Instead of Dessert

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM and DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
It was perhaps the quirkiest intimate session at the World Economic Forum: Dinner for 80 at Daniel Boulud's top-rated French restaurant, Daniel, with a dessert discussion of food, culture and national identity. But at 10:10 p.m. Sunday, just as diners savored the last scraps of braised veal cheeks, the word came down: "If you are going to the Clinton nightcap, it's completely full, and the buses are leaving for the Waldorf right now!"
 In a flash, half the room rushed for the exit as if a fire alarm had rung, skipping not one but two desserts. The planned panel discussion collapsed like a fallen souffle. But back in a crowded conference room at the Waldorf, some 300 world leaders in politics, industry and finance were held spellbound by a freewheeling, solo seminar conducted by someone whose idea of a great meal was the Mexican platter at the White House mess: former President Bill Clinton, the ultimate Davos Man, always ready to expound on globalization until the last top-dog dies. 
 So what if platters of chilled pineapple, tapioca and mint fruit soup with coconut sorbet, and banana-Manjari chocolate clafoutis with macadamian nougat went uneaten in Mr. Boulud's elegant dining room on East 65th Street? Fifteen blocks to the south, Mr. Clinton was just getting up a good head of steam as midnight approached.
Dapper in a double-breasted blue blazer and hand-held microphone, the man the official program described as "Founder, William Jefferson Clinton Foundation," held forth on North Korea, the Middle East, Enron and health care. At one point, he welcomed a guest star, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of Israel, who declared, "I wish we'd had just a few more months, then we'd have peace in the Middle East."
Inevitably, a questioner pressed Mr. Clinton for his thoughts about President Bush's "axis of evil," the nuclear-eager combination of Iran, Iraq and North Korea. "We have to take these countries each in turn," he warned. "They may all be trouble, but they are different." Support for sanctions against Iraq in the United Nations had eroded, he said.
Iran, he said, "has two governments now," progressive elements that the United States can work with and hard-liners whose every move must be watched.
"On North Korea, I have a totally different take," he said, recounting how close he believed he was to a deal with Pyongyang to end its missile program in December 2000. He nearly went to the Stalinist nation to seal it, he said, but he had to stay in Washington working on a last-minute Middle East peace initiative that, he noted ruefully, fell apart.
With North Korea, he said, "I figure I left the next administration with a big foreign policy win, " one that he hinted Mr. Bush had squandered with unnecessarily hard language early last year.
When asked later about what advice he gave his successors after Sept. 11, he talked about calling the White House to alert them to a vulnerability in the way American computer databases are searched, but he refused to get more specific. When a questioner quizzed him, he snapped: "Are you with the press? That's none of your business."
He was equally reticent about what he thought the next steps in seeking Middle East peace should be, saying, "I think the less the rest of us all say about this publicly the better."
But he could not resist suggesting that he had already left the clear recipe for the final deal. "Some day when there is peace in the Middle East, it'll look an awful lot like what they walked away from last December," he said, meaning the last month of his term.
"We actually know within a two or three percent variance, what the final deal has to be," he said, no doubt thinking about those maps of Jerusalem that he had spread out at Camp David with Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and Ehud Barak, who was then prime minister of Israel.
But by the evening's end, after Mr. Clinton declared, "I have cried for Argentina" and greeted old friends like Dr. Ruth Westheimer, the diminutive sex therapist, ("She was a sniper in the early days of Israel!" he declared), the former president summed up by saying, "I did the best I could and had a good time trying."
The foodies who lingered at Boulud said much the same thing, even if their effort to hold a serious discussion led by the likes of Theodore Zeldin, an Oxford scholar and a distinguished historian of France, failed in the face of the Clinton-inspired exodus. Instead, Professor Zeldin made do with a mild observation on food and fellowship, appropriate to the global conference.
"If you hate your neighbor, however good the food," he said, "you cannot enjoy your meal."

HEADLINE: FORUM IN NEW YORK: VIEW FROM ABROAD; 
A Yawn, a Grumble, and After All It's Just Not Europe, Is It?

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE DALEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
The very private Elton John concert in New York last Friday did not draw much notice, nor did the marchers in the streets. Nor did anyone seem surprised that New York proved, once and for all, that it was open for business despite the events of Sept. 11.
 In press coverage of the World Economic Forum in Europe and elsewhere, no one seems to have doubted that New York was indeed back on its feet. So the high-powered talkathon was relegated, much as it has always been, to the back pages and business news segments of the evening news. 
 Far from dwelling on the swirl of meetings and parties that descended on New York, many journalists did as they usually do, dutifully reporting subject and speakers, little more. The heavy police presence caught some eyes. There was some grumbling about whether America, given an opening, had greedily snatched a European event.
Some commentaries also raised the question of whether the forum, which had for decades convened in the Swiss resort of Davos, really belonged in a bustling Manhattan setting with its costly restaurants, hotel suites and long elevator waits.
In its weekend issue, the French daily Le Monde described overbooked seminars, long lines, packed elevators and a sense that instead of being able to meet quietly back at one's hotel for a private chat, people were easily getting lost.
It worried as well that the usual back-and-forth of ideas between world leaders had been more one-sided than usual.
"In moving the World Economic Forum to New York this year, the risk was great that the Davos meeting would become Americanized while America would not become Europeanized -- that the focus would become America's worries without opening America's eyes to the worries of others in the world," the newspaper said. "And that is, unfortunately, what has happened."
Swiss papers had not devoted much attention to the affair until Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg talked about having the meeting come back to Manhattan. (It is scheduled for Davos next year.) The Swiss daily Le Temps ran a front-page headline, "New York Snubs Switzerland," and an accompanying article said Swiss officials had been "flabbergasted" by the mayor's remarks.
"The opportunism of the American at the very least annoys and embarrasses Swiss officials," the article reported. Some in the Swiss entourage, the article continued, could not stop talking about the boorishness of Americans who "in the middle of ceremonies dedicated to victims of Sept. 11 cannot help talking about money."
Some journalists seemed to find New York's security precautions over the top. A Saturday story in the English daily The Guardian, was titled "12,000 Police Aim to Ensure This Is Just a Storm in a Coffee Cup," noting that "as New York waited on high alert for anticipated violence surrounding the 32nd World Economic Forum, almost every branch of Starbucks north of 40th Street boasted its own detail of four or five armed police."
Ultimately, the papers divided as to the effect of the protesters. Today the headline in the British daily The Times read "Protests Mar Forum's Close"' while one of its competitors, The Independent, ran a headline saying: "Anti-Forum Activists March and 'Twinkle' to Little Effect."
In Argentina, whose government representative came to the United States to plead its case for aid, money and high living did not escape comment. Clarin, the daily newspaper, used the headline "A World Apart" to describe a New York setting for the rich and powerful to dine in expensive restaurants and occupy $1,200 hotel rooms when Argentina has been driven into bankruptcy.
"These are not prices for people with heart conditions or members of the middle class with their savings frozen in the bank," the newspaper commented.
In several countries, the alternative -- and larger -- World Social Forum in Porto Allegre, Brazil, competed with the attention given to the Davos meeting.
This was true in Germany and Britain, though even more true in France, where the Brazil meeting almost always got the upper hand.
On Thursday, the conservative daily Le Figaro gave Porto Alegre a banner headline across the front page. Inside were another two long articles on who was there -- a contingent of ministers from the Socialist government of France and several presidential candidates -- and what was being said.
The Davos meeting, meanwhile, was consigned to a small corner at the bottom of an inside page. It mostly focused on the difficulties of getting around New York and the increased cost of moving the event to the United States.
In Moscow, the coverage was slanted to Russian interests, with many reports noting that Russia seemed more like a member of the club. Russian officials were quoted saying that discussions in New York were now "devoid of dramatism." 
In Japan, as well, coverage focused on national worries. An editorial today in the financial newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun bemoaned the fact that few forum participants discussed Japan as a potential contributor to the world economic recovery.
"The world has now given up all hope for Japan's economic upturn in the near future, as the country is perceived not to be doing what it clearly needs to do to pull the economy out of the morass," the paper said. "Japan seems to be slipping out of the policy-making consciousness of world political and business leaders."

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: Russia:Oil Strategy Emphasized 

BYLINE:  By Sabrina Tavernise (NYT) 

 BODY:
 Russia may scrap reductions in crude oil exports in the second quarter if American and European economies show signs of growth, Mikhail Kasyanov, the Russian prime minister, said after meeting with President Bush in Washington, according to Russia's Itar-Tass news agency. 
The comment followed a similar statement over the weekend, when Mr. Kasyanov, at the World Economic Forum in New York, said the country's energy strategy is to increase oil production. Russia is flexing its muscles as the world's No. 2 oil producer and its stance has created tension with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which has been pushing for cuts in output to help support prices.

HEADLINE: A CONVERSATION WITH: GLEN GABBARD; 
A Rare Day: The Movies Get Mental Illness Right

BYLINE:  By ERICA GOODE 

 BODY:
It was 1980 and the patient in Dr. Glen Gabbard's consulting room had a pressing request.
 She had just seen "Ordinary People," she told him, and in the movie, Judd Hirsch, who played the therapist, hugged Timothy Hutton, who played the suicidal patient. 
 "It really helped him a lot," the woman said, "so I was wondering if you could hug me."
Dr. Gabbard explained to the young woman that "Ordinary People" was a movie. 
"This is therapy," he said, "and we need to use words."
"Yes, I know it was a movie," the patient replied, "but the hug helped a lot."
Where does the public get many of its ideas about psychiatry and mental illness? From Hollywood, of course.
And Hollywood, said Dr. Gabbard, who has spent many years examining the rendering of his field in the movie theater, has mostly preferred distortion and stereotype over more true-to-life representations.
Yet inaccurate as such portraits are, they are also compelling.
"People don't make distinctions between what's reality and what's on the great silver screen," Dr. Gabbard said. 
At the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kan., where he trained as a psychoanalyst and later became medical director, patients often asked him to hypnotize them so they could recover repressed memories.
"I'd say, 'Why do you want that?' " Dr. Gabbard said. "And they'd say, 'I saw it in "The Three Faces of Eve." ' "
Dr. Gabbard came by his passion for movies naturally: his parents are professional actors. And after a while, psychoanalyzing psychiatry's relationship with the motion pictures became a hobby, eventually resulting in the 1987 book "Psychiatry and the Cinema," written with his brother, Dr. Krin Gabbard, a professor of comparative literature at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
As an added perk, Dr. Gabbard noted, his sideline gave him "an excuse to watch bad movies and call it part of my work."
"I can really get into bad movies," he added.
Yet very occasionally, he said, screenwriters and directors who tackle the subject of mental disorders and their treatments get it right.
In Dr. Gabbard's view, "The Sopranos" is the best depiction of psychotherapy "ever to appear on film or television." (His new book, "The Psychology of the Sopranos," is scheduled for publication by Basic Books this summer.)
And "A Beautiful Mind," Ron Howard's award-winning drama chronicling the genius and the battle with schizophrenia of the mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr., who won the Nobel Prize for economics in 1994, is as accurate a portrait of the illness as Hollywood has produced.
In a recent conversation, Dr. Gabbard placed "A Beautiful Mind" in context.

Q. How has schizophrenia typically been portrayed in the movies?

A. First of all, in most films, a distinction is not made between serious mental illness and schizophrenia. It's only in recent years that schizophrenia itself has been defined in any way approaching reality.
Out of over 400 films depicting psychiatric treatment, I can think of less than five that I would call accurate. One was "I Never Promised You a Rose Garden," based on Hannah Greenberg's book. And one other film that was fairly accurate was "Benny and Joon."
But inaccuracy goes back as far as 1909 to a D. W. Griffith film called "The Maniac Cook." In this film, a cook becomes distressed and starts attacking her employers and is led away by the police. She escapes and first plans to kill her employers in their bed with a kitchen knife, but instead kidnaps the baby and puts it in the oven to roast.

Q. Violence is often linked with schizophrenia on the screen, is it not?

A. Yes, this stereotype of the homicidal maniac has been one of the primary myths perpetrated by the cinema about the seriously mentally ill. A more modern version of this can be seen in films like the "Halloween" series, where the Michael Myers character is the Devil himself.
Another stereotype has been to portray schizophrenia inaccurately as split personality. In "Me, Myself and Irene," the recent Jim Carrey film, you saw that. But probably the classic film of this ilk would be "Psycho." In what appears to be a severely psychotic individual, we see Norman Bates taking on the personality of his mother and dressing like her and becoming a killer of women who arouse him sexually.
And then, of course, there is Brian De Palma's 1980 film, "Dressed to Kill," which has a similar theme.
Yet another stereotype grows out of the R. D. Laing and Thomas Szasz idea that mental illness either does not exist or is an enlightened expression of rebellion against a crazy society. An example of this would be "A Fine Madness," in which Sean Connery plays a poet with writer's block, and he is shown as a free spirit who is fighting alone against the psychiatric establishment.
The other classic film of this type is "King of Hearts," a French film, in which Alan Bates plays a Scottish soldier sent on a mission to disarm a bomb in a small French town. All the townspeople except the patients in the local mental hospital have been evacuated. And the patients take over the town and show themselves as a fun-loving group capable of creating a utopian society.
One other stereotype I might mention I've called the zoo specimen. You see this in films like "Snake Pit" and "Marat Sade," the 1966 film based on the play. In "Snake Pit," for example, Olivia de Havilland is hospitalized and comments on the similarity between the patients on the wards and animals in their cages in a zoo.

Q. What makes "A Beautiful Mind" noteworthy in its approach to mental illness?

A. Overall, it's one of the better portrayals, if not the best, of what the disease is like.
As the title implies, it shows that someone with schizophrenia can be capable of having a beautiful mind -- in the sense of making significant contributions in an academic field, having loving relationships, helping students.
One of the things I liked about the film was that they showed that in the long term, some people can actually return to functioning despite the illness, that they can learn to manage it in the same way a diabetic learns to manage diabetes. The other thing is that they portrayed the kind of chronic struggle that both the patient and the family goes through around complying with medication, and around trying to adjust to the psychotic thinking by ignoring it and recognizing it as not real. That was nicely depicted.
Also, it portrays medication as effective and useful. To put this in context, when we wrote "Psychiatry and the Cinema," we could only find one film that really showed the effectiveness of psychiatric medication, and that was "As Good as It Gets." But one reading of that film would be that it was the love of Helen Hunt rather than the medication that cured Jack Nicholson.
In "A Beautiful Mind," it's clear that when he does take medication he gets better, and when he's cheeking it and hiding it he doesn't.

Q. Are there ways in which the portrait of schizophrenia in "A Beautiful Mind" departs from realism?

A. The major departure would be the emphasis on visual hallucinations. The vast majority of hallucinations in schizophrenia are auditory, that is, hearing voices. On the other hand, the cinematic medium demands visual representations of the inner world. In a novel, you can have a first-person narrator describe in detail what's going on in his mind. But in the movies, there has to be some way of visually representing a delusional world.

Q. Doesn't the film romanticize mental illness, for instance in associating genius with schizophrenia?

A. Of course it romanticizes mental illness.
The job of a filmmaker is to fill the seats at the theater. So the entire arc of John Nash's life and marriage is all romanticized.
The idea that madness and genius are very closely related is also a recurring theme in Hollywood cinema. We can think of recent examples like "Pollock," and most films about musicians, like Mozart in "Amadeus," will show a connection between genius and madness.
But the research suggests that there is probably a much closer relationship between genius or extraordinary talent and manic depressive illness than schizophrenia. Schizophrenia causes such a global deterioration that works of genius would be very difficult to sustain.
Even when a person is successfully treated with medication and various kinds of therapy there is usually a continued deficit in functioning. And you can see that pretty well portrayed near the end of "A Beautiful Mind." We're not led to believe that Nash has been completely restored to his previous level of functioning.

Q. Do the images of mental illness in the movies arise from misconceptions that already exist in the culture, or vice versa?

A. Well, let's look at things historically. There were times when mental hospitals in the United States charged admission so the public could gawk at the mentally ill. So we have this tradition of looking at the mentally ill as strange, exotic and totally different than Me. And the movies, to some degree, appropriate a pre-existing stigma that was rampant in the society.
But there's another aspect we ought to bring up. The Hollywood cinema operates on cultural mythology. In fact, I would say that just as the ancient Athenians went to the theater and got their sense of what it means to be human from Sophocles, contemporary citizens in the United States learn what it means to be human from the movies. So that both the Greek dramas and modern American movies are mythopoetic in that sense.
One of the things we see in movies about psychiatry or mental illness is a mythic narrative that audiences want to see rather than a mirror held up to reality. And we really can't expect Hollywood to give us the stark reality that we see in psychiatric hospitals or psychiatric outpatient clinics.
For example, in the movie, John Nash looks like Russell Crowe, Mrs. Nash looks like Jennifer Connelly. He gives a stirring speech at the Nobel Prize ceremony that he never really gave. The homosexual relationships he had in real life and his divorce are also excluded from the movie.

Q. Do you think that people who see "A Beautiful Mind" will start to think differently about mental illness?

A. I think there is an educational benefit. It shows that someone with schizophrenia can be very intelligent, can retain a sense of humor and can persevere with this illness. And it does educate the public that this can strike anybody, and even people who are talented and gifted.
The fact that Russell Crowe is playing the character with schizophrenia is also very significant. Russell Crowe is becoming the John Wayne of our era. Here's a guy who just won the Oscar for playing in "Gladiator." If this masculine, sexy movie star can be connected in people's minds with serious mental illness, then there is a certain cachet. We live in a celebrity-mad culture. And the association of something with celebrity has tremendous influence.

HEADLINE: Cutting Taxes Faster Would Help Everyone 

BYLINE:  By Daniel Mitchell; Daniel Mitchell is a senior fellow in political economy at the Heritage Foundation.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The bulk of President Bush's tax cut won't take effect until at least 2004. It is scheduled to disappear in 2011. The president may have been pushed into this deal politically last year, but it was a mistake. Fortunately, in his State of the Union address last week, he asked Congress to correct this problem by speeding up the tax cut and making it permanent, even though opponents like Senator Edward Kennedy want to head in the opposite direction, proposing to postpone tax rate reductions scheduled to take effect in 2004 and 2006.
 Lower tax rates increase incentives to work, save and invest, and these rate reductions will provide a significant stimulus when they take effect. Consider the historical pattern. Cuts in tax rates during the 1960's and 1980's resulted in faster growth, rising incomes and more job creation. Critics in those decades complained that rate cuts would allow the rich to keep too much of their money, but upper-income taxpayers actually wound up paying a greater share of the tax burden during those decades, in part because lower rates reduced the incentive to hide, shelter and underreport income. 
 In the 1960's, President John F. Kennedy cut the top rate to 70 percent from 91 percent. Between 1961 and 1968, as the economy expanded by more than 42 percent and tax revenues rose by one-third, the rich saw their share of the tax burden climb to 15.1 percent from 11.6 percent.
In the 1980's, the top marginal rate was cut to 28 percent from 70 percent. Critics charge that this caused higher federal budget deficits, but they misread the evidence. Although the Reagan tax cut was approved in 1981, it was phased in slowly (much as the Bush tax cut is scheduled to be). Once the cuts were in place, the economy grew and tax revenues soared. Revenues from personal income taxes increased 28 percent (adjusted for inflation) by 1989. And yes, the rich wound up paying more. The share paid by the top 10 percent jumped to 57.2 percent from 48 percent of total income tax revenues. The share for the top 1 percent rose to 27.5 percent in 1988 from 17.6 percent in 1981.
Unfortunately, few members of Congress seem to understand how taxes affect the economy. They cling to the belief that tax cuts boost growth by putting money in the pockets of consumers. Because they think consumer spending is the way to jump-start a weak economy, they focus on temporary tax cuts like last year's tax rebate checks.
But government can't inject money into an economy unless it first takes the money out. So even if rebates succeed in slightly boosting consumer spending, the funds for the rebate came from a reduction in spending elsewhere in the economy (probably from private investment). This explains why last year's rebate was a flop -- and why Japan, for example, despite repeated stimulus packages intended to pump up spending, has been mired in a 10-year slump.
Last year's tax cut included the politically popular rebate checks, but those checks didn't have much impact on the economy. Only tax cuts that make saving and investment more attractive, like lower income tax rates and a repeal of the inheritance tax, will have a measurable impact.
Even the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has noted that the United States has relatively high top rates for income and estate taxes. It also suggests that tax revenues from high-income taxpayers might rise if their tax rates fell.
The Bush tax cut is reminiscent of Clint Eastwood's old spaghetti western "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly." Last year's tax bill included very good provisions to boost the economy. But the vast majority of the good provisions don't take effect until 2004, 2006 and 2010. That's the bad news.
President Bush has won tremendous public support for his leadership in the past five months. He is right to insist that his pro-growth tax provisions be made permanent. President Bush is right to say that any effort to undo his tax cut is "wacky," but having a tax cut that's only good between 2004 and 2010 isn't much better. The president wants to fix this mistake. He should also push to speed up the tax cuts immediately. Congress should rally to support these important improvements to last year's tax bill.

HEADLINE: On Cuba Visit, Mexico's Chief Meets Quietly With Dissidents 

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
President Vicente Fox of Mexico trod lightly on sensitive diplomatic territory today, ending his good-will mission to Cuba by meeting with several of its government's most prominent opponents.
 In a statement issued after the meeting, Mr. Fox pressed Cuba's government, the last Communist one in the region, to pursue democratic reforms and increase human rights protections. 
 Mr. Fox, whose election 18 months ago ended the 71-year rule of Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party, held several hours of private conversation with President Fidel Castro, who has been in power here for 43 years. Mr. Fox said he was particularly interested in seeing Cuba abolish the death penalty. 
"I expressed my hope that Cuba can move toward the standards on human rights and democracy that, day by day, help make things more secure not only in Latin America but in the rest of the world," Mr. Fox said. He said that he told dissident leaders that he was "always ready to hear all the voices of Cuban society."
Elizardo Sanchez, president of the Cuban Commission on Human Rights and National Reconciliation, said the meeting provided important awareness for the efforts of Cuban dissidents, whose organizations are not recognized by the government. Many dissident leaders have been jailed for their activities.
"The government tries to treat us as if we do not exist," said Mr. Sanchez, a former professor of Marxism at the University of Havana. "The visit with President Fox demonstrates that we are here and it gives us a voice." 
Mr. Fox said President Castro "accepted it as a right that we have and he accepted that I have a very strong commitment with human rights and with democracy." 
The Cuban foreign minister, Felipe Perez Roque, said after Mr. Fox had boarded his plane, 'We are satisfied with the visit." He said that the two countries had agreed on the need to increase trade and other forms of cooperation and on "respect for sovereignty."
Mr. Fox is the first Mexican head of state to meet in Havana with dissident leaders. The sensitivity of the 30-minute gathering at the Mexican Embassy seemed clear from Mr. Fox's behavior. He said he had told Mr. Castro ahead of time about his plan to meet with the dissidents. But he did not announce the meeting to the press and did not issue a statement about it until he had left Cuba.
Walking the incendiary line between Washington and Havana, Mr. Fox made important gestures toward both.
On Sunday, he walked with Mr. Castro, who limped heavily, through the crowded streets of Havana, proclaiming the strength of Mexico's century-old relationship with Cuba and holding out prospects for increased Mexican investment in the flagging Cuban economy.
The visit here was preceded by a storm of pressure on Mr. Fox from political forces in Mexico and abroad. Traditional leftist leaders in Mexico urged him to restore damaged relations with Cuba, and officials in Washington pressed him to meet with the dissidents.
Tensions between Cuba and Mexico, once one of Latin America's closest alliances, had risen over the last decade after Ernesto Zedillo, President Fox's predecessor, criticized the Cuban government, saying it was standing against the wave of democracy sweeping across the region. Those tensions continued in the early months of Mr. Fox's presidency, when Mexico abstained from voting on a critical resolution against Cuba in the United Nations Human Rights Commission but issued a statement of concern about lingering human rights violations here.
The Mexican foreign minister, Jorge G. Castaneda, assured his Cuban counterpart that Mexico would not sponsor a new human rights resolution against Cuba in the United Nations, where Mexico occupies a temporary seat on the Security Council. 
Mr. Perez Roque said that Cuba was especially pleased with what he called Mexico's "categorical affirmation" that it would not support a vote to condemn Cuba for its human rights record.
Mr. Fox also reiterated his objections to United States trade sanctions against Cuba, saying that they had stifled Mexican investments in Cuba.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: POLITICAL MEMO; 
Bush Budget Is Blueprint For Clashes in Congress

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
The budget documents President Bush sent Congress today are important politically because they display all the president's programs in one place and because they set an agenda for the coming battles between the White House and the Capitol.
 But they are not a very good description of what will actually happen this year and in the years ahead in terms of taxes and spending. 
 One reason, of course, is that while Congress will probably adopt the additional spending the president wants for the military and domestic security, it can be expected to reject many of the cuts he proposed in other areas. In an election year, it is highly unlikely, for example, that Congress will approve the spending cuts Mr. Bush envisions for highway construction and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Beyond the question of spending cuts in popular programs, Congress has repeatedly rejected the idea of using federal education funds to help children in failing public schools move to private schools, and there is no reason to believe Mr. Bush can change minds this year. The president's plan for further tax reductions as an economic stimulus will also probably be defeated, certainly in part if not in whole.
Mr. Bush could veto bills that permit more spending than he requested, but that might create problems in an election year. Not only would it force Republican lawmakers to cast difficult votes, but it would also keep Congress in session well into the fall. Twenty of the 34 Senate seats up for election this year are held by Republicans, and the incumbents are eager to adjourn early so they can have more time to campaign. 
Another reason the budget is probably unrealistic, especially in its long-term estimates, is that much of it is predicated on extended economic forecasts. Over the years, such forecasts have proved unreliable. 
The White House predicts a deficit for three years, a return to budget surpluses in the 2005 fiscal year and $1 trillion in total surpluses over the next 10 years. For that to happen, Congress will either have to cut popular spending programs or raise taxes, neither a very good bet, and the economy will have to begin growing again at a fairly robust rate of well over 3 percent a year.
Presidential budgets used to be more meaningful, said Charles L. Schultze, who was budget director under President Lyndon B. Johnson. They were the only complete source of data about federal taxes and spending and the only place where fiscal priorities were considered. In those days, Congress considered each tax and spending measure separately.
But since the 1970's, Congress has had its own budget process and its own budget office where data are compiled. Moreover, said Robert D. Reischauer, former director of the Congressional Budget Office, the president's budget is much more likely to represent what will probably come to pass when the White House and Congress are controlled by the same party. This year, not only do Democrats have a majority in the Senate, but the House and Senate are beginning the year controlled by different parties for the first time in 16 years.
Largely as a result of the divided Congress, the Congressional budget process may break down this year.
When the system is in gear, Congress approves a budget resolution early in the year that sets the framework for taxes and spending, and then all the legislation for the rest year is fit into that framework. 
This process has not worked smoothly for years, but it has contributed to some efficiency in the way Congress has handled budget bills. Its main benefit -- or drawback, depending on the point of view -- has been that under Congressional rules, it made one budget bill a year immune from filibuster in the Senate. Without such a system, President Bush's large tax cut last year probably could not have been enacted.
The prevailing view in the Capitol is that the Senate and House will be unable to agree on a budget resolution this year, something that happened only once, in 1998, in the last quarter-century.
Another factor that may lead to a free-for-all when Congress considers the budget is that for the first time in more than a decade, there will be no statutory caps on discretionary spending and no restrictions on tax cuts and entitlements.
Since 1990, the total amount Congress could allocate for discretionary programs -- those that get annual appropriations -- has been fixed by law, and every tax cut and increase in spending on entitlements like Social Security and Medicare had to be offset by other tax increases or spending cuts.
Those rules, which have expired, were instrumental in eliminating the budget deficit in the 1990's. They were more or less disregarded with little consequence when the budget went into surplus. But now it may be difficult for Congress to restrain the new deficit without the discipline of those rules.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: THE DEMOCRATS' RESPONSE; 
Leading Democrats Open Fire on Plan to Dip Into Social Security Surplus

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
Congressional Democrats sharply criticized President Bush's $2.13 trillion budget today as a plan that returns the nation to deficit spending and drains the Social Security surplus just when the government should be preparing for the retirement of the baby boom generation.
 Their comments, at the start of an election year battle over government priorities, suggested that Democrats were trying to position themselves in their familiar role as defenders of the popular government programs for the elderly. 
 Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, who heads the Budget Committee, said Mr. Bush would use more than $2 trillion of the Social Security and Medicare surpluses in the next decade to pay for other needs and make up for tax cuts. 
Mr. Conrad said that was a "serious error, given the fact that the baby boomers start to retire in just six years." He called the budget reminiscent of the deceptive financial practices of the Enron Corporation that led the company to file for bankruptcy protection.
"They said that the biggest problem with Enron was that they were hiding debt," Mr. Conrad said, "hiding it from its shareholders, hiding it from the creditors, hiding it from themselves. I think that's exactly what the federal government is doing. The federal government is now engaged in hiding its debt and understating its debt."
Republicans called the deficits, projected to last for most of Mr. Bush's current term, a result of the Sept. 11 attacks and said Mr. Bush had put forward a wartime plan for security. "This is not necessarily a budget for bookkeepers, it is a budget for security and victory," said Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee.
The Social Security issue is sensitive because it is a potent campaign issue and because each party has pledged over the past few years to use Social Security taxes only to pay benefits or pay down the debt.
The two Democratic leaders, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, also put the focus on Social Security today.
"We need a plan that will keep our commitments to Social Security and Medicare without making deep cuts in benefits, shortchanging our other national priorities or running deficits," said Mr. Daschle, the Senate majority leader. "Unfortunately the budget the administration submitted today is not that plan."
Mr. Domenici acknowledged that Republicans had pledged to protect the Social Security surpluses and that he had once spoken of the need for a "lock box" to protect that money. But he said "that pales now in comparison with the challenges brought about by Sept. 11." 
Other Republicans also put an emphasis on the war effort. "We are living in dangerous and unprecedented times," said Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader. Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois said the president had put forward a "responsible, common-sense budget that meets the needs of our nation in a time of war."
The debate amounted to an odd role reversal for the parties, with Republicans defending increased spending and Democrats calling for fiscal discipline.
A few conservative Republicans were pressing for a balanced budget, but House Republicans are expected to assemble a budget plan that closely resembles Mr. Bush's.
Democrats, who control the Senate by one vote, have little flexibility for drawing up a competing budget plan. Party leaders are reluctant to try to freeze or roll back part of Mr. Bush's $1.35 trillion tax cut, fearful of being called big taxers. Nor do they want to look as if they do not support the military.
"I can tell you what we're not going to do," Mr. Conrad said. "We're not going to raise taxes in the midst of an economic downturn. And we are going to supply the president with the resources necessary to fight this war."

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: MILITARY SPENDING; 
Rise in Budget Is Not Enough, General Plans To Testify

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO and THOM SHANKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
Even with the $48 billion increase in military spending that President Bush has requested, the Pentagon will still fall tens of billions of dollars short of what is needed to replace aging aircraft, ships and tanks, senior military officials said today. 
 If approved by Congress, Mr. Bush's request would be the largest military spending increase in 20 years, raising the Pentagon budget to $379 billion. But most of that growth, the officials said, would go toward what they called must-pay bills, including $14 billion for rising health-care costs and salaries, $6.7 billion for inflation costs on existing programs and $19 billion for the war on terrorism. 
 "We could not do all of the things we wanted to do in certain areas," the Pentagon comptroller, Dov S. Zakheim, said. 
The financing mismatch is widely expected to be a major theme of the testimony that Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will present to Congress this week. According to a statement delivered to Capitol Hill for review on Friday, General Myers contends that the armed services need to spend $100 billion to $110 billion a year "for several years" to replace fighter jets, ships and other weapons that should be retired.
"We cannot continue to defer procurement as we did over the last decade," General Myers plans to tell the Senate, according to a copy of his prepared testimony. "We must accelerate the replacement of aging systems if we are to sustain our capability to meet near-term challenges and all of our 21st-century commitments."
But some Democrats, military experts and Pentagon watchdog groups said the real problem was that Mr. Bush and Donald H. Rumsfeld, the secretary of defense, had not cut or killed older weapons programs to help pay for the new ones. Thus, the critics said, the Pentagon will have big-ticket programs on its books that it cannot afford for many years. 
"The budget is just too big," said Michael E. O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "It deprives the nation of a sound fiscal policy, enough money for other counterterrorism efforts such as increased diplomacy and foreign aid, and enough money for a serious domestic agenda. Bush has gone from compassionate conservative to Ronald Reagan reincarnate. Rumsfeld has gone from defense reformer to Caspar Weinberger."
Even President Bush's plan, which calls for spending more than $2 trillion on the military in the next five years, would not reach the levels cited by General Myers until near its end. Under Mr. Bush's proposal, procurement spending -- weapons purchases -- would grow to about $70 billion next year, from $61 billion, and steadily climb to $99 billion by 2007. 
It has become an annual tradition for senior military officers to tell Congress that the Pentagon is underfinanced. In recent years, Republicans have seized on those requests to accuse the Clinton administration of shortchanging the military. 
This year, though, only a few hawkish Democrats -- possibly including Representative Norm Dicks of Washington -- are likely to level similar criticisms against Mr. Bush. Still, while there appears to be bipartisan support for Mr. Bush's $48 billion increase, many Democrats are likely to resist allocating more than that, worrying instead about restoring money Mr. Bush wants to cut from domestic programs. 
Mr. Zakheim said today that the Pentagon was all but certain to request more money in this fiscal year to pay for the war on terrorism. The military has already received $17.5 billion in emergency financing for the war, of which it has spent about $10 billion, officials said.
General Myers, in his prepared text as delivered to Congress, says that the older fleet of aircraft is taking a toll in increased operational costs for fighter jets, particularly F-15C/D aircraft, which have an average age of 17 1/2 years.
The budget would also not buy enough new ships to provide a fleet of 310 ships, as was advocated in last fall's Quadrennial Defense Review, the Pentagon's budget and strategy guide, which is issued every four years, officials said. 
Under the plan Mr. Bush formally sent to Congress today, the Pentagon is to spend $1 billion on unpiloted aircraft, including $158 million to build 22 new Predator surveillance drones, which have been used extensively in Afghanistan. Many of the new Predators will be modified to fire Hellfire antitank missiles, Mr. Zakheim said. 
The budget proposal also seeks to raise spending on Special Operations Forces, the units that also played a major role in the Afghan war, to more than $3 billion. Procurement for Special Operations Command would include four AC-130U gunships and new radar-jamming equipment.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: THE OVERVIEW; 
PRESIDENT SUBMITS $2 TRILLION BUDGET THAT RAISES DEFICIT

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
President Bush sent Congress a $2.13 trillion budget proposal today that would squeeze much of government to bolster national security and continue cutting taxes, even at the cost of increased deficits for a few years.
 The plan immediately ignited a partisan battle on Capitol Hill. 
 Democrats said they would stand by the president in making available the money needed to fight terrorism. But they said the trade-offs sought by Mr. Bush would shortchange vital social needs in the short run and hobble government in the long run as it faces the huge costs of paying health and retirement benefits to a rapidly aging population. 
Mr. Bush cast his proposal, for the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1, as a wartime agenda necessary to battle terrorism abroad and keep Americans safe at home. He called on Congress to begin a years-long, expensive process of adding to the nation's military might, and sought an infusion of money for domestic security programs including bioterrorism preparedness, increased border security and more support for police, fire and rescue teams.
To help pay the cost, Mr. Bush proposes cuts or freezes in a vast array of domestic programs. Page A19. 
The budget seeks $38.3 billion in new spending for the Pentagon, an 11.7 percent increase that would be the biggest since the Reagan administration. It asks Congress to give the president authority to spend $10 billion beyond that if necessary to fight the war in Afghanistan or elsewhere. Separately, it calls for $18 billion in new funds for domestic security, nearly doubling the budget for defending the nation within its borders.
"The budget for 2003 is much more than a tabulation of numbers," Mr. Bush said in his budget message to Congress. "It is a plan to fight a war we did not seek -- but a war we are determined to win."
But the budget proposal, which is sure to be substantially changed by the time Congress finishes work on the annual spending and tax bills late this year, is also shaped by its emphasis on tax cuts. It calls for the permanent extension of the $1.35 trillion, 10-year tax reduction Mr. Bush signed into law last year. It proposes a host of other, smaller tax cuts, including a permanent extension of a business tax credit for research and development expenses. And it reiterates the administration's call for an immediate economic recovery package, setting aside $175 billion over three years for tax cuts including an acceleration of the individual income tax rate reductions adopted in the law enacted last year. 
Administration officials said tax cuts were the key to restoring the economy to good health now and encouraging prosperity in the long run. The immediate debate over how to help the economy will reach a milestone on Wednesday, when the Senate is to vote on a Democratic version of a stimulus package; the legislation offers far less in tax cuts than the administration would like.
In all, Mr. Bush calls for $591 billion, beyond the $1.35 trillion already enacted, to be reserved for tax cuts over the next decade. This figure includes $343 billion to extend last year's tax cut for two years beyond its current expiration in 2010.
But the emphasis on tax cuts and on increased spending for the military and domestic security would come at a cost to the government's fiscal condition. The administration said that if its tax and spending recommendations were enacted, the government would run a $106 billion deficit this year -- the first deficit since 1997 -- followed by an $80 billion deficit next year and a $14 billion deficit in 2004. By the administration's projections, the budget would return to surplus in 2005.
The figures also show the government breaking a bipartisan pledge not to use that part of revenue generated by Social Security for any purpose other than to shore up the retirement system or reduce the national debt. They show the government spending a portion of the Social Security surplus each year for at least the next decade.
To keep deficits under control, and to advance its longstanding goal of restraining the growth of government, the administration would allocate little additional money to programs other than those related to national security. 
Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said so-called discretionary spending -- the programs revisited by Congress each year -- would rise a total of just 2 percent in categories outside of the Pentagon and domestic security, about a third of the annual increase of recent years.
The budget calls for freezing or cutting spending in 6 of the 14 major cabinet departments, and for slowing or cutting spending on scores of programs.
The Labor Department's budget would be cut $856 million, or 7 percent, to $11.3 billion, with particularly big cuts in job training and international labor programs. The Environmental Protection Agency's budget would decline by $286 million, or 3.6 percent, to $7.62 billion. The Agriculture Department's budget would be frozen at $19.4 billion.
The Education Department's budget would rise by $1.8 billion, or 3.7 percent, to $50.3 billion. But to make room for increases in spending for special education and for aid to schools in poor neighborhoods, the administration would reduce spending on other programs, including vocational and adult education.
For the first time, an administration's budget proposal explicitly links financing decisions to a formal review of the effectiveness of various government programs. The White House said this effort in the current budget was just the beginning.
Despite having been rebuffed last year by Congress, the administration also stepped up its campaign to reduce pork-barrel spending, even singling out programs that it considered to be of questionable merit, like a $3 million renewable-energy project in Winona, Miss., and $2.25 million for "winter recreation opportunities" in Fairbanks, Alaska.
Members of both parties said it would be difficult, especially in an election year, for Congress to agree to the broad cuts or freezes Mr. Bush is seeking, particularly since the administration itself has proclaimed deficits to be acceptable for the next couple of years. 
Administration officials signaled that they would be flexible about how the budget was actually allocated by Congress, but suggested that Mr. Bush would veto any appropriations above the levels he seeks in broad categories of spending. 
"It may well come to that this year," said Mr. Daniels, the White House budget director. 
Democrats said Mr. Bush's budget was inadequate in addressing some of the biggest items on the national agenda, including the creation of a prescription drug benefit for retirees. The president's budget allocates $190 billion over the next decade to overhauling Medicare and creating a prescription drug plan, a figure that Democrats said fell a minimum of $100 billion short of what would be needed to establish a meaningful drug benefit alone.
Democrats said they were still discovering cuts in social programs throughout Mr. Bush's budget, and signaled that they would insist on more money for education, health care, environmental and other programs. But they were unable or unwilling to offer an alternative approach that would reconcile their insistence on fiscal responsibility with their demand for additional spending and their political fear of trying to roll back Mr. Bush's tax cut. 
Instead, they attacked the president today for the damage they said the budget would do in years and decades to come as the bill for Social Security and Medicare benefits begins to rise sharply.
Figures developed by the administration but not released publicly showed that the government would run "on budget" deficits -- that is, deficits not including the revenue generated by Social Security payroll taxes -- in every year through 2012.
As a result, nearly $1.5 trillion of a cumulative $2.5 trillion Social Security surplus over the next decade, money that both parties had counted on to reduce the $3.4 trillion national debt, would instead go to general government expenses. 
By the administration's calculations, the debt in 2012 will stand at $2.6 trillion. A year ago, the administration had projected that it would be pushed down to the lowest level practical, about $1 trillion, within this decade. Mr. Daniels said today that the administration remained committed to debt reduction but that fighting terrorism and nurturing an economic recovery must come first.
Democrats, however, said Mr. Bush's approach provided no money to shore up Social Security and would leave the country debt-ridden as it approached the demographic challenges of coming decades.
"If budgets demonstrate -- better than words -- what is important to us," said the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, "this budget does not make the commitment I would like to see to our seniors, and our future."

HEADLINE: The Axis-of-Inefficiency Budget 

 BODY:
President Bush's proposed $2.1 trillion budget embraces the word "security" at every turn. It provides more spending for military security and domestic security and more tax cuts for "economic security." But the budget undermines the security of the nation's social safety net and the government's ability to carry out some of its basic responsibilities over the next two decades. It jeopardizes the future of Social Security and Medicare, whose trust funds would be siphoned away to underwrite outmoded military projects and tax reductions favoring the rich. The budget embodies a divisive agenda for which Mr. Bush has no mandate, in spite of his popularity.
 For weeks the administration has cleverly leaked news about a handful of domestic programs like family nutrition, health research and food stamps that were targeted for spending increases. But the budget the administration presented yesterday revealed that everything outside these few programs was up for assault. According to Mitchell Daniels, the budget director, the administration is targeting only inefficient programs. The cuts, he insists, are not aimed at hobbling job training, environmental programs or labor safety -- although those are some of the areas that will suffer. The administration, he says, is simply trying to do away with bad management. Mr. Daniels has created a virtual axis of inefficiency, and declared war on it. 
 It is hard to accept Mr. Daniels's sincerity when the defense budget remains packed with cold-war-era projects that have no business in the kind of modern, high-tech military the Bush administration wants to create. The budget will lock in billions of dollars in future spending for outmoded technology like the 70-ton Crusader howitzer and the F-22 jet fighter. Apparently the only federal programs that can be inefficient are the ones the Republican Party's right wing doesn't like.
The most discouraging part of the new budget is the way it disguises the true cost of its tax cuts with accounting gimmicks and arbitrary expiration dates. Almost incredibly, Mr. Bush wants to accelerate and make permanent previously enacted tax cuts and add new tax cuts on top of them. He says that his actions would cost more than $600 billion over the next 10 years, but without the gimmicks they would cost more than $1 trillion.
The Bush budget is a road map toward a different kind of American society, in which the government no longer taxes the rich to aid the poor, and in fact does very little but protect the nation from foreign enemies. If the budget is adopted as proposed, over the next decade the increasing cost of the tax cuts will drain the treasury while the rapidly rising price tag of unnecessary military projects will make up a larger and larger piece of what is left.
Virtually everyone supports spending as much money as it takes to fight the war on terrorism at home and abroad. But national security does not require new corporate tax write-offs or contracting for a new fighter plane designed primarily for cold-war-era dogfights. Mr. Bush is using the anti-terrorism campaign to disguise an ideological agenda that has nothing to do with domestic defense or battling terrorism abroad. The budget discontinues the tradition of making 10-year projections into the future, possibly because the administration does not want the American people to see where the road is heading.
One of the many pieces of this budget that the public would never accept if consulted is the harm it does to the future of Medicare and Social Security. When asked yesterday to address charges that the administration was not leaving enough money to keep Medicare and Social Security solvent, Mr. Daniels said both were heading toward insolvency anyway. His policies seemed intent on starving the federal government of money to save them so that they can be "fixed" by privatizing them in ways that favor the well-to-do. 
The budget now goes to Congress, where it needs to be rethought and stripped of its gimmicks disguising the true cost of what it wants to do.
